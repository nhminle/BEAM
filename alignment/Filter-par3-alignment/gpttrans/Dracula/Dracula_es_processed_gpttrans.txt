<t0>I.– FROM THE JOURNAL OF JONATHAN HARKER</t0>
<t1>Bistritz, May 3.</t1> <t2>I left Munich at 8:35 PM on May 1st, arriving in Vienna early the next morning; I should have arrived at 6:46, but the train was an hour late.</t2> <t3>Budapest seems like a wonderful place, judging by the little I could see of it from the train and the short walk I took through its streets.</t3> <t4>I feared straying too far from the station, as we had arrived late and would depart as close to the scheduled time as possible.</t4> <t5>The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East.</t5> <t6>By the most western of the splendid bridges over the Danube, which here is of great width and depth, we reached places once under Turkish rule.</t6>
<t7>We left with quite good weather, and it was pitch dark when we arrived in Klausenburg, where I spent the night at the Royale hotel.</t7> <t8>At the meal, or rather, at dinner, I ate chicken prepared with red paprika, which was very tasty but made me very thirsty.</t8> <t9>(Remember to get the recipe for Mina).</t9> <t10>I asked the waiter and he told me it was called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was a national dish, it would be very easy for me to get it anywhere in the Carpathians.</t10> <t11>I found that my limited knowledge of German was very useful there; in fact, I don't know how I would have managed without it.</t11>
<t12>Since I had some free time when I was in London, I visited the British Museum and studied the books and maps in the library that referred to Transylvania; it had occurred to me that prior knowledge of the country would always be useful and important when dealing with a nobleman from the region.</t12> <t13>I discovered that the district he had mentioned was located in the easternmost part of the country, right on the border of three states: Transylvania, Moldavia, and Bukovina, in the center of the Carpathian Mountains; one of the wildest and least known parts of Europe.</t13> <t14>I could not find any map or work that shed light on the exact location of Dracula's castle, as there are no maps in this country that can compare in accuracy with ours; but I discovered that Bistritz, the post town mentioned by Count Dracula, was a fairly well-known place.</t14> <t15>I am going to include some of my notes here, as they may refresh my memory when I recount my travels to Mina.</t15>
<t16>In the population of Transylvania, there are four distinct nationalities: Saxons in the south, and mixed with them the Vlachs, who are descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the west, and Szeklers in the east and north.</t16> <t17>I am among the latter, who claim to be descendants of Attila and the Huns.</t17> <t18>This may be true, since when the Magyars conquered the country in the 11th century, they found the Huns, who had already settled there.</t18> <t19>I read that all the superstitions known in the world are gathered in the Carpathian horseshoe, as if it were the center of some kind of imaginative vortex; if so, my stay may be very interesting.</t19> <t20>(Remember to ask the Count about these superstitions).</t20>
<t21>I did not sleep well, although my bed was sufficiently comfortable, because I had all kinds of strange dreams.</t21> <t22>Throughout the night a dog howled under my window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have also been the paprika, since I had to drink all the water from my jug, and I was still thirsty.</t22>
<t23>In the early morning, I fell asleep, but I was awakened by some insistent knocks on my door, so I suppose that at that moment I was sleeping deeply.</t23> <t24>I ate more bell pepper for breakfast, a kind of porridge made from cornmeal that they say was "mamaliga", and eggplant stuffed with minced meat, an excellent dish they call "impletata" (remember to also get the recipe for this).</t24> <t25>I hurried to have breakfast, as the train was leaving a little after eight, or rather, it should have left, because after running to the station at seven-thirty, I had to wait sitting in the carriage for more than an hour before we started moving.</t25> <t26>It seems to me that the further east you go, the less punctual the trains are.</t26> <t27>What will they be like in China?</t27>
<t28>It seemed that throughout the day we wandered through a country that was full of all kinds of beauties.</t28> <t29>Sometimes we saw small villages or castles on the tops of steep hills, such as those seen in old missals; sometimes we ran alongside rivers and streams, which, by the wide and stony margins on either side of them, seemed to be subject to great floods.</t29> <t30>It takes a great amount of water, with a very strong current, to be able to clean the outer bank of a river.</t30> <t31>At all the stations there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all kinds of attire.</t31> <t32>Some of them were exactly like the peasants of my country, or those I had seen when crossing France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats and pants made by themselves; but others were very picturesque.</t32> <t33>The women were pretty, except when one got close to them, for they were quite thick around the waist.</t33> <t34>They all wore long white sleeves, and most of them had wide belts with a bunch of fringes of something hanging like in ballet dresses, but of course they wore petticoats underneath them.</t34> <t35>The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbaric than the rest, with their wide cowboy hats, large baggy and dirty pants, white linen shirts, and huge and heavy leather belts, almost a foot wide, completely studded with tin nails.</t35> <t36>They wore high boots, with their pants tucked inside them, and had long black hair and heavy black mustaches.</t36> <t37>They were very picturesque, but they did not seem friendly.</t37> <t38>In any setting, they would be immediately recognized as some old gang of bandits.</t38> <t39>However, I am told that they are quite harmless and, moreover, quite shy.</t39>
<t40>It was already getting dark when we arrived in Bistritz, which is a very interesting old town.</t40> <t41>Since it is practically on the border, as the Borgo Pass leads from there to Bucovina, it has had a rather turbulent existence, and you can certainly see the signs of it.</t41> <t42>Fifty years ago, there were major fires that caused terrible devastation on five different occasions.</t42> <t43>At the beginning of the 17th century, it endured a three-week siege and lost thirteen thousand people, with casualties from war compounded by those from hunger and disease.</t43>
<t44>Count Dracula had instructed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which, to my great satisfaction, was quite old-fashioned, for of course, I wanted to learn as much as possible about the customs of the country.</t44> <t45>They were evidently expecting me, for as I approached the door, I found myself facing a woman already advanced in years, with a cheerful face, dressed in peasant fashion: white underwear with a double apron, front and back, of colorful fabric, so tight to the body that it could not be described as modest.</t45> <t46>When I approached, she bowed and said:</t46>
<t47>–The English gentleman?</t47>
<t48>–Yes -I replied-: Jonathan Harker.</t48>
<t49>She smiled and gave some instructions to an elderly man in a white-sleeved shirt, who had followed her to the door.</t49> <t50>The man left, but immediately returned with a letter:</t50>
<t51>"My dear friend: welcome to the Carpathians.</t51> <t52>I am eagerly awaiting you.</t52> <t53>Sleep well tonight.</t53> <t54>Tomorrow at three, the coach for Bucovina will depart; you already have a reserved seat.</t54> <t55>At the Borgo Pass, my carriage will be waiting for you and will bring you to my house.</t55> <t56>I hope your journey from London has been smooth, and that you enjoy your stay in my beautiful country.</t56>
<t57>Your friend,</t57>
<t58>DRACULA"</t58>
<t59>May 4th.</t59> <t60>I found out that my innkeeper had received a letter from the count, instructing him to secure the best seat in the coach for me; but when inquiring about the details, he became somewhat reticent and pretended not to understand my German.</t60> <t61>This could not be true, because until that moment he had understood me perfectly; at least he answered my questions exactly as if he understood them.</t61> <t62>He and his wife, the elderly woman who had received me, looked at each other with fear.</t62> <t63>He murmured that the money had been sent to him in a letter, and that was all he knew.</t63> <t64>When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula and if he could tell me anything about his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves, and saying that they knew nothing at all, they simply refused to say anything more.</t64>
<t65>It was already so close to the time of departure that I didn't have time to ask anyone else, but everything seemed very mysterious to me and in no way reassuring.</t65>
<t66>A few moments before I left, the old woman came up to my room and said, with a nervous voice:</t66>
<t67>–Do you have to go? Oh!</t67> <t68>Young sir, do you have to go?</t68>
<t69>He was in such a state of excitement that he seemed to have lost the little German he knew, and mixed it all with another language from which I did not understand a single word.</t69> <t70>I barely understood anything by asking him numerous questions.</t70> <t71>When I told him that I had to leave immediately, and that I was engaged in important business, he asked again:</t71>
<t72>–Do you know what day it is today?</t72>
<t73>I replied that it was the fourth of May.</t73> <t74>She shook her head and spoke again:</t74>
<t75>–Oh, yes!</t75> <t76>I already know that.</t76> <t77>I already know that, but do you know what day it is today?</t77>
<t78>When I responded that I didn't understand her, she continued:</t78>
<t79>–It is the eve of St. George's Day.</t79> <t80>Don't you know that tonight, when the clock strikes midnight, all the demonic things in the world will have full power?</t80> <t81>Do you know where you are going and what you are going for?</t81>
<t82>She was in such a state of desperation that I tried to calm her, but to no avail.</t82><t83>Finally, she fell to her knees and begged me not to go; to at least wait one or two days before leaving.</t83><t84>All of this was quite ridiculous, but I did not feel at ease.</t84><t85>However, I had a business to attend to and could not allow anything to interfere.</t85><t86>Therefore, I tried to lift her up, and told her, as seriously as I could, that I appreciated it, but that my duty was imperative and I had to leave.</t86><t87>Then she stood up and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck, she offered it to me.</t87><t88>I did not know what to do, for as a faithful member of the Anglican Church, I have been accustomed to seeing such things as symbols of idolatry, and yet, it seemed discourteous to refuse it from an old woman with such good intentions and in such a mental state.</t88><t89>I suppose she could read the doubt on my face, for she placed the rosary around my neck, and said: "For the love of your mother," and then left the room.</t89><t90>I am writing this part of my diary while I wait for the coach, which of course, is delayed; and the crucifix still hangs around my neck.</t90><t91>I do not know if it is the old woman's fear or the many ghostly traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, but the truth is that I do not feel as calm as usual.</t91><t92>If this book ever reaches Mina's hands before I do, let it carry my farewell. Here comes my coach!</t92>
<t93>May 5th.</t93> <t94>The castle.</t94> <t95>The darkness of the morning has passed and the sun is very high above the distant horizon, which seems pursued, I don't know if by trees or by hills, for it is so far away that large and small things blend together.</t95> <t96>I am not sleepy and, as I will not be called until I wake up on my own, I naturally write until sleep comes.</t96> <t97>There are many strange things I would like to note, and so that no one reading them can imagine that I dined too well before leaving Bistritz, I will also note exactly my dinner.</t97> <t98>I had what they call "robbed steak," with slices of bacon, onion, and beef, all seasoned with red pepper skewered on sticks and roasted.</t98> <t99>In the simple style of London's "cat meat!"</t99> <t100>The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a rare tingling on the tongue, which, however, is not unpleasant.</t100> <t101>I only drank a couple of glasses of this wine, and nothing more.</t101>
<t102>When I arrived at the car, the driver had not yet taken his seat, and I saw him talking with the owner of the inn.</t102> <t103>They were evidently talking about me, as they occasionally turned to look at me, and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door (whom they call by a name that means "Word Bearers") approached and listened, and then looked at me, most of them pitying me.</t103> <t104>I could hear many words that were often repeated: strange words, as there were many nationalities in the group; so I quietly took out my polyglot dictionary from my pocket, and looked them up.</t104> <t105>I must admit they brought me no joy, as among them were "Ordog" (Satan), "pokol" (hell), "stregoica" (witch), "vrolok" and "vlkoslak" (which mean the same thing, one in Slovak and the other in Serbian, referring to something that is a werewolf or a vampire).</t105> <t106>(Note: I must ask the count about these superstitions.)</t106> <t107>When we departed, the crowd around the inn's door, which by then had grown to a considerable number, all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers at me.</t107> <t108>With some difficulty, I managed to get a fellow passenger to tell me what all this meant; at first, he did not want to answer me, but when he learned that I was English, he explained that it was the charm or spell against the evil eye.</t108> <t109>This did not please me much either as I was heading to an unknown place with an unknown man; but everyone seemed so kind, so compassionate, and so sympathetic that I couldn't help but feel moved.</t109>
<t110>I will never forget the last glimpse I took of the inn's courtyard and its multitude of picturesque characters, all crossing themselves, as they stood around the wide porch, with its backdrop of rich foliage of oleanders and orange trees in green tubs grouped in the center of the courtyard.</t110> <t111>Then our driver, whose wide linen trousers covered the entire front seat (they call it "gotza"), cracked his large whip over the four small horses running two by two, and we began our journey...</t111>
<t112>Soon I lost sight and memory of the ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene we were passing through, although if I had known the language, or rather, the languages spoken by my travel companions, it is very possible that I would not have been able to get rid of them so easily.</t112> <t113>Before us stretched the green sloping field full of forests with steep hills here and there, crowned with clusters of clovers or with peasant houses, with their empty walls facing the road.</t113>
<t114>Everywhere there was a maddening amount of flowering fruits: apples, plums, pears, and strawberries.</t114> <t115>And as we advanced, I could see how the green grass under the trees was covered with fallen petals.</t115> <t116>The road wound in and out of these green hills of what is called "Middle Earth" here, freeing itself as it swept around the curves, or closed in by the strangling arms of the pine forests, which here and there ran down the hills like tongues of fire.</t116> <t117>The road was rough, but despite that, it felt like we were flying with an exciting haste.</t117> <t118>At that time, I couldn't understand the reason for that haste, but evidently the driver didn't want to waste time before reaching the Borgo Pass.</t118> <t119>I was told that the road was excellent in summer, but that it hadn't yet been repaired after the winter snows.</t119> <t120>In this regard, it was different from most of the roads in the Carpathians, as it is an ancient tradition that they should not be kept in such good condition.</t120> <t121>Since ancient times, the hospodars could not repair them, for then the Turks would think they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and thus stoke the war that was always truly on the verge of breaking out.</t121>
<t122>Beyond the green and swollen hills of Middle-earth rose imposing hills of forests that reached the lofty peaks of the Carpathians.</t122>
<t123>They rose to the left and right of us, with the afternoon sun fully shining upon them and making the glorious colors of this beautiful mountain range gleam, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where the grass and stones mixed, and an infinite perspective of jagged rocks and pointed crags, until they themselves were lost in the distance, where the snow-capped summits rose grandly.</t123> <t124>Here and there, imposing crevices seemed to be discovered in the mountains, through which, when the sun began to descend, we occasionally saw the white flash of falling water.</t124> <t125>One of my companions touched my hand as we slid around the base of a hill and pointed to the high peak of a snow-covered mountain, which seemed, as we advanced on our winding road, to be right in front of us.</t125>
<t126>–"Look! Ilsten szek! 'The throne of God!'" he told me, and crossed himself again.</t126>
<t127>As we continued on our endless journey and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to surround us.</t127><t128>This fact was highlighted because the peaks of the snow-capped mountains still received the sun's rays and seemed to glow with a delicate and cold pink color.</t128><t129>Here and there we passed by Czechs and Slovaks, all in their picturesque attire, but I noticed that goiter was painfully prevalent.</t129><t130>Along the road, there were many crosses, and as we passed, all my companions crossed themselves before them.</t130><t131>Here and there, there was a peasant woman kneeling before an altar, not even turning to see us as we approached, but rather, in the rapture of devotion, she seemed to have neither eyes nor ears for the outside world.</t131><t132>Many things were completely new to me; for example, haystacks in the trees, and here and there, very beautiful groups of weeping willows, with their white branches shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves.</t132><t133>Time and again we passed a wagon (the ordinary cart of the peasants) with its long, sinuous spine, designed to adjust to the unevenness of the road.</t133><t134>In each of them sat a group of peasants returning to their homes, the Czechs with their white sheepskins and the Slovaks with their colored ones.</t134><t135>The latter carried their long staves like spears, with an axe at the end.</t135><t136>As night began to fall, it became very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to blend the gloom of the trees—oaks, beeches, and pines—into a single mist, although in the valleys that ran deeply through the furrows of the hills, as we ascended towards the gorge, the dark fir trees stood out against the backdrop of the late snow.</t136><t137>Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine forests that seemed to close in on us in the darkness, large gray masses scattered here and there among the trees produced a gloomy and solemn effect, which revived the thoughts and sinister fantasies engendered by the evening, while the setting sun seemed to cast a strange comfort on the ghostly clouds that, among the Carpathians, seem to wander incessantly through the valleys.</t137><t138>On certain occasions, the hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could only advance very slowly.</t138><t139>I wanted to get out of the carriage and walk beside them, as we do in my country, but the coachman would have none of it.</t139>
<t140>–No; no -he told me-, you must not walk here.</t140> <t141>The dogs are very fierce -he said, and then added, with what evidently seemed to be a macabre joke, as he looked around to catch the affirmative smiles of the others-:</t141> <t142>You will have enough to do before going to sleep.</t142>
<t143>Thus, the only stop he made for a moment served to light the lamps.</t143>
<t144>As dusk fell, it seemed that the passengers became more nervous and continuously spoke to the coachman one after another, as if asking him to increase the speed.</t144> <t145>He whipped the horses mercilessly with his long whip, and with wild shouts of encouragement tried to force them to greater efforts.</t145> <t146>Then, through the darkness, I could see a kind of gray patch of light ahead of us, as if there were a gap in the hills.</t146> <t147>The passengers' uneasiness increased; the mad carriage swayed on its large leather springs, and tilted from one side to the other like a ship floating on a stormy sea.</t147> <t148>I had to hold on.</t148> <t149>The road became more level and it seemed as if we were flying over it.</t149> <t150>Then, the mountains seemed to close in on us from both sides, as if they wanted to strangle us, and we found ourselves at the entrance of the Borgo Pass.</t150> <t151>One by one all the passengers offered me gifts, insisting in such a sincere manner that there was no way to refuse to accept them.</t151> <t152>Of course, the gifts were of very diverse and strange kinds, but each one gave it to me with such goodwill, with such kind words, and with a blessing, that strange mixture of fearful gestures I had already seen outside the hotel in Bistritz: the sign of the cross and the charm against the evil eye.</t152>
<t153>Then, as we were flying, the coachman leaned forward and, on each side, the passengers, leaning against the windows of the coach, anxiously scrutinized the darkness.</t153> <t154>It was evident that something strange was expected to happen, but although I asked each of the passengers, none gave me the slightest explanation.</t154> <t155>This state of mind lasted for some time, and in the end, we saw how the gorge opened towards the eastern side.</t155> <t156>Dark and gloomy clouds hung over us, and the air was heavy, laden with the oppressive sensation of thunder.</t156> <t157>It seemed as if the mountain range separated two atmospheres, and that now we had entered the stormy one.</t157> <t158>I myself began to look for the vehicle that was to take me to the count's residence.</t158> <t159>At every moment, I expected to see the flash of lamps through the darkness, but everything remained in the deepest darkness.</t159> <t160>The only light came from the flickering rays of light from our own lamps, in which the vapors of our exhausted horses rose like white clouds.</t160> <t161>Now we could see the sandy road stretching white before us, but there was no sign of a vehicle on it.</t161> <t162>The passengers reclined with a sigh of relief, which seemed to mock my own disappointment.</t162> <t163>I was already thinking about what I could do in such a situation when the coachman, looking at his watch, said something to the others that I could barely hear, so soft and mysterious was the tone in which he said it.</t163> <t164>I think it was something like "an hour ahead of time."</t164> <t165>Then he turned to me and said in German worse than mine:</t165>
<t166>–There is no carriage here.</t166> <t167>After all, no one is waiting for the gentleman.</t167> <t168>It would be better for him to come to Bukovina now and return tomorrow or the day after; better the day after.</t168>
<t169>While he was speaking, the horses began to prance and neigh, and to rear up so wildly that the coachman had to hold them firmly.</t169> <t170>Then, amidst a chorus of screams from the peasants who were hastily crossing themselves, a carriage appeared behind us, passed us, and stopped beside our coach.</t170> <t171>By the light emitted from our lamps, as the rays fell upon them, I could see that the horses were splendid animals, black as coal.</t171> <t172>They were driven by a tall man with a long grayish beard and a large black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us.</t172> <t173>I could only see the flash of a pair of very bright eyes, which appeared red in the lamp's glow, in the moments when the man turned towards us.</t173> <t174>He addressed the coachman:</t174>
<t175>–You arrived very early today, my friend.</t175>
<t176>The man replied, stammering:</t176>
<t177>The English gentleman was in a hurry.</t177>
<t178>Then the stranger spoke again:</t178>
<t179>–I suppose then that is why you wanted him to continue to Bucovina.</t179> <t180>You cannot deceive me, my friend.</t180> <t181>I know too much, and my horses are fast.</t181>
<t182>And as he spoke, he smiled, and when the light of the lamp fell upon his fine and hard mouth, with very red lips, his sharp teeth gleamed white like ivory.</t182> <t183>One of my companions whispered to another that phrase from Burger's "Leonora":</t183>
<t184>"For the dead travel fast"</t184>
<t185>(For the dead travel fast)</t185>
<t186>The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a sparkling smile.</t186> <t187>The passenger hid his face at the same time he made the sign with two fingers and crossed himself.</t187>
<t188>–Give me the gentleman's luggage -said the strange coachman.</t188>
<t189>With excessive haste, my suitcases were taken out and placed in the carriage.</t189> <t190>Then I got out of the car, as the carriage was situated next to it, and the coachman helped me with a hand that gripped my arm like a fist of steel; his strength must have been prodigious.</t190> <t191>Without saying a word, he shook the reins, the horses turned around, and we slid into the darkness of the gorge.</t191> <t192>Looking back, I saw the steam from the car's horses in the light of the lamps, and projected against it were the figures of my companions until recently, crossing themselves.</t192> <t193>Then the coachman cracked his whip and shouted at the horses, and we all set off towards Bucovina.</t193> <t194>As they disappeared into the darkness, I felt a strange shiver, and a feeling of loneliness took hold of me.</t194>
<t195>But my new coachman covered my shoulders with a cloak and placed a blanket over my knees, then spoke in excellent German:</t195>
<t196>–The night is cold, my lord, and my lord the count asked me to take good care of you.</t196> <t197>Under the seat there is a bottle of slivovitz, a regional liquor made from plums, in case you would like some…</t197>
<t198>But I didn't take anything, although it was nice to know there was a supply of liquor.</t198> <t199>I felt a bit strange, and no less scared.</t199> <t200>I think that if there had been another alternative, I would have taken it instead of continuing that mysterious night journey.</t200>
<t201>The carriage moved quickly, in a straight line; then we made a complete turn and went down another straight path.</t201> <t202>It seemed to me that we were just going around and around the same place; so, I took note of a prominent point and confirmed my suspicions.</t202> <t203>I would have liked to ask the coachman what all this meant, but I was really afraid, as I thought that, in the situation I was in, any protest would not have the desired effect in case there was an intention to delay.</t203> <t204>After a while, however, feeling curious to know how much time had passed, I lit a match, and by its light, I looked at my watch; it was a few minutes to midnight.</t204> <t205>This gave me a kind of start, as I suppose the general superstition about midnight had been heightened by my recent experiences.</t205> <t206>I remained waiting with a sickly feeling of anxiety.</t206>
<t207>Then a dog began to howl in some farmhouse further down the road.</t207> <t208>It let out a long, mournful howl, as if it were afraid.</t208> <t209>Its call was picked up by another dog and another and another, until, born like the wind that now gently passed through the gorge, it began a terrifying concert of howls that seemed to come from all points of the field, from as far as the imagination could reach through the darkness of the night.</t209> <t210>From the first howl, the horses began to paw and become restless, but the coachman spoke to them, calming them down, and they regained their composure, though they trembled and sweated as if they had just experienced a sudden fright.</t210> <t211>Then, in the far distance, from the mountains on either side of us, came a much louder and sharper howl, the howl of wolves, which affected the horses and myself in the same way, for I was about to jump out of the carriage and run away, while they backed up and reared frantically, so that the coachman had to use all his strength to prevent them from bolting.</t211> <t212>However, within a few minutes, my ears had become accustomed to the howls, and the horses had calmed down enough that the coachman could descend and stand in front of them.</t212> <t213>He rubbed and petted them, and whispered something in their ears, just as I have heard horse trainers do, and with such an extraordinary effect that under these caresses they became quite obedient again, though still trembling.</t213> <t214>The coachman took his seat again, shook his reins, and we resumed our journey at a good pace.</t214>
<t215>This time, after reaching the far side of the gorge, he suddenly crossed a narrow path that sharply veered to the right.</t215>
<t216>Soon we found ourselves obstructed by trees, which in some places completely covered the path, forming a sort of tunnel through which we passed.</t216> <t217>And in addition to that, gigantic menacing boulders flanked us on either side.</t217>
<t218>Despite being thus protected, we could hear the wind rising, as it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees clashed against each other as we passed along the path.</t218> <t219>It grew colder and a fine snow began to fall, so that in a moment everything around us was covered by a white mantle.</t219> <t220>The sharp wind still carried the howls of the dogs, though these diminished as we moved away.</t220> <t221>The howling of the wolves, on the other hand, came closer and closer, as if they were approaching us from all sides.</t221> <t222>I felt terribly distressed, and the horses shared my fear.</t222> <t223>However, the coachman did not seem to have any fear; he continuously turned his head to the left and to the right, but I could see nothing through the darkness.</t223>
<t224>Suddenly, far off to the left, I spotted the faint glow of a blue flame.</t224> <t225>The coachman saw it at the same time; he immediately stopped the horses and, jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness.</t225> <t226>I didn't know what to do, especially since the howls of the wolves seemed to be getting closer; but while I hesitated, the coachman suddenly appeared again, and without saying a word, took his seat and we resumed our journey.</t226>
<t227>I think I must have fallen asleep or repeatedly dreamed about the incident, for it happened over and over again, and now, when I recall it, it seems like a kind of horrifying nightmare.</t227> <t228>Once the flame appeared so close to the road that even in the darkness surrounding us, I could observe the coachman's movements.</t228> <t229>He quickly went to where the blue flame was (it must have been very faint, because it didn't seem to illuminate the area around it), and taking some stones, he placed them in a significant pattern.</t229> <t230>On one occasion, I was the victim of a strange optical effect: as he stood between the flame and me, he didn't seem to obstruct it, because I continued to see its ghostly glow.</t230> <t231>This astonished me, but since it was only a momentary effect, I supposed that my eyes had deceived me due to the effort I was making in the darkness.</t231> <t232>Then, for a while, the blue flames no longer appeared, and we sped through the darkness with the howls of wolves surrounding us, as if they were following us in encircling circles.</t232>
<t233>Finally, the coachman went farther away than he had done before, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble more than ever and to paw and neigh in fear.</t233> <t234>I could not see any cause for their nervousness, as the howling of the wolves had completely ceased; but then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of an overhanging rock covered with pines, and in its light, I saw around us a circle of wolves, with white teeth and red, hanging tongues, with long, sinuous limbs and bristly fur.</t234> <t235>They were a hundred times more terrifying in that gloomy silence that surrounded them than when they were howling.</t235> <t236>As for me, I fell into a kind of paralysis of fear.</t236> <t237>Only when a man comes face to face with such horrors can he understand their true meaning.</t237>
<t238>Suddenly, all the wolves began to howl as if the moonlight had a peculiar effect on them.</t238> <t239>The horses reared and backed away, looking helplessly around with eyes that rolled painfully; but the living circle of terror accompanied them on every side; they were forced to remain within it.</t239> <t240>I shouted to the coachman to come back, as it seemed to me that our last alternative was to try to break through the circle, and to aid his return I shouted and struck one side of the carriage, hoping that the noise would scare the wolves on that side and thus give him a chance to get back to the coach.</t240>
<t241>How he finally arrived is something I do not know; but I heard his voice rise in an imperious tone of command, and looking towards the place from where it came, I saw him standing in the middle of the road.</t241> <t242>He waved his long arms as if trying to remove an impalpable obstacle, and the wolves retreated; just at that moment, a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so we were plunged back into darkness.</t242>
<t243>When I could see again, the driver was getting into the carriage and the wolves had disappeared.</t243> <t244>All of this was so strange and mysterious that I was overcome by a panic fear, and I didn't have the courage to move or speak.</t244> <t245>Time seemed endless as we continued our journey, now in complete darkness, for the black clouds obscured the moon.</t245> <t246>We continued ascending, with occasional periods of rapid descents, but ascending most of the time.</t246>
<t247>Suddenly, I became aware that the driver was stopping the horses in the inner courtyard of an immense, partially ruined castle, from whose tall black windows not a single ray of light emerged, and whose broken walls showed a jagged line that stood out against the sky illuminated by the moonlight.</t247>
<t248>II.– FROM THE JOURNAL OF JONATHAN HARKER (continued)</t248>
<t249>May 5th.</t249> <t250>I must have been asleep, for it is certain that if I had been fully awake I would have noticed that we were approaching such an extraordinary place.</t250> <t251>In the darkness, the courtyard seemed to be of considerable size, and as several black corridors with large round arches led from it, it perhaps appeared larger than it actually was.</t251> <t252>I still haven't had the opportunity to see it in the daylight.</t252>
<t253>When the carriage stopped, the coachman jumped down and offered me his hand to help me disembark.</t253> <t254>Once again, I could feel his prodigious strength.</t254> <t255>His hand practically felt like a steel press that could have crushed mine if he had wanted to.</t255> <t256>Then he brought down my things and placed them on the ground beside me, while I stood near the large door, old and studded with large iron nails, set in a solid stone porch.</t256> <t257>Even in that dim light, I could see that the stone was profusely carved, but the carvings had been worn away by time and rain.</t257> <t258>While I stood there, the coachman jumped back onto his seat and shook the reins; the horses started moving, and they disappeared under one of those black openings, carriage and all.</t258>
<t259>I remained silent where I was because I really didn't know what to do.</t259> <t260>There were no signs of any bell or knocker, and through those grim walls and dark windows, it was most likely that my voice wouldn't penetrate.</t260> <t261>The time I waited seemed infinite, and I felt doubts and fears assailing me.</t261> <t262>What kind of place had I arrived at, and among what kind of people had I found myself?</t262> <t263>What kind of gloomy adventure had I embarked on?</t263> <t264>Was this a normal incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent to explain the purchase of a property in London to a foreigner?</t264> <t265>Solicitor's clerk!</t265> <t266>Mina wouldn't like that.</t266> <t267>Better solicitor, since just before leaving London I received the news that I had passed my exam; so now I was a full-fledged solicitor!</t267>
<t268>I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself, to see if I was awake.</t268> <t269>Everything seemed like a horrible nightmare, and I hoped to wake up suddenly finding myself at home with the dawn struggling through the windows, just as had happened to me on other occasions after working too much the previous day.</t269> <t270>But my flesh responded to the pinch test, and my eyes were not deceived.</t270> <t271>It was undeniable that I was awake and in the Carpathians.</t271> <t272>All I could do was be patient and wait for the dawn to arrive.</t272>
<t273>As soon as I reached this conclusion, I heard heavy footsteps approaching behind the large door, and through the cracks, I saw the glow of a light coming closer.</t273> <t274>The sound of chains clanging and the creaking of heavy bolts being drawn back was heard.</t274> <t275>A key turned, making the familiar noise produced by long disuse, and the immense door opened inward.</t275> <t276>In the doorway appeared a tall man, already old, clean-shaven except for a long white mustache, dressed in black from head to toe, without a single spot of color anywhere.</t276> <t277>He held an antique silver lamp in his hand, in which the flame burned without a globe or any kind of protection, casting long and wavy shadows as it flickered in the draft from the open door.</t277> <t278>The old man made a gesture with his right hand, making a courteous gesture and speaking in excellent English, though with a strange intonation:</t278>
<t279>–Welcome to my house.</t279> <t280>Come in freely and of your own will!</t280>
<t281>He made no movement to approach me, but remained motionless like a statue, as if his welcoming gesture had fixed him in stone.</t281> <t282>However, the moment I crossed the threshold of the door, he impulsively took a step forward and, extending his hand, grasped mine with a force that made me recoil, an effect not diminished by the fact that it felt as cold as ice; that it seemed more like the hand of a dead man than of a living one.</t282> <t283>He said again:</t283>
<t284>–Welcome to my house.</t284> <t285>Enter freely, go safely, and leave some of the happiness you bring.</t285>
<t286>The strength of the handshake was so similar to the one I had noticed in the coachman, whose face I had not been able to see, that for a moment I doubted if it was the same person I was talking to; so to make sure, I asked him:</t286>
<t287>–Count Dracula?</t287>
<t288>He bowed courteously as he responded to me.</t288>
<t289>–I am Dracula; and I welcome you, Mr. Harker, to my house.</t289> <t290>Come in; the night air is cold, and surely you need to eat and rest.</t290>
<t291>While he was talking, he placed the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and leaving, he took my luggage; he took it before I could prevent it.</t291> <t292>I protested, but he insisted:</t292>
<t293>–No, sir; you are my guest.</t293> <t294>It is already late, and my servants are not at hand.</t294> <t295>Let me personally take care of your comfort.</t295>
<t296>He insisted on carrying my things along the corridor and then up some large spiral stairs, and through another long corridor where our footsteps echoed loudly on the stone floor.</t296> <t297>At the end of it, he abruptly opened a heavy door, and I had the pleasure of seeing a very well-lit room in which a table was set for dinner, and in whose fireplace a large fire of logs, surely freshly placed, was blazing with sparkling flames.</t297>
<t298>The count stopped, put my suitcases on the floor, closed the door, and, crossing the room, opened another door that led to a small octagonal room lit by a simple lamp, and that at first glance did not seem to have any windows.</t298> <t299>Passing through this one, he opened yet another door and motioned for me to go through.</t299> <t300>It was a pleasant sight, for there was a large bedroom very well lit and heated by the fire of another hearth, which had also just been lit, as the logs on top were still fresh and sent a hollow crackling sound through the wide chimney.</t300> <t301>The count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying before closing the door:</t301>
<t302>–You will need, after your journey, to freshen up a bit and arrange your things.</t302> <t303>I hope you find everything you desire.</t303> <t304>When you are finished, come to the other room, where you will find your dinner prepared.</t304>
<t305>The light and warmth of the courteous welcome the count extended to me seemed to dispel all my old doubts and fears.</t305> <t306>Then, having returned to my normal state, I discovered that I was half-dead with hunger, so I got ready as quickly as possible and entered the other room.</t306>
<t307>I found that dinner was already served.</t307> <t308>My host was standing by the large bonfire, leaning against the stone fireplace; he made a graceful motion with his hand, pointing to the table, and said:</t308>
<t309>–I beg you to sit and dine as you please.</t309> <t310>I hope you will excuse me for not joining you; but I have already eaten, and I generally do not dine.</t310>
<t311>I handed him the sealed letter that Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.</t311> <t312>He opened it and read it seriously; then, with a charming smile, he gave it to me to read.</t312> <t313>At least one passage of it gave me great pleasure:</t313>
<t314>"I regret that an attack of gout, a disease from which I am constantly suffering, makes it absolutely impossible for me to undertake any journey for some time; but I am pleased to tell you that I can send you an efficient substitute, a person in whom I have the utmost confidence.</t314> <t315>He is a young man, full of energy and talent, and of great spirit and disposition.</t315> <t316>He is discreet and silent, and has grown and matured in my service.</t316> <t317>He will be ready to attend to you whenever you wish during your stay in that city, and will take instructions from you in all matters.</t317><t318>"</t318>
<t319>The count himself approached me and removed the lid from the dish, and I immediately attacked an excellent roasted chicken.</t319> <t320>This, with some cheese and salad, and a bottle of aged Tokay, of which I drank two glasses, was my dinner.</t320> <t321>During the time I was eating, the count asked me many questions about my journey, and I told him everything I had experienced.</t321>
<t322>By that time, dinner had already ended, and at my host's suggestion, I had pulled a chair up to the fire and started smoking a cigar that he had offered me while excusing himself for not smoking.</t322> <t323>This gave me the opportunity to observe him, and I noticed that he had very pronounced features.</t323>
<t324>His face was strong, very strong, aquiline, with a very pronounced bridge over the fine nose and its nostrils peculiarly arched; with a high and clear forehead, and gray hair that grew sparsely around the temples, but profusely in other parts.</t324> <t325>His eyebrows were very thick, almost meeting at the brow, and with hair so abundant that it seemed to curl from its very profusion.</t325>
<t326>The mouth, as far as I could see it under the thick mustache, was thin and had a rather cruel appearance, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over the lips, whose notable roughness showed a singular vitality in a man of his age.</t326> <t327>As for the rest, his ears were pale and extremely pointed at the top; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm, though thin.</t327> <t328>The complexion was of an extraordinary paleness.</t328>
<t329>Meanwhile, I had noticed the backs of his hands as they rested on his knees in the firelight, and they had seemed quite white and fine; but seeing them more closely, I couldn't help but notice that they were quite coarse, broad, and with stubby fingers.</t329> <t330>Strangely, they had hairs in the center of the palm.</t330> <t331>The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp point.</t331> <t332>When the count leaned toward me and one of his hands touched me, I couldn't suppress a shiver.</t332> <t333>It might have been his breath, which was fetid, but the truth is that a terrible feeling of nausea overtook me, which, despite my efforts, I couldn't repress.</t333> <t334>Evidently, the count, noticing it, withdrew, and with a somewhat gloomy smile, which showed more of his protruding teeth than before, sat down again on his own side facing the fireplace.</t334> <t335>We both remained silent for a few moments, and when he looked toward the window, I saw the first faint glimmers of dawn approaching.</t335> <t336>A strange stillness seemed to envelop everything; but listening more intently, I could hear, as if coming from the valley below, the howling of many wolves.</t336> <t337>The count's eyes flashed, and he said:</t337>
<t338>–Listen to them.</t338> <t339>The children of the night.</t339> <t340>What music they make!</t340>
<t341>But seeing, I suppose, some strange expression on my face, he hurried to add:</t341>
<t342>–Ah, sir!</t342> <t343>You city dwellers cannot fathom the feelings of a hunter.</t343>
<t344>Then he stood up and said:</t344>
<t345>–But the truth is that you must be tired.</t345> <t346>Your room is ready, and tomorrow you can sleep as much as you want.</t346> <t347>I will be away until the evening, so sleep well, and sweet dreams!</t347>
<t348>With a courteous bow, he himself opened the door that led to the octagonal room and entered my bedroom.</t348>
<t349>I am bewildered.</t349> <t350>I doubt, I fear, I think strange things, and I myself do not dare to confess to my own soul.</t350> <t351>May God protect me, if only for the love of my loved ones!</t351>
<t352>May 7.</t352> <t353>It is early in the morning again, but I have rested well over the last 24 hours.</t353> <t354>I slept very late, well into the day.</t354> <t355>When I had dressed, I went into the room where we had dined the night before and found a cold breakfast that was served, with hot coffee because the coffee pot had been placed on the stove.</t355> <t356>On the table, there was a card on which the following was written:</t356>
<t357>"I have to be away for a while."</t357>
<t358>Do not wait for me.</t358> <t359>D."</t359>
<t360>I sat down and enjoyed a good meal.</t360> <t361>When I had finished, I looked for a bell to let the servants know I was done, but I couldn't find one.</t361> <t362>There are certainly some rare deficiencies in the house, especially considering the extraordinary displays of opulence that surround me.</t362> <t363>The table service is made of gold, and so beautifully crafted that it must be of immense value.</t363> <t364>The curtains and the linings of the chairs and sofas, and the covers of my bed, are made of the most costly and beautiful fabrics, and they must have been of fabulous value when they were made, as they seem to be several hundred years old, though they are still in good condition.</t364>
<t365>I saw something similar to them at Hampton Court, but those were used and moth-eaten.</t365> <t366>But I have not yet found a mirror in any room.</t366> <t367>There isn't even a hand mirror on my table, and to shave or comb my hair I was forced to take my small mirror out of my suitcase.</t367> <t368>I have also not seen any servants anywhere, nor have I heard any other noise near the castle, except for the howling of the wolves.</t368> <t369>Shortly after I had finished my meal (I don't know what to call it, whether breakfast or dinner, as I had it between five and six in the afternoon) I looked for something to read, but I did not want to wander around the castle before asking the count for permission.</t369> <t370>In the room, I could not find anything at all, neither books nor newspapers nor anything printed, so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of library.</t370> <t371>I tried to open the door opposite mine, but I found it locked.</t371>
<t372>In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of books in English, entire shelves full of them, and bound volumes of newspapers and magazines.</t372> <t373>A table in the center was filled with English magazines and newspapers, although none of them were very recent.</t373> <t374>The books were of the most varied kinds: history, geography, politics, political economy, botany, biology, law, and all referring to England and English life and customs.</t374> <t375>There were even reference books such as the London directory, the "Red" and "Blue" books, Whitaker's almanac, the Army and Navy catalogs, and, what brought me great joy to see, the catalog of Laws.</t375>
<t376>While I was looking at the books, the door opened and the count entered.</t376> <t377>He greeted me very warmly and hoped that I had rested well during the night.</t377>
<t378>Then, he continued:</t378>
<t379>–I am pleased that you have found your way here, for I am sure that there will be many things here that will interest you.</t379> <t380>These companions -he said, placing his hand on some books- have been very good friends of mine, and for some years now, since I had the idea of going to London, they have given me many, many hours of pleasure.</t380> <t381>Through them, I have learned to know your great England; and to know it is to love it.</t381> <t382>I have a fervent desire to walk through the crowded streets of your mighty London; to be in the midst of the whirlwind and rush of humanity, to share its life, its changes, and its death, and everything that makes it what it is.</t382> <t383>But, alas, until now I only know your language through books.</t383> <t384>To you, my friend, does it seem that I know your language well?</t384>
<t385>–But, Count -I said-, you know and speak English very well!</t385>
<t386>He made a deep bow.</t386>
<t387>–I thank you, my friend, for your overly optimistic estimation; however, I fear that I am just beginning the path I am going to travel.</t387> <t388>It is true that I know the grammar and the vocabulary, but I still do not express myself fluently.</t388>
<t389>–I insist -I told him- that you speak excellently.</t389>
<t390>–Not so much -he replied-.</t390> <t391>That is to say, I know that if I were to carry myself and speak in your London, there is no one there who would not take me for a foreigner.</t391> <t392>That is not enough for me.</t392> <t393>Here I am a noble, I am a boyar; the common people know me and I am their lord.</t393> <t394>But a foreigner in a foreign land is nobody; men do not know him, and not knowing is not caring.</t394> <t395>I am content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops me if he sees me, or pauses in his words upon hearing my voice, saying: "Ha, ha, a foreigner!"</t395> <t396>I have been a lord for so long that I will still be a lord, or at least no one will prevail over me.</t396> <t397>You do not come to me only as an agent of my friend Peter Hawkins, of Exeter, to give me the details about my new property in London.</t397> <t398>I hope that you will stay with me for some time, so that through our conversations I can learn the English accent; and I would very much like you to tell me when I make a mistake, even the smallest, in speaking.</t398> <t399>I am very sorry to have had to be absent for so long today, but I hope you will forgive someone who has so many important things at hand.</t399>
<t400>Of course, I said everything that can be said about having good will, and I asked if I could enter that room whenever I wanted.</t400> <t401>He replied yes, and added:</t401>
<t402>–You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are locked, where of course you will not want to go.</t402> <t403>There is a reason for everything to be as it is, and if you saw with my eyes and knew with my knowledge, you might understand better.</t403>
<t404>I assured him that it would be so, and he continued:</t404>
<t405>–We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England.</t405> <t406>Our way of being is not like your way of being, and there will be many strange things for you.</t406> <t407>Moreover, from what you have already told me about your experiences, you already know something about what strange things can be.</t407>
<t408>This led to much conversation; and it was evident that he wanted to talk even if it was just for the sake of talking.</t408> <t409>I asked him many questions about things that had already happened to me or that I had already taken note of.</t409> <t410>Sometimes he dodged the topic or changed the conversation, pretending not to understand me; but generally, he answered everything I asked in the most straightforward manner.</t410> <t411>Then, as time went on and I became more confident, I asked him about some of the strange events of the previous night, such as why the coachman went to the places where he saw the blue flame.</t411> <t412>Then he explained to me that it was a common belief that on a certain night of the year (in fact, the previous night, when evil spirits are believed to have unlimited powers) a blue flame appears in any place where some treasure has been hidden.</t412>
<t413>That treasures have been hidden in the region through which you passed last night -he continued-, is something that is beyond all doubt.</t413> <t414>This has been land where the Vlachs, Saxons, and Turks have fought for centuries.</t414> <t415>To tell the truth, it would be difficult to find a square foot of land in this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or invaders.</t415> <t416>In ancient times there were turbulent periods, when the Austrians and Hungarians arrived in hordes and the patriots went out to confront them, men and women, old and young, awaited their arrival among the rocks above the gorges to hurl destruction and death upon them with their artificial avalanches.</t416> <t417>When the invaders triumphed, they found very little loot, as everything that existed was hidden in the kind earth.</t417>
<t418>–But how is it possible –I asked– that so much time has passed without it being discovered, given that there is such a sure sign to uncover it, simply by the man taking the trouble to just look?</t418>
<t419>The count smiled, and as his lips pulled back over his gums, his canines, long and sharp, were unusually revealed.</t419> <t420>He replied:</t420>
<t421>–Because the peasant is, deep down in his heart, a coward and an imbecile!</t421> <t422>Those flames only appear on one night; and on that night no man from this land, if he can avoid it, dares even to peek through his door.</t422> <t423>And, my dear sir, even if he did, he wouldn't know what to do.</t423> <t424>I assure you that not even the peasant you told me about, who marked the places of the flame, will know where to look during the day, because of the work he did that night.</t424> <t425>Even you, I dare say, would not be able to find those places again.</t425> <t426>Isn't that true?</t426>
<t427>–Yes, it's true -I said-.</t427> <t428>I don't have the slightest idea where I could look for them.</t428>
<t429>Then we moved on to other topics.</t429>
<t430>–Let's go -he told me at the end-, tell me about London and the house you have bought in my name.</t430>
<t431>Excusing myself for my forgetfulness, I went to my room to take the papers out of my portfolio.</t431> <t432>While I was arranging them in order, I heard a tinkling of porcelain and silver in the other room, and upon crossing it, I noticed that the table had been set and the lamp lit, for by then it was quite late.</t432> <t433>Also in the study or library, the lamps were lit, and I found the count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, a Bradshaw's English Guide.</t433> <t434>When I entered, he removed the books and papers from the table; and then I began to explain to him the plans and the facts, and the numbers.</t434> <t435>He was interested in everything, and asked me countless questions related to the place and its surroundings.</t435> <t436>It was clear that he had studied in advance everything he could expect regarding the subject of his neighborhood, for evidently, in the end, he knew much more than I did.</t436> <t437>When I pointed that out to him, he replied:</t437>
<t438>–But, my friend, is it not necessary for it to be so?</t438> <t439>When I go there, I will be completely alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan, no, forgive me, I always fall into the custom of my country of putting the patronymic name first; so, my friend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and help me.</t439> <t440>I will be in Exeter, miles away, probably working on legal papers with my other friend, Peter Hawkins.</t440> <t441>Isn't that so?</t441>
<t442>We fully entered the business of purchasing the property in Purfleet.</t442> <t443>When I had explained the facts to him and he had already signed the necessary papers, and I had written a letter with them to send to Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had found such an appropriate place.</t443> <t444>Then I read to him the notes I had made at that time, which I transcribe here:</t444>
<t445>"In Purfleet, by the side of the road, I found a place that seems to be exactly what is needed, and where there was a sign displayed announcing that the property was for sale.</t445> <t446>It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure, built of heavy stones, and which has not been repaired for a long number of years.</t446> <t447>The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all corroded by mold.</t447>
<t448>"The property is called Carfax, which is undoubtedly a corruption of the old Quatre Face, as the house has four sides, aligning with the cardinal points.</t448> <t449>It contains a total of about twenty acres, completely surrounded by the solid stone wall mentioned above.</t449> <t450>The place has many trees, which gives it a gloomy appearance, and there is also a pool or small lake, deep, with a dark appearance, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and flows in a fairly appreciable stream.</t450> <t451>The house is very large and from all past ages, I would say, up to medieval times, as one of its parts is made of extremely thick stone, with only a few windows very high up and heavily barred with iron.</t451>
<t452>“It looks like a part of a castle, and it is very close to an old chapel or church.</t452> <t453>I couldn't enter it, as I didn't have the key to the door that led inside from the house, but I have taken views with my Kodak from various points.</t453> <t454>The house has been added to, but in a very strange way, and I can only roughly guess the extent of land it covers, which must be a lot.</t454> <t455>There are very few houses nearby, one of them is very long, recently expanded, and fitted to serve as a private asylum for lunatics.</t455> <t456>However, it is not visible from the grounds.</t456>
<t457>When I had finished, the count said:</t457>
<t458>–I am glad that it is large and old.</t458> <t459>I myself come from an ancient family, and living in a new house would kill me.</t459> <t460>A house cannot be made habitable in a day, and, after all, how few are the days needed to make a century.</t460> <t461>I am also delighted that there is a chapel from ancient times.</t461> <t462>We, the Transylvanian nobles, do not like the thought that our bones might one day rest among the common dead.</t462> <t463>I do not seek joy or jubilation, nor the bright voluptuousness of many rays of sun and sparkling waters that so please the cheerful young.</t463> <t464>I am no longer young; and my heart, through the heavy years of watching over the dead, is no longer disposed to rejoicing.</t464> <t465>Moreover: the walls of my castle are broken; many are the shadows, and the wind breathes cold through the broken walls and casemates.</t465> <t466>I love the shadow and the darkness, and I prefer, when I can, to be alone with my thoughts.</t466>
<t467>Somehow his words and his gaze did not seem to agree, or perhaps it was that the expression on his face made his smile seem malevolent and saturnine.</t467>
<t468>At the moment, excusing himself, he left me, asking me to gather all my papers.</t468> <t469>He had already been absent for a short time, and I began to leaf through some of the books that were closest to me.</t469> <t470>One was an atlas, which, naturally, was open to England, as if the map had been very used.</t470> <t471>Looking at it, I found certain places marked with small rings, and upon examining these, I noticed that one was near London, on the east side, evidently where his new property was situated.</t471> <t472>The other two were Exeter and Whitby, on the coast of Yorkshire.</t472>
<t473>Approximately an hour passed before the count returned.</t473>
<t474>–Aha! – he said –, still with your books? Good!</t474> <t475>But you must not work all the time.</t475> <t476>Come; I have been told that your dinner is already prepared.</t476>
<t477>He took me by the arm and we entered the next room, where I found an excellent dinner already set on the table.</t477> <t478>Once again the count apologized, as he had dined during the time I had been out of the house.</t478> <t479>But just like the previous night, he sat and chatted while I ate.</t479> <t480>After dinner I smoked, and like the previous night, the count stayed with me, chatting and asking questions about all possible topics, hour after hour.</t480> <t481>I felt that it was getting very late, but I said nothing, as I felt obligated to satisfy my host's wishes in any way possible.</t481> <t482>I did not feel sleepy, as the long night's sleep from the previous day had strengthened me; but I could not avoid experiencing that chill that overtakes one with the arrival of dawn, which is in its own way, the change of tide.</t482> <t483>They say that people who are dying generally die with the change of dawn or with the change of the tide; and anyone who has been tired and forced to stay at their post has experienced this change in the atmosphere and can believe it.</t483> <t484>Suddenly, we heard the crowing of a rooster, arriving with supernatural shrillness through the clear morning; Count Dracula jumped to his feet, and said:</t484>
<t485>–Well, morning has come again!</t485> <t486>I am very inconsiderate, forcing you to stay awake for so long.</t486> <t487>You must make your conversation about my dear new country, England, less interesting, so that I do not forget how time flies between us.</t487>
<t488>And having said this, making a very courteous bow, he quickly walked away.</t488>
<t489>I entered my room and opened the curtains, but there was little to observe; my window overlooked the central courtyard, and all I could see was the hot gray of the clear sky.</t489> <t490>So I closed the windows again, and I have written about this day.</t490>
<t491>May 8.</t491> <t492>When I began writing this book, I feared that I was being too verbose; but now I am pleased to have gone into detail from the start, for there is something so strange about this place and all the things that happen, that I cannot help but feel uneasy.</t492> <t493>I wish I were far away from here, or had never come.</t493> <t494>It may be that this strange nocturnal existence is affecting me, but how I wish that were all!</t494> <t495>If there were someone I could talk to, I think I could bear it, but there is no one.</t495> <t496>I only have the count to talk to, and he...!</t496> <t497>I fear I am the only living soul in the place.</t497> <t498>Let me be as prosaic as the facts are; this will help me a lot to endure the situation; and imagination must not be corrupted with me.</t498> <t499>If it does, I am lost.</t499> <t500>Let us say once and for all in what situation I find myself, or seem to find myself.</t500>
<t501>I slept only a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I couldn't sleep any longer, I got up.</t501><t502>I hung my shaving mirror on the window and was just beginning to shave.</t502><t503>Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder, and I heard the Count's voice saying to me: "Good morning."</t503><t504>It startled me, for I was amazed that I hadn't seen him, as the mirror's image covered the entire room behind me.</t504><t505>Due to the shock, I slightly cut myself, but at the moment I didn't notice it.</t505><t506>Having responded to the Count's greeting, I turned back to the mirror to see how I had made a mistake.</t506><t507>This time there could be no mistake, for the man was close to me and I could see him over my shoulder, but there was no image of him in the mirror!</t507><t508>The whole room behind me was reflected, but there was no sign of any man in it, except for myself.</t508><t509>This was astonishing, and, added to the large number of strange things that had already happened, it began to increase that vague feeling of unease that I always have when the Count is near.</t509><t510>But at that moment I saw that the wound had bled slightly and that a trickle of blood was running down my chin.</t510><t511>I put down the razor, and as I did so, I turned halfway around looking for an adhesive plaster.</t511><t512>When the Count saw my face, his eyes gleamed with a kind of demonic fury, and suddenly he lunged at my throat.</t512><t513>I stepped back and his hand touched the chain of the rosary that held the crucifix.</t513><t514>It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe he had ever felt it.</t514>
<t515>–Be careful -he said-, be careful not to cut yourself.</t515> <t516>It is more dangerous than you think in this country -he added, taking the shaving mirror-.</t516> <t517>And this damned thing is what has caused the mess.</t517> <t518>It is a rotten bubble of man's vanity.</t518> <t519>Away with it!</t519>
<t520>Upon saying this, he opened the heavy window and with a yank of his horrible hand, threw the mirror through it, which shattered into pieces on the stones of the inner courtyard below.</t520>
<t521>Then he left without saying a word.</t521> <t522>All this is very annoying, because now I don't see how I am going to be able to shave, unless I use the case of my watch or the bottom of my shaving bowl, which fortunately is made of metal.</t522>
<t523>When I entered the dining room, breakfast was prepared; but I couldn't find the count anywhere.</t523> <t524>So I had breakfast alone.</t524> <t525>It's strange that until now I still haven't seen the count eat or drink.</t525> <t526>He must be a very peculiar man!</t526> <t527>After breakfast, I did a little exploration in the castle.</t527> <t528>I went up the stairs and found a room that faced south.</t528> <t529>The view was magnificent, and from where I stood, I had every opportunity to appreciate it.</t529> <t530>The castle is situated at the very edge of a terrible precipice.</t530> <t531>A stone falling from the window could descend a thousand feet without touching anything!</t531> <t532>As far as the eye can see, there is only a sea of green tree tops, with an occasional rift where there is an abyss.</t532> <t533>Here and there, you can see silver threads of rivers passing through deep gorges in the forest.</t533>
<t534>But I am not in the mood to describe such beauty, for when I had gazed at the view, I explored a bit more; doors, doors, doors everywhere, all closed and locked.</t534> <t535>There is no place, except for the windows in the castle walls, through which one can exit.</t535>
<t536>The castle is truly a prison, and I am a prisoner!</t536>
<t537>III.– FROM THE JOURNAL OF JONATHAN HARKER (continued)</t537>
<t538>When I realized that I was a prisoner, a sort of wild sensation took hold of me.</t538> <t539>I ran up and down the stairs, pressing every door and looking through every window I found; but after a while, the conviction of my helplessness overcame all my other feelings.</t539> <t540>Now, after a few hours, when I think about it, I imagine that I must have been mad, for I behaved very much like a rat caught in a trap.</t540> <t541>However, when I was convinced of my helplessness, I sat quietly, as quietly as I have ever done in my life, and began to think about what was the best thing I could do.</t541> <t542>One thing I am sure of: it makes no sense to reveal my ideas to the Count.</t542> <t543>He knows perfectly well that I am trapped; and since he himself is the one who has done it, and undoubtedly has his reasons for it, if I fully confess my situation to him, he will only try to deceive me.</t543>
<t544>From what I can see so far, my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and fears to myself, and my eyes open.</t544> <t545>I know that either I am being deceived like a child by my own fears, or I am in a predicament; and if the latter is true, I need and will need all my wits to get through.</t545>
<t546>I had barely reached this conclusion when I heard the large door downstairs close, and I knew that the count had returned.</t546> <t547>He did not come to the library immediately, so I cautiously returned to my room and found him making my bed.</t547> <t548>This was strange, but it only confirmed what I had been suspecting for quite some time: there were no servants in the house.</t548> <t549>When I later saw him through the hinge crack of the door setting the table in the dining room, I had no doubt left; for if he was taking care of all those small chores, it surely was proof that there was no one else in the castle, and the count himself must have been the coachman who brought me here in the carriage.</t549> <t550>This is a terrible thought; for if so, it means he can control the wolves, just as he did, by merely raising his hand in silence.</t550> <t551>Why was it that all the people in Bistritz and on the coach were so afraid for me?</t551> <t552>What meaning did they give to the crucifix, the garlic, the wild rose, the mountain ash?</t552> <t553>Bless that good woman who hung the crucifix around my neck!</t553> <t554>It gives me comfort and strength every time I touch it.</t554> <t555>It is amusing that something I was taught to view with disdain and as idolatrous could be of help in times of loneliness and trouble.</t555> <t556>Is there something in the very essence of the thing, or is it a means, a tangible aid that evokes the memory of sympathies and comforts?</t556> <t557>Perhaps someday I should examine this matter and try to tell myself about it.</t557> <t558>Meanwhile, I must find out all I can about Count Dracula, for that might help me understand.</t558> <t559>Tonight I will make him talk about himself, steering the conversation in that direction.</t559> <t560>However, I must be very careful not to arouse his suspicions.</t560>
<t561>Midnight.</t561> <t562>I had a long conversation with the count.</t562> <t563>I asked him a few questions about the history of Transylvania, and he responded to the topic wonderfully.</t563> <t564>When talking about things and people, and especially about battles, he spoke as if he had been present at all of them.</t564> <t565>He later explained this to me by saying that for a boyar, the pride of his house and his name is his own pride, that their glory is his own glory, that their fate is his own fate.</t565> <t566>Whenever he spoke of his house, he referred to it as "we," and almost all the time he spoke in the plural, just as kings do.</t566> <t567>I wish I could write down here exactly everything he said, for to me it is extremely fascinating.</t567> <t568>The whole history of the country seemed to be there.</t568> <t569>As he spoke, he became excited, and he paced around the room tugging at his large white mustache and gripping everything he had in his hands as if he were about to crush it with sheer force.</t569> <t570>He said something that I will try to describe as accurately as possible; for in his way, it narrates the entire history of his race:</t570>
<t571>"We, the Escequelians, have the right to be proud, for the blood of many brave races that fought like lions for their dominion runs through our veins.</t571> <t572>Here, in the whirlwind of European races, the Ugric tribe brought from Iceland the fighting spirit that Thor and Wodin had given them, and whose berserkers demonstrated so clearly and intensely on the coasts of Europe (what am I saying?, and of Asia and Africa too) that the very people believed that the werewolves themselves had arrived.</t572>
<t573>Here too, when they arrived, they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the land like a living flame, so much so that the dying people believed that in their veins ran the blood of those ancient witches, who, expelled from Scythia, coupled with devils in the desert.</t573> <t574>Fools, fools!</t574> <t575>What devil or what witch has ever been as great as Attila, whose blood is in these veins? – he said, raising his arms -.</t575> <t576>Is it strange that we are a conquering race; that we are proud; that when the Magyars, the Lombards, the Avars, the Bulgarians, or the Turks launched themselves by the thousands upon our borders, we repelled them?</t576> <t577>Is it strange that when Árpád and his legions spread across the Hungarian homeland, they found us here upon reaching the border; that the Honfoglalás was completed here?</t577> <t578>And when the Hungarian flood moved eastward, the Szeklers were proclaimed relatives by the mysterious Magyars, and it was to us for centuries that the guarding of the Turkish border was entrusted.</t578> <t579>There is more still, the endless duty of border guarding, for as the Turks say, the water sleeps, and the enemy watches.</t579> <t580>Who more happily among the four nations received “the bloodstained sword,” or ran more swiftly beside the king when he gave his war cry?</t580> <t581>When was the great shame of the nation redeemed, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the Wallachians and the Magyars fell defeated under the crescent?</t581> <t582>Who was it but one of my own race who, under the name of Voivode, crossed the Danube and struck the Turks in their own land?</t582> <t583>This was undoubtedly a Dracula!</t583> <t584>Who was it that sold his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, to the Turks and brought upon them the shame of slavery?</t584> <t585>Was it not this Dracula, who inspired that other of his race who in later ages led his forces again and again over the great river and into Turkey; who, when defeated, returned again and again, even if he had to go alone to the bloody field where his troops were being mortally crushed, because he knew that only he could guarantee victory!</t585> <t586>They say he only thought of himself.</t586> <t587>Bah! What use are peasants without a leader?</t587> <t588>What does a war come to that has no brain and heart to direct it?</t588> <t589>Moreover, when, after the Battle of Mohács, we shook off the Hungarian yoke, we of Dracula blood were among their leaders, for our spirit could not bear that we were not free.</t589> <t590>Ah, young friend, the Szeklers (and the Draculas as the blood of their heart, their brain, and their swords) can be proud of a tradition that mushroom offshoots like the Hapsburgs and the Romanovs can never attain.</t590> <t591>The days of war are over.</t591> <t592>Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonorable peace; and the glories of the great races are like a tale that is told.</t592>
<t593>By that time, morning was already approaching, and we went to bed.</t593> <t594>(Rec., this diary seems as dreadful as the beginning of the "Arabian Nights," since everything has to be suspended at the crowing of the rooster - or like the ghost of Hamlet's father.)</t594>
<t595>May 12.</t595> <t596>Allow me to begin with facts, mere and concise facts, verified with books and numbers, and of which there can be no doubt.</t596> <t597>I must not confuse them with experiences that will have to rest on my own observation, or on my memory of them.</t597> <t598>Last night, when the count came from his room, he began by asking me questions about legal matters and the way certain types of business were conducted.</t598> <t599>I had spent the day wearily over books and, simply to keep my mind occupied, I began to reflect on some things I had been examining at the Lincoln inn.</t599> <t600>There is a certain method in the count's inquiries, so I will try to put them in their order of succession.</t600> <t601>Knowledge may somehow and someday be useful to me.</t601>
<t602>First, he asked me if a man in England can have two or more solicitors.</t602> <t603>I told him that if he wished, he could have a dozen, but it would not be advisable to have more than one solicitor employed in a transaction, because only one could act at a time, and changing them would surely act against his interest.</t603> <t604>It seemed that he understood well what I meant and continued asking me if there would be a practical difficulty in having one man attending, say, to finances, and another worrying about shipments, in case local help was needed in a place far from the financial solicitor's office.</t604> <t605>I asked him to explain more fully, so that there would be no chance of me giving him an erroneous judgment.</t605> <t606>Then he said:</t606>
<t607>–I will give an example.</t607> <t608>Our mutual friend, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from the shadow of his beautiful cathedral in Exeter, which is quite far from London, buys a property in London for me through his good offices.</t608> <t609>Very well!</t609> <t610>Now let me tell you frankly, unless you think it very strange that I have requested the services of someone so far from London, instead of someone residing there, that my only motive was that no local interest should be served except my own desires.</t610> <t611>And as someone residing in London might have, perhaps, some purpose for themselves or for friends whom they serve, I sought my agent in the countryside, whose work would be solely for my interest.</t611> <t612>Now, suppose I, having many pending matters, wish to ship some things, say, to Newcastle, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, wouldn't it be easier to do so by consigning them to one of these ports?</t612>
<t613>I replied that it was certainly easier, but that we, the solicitors, had a system of agencies among each other, in such a way that the local work could be done locally under the instruction of any solicitor, so that the client, by simply putting themselves in the hands of one person, could see their wishes fulfilled without taking any further trouble.</t613>
<t614>–But -he said-, I would have the freedom to direct myself.</t614> <t615>Isn't that right?</t615>
<t616>–Of course -I replied -; and many times businessmen do the same, as they do not wish for the entirety of their affairs to be known by a single person.</t616>
<t617>–Magnificent! – he exclaimed.</t617>
<t618>And then he proceeded to ask me about the means to send things on consignment and the ways by which they had to be sent, and all kinds of difficulties that might arise, but that could be foreseen by thinking about them in advance.</t618> <t619>I explained all his questions to the best of my abilities, and he certainly left me with the impression that he would have been a magnificent solicitor, as there was nothing he did not think of or foresee.</t619> <t620>For a man who had never been in the country, and who evidently did not engage much in business matters, his knowledge and insight were marvelous.</t620> <t621>When he was satisfied with those points he had talked about, and I had also verified everything with the books I had on hand, he suddenly stood up and said:</t621>
<t622>–Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter Hawkins, or to anyone else?</t622>
<t623>It was with a certain bitterness in my heart that I responded no, as until then I had not seen any opportunity to send letters to anyone.</t623>
<t624>"Then write now, my young friend," he said, placing his heavy hand on my shoulder; "write to our friend and to anyone else; and say, if you please, that you will stay with me for another month starting today."</t624>
<t625>–Do you want me to stay that long? – I asked, for my heart froze at the thought.</t625>
<t626>–I desire it greatly; no, rather, I do not accept refusals.</t626> <t627>When your master, your employer, whatever you prefer, ordered someone to come on his behalf, it was understood that only my needs should be consulted.</t627> <t628>I have not been stingy, have I?</t628>
<t629>What could I do but bow and accept?</t629> <t630>It was in Mr. Hawkins' interest, not mine, and I had to think of him, not myself.</t630> <t631>And besides, while Count Dracula was speaking, there was something in his eyes and gestures that reminded me that I was his prisoner, and that even if I wished, I really had no choice.</t631> <t632>The Count saw his victory in my bow and his dominance in the anguish on my face, for he immediately began to use both, but in his own smooth and irresistible manner.</t632>
<t633>–I beg you, my good young friend, to speak of nothing but business in your letters.</t633> <t634>Undoubtedly, your friends will be pleased to know that you are well and eager to return home to them, won't they?</t634>
<t635>While he was speaking, he handed me three sheets of paper and three envelopes.</t635> <t636>They were thin, meant for foreign mail, and upon seeing them, and seeing him, noticing his calm smile with sharp canine teeth protruding over his red lower lips, I also understood as if it had been said to me in words that I should be quite prudent with what I wrote, for he was going to read its content.</t636> <t637>Therefore, I resolved to write for now only some normal notes, but to write in detail to Mr. Hawkins in secret.</t637> <t638>And also to Mina, for I could write to her in shorthand, which would surely perplex the count if he read the letter.</t638> <t639>Once I had written my two letters, I sat calmly, reading a book while the count wrote several notes, referring to some books on his desk as he wrote.</t639> <t640>Then he took my two letters and placed them with his, and put away the writing tools he had used.</t640> <t641>The moment the door closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the envelopes that were face down on the table.</t641> <t642>I felt no scruples in doing this, for under the circumstances I felt I had to protect myself in any way possible.</t642>
<t643>One of the letters was addressed to Samuel F. Billington, number 7, The Crescent, Whitby; another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was for Coutts Co., London, and the fourth for Herren Klopstock Billreuth, bankers, Budapest.</t643> <t644>The second and the fourth were not sealed.</t644> <t645>I was about to look at them when I noticed the doorknob moving.</t645> <t646>I dropped into my seat, barely having enough time to place the letters as they had been and to resume reading my book, before the count entered still carrying another letter in his hand.</t646> <t647>He took all the other letters that were on the table and carefully stamped them, and then, turning to me, said:</t647>
<t648>–I trust you will forgive me, but I have a lot of private work to do tonight.</t648> <t649>I hope you find everything you need.</t649>
<t650>Already at the door, he turned around, and after a moment of pause, he said:</t650>
<t651>–Allow me to advise you, my dear young friend; no, allow me to warn you with all seriousness that in case you leave these rooms, under no circumstances should you fall asleep anywhere else in the castle.</t651> <t652>It is old and has many memories, and there are many nightmares for those who do not sleep wisely.</t652> <t653>I warn you!</t653> <t654>In case sleep overcomes you now or at another time or is about to overcome you, quickly return to your own room or to these quarters, for then you will be able to rest safely.</t654> <t655>But if you are not careful in this regard, then… -he finished his speech in a horrifying manner, for he made a motion with his hands as if he were washing them.</t655>
<t656>I almost understood him.</t656> <t657>My only doubt was whether any dream could be more terrible than the supernatural, horrible web of darkness and mystery that seemed to be closing around me.</t657>
<t658>Later.</t658> <t659>I endorse the last written words, but this time there is no doubt about the matter.</t659> <t660>I will have no fear of sleeping anywhere he is not.</t660> <t661>I have placed the crucifix above the head of my bed because I imagine that my rest is freer from nightmares that way.</t661> <t662>And there it will remain.</t662>
<t663>When he left me, I headed to my room.</t663> <t664>After some time, not hearing any noise, I went out and climbed the stone bleachers from where I could see to the south.</t664> <t665>There was a certain sense of freedom in this vast expanse, although it was inaccessible to me, compared to the narrow darkness of the inner courtyard.</t665> <t666>Looking outside, I felt without any doubt that I was a prisoner, and it seemed to me that I needed a breath of fresh air, even if it was at night.</t666> <t667>I am beginning to feel that this nocturnal existence is affecting me.</t667> <t668>It is destroying my nerves.</t668> <t669>I am scared of my own shadow, and I am filled with all kinds of terrible imaginations.</t669> <t670>God knows very well that there are reasons for my terrible fear in this damned place!</t670> <t671>I looked at the beautiful landscape, bathed in the faint yellow light of the moon, until it was almost like daylight.</t671> <t672>In the soft twilight, the distant hills melted away, and the shadows were lost in the valleys and hollows of a velvety black.</t672> <t673>The mere beauty seemed to cheer me up; there was peace and comfort in every breath I inhaled.</t673> <t674>As I leaned against the window, my eye was caught by something moving a floor below and somewhat to my left, where I imagine, by the order of the rooms, the windows of the count's own room would be.</t674> <t675>The window in which I was standing was high and deep, carved in stone, and although time and weather had worn it, it was still complete.</t675> <t676>But evidently, the frame had long since disappeared.</t676> <t677>I placed myself behind the stone frame and looked intently.</t677>
<t678>What I saw was the count's head emerging from the window.</t678> <t679>I didn't see his face, but I knew it was him by the neck and the movement of his back and arms.</t679> <t680>In any case, I couldn't mistake those hands, which I had studied on so many occasions.</t680> <t681>At first, I showed interest and was even somewhat entertained, for it is wonderful how a small thing can interest and entertain a man who finds himself imprisoned.</t681> <t682>But my own sensations turned to repulsion and terror when I saw the entire man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall, over the deep abyss, head downwards with his cloak spread out over him like great wings.</t682> <t683>At first, I couldn't believe my eyes.</t683> <t684>I thought it was a trick of the moonlight, some malevolent effect of shadows.</t684> <t685>But I kept looking and it couldn't be any illusion.</t685> <t686>I saw how the fingers of his hands and feet gripped the corners of the stones, clearly worn from the mortar by the passage of years, and thus using every projection and irregularity, they moved downward at a considerable speed, in the same way a lizard walks on walls.</t686>
<t687>What kind of man is this, or what kind of being with the appearance of a man?</t687> <t688>I feel that the terror of this horrible place is overcoming me; I am afraid, very afraid, that there may be no possible escape for me.</t688> <t689>I am surrounded by such terrors that I do not dare to think about them...</t689>
<t690>May 15th.</t690> <t691>Once again, I saw the Count slither like a lizard.</t691> <t692>He walked downward, slightly sideways, for about a hundred feet and veered to the left.</t692> <t693>There he disappeared into a hole or window.</t693> <t694>When his head had vanished, I leaned out trying to see more, but to no avail, as the distance was too great to provide me with a favorable viewing angle.</t694> <t695>But by then I already knew he had left the castle, and I thought I should take the opportunity to explore more than I had dared to see until then.</t695> <t696>I returned to the room, and taking a lamp, I tried all the doors.</t696> <t697>All were locked, just as I had expected, and the locks were comparatively new.</t697> <t698>Then, I descended the stone steps to the corridor where I had originally entered.</t698>
<t699>I found that I could easily enough remove the bolts and unlock the large chains; but the door was firmly locked and there was no key!</t699> <t700>The key must be in the count's room.</t700> <t701>I have to watch in case his door is unlocked, so that I can get it and escape.</t701> <t702>I continued to make a thorough examination of various staircases and passages and pressed all the doors that were before them.</t702> <t703>One or two rooms near the corridor were open, but there was nothing in them, nothing to see except old furniture, dusty from the wind and moth-eaten.</t703>
<t704>Finally, however, I found a door at the end of the staircase, which, although it seemed to be locked, gave way a little under pressure.</t704><t705>I pushed it harder and discovered that it was not actually locked, but the resistance came from the hinges having sagged a bit and the heavy door resting on the floor.</t705><t706>There was an opportunity that might well be unique, so I made a supreme effort, and after many attempts, I forced it back so that I could enter.</t706><t707>I found myself at that moment in a wing of the castle much further to the right than the rooms I knew and a floor lower.</t707><t708>From the windows, I could see that the series of rooms were situated along the south side of the castle, with the windows of the last room facing both east and south.</t708><t709>On that last side, as well as the previous one, there was a great precipice.</t709><t710>The castle was built on the corner of a large rock, making it almost impregnable on three of its sides, and large windows were placed here where neither wave, nor bow, nor culverin could reach, thus ensuring light and comfort to a position that had to be guarded.</t710><t711>To the west, there was a great valley, and then, rising far away, a large chain of jagged mountains, rising peak to peak, where the bare stone was dotted with rowan trees and brambles, whose roots clung to the crevices, cracks, and fissures of the rocks.</t711><t712>This was evidently the portion of the castle occupied in days past by the ladies, as the furniture had a more comfortable air than I had seen until then.</t712><t713>The windows had no curtains, and the yellow moonlight reflecting in the diamond-shaped hollows allowed even the colors to be distinguished, while it softened the amount of dust that lay over everything and somewhat disguised the effects of time and moths.</t713><t714>My lamp had little effect in the bright moonlight, but I was glad to have it with me, for there was a gloomy solitude in the place that made my heart and nerves tremble.</t714><t715>Despite everything, it was better than living alone in the rooms I had come to hate due to the presence of the count, and after trying a bit to calm my nerves, I felt overwhelmed by a gentle tranquility.</t715><t716>And here I am, sitting at a small oak table where in ancient times some beautiful lady used to take up the pen, with many thoughts and more blushes, to poorly write her love letter, writing in my diary in shorthand everything that has happened since I last closed it.</t716><t717>It is the 19th century, very modern, with all its soul.</t717><t718>And yet, unless my senses deceive me, past centuries had and have peculiar powers of their own, which mere "modernity" cannot kill.</t718>
<t719>Later: morning of May 16.</t719> <t720>God keep me sane, for this is what I am reduced to.</t720> <t721>Safety, and confidence in safety, are things of the past.</t721> <t722>As long as I live here, there is only one thing to wish for, and that is that I do not go mad, if I am not mad already.</t722> <t723>If I am sane, then it is certainly maddening to think that of all the rotten things that crawl in this hateful place, the count is the least dreadful to me; that only in him can I seek safety, even if it is only as long as I can serve his purposes.</t723> <t724>Great God, merciful God!</t724> <t725>Give me calm, for in that direction madness surely awaits me.</t725> <t726>I am beginning to see new lights on certain things that previously perplexed me.</t726> <t727>Until now I did not truly understand what Shakespeare meant when he made Hamlet say:</t727>
<t728>"My notebooks, quickly, my notebooks!</t728>
<t729>it is essential that you write it", etc.,</t729>
<t730>Well now, feeling as if my brain were deranged or as if the blow that will end in its disorder had arrived, I turn to my diary seeking rest.</t730> <t731>The habit of noting everything meticulously should help me to calm down.</t731>
<t732>The mysterious warning from the count scared me; but it scares me more now when I think about it, for in the future it has a terrifying power over me.</t732><t733>I will doubt everything he tells me!</t733><t734>Once I had written in my diary and put the pen and the book back in my pocket, I felt drowsy.</t734><t735>I immediately remembered the count's warning, but it was a pleasure to disobey it.</t735><t736>The feeling of sleep had numbed me, and with it the obstinacy that sleep brings like a stranger.</t736><t737>The soft moonlight calmed me, and the vast expanse outside gave me a sense of freedom that refreshed me.</t737><t738>I made the decision not to return that night to the rooms filled with horrors, but to sleep here where, in the past, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives while their gentle breasts saddened for the men away in bloody wars.</t738><t739>I pulled a wide bed from its place near a corner, so that when I lay down, I could look at the beautiful landscape to the east and south, and without thinking and without minding the dust, I prepared to sleep.</t739><t740>I suppose I must have fallen asleep; I hope so, but I fear it, for everything that followed was so extraordinarily real, so real, that now sitting here in the full light of the morning sun, I cannot think in any way that I was asleep.</t740>
<t741>He was not alone.</t741> <t742>The room was the same, without any change of any kind since I had entered it; in the light of the bright moonlight, I could see my own footprints marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of dust.</t742> <t743>In the moonlight on the opposite side from where I was standing were three young women, or rather three ladies, due to their dress and demeanor.</t743> <t744>The moment I saw them I thought I was dreaming, for, although the moonlight was behind them, they cast no shadow on the floor.</t744> <t745>They approached me and looked at me for a time, and then began to murmur among themselves.</t745> <t746>Two were dark-haired and had high aquiline noses, like the count, and large, piercing black eyes, which almost seemed to be red in contrast to the pale yellow moon.</t746> <t747>The other was blonde; incredibly blonde, with large locks of golden wavy hair and eyes like pale sapphires.</t747> <t748>It seemed to me that somehow I knew her face, and that I knew it in connection with some dark dream, but at the moment I could not remember where or how.</t748> <t749>The three had bright white teeth that gleamed like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips.</t749> <t750>There was something about them that made me feel uneasy; a fear both nostalgic and deadly.</t750> <t751>I felt in my heart a malevolent, burning desire for them to kiss me with those red lips.</t751> <t752>It is not right for me to write this down, in case one day it meets Mina's eyes and causes her pain; but it is the truth.</t752> <t753>They murmured among themselves, and then the three laughed, with a silvery, musical laugh, but as harsh as if its sound had never passed through the softness of human lips.</t753> <t754>It was like the intolerable, tinkling sweetness of water glasses when touched by a skilled hand.</t754> <t755>The blonde woman coquettishly shook her head, and the other two insisted on her.</t755> <t756>One said:</t756>
<t757>–Go ahead!</t757> <t758>You go first and we will follow you; it is your right to start.</t758>
<t759>The other added:</t759>
<t760>–He is young and strong.</t760> <t761>There are kisses for everyone.</t761>
<t762>I remained still, looking under my eyelashes at the agony of a delightful expectation.</t762> <t763>The blonde girl advanced and leaned over me until I could feel the movement of her breath on my face.</t763> <t764>In one sense it was sweet, sweet as honey, and sent, like her voice, the same tingle through the nerves, but with a bitterness beneath the sweetness, an offensive bitterness like that which is smelled in blood.</t764>
<t765>I was afraid to lift my eyelids, but I looked and saw perfectly beneath my lashes.</t765> <t766>The girl knelt and leaned over me, simply rejoicing.</t766> <t767>There was a deliberate voluptuousness that was both wonderful and repulsive, and at the moment she bent her neck, she licked her lips like an animal, so that I could see the moisture shining on her scarlet lips in the moonlight and the red tongue as it struck her white, sharp teeth.</t767> <t768>Her head descended and descended as her lips passed along my mouth and chin, and seemed to settle on my throat.</t768> <t769>Then she paused and I could hear the agitated sound of her tongue licking her teeth and lips, and I could feel the hot breath on my neck.</t769> <t770>Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as happens to one's flesh when the hand that is going to tickle it comes closer and closer.</t770> <t771>I could feel the soft, trembling touch of the lips on the supersensitive skin of my throat, and the strong pressure of two sharp teeth, just touching me and stopping there; I closed my eyes in languid ecstasy and waited; I waited with my heart beating strongly.</t771>
<t772>But at that moment, another sensation ran through me as quickly as lightning.</t772>
<t773>I became aware of the count's presence, and of his existence as if wrapped in a storm of fury.</t773> <t774>As my eyes involuntarily opened, I saw his strong hand gripping the delicate neck of the blonde woman, and with the power of a giant dragging her backward, with his blue eyes transformed by rage, his white teeth clenched in anger, and his pale cheeks flushed with passion.</t774> <t775>But the count!</t775> <t776>I never imagined such an outburst and fury even in the demons of hell.</t776> <t777>His eyes positively emitted flames.</t777> <t778>The red light in them was terrifying, as if behind them were the flames of hell itself.</t778> <t779>His face was deathly pale and its lines were as hard as twisted wires; the thick eyebrows, which met over the nose, now seemed like a lever of white-hot metal.</t779> <t780>With a fierce movement of his hand, he threw the woman away from him, and then gestured towards the others as if he were repelling them; it was the same imperious gesture I had seen used with the wolves.</t780> <t781>In a voice that, though low and almost a whisper, seemed to cut through the air and then resonate throughout the room, he said to them:</t781>
<t782>–How dare any of you touch him?</t782> <t783>How dare you lay your eyes on him when I have forbidden it?</t783> <t784>Back off, I tell you all!</t784> <t785>This man belongs to me!</t785> <t786>Beware of messing with him, or you'll have to deal with me.</t786>
<t787>The blonde girl, with a flirtatious rival laugh, turned to respond to him:</t787>
<t788>–You yourself have never loved; you never love!</t788>
<t789>Upon hearing this, the other women echoed her, and a laughter so gloomy, harsh, and merciless resonated through the room that I almost fainted upon hearing it.</t789> <t790>It seemed like the pleasure of enemies.</t790> <t791>Then the count turned after looking intently at my face, and said in a soft whisper:</t791>
<t792>–Yes, I can also love; you yourselves know it from the past.</t792> <t793>Isn't that so?</t793> <t794>Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him, I will let you kiss him as much as you want.</t794> <t795>Now go, go!</t795> <t796>I must wake him because there is work to be done.</t796>
<t797>–Aren't we going to have anything tonight? – asked one of them, with a suppressed laugh, while pointing to a bag that he had thrown on the ground and that was moving as if there were something alive inside.</t797>
<t798>In response, he made a nodding gesture.</t798> <t799>One of the women jumped forward and opened the bag.</t799> <t800>If my ears did not deceive me, a sigh and a whimper like that of a nursing baby were heard.</t800> <t801>The women surrounded the bag, while I remained petrified with fear.</t801> <t802>But when I looked again, they had already disappeared, and with them the horrifying bag.</t802> <t803>There was no door near them, and it is not possible that they passed over me without me noticing.</t803> <t804>It seemed that they simply vanished into the moonlight rays and exited through the window, as I could see outside the faint shapes of their shadows, a moment before they disappeared completely.</t804>
<t805>Then horror overwhelmed me, and I sank into unconsciousness.</t805>
<t806>IV.– FROM THE DIARY OF JONATHAN HARKER (continued)</t806>
<t807>I woke up in my own bed.</t807> <t808>If it hasn't all been a dream, the count must have carried me here in his arms.</t808> <t809>I tried to explain the event to myself, but I couldn't reach any clear conclusion.</t809> <t810>To be sure, there were certain small pieces of evidence, such as my clothes being folded and arranged in a strange manner.</t810> <t811>My watch was unwound, and I am strictly accustomed to winding it as the last thing before going to bed, and other similar details.</t811> <t812>But all these things are not definitive proof, as they could be evidence that my mind was not in its normal state, and, for one reason or another, the truth is that I had been very excited.</t812> <t813>I have to observe to prove.</t813> <t814>One thing I am glad about: if it was the count who brought me here and undressed me, he must have done it all quickly, for my pockets were intact.</t814> <t815>I am sure this diary would have been a mystery he could not have endured.</t815> <t816>He would have taken it or destroyed it.</t816> <t817>Looking around this room, although it has been so intimidating to me, I see that it is now a kind of sanctuary, for nothing can be more terrible than those monstrous women who were there - they are waiting to suck my blood.</t817>
<t818>May 18.</t818> <t819>I've been down there again to take another look at the room, taking advantage of the daylight, for I must know the truth.</t819> <t820>When I reached the door at the end of the stairs, I found it closed.</t820> <t821>It had been pushed with such force against the frame that part of the wood had splintered.</t821> <t822>I could see that the bolt on the door hadn't been slid, but the door is barred from the inside.</t822> <t823>I'm afraid it wasn't a dream, and I must act according to this assumption.</t823>
<t824>May 19.</t824> <t825>It is certain that I am ensnared.</t825> <t826>Last night the Count asked me, in the gentlest of tones, to write three letters: one saying that my work here was almost finished, and that I would be leaving for home in a few days; another saying that I would be leaving the next morning after writing the letter, and a third stating that I had left the castle and had arrived in Bistritz.</t826> <t827>I would have gladly protested, but I felt that in the current state of affairs it would be madness to have an altercation with the Count, as I am absolutely in his power; and to refuse would have been to arouse his suspicions and excite his anger.</t827> <t828>He knows that I know too much, and that I must not live, for it would be dangerous for him; my only chance lies in prolonging my opportunities.</t828>
<t829>Something might happen that gives me a chance to escape.</t829> <t830>I saw in his eyes some of that anger that manifested when he threw the blonde woman away from him.</t830> <t831>He explained to me that jobs were few and insecure, and that by writing now I would surely give peace of mind to my friends; and he assured me so insistently that he would send the last letters (which would be held in Bistritz until the opportune time in case chance allowed me to prolong my stay) that opposing him would have created new suspicions.</t831> <t832>Therefore, I pretended to agree with his points of view and asked him what date I should put on the letters.</t832> <t833>He calculated for a minute.</t833> <t834>Then, he said:</t834>
<t835>–The first one should be on June 12th, the second on June 19th, and the third on June 29th.</t835>
<t836>Now I know how long I will live.</t836> <t837>God help me!</t837>
<t838>May 28.</t838> <t839>I am offered an opportunity to escape, or at least to send a few words home.</t839> <t840>A band of gypsies has come to the castle and camped in the inner courtyard.</t840> <t841>These are nothing but gypsies; I have certain data about them in my book.</t841> <t842>They are peculiar to this part of the world, although they are allied with ordinary gypsies in all countries.</t842> <t843>There are thousands of them in Hungary and Transylvania, almost always living on the fringes of the law.</t843> <t844>They usually attach themselves to some noble or boyar, and call themselves by his name.</t844> <t845>They are indomitable and without religion, except for superstition, and only speak their own dialects.</t845>
<t846>I will write some letters to my home and try to convince them to put them in the mail.</t846> <t847>I have already spoken to them through the window to start getting to know them.</t847> <t848>They took off their hats and made many bows and gestures, which, however, I could not understand any more than I understand the language they speak...</t848>
<t849>I have written the letters.</t849> <t850>Mina's in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr. Hawkins to get in touch with her.</t850> <t851>To her, I have explained my situation, but without the horrors that I can only suppose.</t851> <t852>If I showed her my heart, it would give her a fright that could even kill her.</t852> <t853>In case the letters could not be dispatched, the count will not be able to know my secret nor the extent of my knowledge…</t853>
<t854>I have delivered the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window, with a gold coin, and made the signs I could, wanting to indicate that they should be put in the mail.</t854> <t855>The man who picked them up pressed them against his heart and bowed, and then put them in his cap.</t855> <t856>I could do no more.</t856> <t857>I stealthily returned to the library and began to read.</t857> <t858>Since the count did not come, I have written here…</t858>
<t859>The count has come.</t859> <t860>He sat next to me and told me with the softest of voices while opening two letters:</t860>
<t861>–The gypsies have given me these, of which, although I do not know where they come from, I will certainly take care of.</t861> <t862>Look! (he must have looked at it before), one is for you, and addressed to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other -and here he saw for the first time the strange symbols upon opening the envelope, and a murky look appeared on his face and his eyes gleamed malevolently-, the other is a vile thing, an insult to friendship and hospitality!</t862> <t863>It is not signed, so it cannot concern us.</t863>
<t864>And then, with great calm, he held the letter and the envelope in the lamp's flame until they were consumed.</t864> <t865>After that, he continued:</t865>
<t866>–The letter for Hawkins, that one, of course, since it is his, I will send it.</t866> <t867>Your letters are sacred to me.</t867> <t868>Forgive me, my friend, for unknowingly breaking the seal.</t868> <t869>Would you like to put it in another envelope?</t869>
<t870>He handed me the letter, and with a courteous bow, he gave me a clean envelope.</t870> <t871>I could only write the address again and silently returned it to him.</t871> <t872>When he left the room, I heard the key turn softly.</t872> <t873>A minute later, I went to it and tried to open it.</t873> <t874>The door was locked.</t874>
<t875>When, one or two hours later, the count entered the room silently, his arrival woke me up, as I had fallen asleep on the sofa.</t875> <t876>He was very courteous and very cheerful in his own way, and seeing that I had slept, he said:</t876>
<t877>–So, my friend, you are tired?</t877> <t878>Go to your bed.</t878> <t879>That is where you can rest most safely.</t879> <t880>I may not have the pleasure of speaking with you tonight, as I have many tasks pending; but I wish you a peaceful sleep.</t880>
<t881>I went to my room and lay down on the bed; strange to say, I slept without dreaming.</t881> <t882>Despair has its own calms.</t882>
<t883>May 31.</t883> <t884>This morning, when I woke up, I thought I would take some papers and envelopes out of my briefcase and put them in my pocket, so that I could write in case I found an opportunity; but once again a surprise awaited me.</t884> <t885>A big surprise!</t885>
<t886>I couldn't find even a piece of paper.</t886> <t887>Everything had disappeared, along with my notes, my railway and travel-related notes, my credentials.</t887> <t888>In fact, everything that could be useful to me once I left the castle.</t888> <t889>I sat down and reflected for a few moments; then an idea occurred to me and I went to look for my light suitcase, and to the wardrobe where I had placed my suits.</t889>
<t890>The suit with which I had made the journey had disappeared, as well as my coat and my blanket; I could not find any trace of them anywhere.</t890> <t891>This seemed to me a new villainy...</t891>
<t892>June 17.</t892> <t893>This morning, while I was sitting on the edge of my bed racking my brains, I heard outside the cracking of whips and the clattering of horses' hooves along the stone path beyond the courtyard.</t893> <t894>With joy, I quickly went to the window and saw two large carriages entering the courtyard, each drawn by eight spirited steeds, and at the head of each, a pair of Slovaks wearing wide-brimmed hats, belts studded with large nails, dirty sheepskins, and tall boots.</t894> <t895>They also carried their long whips in their hands.</t895> <t896>I ran to the door, trying to go down to catch them in the main corridor, which I thought must be open waiting for them.</t896> <t897>A new surprise awaited me: my door was bolted from the outside.</t897>
<t898>Then, I ran to the window and shouted at them.</t898> <t899>They looked at me stupidly and pointed towards me, but at that moment the "ataman" of the gypsies came out, and seeing that they were pointing towards my window, he said something, which made them burst into laughter.</t899> <t900>After that, none of my efforts, no pitiful or agonizing scream moved them to look at me again.</t900> <t901>Resolutely, they turned their backs on me and walked away.</t901> <t902>The carts contained large square boxes with thick rope handles; they were evidently empty due to the ease with which the Slovaks unloaded them, and the resonance as they dragged them across the ground.</t902> <t903>When all were unloaded and piled up in a corner of the courtyard, the Slovaks received some money from the gypsy, and after spitting on it for luck, each went to their respective carriage, walking lazily.</t903> <t904>Shortly after, I heard the crack of their whips dying away in the distance.</t904>
<t905>June 24, before dawn.</t905> <t906>Last night the Count left me very early and locked himself in his own room.</t906> <t907>As soon as I dared, I ran up the spiral staircase and looked out the window facing south.</t907> <t908>I thought I should keep an eye on the Count, for something was happening.</t908> <t909>The gypsies are camped somewhere in the castle and are doing some work for him.</t909> <t910>I know this because from time to time I hear in the distance the muffled sound of picks and shovels, and whatever it is, it must be the completion of some horrendous villainy.</t910>
<t911>I had been looking out the window for a little less than half an hour when I saw something coming out of the count's window.</t911> <t912>I stepped back and watched carefully, and I saw the man come out.</t912> <t913>It was a surprise to me to discover that he had put on the suit I had worn during my journey to this place, and that the terrible bag I had seen the women take away was hanging from his shoulder.</t913> <t914>There could be no doubt about his intentions, and moreover, with my attire!</t914> <t915>This is, then, his new diabolical trick: he will allow others to see me, so that on one hand there will be evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own letters, and on the other hand, any evil he might do will be attributed by the local people to me.</t915>
<t916>It infuriates me to think that this could continue like this, and meanwhile I remain locked up here, like a true prisoner, but without that protection of the law that is even the right and consolation of criminals.</t916>
<t917>I thought I could observe the count's return, and for a long time I sat tenaciously by the window.</t917> <t918>Then I began to notice that there were small spots of pristine beauty floating in the moonlight.</t918> <t919>They were like the tiniest particles of dust, swirling in whirlwinds and clustering together in shapes similar to nebulae.</t919> <t920>I watched them with a feeling of tranquility, and a kind of calm invaded my entire being.</t920> <t921>I reclined in search of a more comfortable position, so that I could more fully enjoy that ethereal spectacle.</t921>
<t922>Something startled me; a faint, melancholic howl of dogs somewhere far away in the valley down below that was hidden from my eyes.</t922> <t923>It sounded louder in my ears, and the floating dust particles took on new shapes, as if they were dancing to the rhythm of a moonlit dance.</t923> <t924>I felt desperate efforts to awaken to some call of my instincts; no, rather it was my own soul that was struggling and my half-asleep sensitivity trying to respond to the call.</t924> <t925>They were hypnotizing me!</t925> <t926>The dust danced more rapidly.</t926> <t927>The moonbeams seemed to tremble as they passed near me towards the darkness behind me.</t927> <t928>They joined together until they seemed to take on the faint forms of ghosts.</t928> <t929>And then I woke up completely and in full possession of my senses, and I started running, screaming and fleeing from the place.</t929> <t930>The ghostly forms that were gradually materializing from the moonbeams were those of the three ghostly women to whom I was condemned.</t930> <t931>I fled, and felt somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp burned brightly.</t931>
<t932>After a few hours had passed, I heard something moving in the count's room; something like a sharp moan quickly stifled.</t932> <t933>And then everything fell silent, into a deep and horrible silence that made me shudder.</t933> <t934>With my heart pounding wildly, I pressed the door; but I found myself locked in my prison, and I could do nothing.</t934> <t935>I sat down and simply started to cry.</t935>
<t936>While I was sitting, I heard a noise outside, in the yard: the agonizing scream of a woman.</t936> <t937>I ran to the window and, throwing it open, I peered through the bars.</t937> <t938>Indeed, out there was a woman with disheveled hair, clutching her hands over her heart as if she were the victim of great misfortune.</t938> <t939>She was leaning against the corner of the hallway.</t939> <t940>When she saw my face in the window, she lunged forward and shouted in a voice laden with threat:</t940>
<t941>–Monster, give me back my son!</t941>
<t942>He fell to his knees, and raising his arms, he shouted some words in tones that tormented my heart.</t942> <t943>Then he tore his hair and beat his chest, giving in to all the violences of extravagant emotion.</t943> <t944>Finally, he ran, and although I could not see him, I could hear him pounding on the door with his bare hands.</t944>
<t945>Somewhere quite high above me, probably in the tower, I heard the Count's voice calling in his hard and metallic whisper.</t945> <t946>His call seemed to be answered from afar and all around by the howling of wolves.</t946> <t947>Before many minutes had passed, a pack of them entered, like an overflowing dam, through the wide entrance of the courtyard.</t947>
<t948>No screams were heard from the woman, and the howls of the wolves lasted only a short time.</t948> <t949>After a little while, they withdrew one by one, still licking their snouts.</t949>
<t950>I did not feel pity for the woman, for I knew what had happened to her son, and it was better that she was dead.</t950> <t951>What will I do? What can I do?</t951> <t952>How can I escape from this horrifying night of terror and fear?</t952>
<t953>June 25, in the morning.</t953> <t954>No one knows until they have suffered the horrors of the night, how sweet and pleasant the arrival of the morning can be for their heart and eyes.</t954> <t955>When the sun rose this morning high enough to light up the top of the gate opposite my window, the dark place it illuminated seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had been there.</t955> <t956>My fear evaporated like a vaporous garment dissolving with the heat.</t956> <t957>I must take action in some way while the courage of the day lasts.</t957> <t958>Last night one of my already dated letters was put in the mail, the first of that fatal series that is to erase all trace of my existence on earth.</t958>
<t959>I must not think about it.</t959> <t960>I must act!</t960>
<t961>It has always been during the night when I have been disturbed or threatened; where I have found myself in some way or another in danger or afraid.</t961> <t962>I still have not seen the count in the daylight.</t962> <t963>Is it possible that he sleeps when others are awake, and that he is awake when everyone sleeps?</t963> <t964>If only I could get to his room!</t964> <t965>But there is no possible way.</t965> <t966>The door is always locked; there is no way for me to reach him.</t966>
<t967>I lie.</t967> <t968>There is a way, if one dares to take it.</t968> <t969>Where his body has passed, why can't another body pass?</t969> <t970>I myself have seen him crawl from his window.</t970> <t971>Why can't I imitate him, and crawl to enter through his window?</t971> <t972>The odds are very slim, but necessity forces me to take all risks.</t972>
<t973>I will take the risk.</t973> <t974>The worst that can happen to me is death; but the death of a man is not the death of a calf, and the dark "beyond" might still offer me opportunities.</t974> <t975>May God help me in my endeavor!</t975> <t976>Goodbye, Mina, if I fail; goodbye, my faithful friend and second father; goodbye, everything, and as the last thing, goodbye Mina!</t976>
<t977>Same day, later.</t977> <t978>I made the effort, and with God's help I returned safely to this room.</t978> <t979>I must write down every detail in order.</t979> <t980>I went, while my courage was still fresh, directly to the window on the south side, and went out from there.</t980> <t981>The stones are large and roughly cut, and over time the mortar has worn away.</t981> <t982>I took off my boots and ventured like a desperate man.</t982> <t983>I looked down once, as if to make sure that a sudden glance at the horrifying depth would not overwhelm me, but after that I kept my eyes looking forward.</t983> <t984>I know the count's window quite well, and I headed towards it as best as I could, taking advantage of the opportunities that presented themselves.</t984> <t985>I did not feel dizzy, I suppose I was too nervous, and the time it took me to reach the windowsill seemed ridiculously short.</t985> <t986>In a flash, I found myself trying to lift the sash window.</t986> <t987>However, when I slid feet first through the window, I was seized by a terrible agitation.</t987> <t988>Then I looked everywhere for the count, but, with surprise and joy, I made a discovery: the room was empty!</t988>
<t989>It was barely furnished with strange things that seemed never to have been used; the furniture was somewhat similar in style to those in the rooms situated to the south, and they were covered in dust.</t989> <t990>I looked for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I couldn't find it anywhere.</t990> <t991>The only thing I found was a large pile of gold in a corner, gold of all kinds, in Roman and British coins, Austrian and Hungarian, Greek and Turkish.</t991> <t992>The coins were covered with a film of dust, as if they had lain on the ground for a long time.</t992> <t993>None of the ones I noticed were less than three hundred years old.</t993> <t994>There were also chains and ornaments, some jeweled, but all old and faded.</t994>
<t995>In one corner of the room, there was a heavy door.</t995> <t996>I pushed it, for since I could not find the key to the room or the key to the outer door, which was the main objective of my search, I had to make other investigations, or all my efforts would be in vain.</t996> <t997>The door I pushed was open, and it led me through a stone passageway to a very steep spiral staircase.</t997> <t998>I descended, taking great care where I stepped, for the steps were dark, being lit only by the loopholes in the heavy masonry.</t998> <t999>At the bottom, there was a dark passageway, similar to a tunnel, through which a deadly and sickly smell could be perceived: the smell of freshly turned earth.</t999> <t1000>As I advanced through the passageway, the smell became more intense and closer.</t1000> <t1001>Finally, I opened a heavy door that was ajar and found myself in an old and ruined chapel, which had evidently been used as a cemetery.</t1001> <t1002>The ceiling was cracked, and in places, there were steps leading to vaults, but the ground had been recently dug up, and the earth had been placed in large wooden boxes, evidently the ones the Slovaks had transported.</t1002> <t1003>There was no one around, and I made a thorough search of every inch of the ground.</t1003> <t1004>I even went down into the vaults, where the dim light struggled with the shadows, though in doing so, my soul was filled with the most terrible horror.</t1004> <t1005>I went to two of them, but saw nothing but fragments of old coffins and piles of dust; however, in the third, I made a discovery.</t1005>
<t1006>There, in one of the large boxes, of which there were fifty in total, on a pile of freshly dug earth, lay the count!</t1006> <t1007>He was either dead or asleep; I couldn't tell for sure, for his eyes were open and fixed, but with the glassiness of death, and his cheeks had the warmth of life despite their paleness; moreover, his lips were redder than ever.</t1007> <t1008>But there was no sign of movement, no pulse, no breath, no heartbeat.</t1008> <t1009>I leaned over him and tried to find some sign of life, but in vain.</t1009> <t1010>He could not have been lying there for long, for the smell of earth would have dissipated in a few hours.</t1010> <t1011>Next to the box was its lid, pierced with holes here and there.</t1011> <t1012>I thought he might have the keys with him, but as I was about to search him, I saw his dead eyes, and in them, despite being dead, a look of such hatred, though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled the place, and leaving the count's room through the window, I slid down the castle wall again.</t1012> <t1013>Upon reaching my room again, I threw myself panting onto the bed and tried to think…</t1013>
<t1014>June 29.</t1014> <t1015>Today is the date of my last letter, and the count has taken the necessary steps to prove it is authentic, for I have again seen him leave the castle through the same window and wearing my clothes.</t1015> <t1016>Seeing him slide through the window, like a lizard, I felt the urge to have a rifle or some lethal weapon to destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wielded solely by the hand of a man can have any effect on him.</t1016> <t1017>I did not dare to wait for his return, as I feared seeing his wicked sisters.</t1017> <t1018>I returned to the library and read until I fell asleep.</t1018>
<t1019>I was awakened by the count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can look, while he said to me:</t1019>
<t1020>–Tomorrow, my friend, we must depart.</t1020> <t1021>You will return to your beautiful England, I to a job that may have such an end that we may never meet again.</t1021> <t1022>Your letter home has been dispatched; tomorrow I will not be here, but everything will be ready for your journey.</t1022> <t1023>In the morning the gypsies come, who have some tasks of their own, and the Slovaks also come.</t1023> <t1024>When they have left, my carriage will come to take you and will bring you to the Borgo Pass, to meet there with the coach that goes from Bukovina to Bistritz.</t1024> <t1025>But I hope that we will meet again in Dracula's castle.</t1025>
<t1026>I suspected his words, and decided to test his sincerity.</t1026> <t1027>Sincerity!</t1027> <t1028>It seems like a desecration of the word in connection with a monster like this, so I spoke to him bluntly:</t1028>
<t1029>–Why can't I leave tonight?</t1029>
<t1030>–Because, dear sir, my coachman and the horses have gone on a mission.</t1030>
<t1031>–But I would gladly walk.</t1031> <t1032>What I want is to get out of here as soon as possible.</t1032>
<t1033>He smiled, with a smile so soft, delicate, and devilish, that I immediately knew there was some trick behind his kindness; he said:</t1033>
<t1034>–And your luggage?</t1034>
<t1035>–I don't care.</t1035> <t1036>I can send someone to pick it up later.</t1036>
<t1037>The count stood up and said, with a sweet courtesy that made me rub my eyes, as it seemed real:</t1037>
<t1038>–You English have a saying that is dear to my heart, for its spirit is the same that governs our boyars: "Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest."</t1038> <t1039>Come with me, my dear young friend.</t1039> <t1040>Not one more hour will you stay in my house against your wishes, though it saddens me that you are leaving, and that you wish it so suddenly.</t1040> <t1041>Come.</t1041>
<t1042>With majestic seriousness, he, with the lamp, preceded me up the stairs and along the corridor.</t1042> <t1043>Suddenly, he stopped.</t1043>
<t1044>–Listen!</t1044>
<t1045>The howling of the wolves reached us from nearby.</t1045> <t1046>It was almost as if the howls arose when he raised his hand, similar to how music emerges from a great orchestra when the conductor's baton is lifted.</t1046> <t1047>After a moment of pause, he continued, in his majestic manner, towards the door.</t1047> <t1048>He slid the enormous bolts, unlocked the heavy chains, and began to open it.</t1048>
<t1049>To my incredible astonishment, I saw that it was unlocked.</t1049> <t1050>Suspiciously, I looked all around me, but I couldn't find any kind of key.</t1050>
<t1051>As the door began to open, the howls of the wolves increased in intensity and fury: through the opening of the door, their red jaws with sharp teeth and the claws of their heavy paws could be seen as they leaped.</t1051> <t1052>I realized that it was useless to fight against the count at that moment.</t1052> <t1053>Nothing could be done with him having such allies under his command.</t1053> <t1054>However, the door continued to open slowly, and now it was only the count's body that was blocking the way.</t1054>
<t1055>Suddenly, the idea came to me that perhaps this was the moment and the means of my condemnation; I was going to be handed over to the wolves, and at my own instigation.</t1055> <t1056>There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea, sufficiently grand for the count, and as a last chance, I shouted:</t1056>
<t1057>–Close the door!</t1057> <t1058>I'll wait until tomorrow!</t1058>
<t1059>I covered my face with my hands to hide the tears of bitter disappointment.</t1059>
<t1060>With a movement of his powerful arm, the count slammed the door shut, and the large bolts clanged and echoed through the corridor as they fell back into place.</t1060> <t1061>We returned to the library in silence, and after one or two minutes I went to my room.</t1061> <t1062>The last thing I saw of Count Dracula was his terrible gaze, with a red light of triumph in his eyes and a smile that Judas, in hell, might be proud of.</t1062>
<t1063>When I was in my room and about to go to bed, I thought I heard murmurs on the other side of my door.</t1063> <t1064>I approached it silently and listened.</t1064> <t1065>Unless my ears deceived me, I heard the count's voice:</t1065>
<t1066>–Back, back, to your place!</t1066> <t1067>Your time has not yet come.</t1067> <t1068>Wait! Be patient!</t1068> <t1069>This night is mine.</t1069> <t1070>Tomorrow night is yours.</t1070>
<t1071>There was a slight and sweet murmur of laughter, and in a fit of rage, I flung the door open and saw those three terrible women outside, licking their lips.</t1071> <t1072>When I appeared, they all joined in a horrible laugh and ran away.</t1072>
<t1073>I returned to my room and fell to my knees.</t1073> <t1074>Is the end then so near? Tomorrow! Tomorrow!</t1074> <t1075>Lord, help me, and those who love me!</t1075>
<t1076>June 30th, in the morning.</t1076> <t1077>These may be the last words I ever write in this journal.</t1077> <t1078>I slept until shortly before dawn, and upon waking, I fell to my knees, for I am determined that if death comes, it will find me prepared.</t1078>
<t1079>Finally, I felt that subtle change in the air and knew that the morning had arrived.</t1079>
<t1080>Then I heard the welcoming crow of the rooster and felt that I was safe.</t1080> <t1081>With a joyful heart, I opened the door and ran down the stairs, towards the corridor.</t1081> <t1082>I had seen that the door was unlocked, and now freedom was before me.</t1082> <t1083>With hands trembling with anxiety, I unlatched the chains and slid back the bolts.</t1083>
<t1084>But the door did not move.</t1084> <t1085>Desperation took hold of me.</t1085> <t1086>I repeatedly pulled and pushed the door until, despite being very heavy, it shook on its hinges.</t1086> <t1087>I could see that the latch was fastened.</t1087> <t1088>They had locked it after I left the count.</t1088>
<t1089>Then a wild desire to obtain the key at any cost seized me, and right there I resolved to climb the wall and reach the count's room once again.</t1089>
<t1090>He could kill me, but death now seemed the least of all evils.</t1090> <t1091>Without wasting time, I ran to the east window and slid down the wall, as before, to the count's room.</t1091> <t1092>It was empty, but that was what I expected.</t1092> <t1093>I couldn't see the key anywhere, but the pile of gold remained in its place.</t1093> <t1094>I went through the door in the corner and descended the spiral staircase and along the dark passageway to the old chapel.</t1094> <t1095>I already knew very well where to find the monster I was looking for.</t1095>
<t1096>The large box was in the same place, leaning against the wall, but the lid had been put on, with the nails ready in place to be driven in, although this had not yet been done.</t1096> <t1097>I knew I had to get to the body to look for the key, so I lifted the lid and leaned it against the wall; and then I saw something that filled my soul with terror.</t1097> <t1098>There lay the count, but looking as young as if he had been rejuvenated for his white hair and mustache had changed to a dark gray; the cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed a ruby red beneath them; the mouth was redder than ever; on his lips were drops of fresh blood that fell in trickles from the corners of his mouth and ran down his chin and neck.</t1098> <t1099>Even his eyes, deep and sparkling, seemed to be sunken in the midst of the swollen flesh, for the eyelids and the bags beneath them were bloated.</t1099> <t1100>It seemed as if the horrid creature was simply sated with blood.</t1100>
<t1101>It lay like a horrid leech, exhausted from gluttony.</t1101> <t1102>I trembled as I bent down to touch it, and every sense in me rebelled at the contact; but I had to rummage through its pockets, or I was lost.</t1102> <t1103>The next night I could see my own body serving as a feast in a similar manner for those horrid three.</t1103> <t1104>I fell upon the body, but I could not find any signs of the key.</t1104> <t1105>Then I stopped and looked at the count.</t1105>
<t1106>There was a mocking smile on his swollen face that seemed to drive me mad.</t1106> <t1107>That was the being I was helping to move to London, where, perhaps, in the centuries to come, he could quench his thirst for blood among its prolific millions, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to prey upon the defenseless.</t1107> <t1108>The mere thought of it drove me mad.</t1108> <t1109>I felt a terrible desire to save the world from such a monster.</t1109> <t1110>I had no lethal weapon at hand, but I took the shovel the men had been using to fill the boxes and, raising it high, struck the hateful face with the edge.</t1110> <t1111>But as I did so, the head turned and the eyes fell upon me with all their horrid basilisk brilliance.</t1111> <t1112>His gaze seemed to paralyze me and the shovel twisted in my hand, missing the face, making only a deep cut on the forehead.</t1112> <t1113>The shovel fell from my hands onto the box, and as I pulled it, the edge of the blade caught on the edge of the lid, which fell back over the crate, hiding the horrid image from my sight.</t1113> <t1114>The last glimpse I had was of the swollen face, stained with blood and fixed, with a grimace of malice that would have been very fitting in the deepest of hells.</t1114>
<t1115>I thought and thought about what my next move would be, but it seemed like my brain was on fire, and I waited with a desperation that I felt growing by the moment.</t1115>
<t1116>While I was waiting, I heard in the distance a gypsy song sung by cheerful voices that were approaching, and through the song, the sound of heavy wheels and cracking whips; the gypsies and Slovaks whom the count had spoken of were arriving.</t1116> <t1117>Taking one last look at the box containing the vile body, I ran out of that place and reached the count's room, determined to leave suddenly the moment the door opened.</t1117> <t1118>With attentive ears, I listened, and heard below the creak of the key in the great lock and the sound of the heavy door opening.</t1118> <t1119>There must have been other means of entry, or someone had a key to one of the locked doors.</t1119> <t1120>Then the sound of many feet walking reached me, dying away in some passage that sent back a resounding echo.</t1120> <t1121>I wanted to run back to the vault, where I might find the new entrance; but at that moment a violent gust of wind seemed to penetrate the room, and the door leading to the spiral staircase slammed shut with such force that it raised the dust from the lintels.</t1121> <t1122>When I ran to open the door, I found it was tightly shut.</t1122> <t1123>Once again, I was a prisoner, and the web of my fate seemed to be closing in ever tighter.</t1123>
<t1124>While I write this, in the passageway below me, the sound of many feet stepping and the noise of weights being abruptly deposited can be heard, undoubtedly the boxes with their cargo of earth.</t1124> <t1125>The sound of a hammer can also be heard; it is the count's box being sealed.</t1125> <t1126>Now I can hear again the heavy feet advancing along the corridor, with many other useless feet following behind them.</t1126>
<t1127>The door closes, the chains clash against each other as they are placed; the squeak of the key in the lock is heard; I can even hear when the key is removed; then another door opens and closes; I hear the creaks of the lock and the bolts.</t1127>
<t1128>Listen!</t1128> <t1129>In the courtyard and along the rocky path go the heavy wheels, the crack of the whips, and the choruses of the gypsies as they disappear into the distance.</t1129> <t1130>I am alone in the castle with those horrible women.</t1130>
<t1131>Phew!</t1131> <t1132>Mina is a woman, and she has nothing in common with them.</t1132> <t1133>These are she-devils from hell.</t1133>
<t1134>I will not stay here alone with them; I will try to climb the castle wall farther than I have attempted so far.</t1134> <t1135>I will take some gold with me, as I might need it later.</t1135> <t1136>Perhaps I will find some way to escape this horrendous place.</t1136>
<t1137>And then, quickly home!</t1137> <t1138>Quickly to the fastest and nearest of the trains!</t1138> <t1139>Away from this cursed place, from this cursed land where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet!</t1139>
<t1140>At least the goodness of God is better than that of these monsters, and the precipice is steep and high.</t1140> <t1141>At its feet, a man can sleep like a man.</t1141> <t1142>Goodbye, everything! Goodbye, Mina!</t1142>

<t1145>May 9</t1145>
<t1146>“My very dear Lucy”</t1146>
<t1147>“Forgive my delay in writing to you, but I have been truly overwhelmed with work.</t1147> <t1148>The life of an assistant school principal is distressing.</t1148> <t1149>I am dying to be with you, and by the seaside, where we can talk freely and build our castles in the air.</t1149> <t1150>Lately, I have been working a lot, because I want to maintain Jonathan's level of studies, and I have been practicing shorthand very actively.</t1150> <t1151>When we get married, I will be very useful to Jonathan, and if I can write well in shorthand, I will be able to transcribe everything he says and then type it up neatly for him, which I am also practicing very hard.</t1151> <t1152>He and I sometimes write to each other in shorthand, and he is keeping a stenographic diary of his travels abroad.</t1152> <t1153>When I am with you, I will also keep a diary in the same way.</t1153>
<t1154>I don't mean one of those diaries that are written hastily on the corner of a couple of pages when there's time on Sundays, but a diary in which I can write whenever I feel inclined to do so.</t1154> <t1155>I suppose it won't be of much interest to other people, but it isn't intended for them.</t1155> <t1156>Someday I will show it to Jonathan, in case there is something in it that deserves to be shared, but truly it is an exercise book.</t1156> <t1157>I will try to do what I have seen women journalists do: interviews, descriptions, trying to remember conversations as best as possible.</t1157> <t1158>I have been told that, with a little practice, one can remember everything that has happened or everything one has heard during the day.</t1158> <t1159>However, we shall see.</t1159> <t1160>I will tell you about my little plans when we see each other.</t1160> <t1161>I have just received a few lines from Jonathan from Transylvania.</t1161> <t1162>He is well and will return in about a week.</t1162>
<t1163>I am very anxious to hear all your news.</t1163> <t1164>It must be so nice to visit foreign countries!</t1164> <t1165>Sometimes I wonder if we, I mean Jonathan and I, will ever see them together.</t1165> <t1166>The ten o'clock bell just rang.</t1166> <t1167>Goodbye.</t1167>
<t1168>"He loves you,</t1168>

<t1170>"Tell me all the news when you write to me.</t1170> <t1171>You haven't told me anything for a long time.</t1171> <t1172>I've heard rumors, especially about a tall, handsome man with curly hair.</t1172> <t1173>(???)"</t1173>

<t1176>Wednesday</t1176>
<t1177>"My dearest Mina:</t1177>
<t1178>"I must say that you value me very unfairly by saying that I am bad at correspondence.</t1178> <t1179>I have written to you twice since we parted, and your last letter was only the second.</t1179> <t1180>Besides, I have nothing to tell you.</t1180> <t1181>There is really nothing that might interest you.</t1181> <t1182>The city is very beautiful these days, and we often go to the art galleries and to walk or ride horses in the park.</t1182> <t1183>As for the tall man with curly hair, I suppose he was the one who was with me at the last popular concert.</t1183> <t1184>Evidently, someone has been telling tall tales.</t1184> <t1185>It was Mr. Holmwood.</t1185> <t1186>He often comes to see us, and he gets along very well with mom; they have many things in common to talk about.</t1186> <t1187>Some time ago we met a man who would be suitable for you if you were not already engaged to Jonathan.</t1187> <t1188>He is an excellent match; handsome, rich, and from a good family.</t1188> <t1189>He is a doctor and very smart.</t1189> <t1190>Imagine that!</t1190> <t1191>He is twenty-nine years old and owns a huge lunatic asylum, all under his direction.</t1191> <t1192>Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me and he came here to see us, and now he visits us often.</t1192> <t1193>I think he is one of the most resolute men I have ever seen, and yet, the calmest.</t1193> <t1194>He seems absolutely unperturbable.</t1194> <t1195>I can imagine the magnificent power he has over his patients.</t1195> <t1196>He has the curious habit of looking one directly in the face as if trying to read one's thoughts.</t1196> <t1197>He tries to do this many times with me, but I pride myself that this time he has met a nut too hard to crack.</t1197> <t1198>I know that from my mirror.</t1198> <t1199>Have you never tried to read your own face?</t1199> <t1200>I have, and I can tell you it is not a bad study, and it gives you more work than you can imagine if you have never tried it yet.</t1200> <t1201>He says that I provide him with a curious psychological case, and I humbly believe that is so.</t1201> <t1202>As you know, I do not take enough interest in dresses to be able to describe the new fashions.</t1202> <t1203>The subject of dresses is boring.</t1203> <t1204>That is slang again, but don't mind it; Arthur says that every day.</t1204> <t1205>Well, that is all.</t1205> <t1206>Mina, we have told each other all our secrets since we were girls; we have slept together and eaten together, we have laughed and cried together; and now, although I have already spoken, I would like to speak more.</t1206> <t1207>Oh, Mina!</t1207> <t1208>Could you not guess?</t1208> <t1209>I love him; I love him!</t1209> <t1210>Well, that makes me feel good.</t1210> <t1211>I wish I were with you, dear, sitting in confidence by the fire, just as we used to; then I would try to tell you how I feel; I don't even know how I am writing this to you.</t1211> <t1212>I am afraid to stop, because I might tear up the letter, and I don't want to stop, because I want to tell you everything.</t1212> <t1213>Send me news of you immediately, and tell me everything you think about this.</t1213> <t1214>Mina, I must finish.</t1214> <t1215>Good night.</t1215>
<t1216>Bless me in your prayers, and, Mina, pray for my happiness.</t1216>

<t1222>Letter from Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray</t1222>
<t1223>May 24</t1223>
<t1224>"My dearest Mina:</t1224>
<t1225>"Thank you, thank you, and thank you again for your sweet letter.</t1225> <t1226>It was so nice to feel your sympathy!</t1226>
<t1227>"My dear, it never rains but it pours.</t1227> <t1228>How true the old proverbs are!</t1228> <t1229>Here I am, about to turn twenty in September, and I had never received a proposal until today; not a real one, and today I've had three.</t1229> <t1230>Imagine that! THREE proposals in one day!</t1230> <t1231>Isn't it terrible?</t1231> <t1232>I feel sad, truly and deeply sad, for two of the three suitors.</t1232> <t1233>Oh, Mina, I am so happy that I don't know what to do with myself!</t1233> <t1234>And three marriage proposals!</t1234>
<t1235>But, for God's sake, don't tell any of the girls, or they would immediately start having all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves offended and slighted if they didn't receive at least six on their first day at home; some girls are so vain!</t1235> <t1236>You and I, dear Mina, who are engaged and soon to settle down soberly as old married women, can scorn vanity.</t1236>
<t1237>Well, I must talk to you about the three, but you must keep it a secret, without telling anyone, except, of course, Jonathan.</t1237> <t1238>You will tell him, because I, if I were in your place, would surely tell Arthur.</t1238> <t1239>A woman must tell her husband everything, don't you think, dear? And I must be fair.</t1239> <t1240>Men like women, of course their wives, to be as fair as they are; and women, I fear, are not always as fair as they should be.</t1240> <t1241>Well, dear, number one arrived just before lunch.</t1241> <t1242>I've already told you about him: Doctor John Seward, the man from the lunatic asylum, with a strong chin and a good forehead.</t1242> <t1243>Outwardly he seemed very cold, but he was nervous nonetheless.</t1243> <t1244>He was evidently educating himself about all sorts of little things, and he remembered them; but he almost managed to sit on his silk hat, which men generally don't do when they are calm, and then, trying to appear calm, he was playing with a lancet in a way that almost made me scream.</t1244> <t1245>He spoke to me, Mina, very directly.</t1245> <t1246>He told me how he loved me, despite knowing me for such a short time, and what his life would be like if he had me to help and cheer him.</t1246> <t1247>He was about to tell me how unhappy he would be if I didn't love him too, but when he saw me crying, he said he was a brute and didn't want to add more sorrows to the present ones.</t1247> <t1248>Then he paused and asked me if I could come to love him in time; and when I shook my head negatively, his hands trembled, and then, with some uncertainty, he asked me if I already cared for someone else.</t1248> <t1249>He told me everything in a very nice way, claiming he didn't want to force me to confess, but that he wanted to know, because if a woman's heart was free, a man could have hopes.</t1249> <t1250>And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was already someone.</t1250> <t1251>I only told him that, and he stood up, looking very strong and very serious when he took my two hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever needed a friend, I should count him among the best.</t1251> <t1252>Oh, my dear Mina, I can't help crying: you must forgive that this letter goes stained.</t1252> <t1253>It's very nice to be proposed to and all those things, but it's not at all a happy thing when you see a poor fellow, whom you know loves you honestly, walk away looking all heartbroken, and knowing that, no matter what he might say at those moments, you are walking away forever from his life.</t1253> <t1254>My dear, for the moment I must stop here, I feel so bad, although I am so happy!</t1254>
<t1255>Night, "Arthur just left, and I feel much more cheerful than when I stopped writing to you, so I can continue telling you what happened during the day.</t1255> <t1256>Well, dear, number two arrived after lunch.</t1256> <t1257>He is such a good guy, an American from Texas, and he looks so young and fresh that it seems impossible he has been to so many places and had so many adventures.</t1257> <t1258>I sympathize with poor Desdemona when such a dangerous current was whispered into her ear, even by a black man.</t1258> <t1259>I suppose we women are so cowardly that we think a man is going to save us from our fears, and we marry him.</t1259> <t1260>I already know what I would do if I were a man and wanted a girl to love me.</t1260> <t1261>No, I don't know, because Mr. Morris always told us his adventures, and Arthur never did, and yet, Dear, I don't know how I am getting ahead of myself.</t1261> <t1262>Mr. Quincey P. Morris found me alone.</t1262> <t1263>It seems that a man always finds a girl alone.</t1263> <t1264>No, not always, because Arthur tried on two different occasions, and I helped him as much as I could; I'm not ashamed to say it now.</t1264> <t1265>I must tell you first of all, that Mr. Morris doesn't always speak slang; that is, he doesn't speak it in front of strangers, because he is really well-educated and has very fine manners, but he realized that it amused me a lot to hear him speak American slang, and whenever I was present, and there was no one else who might be bothered by it, he would say funny things.</t1265> <t1266>I fear, dear, that he has to make it all up, because it fits perfectly with anything else he has to say.</t1266> <t1267>But this is a thing inherent to slang.</t1267> <t1268>I myself don't know if I will ever come to speak slang; I don't know if Arthur likes it, since I have never heard him use it.</t1268> <t1269>Well, Mr. Morris sat next to me and was as cheerful and happy as he could be, but nonetheless, I could see that he was very nervous.</t1269> <t1270>He took one of my hands between his with almost reverence, and said, in the most affectionate way:</t1270>
<t1271>"Miss Lucy, I know I'm not good enough to tie the laces of your little shoes, but I suppose if you wait until you find a man who is, you'll end up joining those seven maidens of the lamps when you get bored.</t1271> <t1272>Why don't you hitch yourself to my side and we'll go the long way together, driving with double harnesses?</t1272>
<t1273>"Well, he was in such a good mood and so cheerful that it didn't seem half as difficult to refuse him as it had been with poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as lightly as I could, that I didn't know anything about how to get hitched, and that I wasn't mature enough yet to wear a harness.</t1273> <t1274>Then he said that he had spoken very lightly, and that he hoped if he had made a mistake in doing so, on such a serious and momentous occasion for him, that I would forgive him.</t1274> <t1275>He was truly very serious when he said this, and I couldn't help but feel a bit serious too (I know, Mina, you'll think I'm a horrible flirt), though I also couldn't help feeling a kind of triumphant joy at being number two in one day.</t1275> <t1276>And then, dear, before I could say a word, he began to pour out a torrent of loving words, laying his own heart and soul at my feet.</t1276> <t1277>He seemed so sincere about everything he said that I will never again think that a man must always be playful and never serious, just because he sometimes behaves cheerfully.</t1277> <t1278>I suppose he saw something in my face that put him on guard, for he suddenly stopped, and said, with a kind of masculine fervor that would have made me love him if I had been free, if my heart didn't already belong to someone else, the following:</t1278>
<t1279>"Lucy, you are a girl with a sincere heart; I know that.</t1279> <t1280>I wouldn't be here talking to you as I am now if I didn't consider you to have a pure soul, deep down to the core of your being.</t1280> <t1281>Tell me, as one good companion to another, is there any other man who interests you?</t1281> <t1282>And if there is, I will never again touch even a strand of your hair, but I will be, if you allow me, a very sincere friend.</t1282>
<t1283>"My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so undeserving of them?</t1283> <t1284>Here I am almost making fun of this true gentleman with all my heart.</t1284> <t1285>I burst into tears (I fear, dear, that you will think this is a very sloppy letter in many ways), and I really felt very bad.</t1285> <t1286>Why can't a girl be allowed to marry three men, or as many as love her, to avoid these troubles?</t1286> <t1287>But this is a 'heresy,' and I must not say it.</t1287> <t1288>I am glad, however, to tell you that despite crying, I was able to look into Mr. Morris's brave eyes and speak to him frankly: "Yes; there is someone I love, although he has not yet told me that he loves me.</t1288>
<t1289>"It was good that I spoke to him so frankly, for a light seemed to illuminate his face, and extending his two hands, he took mine, or I believe it was I who placed mine in his, and he said very emotionally:</t1289>
<t1290>"That's right, my brave girl.</t1290> <t1291>It's more worthwhile to arrive late with the possibility of winning you, than to arrive on time for any other girl in the world.</t1291> <t1292>Don't cry, dear.</t1292> <t1293>If it's for me, I'm a tough nut to crack; I'll stand it.</t1293> <t1294>If that other guy doesn't know his luck, well, he'd better seek it quickly or he'll have to deal with me.</t1294> <t1295>Little one, your sincerity and courage have made me a friend, and that's even rarer than a lover; anyway, it's less selfish.</t1295> <t1296>Dear, I'm going to have to make this walk to the Kingdom of Heaven alone.</t1296> <t1297>Would you give me a kiss?</t1297> <t1298>It will be something to carry through the darkness, now and then.</t1298> <t1299>You can do it, if you wish, because that other good guy (he must be a magnificent guy, dear; a good fellow, or you couldn't love him) hasn't spoken yet.</t1299>
<t1300>"That almost won me over, Mina, for she was brave and sweet with him, and also noble with a rival (isn't that so?) and he, so sad!</t1300> <t1301>So I leaned forward and kissed him tenderly.</t1301>
<t1302>"He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down at my face, I fear I was very blushed, he said:</t1302>
<t1303>"Little girl, I hold your hands and you have kissed me, and if these things do not make us good friends, nothing will.</t1303> <t1304>Thank you for your sweet sincerity with me, and goodbye.</t1304>
<t1305>"He let go of my hand, and taking his hat, left the room without looking back, without shedding a tear, without trembling or pausing.</t1305> <t1306>And I am crying like a baby.</t1306> <t1307>Oh! Why must a man like him be unhappy when there are so many girls around who could adore even the ground he walks on?</t1307> <t1308>I know I would if I were free, but it so happens that I don't want to be free.</t1308> <t1309>Dear, this has disturbed me, and I feel that I cannot write about happiness right now, after what I have told you; and I don't want to say anything about number three until everything can be happiness.</t1309>
<t1310>"Loves you always,</t1310>
<t1311>LUCY</t1311>
<t1312>"P. D.-Oh!</t1312> <t1313>Regarding the number three, I don't need to tell you anything about the number three, do I?</t1313> <t1314>Besides, it was all so confusing!</t1314> <t1315>It seemed that only an instant had passed from the moment I entered the room until his two arms surrounded me, and he was kissing me.</t1315> <t1316>I am very, very happy, and I don't know what I have done to deserve it.</t1316> <t1317>I must only try in the future to show that I am not ungrateful to God for all His kindness, by sending me such a love, a husband, and a friend.</t1317>
<t1318>"Goodbye."</t1318>
<t1319>From the diary of Dr. Seward (recorded on phonograph)</t1319>
<t1320>May 25th.</t1320> <t1321>Waning tide in today's appetite.</t1321> <t1322>I can't eat; I can't rest, so instead, the journal.</t1322> <t1323>Since my failure yesterday, I feel a kind of emptiness; nothing in the world seems important enough to dedicate oneself to it.</t1323> <t1324>Knowing that the only cure for these things was work, I devoted myself to my patients.</t1324> <t1325>I chose one who has provided me with a study of much interest.</t1325> <t1326>It is so rare that I am determined to understand it as much as I can.</t1326> <t1327>It seems to me that today I got closer than ever to the heart of its mystery.</t1327>

<t1360>VI.– MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL</t1360>
<t1361>Whitby, 24th of July.</t1361> <t1362>I found Lucy at the station, who looked sweeter and prettier than ever, and from there we headed to Crescent House, where they have rooms.</t1362>
<t1363>It is a very beautiful place.</t1363> <t1364>The small river, the Esk, runs through a deep valley, which widens as it approaches the harbor.</t1364> <t1365>A large viaduct crosses it, with tall piers, through which the landscape seems a bit farther away than it actually is.</t1365> <t1366>The valley is of a beautiful green, and it is so steep that when one is at the top of either side, one can see through it, unless one is close enough to look down.</t1366> <t1367>The houses of the old town (the side farthest from us) all have red roofs, and they seem to be piled on top of each other in any way, as seen in the prints of Nuremberg.</t1367>
<t1368>Directly above the town are the ruins of Whitby Abbey, which was plundered by the Danes, and is the scene of part of "Marmion," where the girl is walled up in the wall.</t1368> <t1369>It is a most noble ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic features; according to legend, a lady in white is seen in one of the windows.</t1369> <t1370>Between the abbey and the town, there is another church, the parish church, around which there is a large cemetery, all filled with stone tombs.</t1370> <t1371>In my view, this is the most beautiful place in Whitby, as it extends right over the town and from there one has a complete view of the harbor and the entire bay where Cape Kettleness juts into the sea.</t1371> <t1372>It descends so steeply over the harbor that part of the bank has collapsed, and some of the tombs have been destroyed.</t1372> <t1373>In one place, some of the tombstones are scattered over the sandy path much lower down.</t1373> <t1374>There are walkways, with benches on the sides, through the church cemetery.</t1374> <t1375>People sit there all day long looking at the magnificent landscape and enjoying the breeze.</t1375> <t1376>I will come and sit here very often to work.</t1376> <t1377>In fact, I am now writing on my knees and listening to the conversation of three old men who are sitting next to me.</t1377> <t1378>It seems that they do nothing all day but sit here and talk.</t1378>
<t1379>The port lies below me, with a long granite wall jutting into the sea on the far side, curving outward at the end, in the middle of which there is a lighthouse.</t1379> <t1380>A massive breakwater runs along the outside of that lighthouse.</t1380> <t1381>On the nearer side, the breakwater forms a reverse bend, and its end also has a lighthouse.</t1381> <t1382>Between the two piers, there is a small opening into the port, which then suddenly widens.</t1382>
<t1383>When the tide is high, it is very beautiful; but when the tide goes out, it decreases in depth until it is almost dry, and then you can only see the Esk current slipping between the sandbanks, with some rocks here and there.</t1383> <t1384>Outside the harbor, on this side, a large reef rises for about half a mile, whose sharp part runs directly from the south side of the lighthouse.</t1384> <t1385>At the end of it, there is a buoy with a bell that rings when there is bad weather and sends its mournful notes to the wind.</t1385> <t1386>They tell a legend here: when a ship is lost, bells can be heard ringing in the open sea.</t1386> <t1387>I must inquire about this with the old man; he is walking in this direction...</t1387>
<t1388>He is a very amusing old man.</t1388> <t1389>He must be terribly old, for his face is all wrinkled and twisted like the bark of a tree.</t1389> <t1390>He tells me that he is almost a hundred years old, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing fleet at the time of the Battle of Waterloo.</t1390> <t1391>He is, I fear, a very skeptical person, for when I asked him about the bells in the sea and about the Lady in White in the abbey, he told me very brusquely:</t1391>
<t1392>–Miss, if I were you, I wouldn't worry about that.</t1392> <t1393>Those things are all worn out.</t1393> <t1394>I mean, I'm not saying they never happened, but I am saying they didn't happen in my time.</t1394> <t1395>All that is fine for strangers and travelers, but not for a young lady as pretty as you.</t1395> <t1396>Those walkers from York and Leeds, who are always eating pickled herrings and drinking tea, and seeing how they can buy anything cheap, believe in those things.</t1396> <t1397>I wonder who bothers to tell them those lies, even in the newspapers, which are full of silly gossip.</t1397>
<t1398>I thought he would be a good person from whom I could learn interesting things, so I asked him if he wouldn't mind telling me something about whaling in ancient times.</t1398> <t1399>He was just sitting down to begin when the clock struck six, and then he laboriously got up and said:</t1399>
<t1400>–Miss, now I must go home again.</t1400> <t1401>My granddaughter doesn't like to wait when the tea is already served, as it takes some time.</t1401>
<t1402>He limped away, and I could see that he was hurrying, as much as he could, down the steps.</t1402>
<t1403>The bleachers are a distinctive feature of this place.</t1403> <t1404>They lead from the village to the church; there are hundreds of them (I don't know how many) and they twist in delicate curves; the slope is so gentle that a horse can easily go up or down them.</t1404> <t1405>I think they must have originally had something to do with the abbey.</t1405> <t1406>I will head home as well.</t1406> <t1407>Lucy went out to make some visits with her mother, and since they were only courtesy visits, I did not go.</t1407> <t1408>But it is time for them to be back by now.</t1408>
<t1409>August 1st.</t1409> <t1410>I arrived up here with Lucy an hour ago, and we had the most interesting conversation with my old friend and the other two who always come and keep him company.</t1410> <t1411>He is evidently the oracle of the group, and I dare to think that in his time he must have been a very dictatorial person.</t1411> <t1412>He never admits to being wrong, and always contradicts everyone.</t1412> <t1413>If he can't win by arguing, then he intimidates them, and then takes the silence of others as acceptance of his own points of view.</t1413> <t1414>Lucy was sweetly beautiful in her white linen dress; since we arrived she has had a beautiful color.</t1414> <t1415>I noticed that the old man wasted no time in getting to her and sitting by her side when we sat down.</t1415> <t1416>Lucy is so sweet with the elderly that I think they all fall in love with her instantly.</t1416> <t1417>Even my old friend succumbed and did not contradict her, but supported everything she said.</t1417> <t1418>I managed to bring him to the topic of legends, and he immediately began to speak, giving us a sort of sermon.</t1418> <t1419>I must try to remember it and write it down:</t1419>
<t1420>–All of that is nonsense, from beginning to end; that's what it is, and nothing more.</t1420> <t1421>Those sayings and signs and ghosts and stone guests and foolishness and all that, only serve to scare children and women.</t1421> <t1422>They are nothing but words, that and all those frights, signs, and warnings that were invented by priests and malicious people and by railroad recruiters, to scare a poor guy and to make people do something they otherwise wouldn't do.</t1422> <t1423>It enrages me to think about it.</t1423> <t1424>Why is it that they, not content with printing lies on paper and preaching them from pulpits, want to engrave them even on tombstones?</t1424> <t1425>Look around as much as you want and you'll see that all those tombstones that raise their heads as much as their pride allows, are tilted..., simply falling under the weight of the lies written on them.</t1425> <t1426>The "Here lie the remains" or "To the sacred memory" are written on them and yet, not even in half of them is there any body; no one has given a damn about their memories and much less have they sanctified them.</t1426> <t1427>It's all lies, just lies of one kind or another!</t1427> <t1428>Good God!</t1428> <t1429>But the great repudiation will come on Judgment Day, when everyone comes out with their shrouds, all united trying to drag their tombstones with them to prove how good they were; some of them trembling, falling with their numb and slippery hands from having lain in the sea, to the point that they won't even be able to stay together.</t1429>
<t1430>By the satisfied air of the old man and the way he looked around seeking support for his words, I could tell he was boasting, so I said something to make him continue.</t1430>
<t1431>–Oh, Mr. Swales, you can't be serious!</t1431> <t1432>Surely all the tombstones can't be wrong.</t1432>
<t1433>–Nonsense!</t1433> <t1434>There may scarcely be a few that are not bad, except for those where people are praised too much; because there are people who think that a container of balm could be like the sea, if only it were theirs.</t1434> <t1435>All that is nothing but lies.</t1435> <t1436>Listen, you came here as a stranger and saw this church atrium.</t1436>
<t1437>I nodded because I thought the best thing to do would be that.</t1437> <t1438>I knew it had something to do with the temple.</t1438> <t1439>The man continued:</t1439>
<t1440>–And you are certain that all those tombstones belong to people who have been buried here, aren't you?</t1440>
<t1441>I nodded again.</t1441>
<t1442>–So, that is precisely where the lie appears.</t1442> <t1443>Listen, there are dozens of such resting places that are as old as the old Dun's coffin from Friday night -he nudged one of his friends and they all laughed-.</t1443> <t1444>Good heavens! And how could they be anything else?</t1444> <t1445>Look at that one, the one at the far end of the cemetery, read it!</t1445>
<t1446>I went up to her, and I read:</t1446>
<t1447>–Edward Spencelagh, boatswain, murdered by pirates off the coast of Andres, April 1845, at the age of 30.</t1447>
<t1448>When I returned, Mr. Swales continued:</t1448>
<t1449>–I wonder, who brought him to be buried here?</t1449> <t1450>Murdered on the outskirts of the coast of Andres!</t1450> <t1451>And you all know that his body rests there!.</t1451> <t1452>I could list a dozen whose bones lie in the seas of Greenland, to the north -and he pointed in that direction-, or wherever they have been carried by the currents.</t1452> <t1453>Their tombstones are around you, and with your young eyes you can read from here the lies that lie between the lines.</t1453> <t1454>Regarding this Braithwaite Lowrey…, I knew his father, he was lost on the Lively off the coast of Greenland in the year twenty; and Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the same sea in 1777; and John Paxton, who drowned near Cape Farewell a year later, and old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me and who drowned in the Gulf of Finland in the year fifty.</t1454> <t1455>Do you think all these men have to hurry to Whitby when the trumpet sounds?</t1455> <t1456>I highly doubt it!</t1456> <t1457>I assure you that by the time they got here they would be bumping and shaking each other in a way that would look like a fight on the ice, like in the old days when we faced each other from dawn to dusk and tried to heal our wounds by the light of the aurora borealis.</t1457>
<t1458>Evidently, this was a local joke, because the old man laughed as he spoke and his friends celebrated it very gladly.</t1458>
<t1459>–But -I said-, surely this is not entirely correct because you assume that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to carry their tombstones with them on Judgment Day.</t1459> <t1460>Do you really think that will be necessary?</t1460>
<t1461>–Well, what else could those tombstones be for?</t1461> <t1462>Answer me that, dear!</t1462>
<t1463>–I suppose to please their relatives.</t1463>
<t1464>–"He supposes that to please his relatives!" – his words were imbued with intense sarcasm-.</t1464> <t1465>"How can it please his relatives to know that everything written there is a lie, and that everyone, in this place, knows it is?"</t1465> <t1466>He pointed to a stone at our feet that had been placed as a tombstone, upon which the chair rested, near the edge of the cliff.</t1466>
<t1467>–Read the lies that are on that tombstone -he said.</t1467>
<t1468>The letters were upside down from where I was; but Lucy was facing them, so she leaned over and read:</t1468>
<t1469>–To the sacred memory of George Canon, who died in the hope of a glorious resurrection, on July 29, 1873, after falling from the rocks at Kettleness.</t1469> <t1470>This tomb was erected by his grieving mother for her dearly beloved son.</t1470> <t1471>"He was the only son of his mother who was a widow."</t1471> <t1472>To tell the truth, Mr. Swales, I don't see anything funny about that -her words were spoken with utmost seriousness and a certain severity.</t1472>
<t1473>–He doesn't find it funny! Ha! Ha!</t1473> <t1474>But that's because he doesn't know that the grieving mother was a witch who hated him because he was a rascal... a real rascal...; and he hated her so much that he committed suicide so she wouldn't collect an insurance policy she had taken out on his life.</t1474> <t1475>He almost blew his brains out with an old shotgun they used to scare away the crows; he didn't aim it at the crows that time, but it made other objects fall on him.</t1475> <t1476>That's how he fell from the rocks.</t1476> <t1477>And as for the hopes of a glorious resurrection, I often heard him say, miss, that he hoped to go to hell because his mother was so pious that she would surely go to heaven and he didn't want to be in the same place as her.</t1477> <t1478>Now, in any case, isn't that a pack of lies? – and he emphasized the words with his cane-.</t1478> <t1479>And won't it make Gabriel laugh when Geordie comes panting up the rocks with his tombstone balanced on his hump, and asks that it be taken as evidence!</t1479>
<t1480>I didn't know what to say; but Lucy changed the conversation by saying, as she stood up:</t1480>
<t1481>–Why did you tell us about this?</t1481> <t1482>It's my favorite seat and I can't leave it, and now I find out that I have to keep sitting on a suicide's grave.</t1482>
<t1483>–That won't do you any harm, darling, and Geordie might be glad to have such a slender girl on his lap.</t1483> <t1484>It won't hurt you, I've sat there countless times over the past twenty years and nothing has happened to me.</t1484> <t1485>Don't worry about guys like the one lying there or those who aren't there either.</t1485> <t1486>The time to run will come when you see everyone carrying the tombstones and the place is as bare as a mown field.</t1486> <t1487>The hour is already sounding and I must go, at your feet, ladies!</t1487>
<t1488>And he walked away limping.</t1488>
<t1489>Lucy and I remained seated for a few moments, and everything before us was so beautiful that we held hands.</t1489> <t1490>She told me again about Arthur and his upcoming marriage; that made me feel a bit sad, because I haven't heard anything from Jonathan for a whole month.</t1490>
<t1491>The same day.</t1491> <t1492>I came here alone because I feel very sad.</t1492> <t1493>There was no letter for me: I hope nothing has happened to Jonathan.</t1493> <t1494>The clock has just struck nine, I can see the lights scattered all over the town, forming rows where the streets are and in other solitary places; they rise up to the Esk and then disappear in the curve of the valley.</t1494> <t1495>To my left, the view is cut off by the black line of the roof of the old house next to the abbey.</t1495> <t1496>The sheep and lambs are bleating in the distant fields behind me, and from the cobblestone road below comes the sound of donkey hooves.</t1496> <t1497>The band on the pier is playing a solemn waltz in good time, and further along the pier, there is a Salvation Army session in some alley.</t1497> <t1498>Neither band listens to the other; but from here I can see and hear both.</t1498> <t1499>I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me!</t1499> <t1500>How I wish he were here.</t1500>
<t1501>From the Diary of Dr. Seward</t1501>
<t1502>June 5.</t1502> <t1503>Renfield's case becomes more interesting the more I manage to understand the man.</t1503> <t1504>He certainly has some very broadly developed characteristics: selfishness, stealth, and intentionality.</t1504> <t1505>I wish I could find out what the purpose of the latter is.</t1505> <t1506>He seems to have a finished scheme of his own, but I don't know what it is.</t1506>
<t1507>His redeeming virtue is his love for animals, although, in fact, he has such curious changes that sometimes I imagine he is just abnormally cruel.</t1507> <t1508>He plays with all kinds of animals.</t1508> <t1509>Right now his hobby is catching flies.</t1509> <t1510>Currently, he has so many that I had an altercation with him.</t1510> <t1511>To my astonishment, he did not have any outburst of fury, as I had expected, but took the matter with a very dignified seriousness.</t1511> <t1512>He reflected for a moment, and then said:</t1512>
<t1513>–Can you give me three days?</t1513> <t1514>At the end of them, I will set them free.</t1514>
<t1515>I told him that, of course, I would give him that time.</t1515> <t1516>I must watch him.</t1516>
<t1517>June 18.</t1517> <t1518>Now he has turned his attention to spiders, and he has a few very large specimens in a box.</t1518> <t1519>He spends the whole day feeding them with his flies, and the number of the latter has decreased significantly, although he has used half of his food to attract more flies from outside.</t1519>
<t1520>July 1st.</t1520> <t1521>His spiders are now becoming as much of a nuisance as his flies, and today I told him he must get rid of them.</t1521> <t1522>He became very sad upon hearing this, so I told him he should at least get rid of some.</t1522> <t1523>He cheerfully accepted this proposal, and I gave him the same amount of time again to carry out the reduction.</t1523> <t1524>While I was with him, he caused me much distress, for when a horrible blowfly, swollen with food waste, buzzed into the room, he caught it and held it for a moment between his index finger and thumb, and before I could warn him of what he was about to do, he popped it into his mouth and ate it.</t1524> <t1525>I scolded him for what he had done, but he argued that it tasted very good and was very healthy; that it was life, strong life, and that it gave life to him.</t1525> <t1526>This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one.</t1526> <t1527>I must watch how he gets rid of his spiders.</t1527> <t1528>He evidently has a difficult problem on his mind, for he is always carrying a small notebook in which he writes something down every moment.</t1528>
<t1529>Whole pages of that notebook are filled with heaps of numbers, usually simple numbers added in batches, and then the sums added again in batches, as if "focusing" on some account, as auditors say.</t1529>
<t1530>July 8.</t1530> <t1531>There is a method in his madness, and the rudiments of the idea in my mind are growing; soon it will be a complete idea, and then, oh, unconscious cerebration!, you will have to give way to your conscious sister.</t1531> <t1532>I stayed away from my friend for a few days, so that I could see if any changes occurred.</t1532> <t1533>Things remain as before, except that he has abandoned some of his little animals and acquired a new one.</t1533> <t1534>He got himself a sparrow, and has partially tamed it.</t1534> <t1535>His way of taming is very simple, as the spiders have considerably decreased.</t1535> <t1536>However, those that still remain are well-fed, as he still attracts flies by tempting them with his food.</t1536>
<t1537>July 19.</t1537> <t1538>We are making progress.</t1538> <t1539>My friend now has almost a complete colony of sparrows, and his flies and spiders have almost disappeared.</t1539> <t1540>When I entered, he ran towards me and told me he wanted to ask me a great favor; a very, very big favor; and as he spoke to me, he fawned over me like a dog.</t1540> <t1541>I asked him what he wanted, and he told me, with an emotional voice that almost broke into sobs:</t1541>
<t1542>–A kitten; a little kitten, silky and playful, so that I can play with it, and I can tame it, and I can feed it, and feed it, and feed it!</t1542>
<t1543>I was not unprepared for such a request, as I had noticed how his little animals were growing in size and liveliness.</t1543> <t1544>But it did not seem pleasant to me that his lovely family of tamed sparrows would be swept away in the same manner as the flies and spiders had been; so I told him I would think about it, and asked if he would not prefer to have a big cat instead of a kitten.</t1544> <t1545>Anxiety betrayed him as he answered:</t1545>
<t1546>–Oh, yes! Of course, I would like a big cat!</t1546> <t1547>I only asked for a kitten fearing that you would refuse to give me a big cat.</t1547> <t1548>No one can deny me a little kitten, right?</t1548>
<t1549>I shook my head and told him that at the moment I feared it wouldn't be possible, but that I would see what I could do.</t1549> <t1550>His face darkened and I could see a warning of danger in it, as he gave me a grim look, which signified a desire to kill.</t1550> <t1551>The man is a potential homicidal maniac.</t1551> <t1552>I will test him with his current desires and see what comes of it: then I will know more.</t1552>
<t1553>10 p. m.</t1553> <t1554>I visited him again and found him sitting in a corner, head down.</t1554>
<t1555>When I entered, he fell to his knees before me and begged me to please let him have a cat; that his salvation depended on it.</t1555> <t1556>However, I was firm and told him that I couldn't tell him, so he got up without saying a word, sat down again in the corner where I had found him, and began to nibble on his fingers.</t1556> <t1557>I will come to see him early in the morning.</t1557>
<t1558>July 20.</t1558> <t1559>I visited Renfield very early, before my assistant made his rounds.</t1559> <t1560>I found him already up, humming a tune.</t1560> <t1561>He was spreading the sugar he had stored on the window, and he was starting again to catch flies; and he was starting again with joy.</t1561> <t1562>I looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, I asked him where they were.</t1562> <t1563>He answered, without turning to look at me, that they had all escaped.</t1563> <t1564>There were a few feathers in the room and on his pillow there were some drops of blood.</t1564> <t1565>I said nothing, but went and ordered the guard to report to me if anything strange happened to Renfield during the day.</t1565>
<t1566>11 a.</t1566> <t1567>m.</t1567> <t1568>My assistant just came to see me to tell me that Renfield is very sick and that he has vomited many feathers.</t1568> <t1569>"My belief is, doctor -he told me-, that he has eaten all his birds, and that he has eaten them raw, just like that!".</t1569>
<t1570>11 p.m.</t1570> <t1571>Tonight I gave Renfield a strong sedative, enough to make even him sleep, and took his notebook to have a look at it.</t1571> <t1572>The thought that has been hovering in my brain lately is complete, and the theory proven.</t1572> <t1573>My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind.</t1573> <t1574>I will have to invent a new classification for him and call him a zoophagous maniac (one who feeds on living things); what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he can, and he has set himself the task of achieving this in a cumulative manner.</t1574> <t1575>He gave many flies to each spider, and many spiders to each bird, and then wanted a cat to eat many birds.</t1575> <t1576>What would his next step have been?</t1576> <t1577>It would almost have been worth completing the experiment.</t1577> <t1578>It could be done if there were sufficient cause.</t1578> <t1579>Men were scandalized by vivisection, and yet, look at the current results!</t1579> <t1580>Why should I not advance science in its most difficult and vital aspect, the knowledge of the human brain?</t1580> <t1581>If only I had the secret of such a mind, if I had the key to the fantasy of even one lunatic, I could advance my own branch of science to such a place that, compared to it, Burdon Sanderson's physiology or Ferrier's knowledge of the brain would be little less than nothing.</t1581> <t1582>If there were sufficient cause!</t1582> <t1583>I must not think too much about this, lest I fall into temptation; a good cause could tip the scale with me, for is it not true that I too may be an exceptional brain, congenitally?</t1583>
<t1584>How well the man reasoned; lunatics always reason well within their own realm.</t1584> <t1585>I wonder in how many lives he will value a man, or even just one.</t1585> <t1586>He has closed the account with complete accuracy, and today he will start a new record.</t1586> <t1587>How many of us start a new record with each day of our lives?</t1587> <t1588>It seems to me that it was only yesterday when my entire life ended with my new hope, and that a new record truly began.</t1588> <t1589>So it will be until the Great Recorder sums me up and closes my account book with a balance of gains or losses.</t1589> <t1590>Oh, Lucy, Lucy!, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait in misfortune and work.</t1590> <t1591>Work, work!.</t1591>
<t1592>If I could have a cause as strong as the one my poor crazy friend has, a good, selfless cause that would make me work, that would undoubtedly be happiness.</t1592>
<t1593>From the journal of Mina Murray</t1593>
<t1594>July 26.</t1594> <t1595>I am anxious and it calms me to express myself in writing; it is like whispering to oneself and listening at the same time.</t1595> <t1596>And there is something also about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from simple writing.</t1596> <t1597>I am sad for Lucy and for Jonathan.</t1597> <t1598>I had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and I was very worried; but yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from him.</t1598> <t1599>I had written to him asking if he had heard from Jonathan and he replied that the letter he was sending me he had just received.</t1599> <t1600>It is just a line dated from Dracula's castle, in which he says that at that moment he is starting the journey back home.</t1600> <t1601>It is not like Jonathan; I do not quite understand, and I feel very uneasy.</t1601> <t1602>And then, also Lucy, although she is so well, has lately fallen back into her old habit of sleepwalking.</t1602> <t1603>Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided that I should lock our room door every night.</t1603> <t1604>Mrs. Westenra has the idea that sleepwalkers always go walking on the roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs, and then wake up suddenly and fall off with a desperate cry that echoes all over the place.</t1604> <t1605>Poor thing, naturally she is anxious about Lucy, and she has told me that her husband, Lucy's father, had the same habit; that he would get up at night and dress and go out for a walk, if he was not stopped.</t1605> <t1606>Lucy is going to get married in the autumn, and she is already planning her dresses and how her house is going to be arranged.</t1606> <t1607>I understand her well, for I will do the same, with the difference that Jonathan and I will start life in a simple way, and we will have to try to make both ends meet.</t1607> <t1608>Mr. Holmwood (he is the honorable Arthur Holmwood, only son of Lord Godalming) is going to come here for a brief visit, as soon as he can leave the town, for his father is not so well, and I believe dear Lucy is counting the minutes until he arrives.</t1608> <t1609>She wants to take him to the bench in the churchyard on the cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby.</t1609> <t1610>I dare say it is the waiting that makes her impatient: she will feel better when he arrives.</t1610>
<t1611>July 27.</t1611> <t1612>No news from Jonathan.</t1612> <t1613>I'm getting anxious about him, although I don't know exactly why; but I would really like him to write, even if it's just a line. Lucy walks more than ever, and every night I wake up because she is pacing up and down the room.</t1613> <t1614>Fortunately, the weather is so hot that she can't catch a cold; but in any case, the anxiety and being perpetually awake are starting to affect me, and I myself am getting nervous and suffering a bit of insomnia.</t1614> <t1615>Thank God, Lucy's health is holding up.</t1615> <t1616>Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has become seriously ill.</t1616> <t1617>Lucy is impatient about the postponement of seeing him, but it doesn't affect her appearance; she is a little bit plumper and her cheeks have a lovely rosy color.</t1617> <t1618>She has lost the anemic look she had.</t1618> <t1619>I pray that everything continues to go well.</t1619>
<t1620>August 3rd.</t1620> <t1621>Another week has passed, and I have had no news from Jonathan.</t1621> <t1622>Not even Mr. Hawkins has heard from him, from whom I have received communication.</t1622> <t1623>Oh, I truly hope he is not ill.</t1623> <t1624>He would almost certainly have written.</t1624> <t1625>I have read his last letter, and there is something in it that does not satisfy me.</t1625> <t1626>It does not seem to be from him, and yet, it is written in his handwriting.</t1626> <t1627>There is no possible mistake about this last point.</t1627> <t1628>In the past week, Lucy has not walked in her sleep as much, but there is a strange concentration about her that I do not understand; even when she sleeps, she seems to be watching me.</t1628> <t1629>She turns the door handle, and finding it locked, she goes from one side of the room to the other looking for the key.</t1629>
<t1630>August 6.</t1630> <t1631>Another three days, and no news.</t1631> <t1632>This waiting is becoming a torment.</t1632> <t1633>If at least I knew where to write, or where to go, I would feel much better: but no one has heard a word from Jonathan since that last letter.</t1633> <t1634>I can only raise my prayers to God asking for patience.</t1634> <t1635>Lucy is more excitable than ever, but otherwise she remains well.</t1635> <t1636>Last night there was bad weather and the fishermen say there will be a storm soon.</t1636> <t1637>I must try to observe it and learn to predict the weather.</t1637> <t1638>Today is a gray day, and as I write the sun is hidden behind thick clouds, very high over Kettleness.</t1638> <t1639>Everything is gray, except the green grass, which looks like an emerald amidst it all; gray earth stones, gray clouds, tinged by the sunlight on the farthest shore, hanging over the gray sea, into which the sandbanks protrude like gray figures.</t1639> <t1640>The sea is pounding with a roar on the shallow, sandy coves, cloaked in the sea mist that reaches the land.</t1640>
<t1641>Everything is vast; the clouds are piled up like gigantic stones, and over the sea, there are gusts of wind that sound like the omen of a cruel fate.</t1641> <t1642>On the beach, here and there, there are dark figures, sometimes shrouded by the mist, and they look like "Trees with human shapes that walk."</t1642> <t1643>All the fishing boats are heading quickly to the harbor, rising and plunging into the large waves as they sail towards the port, listing.</t1643> <t1644>Here comes old Mr. Swales.</t1644> <t1645>He is heading straight towards me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that he wishes to speak with me.</t1645>
<t1646>I have felt quite moved by the change in the poor old man.</t1646> <t1647>When he sat next to me, he said very timidly:</t1647>
<t1648>I want to tell you something, miss.</t1648>
<t1649>I could see that he was not calm, so I took his poor old and wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak with full confidence; then, leaving his hand between mine, he said:</t1649>
<t1650>–I'm afraid, my dear, that I must have impressed you a lot with all the malevolent things I've been saying about the dead and similar things these past few weeks; but I didn't mean them seriously, and I want you to remember that when I'm gone.</t1650><t1651>We, the old and somewhat crazy people, with one foot already in the damned hole, don't like to think about it at all, and we don't want to feel scared; and that's why I've taken those things so lightly, to cheer up my own heart a little bit.</t1651><t1652>But, God bless you, miss, I'm not afraid of death, I don't fear it in the slightest; it's just that if I could avoid dying, it would be better.</t1652><t1653>My time is running out, for I am already old, and a hundred years is too much for any man to hope for; and I am so close to it that the Old Man is already sharpening his scythe.</t1653><t1654>You see, I can't break the habit of laughing about these things all at once: mockery will always be my favorite theme.</t1654><t1655>Someday the Angel of Death will sound his trumpet for me.</t1655><t1656>But don't grieve or regret my death -he said, seeing that I was crying-, for if it were to come tonight, I wouldn't refuse to answer his call.</t1656><t1657>For life, after all, is just a wait for something else besides what we are doing; and death is the only thing we can truly depend on.</t1657><t1658>But I am content, for it is already approaching me, dear, and it is approaching quickly.</t1658><t1659>It can come at any moment while we are watching and asking questions.</t1659><t1660>Perhaps it is in the wind out there at sea that brings with it loss and destruction, and painful ruins, and sad hearts.</t1660><t1661>Look, look! – he suddenly shouted-.</t1661><t1662>There is something in that wind and in the echo beyond it that sounds, seems, tastes, and smells like death.</t1662><t1663>It is in the air; I feel it coming.</t1663><t1664>Lord, make me respond joyfully when my call comes!</t1664>
<t1665>He raised his arms devoutly and took off his hat.</t1665> <t1666>His mouth moved as if he were praying.</t1666> <t1667>After a few minutes of silence, he stood up, shook my hands, blessed me, and said goodbye.</t1667> <t1668>He walked away limping.</t1668> <t1669>All of this impressed me greatly and made me nervous.</t1669>
<t1670>I was relieved when the coastguard approached, spyglass under his arm.</t1670>
<t1671>He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but the whole time he kept looking towards a strange ship.</t1671>
<t1672>–I can't imagine what it is -he told me-.</t1672> <t1673>From what we can see, it's Russian.</t1673> <t1674>But it's swaying in a very strange way.</t1674> <t1675>It really doesn't know what to do; it seems to realize that a storm is coming, but it can't decide whether to sail north into the open sea or to take shelter here.</t1675> <t1676>Look at it, again!</t1676> <t1677>It's maneuvering in an extremely strange way.</t1677> <t1678>It seems like it doesn't respond to the hands on the helm; it changes with every gust of wind.</t1678> <t1679>We'll know more about it by this time tomorrow.</t1679>
<t1680>VII.– CLIPPING FROM THE "DAILYGRAPH", AUGUST 8</t1680>
<t1681>(Pasted in Mina Murray's diary)</t1681>
<t1682>From a correspondent.</t1682>
<t1683>Whitby.–</t1683> <t1684>One of the strongest and most sudden storms in memory has just passed through here, with strange results.</t1684> <t1685>The weather was somewhat sultry, but by no means exceptional for the month of August.</t1685> <t1686>Saturday night was as good as any other, and the large number of visitors went yesterday to the Mulgrave woods, Robin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the other recreational sites around Whitby.</t1686> <t1687>The steamers Emma and Scarborough made numerous trips along the coast, and there was an extraordinary movement of people coming and going from Whitby.</t1687> <t1688>The day was extremely beautiful until the afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the churchyard of East Cliff, and from that prominent eminence observe the wide expanse of sea visible to the north and east, drew attention to a group of very high "mare's tails" in the sky towards the northwest.</t1688> <t1689>The wind was blowing from the southwest at a gentle degree that in barometric language is classified as 2: light breeze.</t1689> <t1690>The coastguard on duty immediately made the report, and an old fisherman, who for more than half a century has made weather observations from East Cliff, emphatically predicted the arrival of a sudden storm.</t1690> <t1691>The sunset was so beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly colored clouds, that a large number of people gathered on the sidewalk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy its beauty.</t1691> <t1692>Before the sun sank behind the black mass of Kettleness, openly meeting port to starboard across the western sky, its descent path was marked by a myriad of clouds of all the colors of the sky: red, purple, pink, green, violet, and all shades of gold; here and there were masses not very large, but notably of an absolute black, in all kinds of shapes; some only outlined and others like colossal silhouettes.</t1692> <t1693>The sight of that landscape was not wasted by the painters, and there is no doubt that some sketches of the "Prelude to a Great Storm" will adorn the walls of R. A. and R. I. next May.</t1693> <t1694>More than one captain decided at that moment and in that place that his "pebble" or his "mule" (as they call the different types of boats) would remain in the harbor until the storm had passed.</t1694> <t1695>By nightfall, the wind had completely died down, and by midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity that, as thunder approaches, affects people of very sensitive nature.</t1695> <t1696>There were very few lights at sea, for even the coastal steamers, which usually sail very close to the shore, stayed offshore, and only a few fishing boats could be seen.</t1696> <t1697>The only outstanding sail was a foreign schooner that had all its sails unfurled and seemed to be heading west.</t1697>
<t1698>The stubbornness or ignorance of its crew was a topic exhaustively discussed while it remained in sight, and efforts were made to send signals to lower the sails, in view of the danger.</t1698> <t1699>Before nightfall, it was seen with its sails idly fluttering while it sailed with great tranquility over the choppy waves of the sea.</t1699>
<t1700>"As idly as a painted ship upon a painted ocean."</t1700><t1701>"</t1701>
<t1702>Shortly before ten o'clock at night, the stillness of the wind became quite oppressive, and the silence was so pronounced that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the village could be distinctly heard; and the band playing on the pier, which was playing a lively French march, was a dissonance in the great harmony of nature's silence.</t1702> <t1703>A little after midnight, a strange sound came from the sea, and very high up, a strange, faint, hollow rumble began to occur.</t1703>
<t1704>Then, without prior warning, the storm burst forth.</t1704><t1705>With a swiftness that, at those moments, seemed incredible, and even afterward is inconceivable; the entire aspect of nature immediately turned convulsive.</t1705><t1706>The waves rose, growing with fury, each one surpassing its companion, until in just a few minutes the glassy sea of not long ago was roaring and devouring like a monster.</t1706><t1707>Waves with white crests struck the beach sands savagely and hurled themselves against the steep cliffs; others broke over the piers, and swept with their foam the lanterns of the lighthouses that stood at each end of the piers in the port of Whitby.</t1707><t1708>The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force that it was difficult even for strong men to stay on their feet, or to cling desperately to the steel supports.</t1708><t1709>It was necessary to completely clear the mass of onlookers from the piers, or otherwise the misfortunes of the night would have increased considerably.</t1709><t1710>As if the difficulties and dangers looming over the town were not enough, masses of sea fog began to invade the land, white and damp clouds that advanced in a ghostly manner, so wet, vaporous, and cold that it took only a small effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living comrades with the clammy hands of death, and more than one person felt shivers and chills as the spirals of sea fog climbed inland.</t1710><t1711>For a few moments the fog cleared, and one could see the sea at some distance, by the light of the lightning, which now flashed frequently followed by sudden crashes of thunder, so horrendous that the entire sky above seemed to tremble under the storm's blow.</t1711>
<t1712>Some of the scenes that took place were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest.</t1712> <t1713>The sea, rising as high as the mountains, hurled great masses of white foam into the sky, which the storm seemed to catch and scatter all over the space; here and there a fishing boat, with torn sails, desperately navigating in search of refuge from the danger; from time to time the white wings of a seabird tossed by the storm.</t1713> <t1714>At the top of East Cliff, the new spotlight was ready to go into action, but it had not yet been tested; the workers in charge of it positioned it, and in the pauses of the fog that was coming upon us, they swept the surface of the sea with it.</t1714> <t1715>Once or twice it rendered the most efficient of services, such as when a fishing boat, with its gunwale under water, rushed towards the harbor, avoiding, thanks to the guidance of the protective light, the danger of crashing against the docks.</t1715> <t1716>Every time a boat managed to reach the harbor safely, there was a shout of joy from the crowd gathered on the shore; a shout that for a moment seemed to stand out from the gale, but was finally overshadowed by its force.</t1716>
<t1717>Shortly thereafter, the spotlight discovered at some distance a schooner with all its sails unfurled, apparently the same vessel that had been sighted earlier that night.</t1717> <t1718>At that hour, the wind had shifted to the east, and a shudder ran through all the spectators on the cliff as they witnessed the terrible danger in which the ship found itself.</t1718> <t1719>Between it and the harbor lay a large flat reef on which many good ships had crashed from time to time, and with the wind blowing in that direction, it would be an almost impossible obstacle to overcome if it attempted to reach the harbor entrance.</t1719> <t1720>It was almost high tide, but the waves were so impetuous that the sands of the beach were almost visible in their troughs, and the schooner, with all its sails unfurled, was rushing forward with such speed that, in the words of an old sea dog, "it had to reach somewhere, even if it was only to hell."</t1720>
<t1721>Then came another burst of sea fog, thicker than all the previous ones; a mass of damp mist that seemed to envelop everything like a gray shroud and left men with only the sense of hearing, for the noise of the storm, the crash of thunder, and the rumble of the mighty waves that came through the humid atmosphere were louder than ever.</t1721> <t1722>The beams of the searchlight remained fixed on the mouth of the harbor through the east pier, where the collision was expected, and the men held their breath.</t1722> <t1723>Suddenly, the wind shifted to the northeast, and the rest of the sea fog dissipated; and then, mirabile dictu, between the piers, rising from wave to wave as it advanced at great speed, the strange schooner entered with all its sails unfurled and reached the sanctuary of the harbor.</t1723> <t1724>The searchlight followed it, and a shiver ran through all who saw it, for tied to the helm was a body, with its head fallen, swaying horribly from side to side with each movement of the ship.</t1724> <t1725>No other form could be seen on deck.</t1725>
<t1726>A great state of reverence and fear overcame everyone when they saw that the ship, as if by a miracle, had found the port, guided only by the hands of a dead man!</t1726> <t1727>However, everything happened more quickly than it takes to write these words.</t1727> <t1728>The schooner did not stop, but, sailing swiftly through the port, rammed into a bank of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms, located at the southeast corner of the pier that juts out under East Cliff, and which is locally known as Tate Hill Pier.</t1728>
<t1729>Of course, when the ship crashed into the sandbank, a considerable jolt occurred.</t1729> <t1730>Every spar, rope, and stanchion felt the shock, and part of the main mast came down.</t1730> <t1731>But the strangest thing of all was that, at the very moment it touched the shore, a huge dog leaped onto the deck from below, and as if propelled by the impact, ran forward and jumped from the bow onto the sand.</t1731> <t1732>Running directly towards the steep cliff where the churchyard hangs over the lane leading to the east pier, so steeply that some of the tombstones ("transatlantic" or "cross stones," as they are vernacularly called here in Whitby) actually jut out where the cliff supporting them has collapsed, and disappeared into the darkness, which seemed intensified just beyond the beam of the searchlight.</t1732>
<t1733>It happened that by chance at that moment there was no one on the Tate Hill pier, as all those whose houses were nearby were either in bed or had gone up to the heights for a better view.</t1733> <t1734>Therefore, the coast guard captain on duty on the east side of the harbor, who immediately ran to the small pier, was the first to board.</t1734> <t1735>The men operating the searchlight, after scanning the harbor entrance without seeing anything, directed the light towards the abandoned ship and kept it there.</t1735> <t1736>The coast guard captain ran across the aft deck, and when he reached the wheel, he leaned over to examine it and suddenly recoiled as if under strong emotion.</t1736> <t1737>This seemed to pique general curiosity, and a good number of people began to run.</t1737> <t1738>It's quite a distance from West Cliff, across the Drawbridge, to the Tate Hill pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and I arrived well ahead of the rest of the crowd.</t1738> <t1739>However, when I arrived, I found a crowd had already gathered on the pier, and the coast guard captain and the police were not allowing anyone to board.</t1739> <t1740>As a courtesy from the chief sailor, I was allowed to board as a correspondent, and I was one of the small group who saw the dead sailor still tied to the helm.</t1740>
<t1741>It was not surprising that the coast guard captain had been startled, or that he had felt fear, for it is not very common to see such things.</t1741> <t1742>The man was simply tied by his hands, one over the other, to the spoke of the steering wheel.</t1742> <t1743>Between his right hand and the wood there was a crucifix, with the rosaries with which he was bound wrapped both around his wrists and the wheel, all tightly secured by the ropes that bound him.</t1743> <t1744>The poor fellow may have been sitting at first, but the flapping and banging of the sails had taken their toll on the steering wheel and dragged him from side to side, so much so that the ropes with which he was tied had cut into his flesh down to the bone.</t1744> <t1745>A detailed description of the state of affairs was made, and a doctor, surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of East Elliot Place, No. 33, who came aboard immediately after me, declared after an examination that the man must have been dead for at least two days.</t1745> <t1746>In his pocket there was a bottle, carefully corked, and empty, except for a small roll of paper, which turned out to be an appendix to the logbook.</t1746>
<t1747>The coast guard captain said that the man must have tied his own hands by tightening the knots with his teeth.</t1747> <t1748>The fact that the coast guard captain was the first to board may avoid some complications later in the Admiralty Court; since coast guards cannot claim the right of salvage that all civilians who are the first to find an abandoned ship can opt for.</t1748>
<t1749>However, the legal officials are already moving, and a young law student is loudly and clearly asserting that the owner's rights are already completely sacrificed, with their property being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain, since the helm's tiller, as an emblem, if not proof of delegated possession, is considered mortmain.</t1749> <t1750>It is needless to say that the dead sailor has been reverently removed from the place where he maintained his venerable watch and guard (with a tenacity as noble as that of young Casablanca), and has been placed in the morgue awaiting further inquiries.</t1750>
<t1751>The sudden storm is already passing, and its ferocity is waning; people are scattering towards their homes, and the sky is beginning to redden over the Yorkshire countryside.</t1751> <t1752>I will send, in time for your next edition, more details about the abandoned ship that so miraculously found its way to the port in the midst of the storm.</t1752>
<t1753>August 9.</t1753> <t1754>The aftermath of the strange arrival of the abandoned ship in last night's storm is almost more astonishing than the event itself.</t1754> <t1755>It turns out that the schooner is Russian, from Varna, and it is called Demetrius.</t1755> <t1756>It is filled almost entirely with ballast of silver sand, with only a small amount of cargo: many large wooden boxes filled with earth.</t1756> <t1757>This cargo was consigned to a solicitor in Whitby, Mr. S. F. Billington, of The Crescent, No. 7, who went on board this morning and took formal possession of the goods consigned in his name.</t1757> <t1758>The Russian consul, also, acting on behalf of the shipping side, took formal possession of the ship and paid all the port dues, etcetera.</t1758> <t1759>Nothing else is talked about here but the strange coincidence; the employees of the Ministry of Commerce have been exceedingly scrupulous in ensuring that all legal procedures are followed according to the current regulations.</t1759>
<t1760>As the matter seems to be "a nine-day wonder," they are evidently determined that there should be no cause for further complications.</t1760> <t1761>Considerable interest has been noted regarding the dog that jumped ashore when the ship ran aground, and more than one member of the A. P. C. A., which is very strong here in Whitby, has tried to take charge of the animal.</t1761> <t1762>But to the general dismay, it has not been possible to find it anywhere; rather, it seems to have completely disappeared from the town.</t1762> <t1763>It may very well be that it was terrified and ran to take refuge in the marshes, where it is possibly still hiding.</t1763> <t1764>There are some who look with fear at this last possibility, as it could later become a danger, since it is evidently a fierce beast.</t1764> <t1765>Early this morning, a large dog, a mixed-breed mastiff belonging to a coal merchant near Tate Hill Pier, was found dead on the road in front of its owner's yard.</t1765> <t1766>It had been fighting, and evidently had a savage opponent, as its throat was torn and its belly was opened as if by a wild claw.</t1766>
<t1767>Later.</t1767> <t1768>By courtesy of the inspector from the Ministry of Commerce, I have been allowed to take a look at the logbook of the Demetrio, which is in order up until three days ago, but it contained nothing of particular interest, except for matters related to the missing men.</t1768> <t1769>The greatest interest, however, centers around the paper found in the bottle, which was presented today during the inquiries; and I can assure you that a stranger tale than what seems to be deduced from both things has never crossed my path.</t1769>
<t1770>Since there is no reason to keep it secret, I am allowed to use them and send you a detailed account, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and cargo.</t1770> <t1771>It almost seems as if the captain had been overcome by a kind of mania before they had reached the open sea, and that this continued to develop persistently throughout the voyage.</t1771> <t1772>Of course, my assertion must be taken cum grano, because I am writing as dictated by an employee of the Russian consul, who kindly translates for me, as there is little time.</t1772>
<t1773>LOGBOOK OF THE "DEMETRIO"</t1773>
<t1774>From Verna to Whitby</t1774>
<t1775>Written on July 18.</t1775> <t1776>Such strange things are happening, of which I will keep detailed information from now on until we reach land.</t1776>
<t1777>On July 6, we finished loading the cargo, silver sand and boxes of soil.</t1777> <t1778>In the afternoon, we set sail.</t1778> <t1779>East wind, fresh.</t1779> <t1780>Crew, five hands…, two officers, cook, and me (captain).</t1780>
<t1781>On July 11 at dawn, we entered the Bosphorus.</t1781> <t1782>Turkish customs officers came on board.</t1782> <t1783>Tips.</t1783> <t1784>Everything was in order.</t1784> <t1785>We resumed the journey at 4 p.m.</t1785>
<t1786>July 12 through the Dardanelles.</t1786> <t1787>More customs employees and the flagship of the guard squadron.</t1787> <t1788>Tips again.</t1788> <t1789>The work of the officers detailed, but quick.</t1789> <t1790>They wanted to get rid of us promptly.</t1790> <t1791>At dusk we passed into the archipelago.</t1791>
<t1792>On July 13, we passed Cape Matapan.</t1792> <t1793>The crew is dissatisfied with something.</t1793> <t1794>They seem scared, but they don't say why.</t1794>
<t1795>On July 14, I was somewhat anxious about the crew.</t1795> <t1796>All the men are trustworthy and have sailed with me before.</t1796> <t1797>The pilot couldn't figure out what was happening either; they only told him that there was something, and they crossed themselves.</t1797> <t1798>The pilot lost his temper with one of them that day and punched him.</t1798> <t1799>I expected a fierce fight, but everything is calm.</t1799>
<t1800>On July 16, the pilot reported in the morning that one of the crew, Petrovsky, has disappeared.</t1800> <t1801>He could not provide more details.</t1801> <t1802>He took the port watch at eight bells last night; he was relieved by Abramov, but he did not go to his bunk.</t1802> <t1803>The men, very depressed, all said that they already expected something like this, but they did not say more except that there was something on board.</t1803> <t1804>The pilot is becoming very impatient with them; I fear more troublesome incidents later.</t1804>
<t1805>On July 17, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin and in a confidential and fearful manner told me that he thought there was a strange man on board the ship.</t1805> <t1806>He narrated that during his watch he had been hiding behind the deckhouse, as there was a stormy rain, when he saw a tall, thin man, who did not resemble any of the crew, climbing the deckhouse ladder and walking forward on the deck, only to disappear.</t1806> <t1807>He followed him cautiously, but when he reached near the bow he found no one, and all the hatches were closed.</t1807> <t1808>A superstitious panic seized him, and I fear that this panic may spread to the others.</t1808> <t1809>Anticipating this, today I will have the entire ship carefully searched, from bow to stern.</t1809>
<t1810>Later that same day, I gathered the entire crew and told them that, since they evidently thought there was someone on the ship, we would search it from bow to stern.</t1810>
<t1811>The first officer got angry; he said it was nonsense, and that giving in to such foolish ideas would demoralize the men even more; he said he committed to keeping them in order with a club.</t1811> <t1812>I left him in charge of the helm, while the rest began to search, all of us staying side by side, with lanterns; we didn't leave a corner unchecked.</t1812> <t1813>Since all there were were some large wooden boxes, there were no possible crevices where a man could hide.</t1813> <t1814>The men were much more relieved when we finished the search, and they went about their tasks with joy.</t1814> <t1815>The first officer grumbled, but said nothing more.</t1815>
<t1816>July 22.</t1816> <t1817>The last three days, bad weather, and all hands busy with the sails: no time to be scared.</t1817> <t1818>The men seem to have forgotten their fears.</t1818> <t1819>The helmsman, cheerful again, and everything is going very well.</t1819> <t1820>I praised the men for their magnificent work during the bad weather.</t1820> <t1821>We passed Gibraltar and exited the straits.</t1821>
<t1822>All good.</t1822>
<t1823>July 24.</t1823> <t1824>It seems that a curse weighs upon this ship.</t1824> <t1825>We were already one hand short, and upon entering the Bay of Biscay in devilish weather, another man disappeared last night without a trace.</t1825> <t1826>Like the first, he left his watch and was never seen again.</t1826> <t1827>All the men are in a panic; I sent an order accepting their request to have double watches, as they are afraid to be alone.</t1827> <t1828>The pilot, furious.</t1828> <t1829>I fear we may have some trouble, as either he or the men might resort to violence.</t1829>
<t1830>July 28.</t1830> <t1831>Four days of hell, tossing about in some kind of typhoon, with stormy winds.</t1831> <t1832>No one has been able to sleep.</t1832> <t1833>All the men are exhausted.</t1833> <t1834>I hardly know how to set up a watch, as no one is in any condition to carry on.</t1834> <t1835>The second officer volunteered to steer and keep watch, allowing the men to sleep for a couple of hours.</t1835> <t1836>The wind is dying down; the sea is still terrifying, but it feels less so, as the ship has gained stability.</t1836>
<t1837>July 29.</t1837> <t1838>Another tragedy.</t1838> <t1839>Tonight we had a single watch, as the crew is too tired to make it double.</t1839> <t1840>When the morning watch came on deck, they couldn't find anyone except the helmsman.</t1840> <t1841>He started shouting and everyone came on deck.</t1841> <t1842>Thorough search, but no one was found.</t1842> <t1843>Now we are without a second officer, and the crew is in great panic.</t1843> <t1844>The helmsman and I agreed to always go armed from now on, and to watch for any sign of the cause.</t1844>
<t1845>July 30.</t1845> <t1846>Night.</t1846> <t1847>Everyone is rejoicing as we approach England.</t1847> <t1848>Magnificent weather, all sails unfurled.</t1848> <t1849>I retired due to exhaustion; slept deeply; was awakened by the officer telling me that both men, the one on watch and the pilot, had disappeared.</t1849> <t1850>Only two crew members remain, the first officer and I, to steer the ship.</t1850>
<t1851>August 1st.</t1851> <t1852>Two days of fog and without sighting a sail.</t1852> <t1853>I had hoped that in the English Channel we could signal for help or reach somewhere.</t1853> <t1854>Not having the strength to work the sails, we have to sail with the wind.</t1854> <t1855>We do not dare to lower them, because we would not be able to raise them again.</t1855> <t1856>It seems we are being dragged towards a terrible end.</t1856> <t1857>The first officer is now more demoralized than any of the men.</t1857> <t1858>His stronger nature seems to have worked internally against him.</t1858> <t1859>The men are beyond fear, working hard and patiently, with their minds prepared for the worst.</t1859> <t1860>They are Russians; he is Romanian.</t1860>
<t1861>August 2, midnight.</t1861> <t1862>I woke up after a few minutes of sleep hearing a scream, which seemed to come from right outside my door.</t1862> <t1863>I couldn't see anything because of the fog.</t1863> <t1864>I ran to the deck and bumped into the first officer.</t1864> <t1865>He tells me he heard the scream and ran, but there were no signs of the man who was on watch.</t1865> <t1866>Another one gone.</t1866> <t1867>Lord, help us!</t1867> <t1868>The first officer says we must have already passed the Strait of Dover, because at a moment when the fog cleared, he managed to see North Foreland, at the same instant he heard the man's scream.</t1868> <t1869>If so, we are now in the North Sea, and only God can guide us in this fog, which seems to move with us; and God seems to have abandoned us.</t1869>
<t1870>August 3rd.</t1870> <t1871>At midnight, I went to relieve the man at the helm, and when I arrived, I found no one there.</t1871> <t1872>The wind was steady, and as we sail wherever it takes us, there was no movement.</t1872> <t1873>I did not dare to leave the helm alone, so I shouted for the officer.</t1873> <t1874>After a few seconds, he came running up to the deck in his flannels.</t1874> <t1875>His eyes were wide and his face was gaunt, so I greatly fear he has lost his mind.</t1875> <t1876>He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, placing his mouth near my ear, as if he feared even the air would hear: "It is here; now I know.</t1876> <t1877>While on watch last night, I saw it, a tall, thin man, deathly pale.</t1877> <t1878>He was near the prow, looking out.</t1878> <t1879>I crawled towards him and plunged my knife into him; but it went through him, empty as the air."</t1879> <t1880>As he spoke, he drew his knife and began to wave it wildly in the air.</t1880> <t1881>Then, he continued: "But since it is here, I will find it.</t1881> <t1882>It is in the hold, perhaps in one of those boxes.</t1882> <t1883>I will unscrew them one by one and see.</t1883> <t1884>You, hold the helm."</t1884> <t1885>And, with a warning look, placing his finger on his lips, he headed below.</t1885> <t1886>A dangerous wind was rising, and I could not leave the helm.</t1886> <t1887>I saw him come out again on deck with a toolbox and a lantern and descend through the forward hatch.</t1887> <t1888>He is mad; completely delirious with madness, and there is no point in trying to stop him.</t1888> <t1889>He cannot harm those large boxes: they are marked as "clay," and moving them around does not matter.</t1889> <t1890>So here I stay, tending the helm and writing these notes.</t1890>
<t1891>I can only trust in God and wait for the fog to clear.</t1891> <t1892>Then, if I can steer the ship towards any port with the wind available, I will lower the sails and stay resting, signaling, asking for help...</t1892>
<t1893>Almost everything is over now.</t1893> <t1894>Just when I was beginning to think that the first officer might return more calmly, as I heard him hammering something in the hold, and work does him good, a sudden scream that froze my blood came up through the hatch; and he appeared on deck as if shot from a gun, completely mad, with eyes rolling and face convulsed with fear.</t1894> <t1895>"Save me, save me!" he shouted, and then looked around at the blanket of fog.</t1895> <t1896>His horror turned to despair, and in a calm voice he said, "It would be better if you came too, captain, before it's too late.</t1896> <t1897>It's here.</t1897> <t1898>Now I know the secret.</t1898> <t1899>The sea will save me from it, and that's all that's left!"</t1899> <t1900>Before I could say a word, or move to stop him, he jumped to the bow, and deliberately threw himself into the sea.</t1900> <t1901>I suppose now I know the secret too.</t1901> <t1902>It was this madman who dispatched the men one by one and now he himself has followed them.</t1902> <t1903>God help me!</t1903> <t1904>How am I going to report all these horrors when I reach port?</t1904> <t1905>When I reach port!</t1905> <t1906>And when will that be?</t1906>
<t1907>August 4th.</t1907> <t1908>Still fog, which the sun cannot penetrate.</t1908> <t1909>I know the sun has risen because I am a sailor, but I don't know for what other reasons.</t1909> <t1910>I don't dare go below; I don't dare leave the helm; so I spent the whole night here, and in the dark of the night I saw him, him!</t1910> <t1911>God forgive me, but the officer was right to jump overboard.</t1911> <t1912>It was better to die like a man; the death of a sailor in the blue waters of the sea cannot be objected to by anyone.</t1912> <t1913>But I am the captain, and I cannot abandon my ship.</t1913> <t1914>But I will thwart this enemy or monster, for when my strength begins to fail, I will tie my hands to the helm, and along with them, I will tie that which this - him! - does not dare to touch; and then, come good wind or bad wind, I will save my soul and my captain's honor.</t1914> <t1915>I am weakening, and night is approaching.</t1915> <t1916>If he can see my face again, it might be that I won't have time to act...</t1916> <t1917>If we shipwreck, perhaps this bottle will be found, and those who find me will understand; if not... Well, then all men will know that I have been faithful to my oath.</t1917> <t1918>God and the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying to do his duty...</t1918>
<t1919>Of course, the verdict was acquittal.</t1919> <t1920>There is no evidence to present; and whether it was the man himself who committed the murders, or it was not him, is something that no one can attest to.</t1920> <t1921>The people here almost universally hold that the captain is simply a hero, and he is going to be buried with all honors.</t1921> <t1922>It is already arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats for a stretch along the Esk, and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and carried up the steps to the abbey; for it has been arranged that he be buried in the church cemetery, on the cliff.</t1922> <t1923>The owners of more than a hundred barges have already given their names, indicating that they wish to follow the captain's funeral procession.</t1923>
<t1924>No traces of the immense dog have been found; because of this, there is much sadness, as, with public opinion in its present state, the animal would have been, I believe, adopted by the people.</t1924> <t1925>Tomorrow will be the funeral, and thus will end this new "mystery of the sea".</t1925>
<t1926>From the journal of Mina Murray</t1926>
<t1927>August 8.</t1927> <t1928>Lucy spent the whole night very restless, and I couldn't sleep either.</t1928> <t1929>The storm was terrible, and as it thundered loudly among the chimney pots, it made me tremble.</t1929> <t1930>When a strong gust of wind came, it sounded like the distant shot of a cannon.</t1930> <t1931>Quite strangely, Lucy did not wake up; but she got up twice and dressed herself.</t1931> <t1932>Fortunately, on each occasion I woke up in time and managed to undress her without waking her, putting her back to bed.</t1932> <t1933>This sleepwalking of hers is very strange, for as soon as her will is thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if she has one, disappears, and she almost exactly follows the routine of her life.</t1933>
<t1934>Early this morning, the two of us got up and went down to the port to see if anything had happened during the night.</t1934> <t1935>There were very few people around, and although the sun was shining and the air was clear and fresh, the great threatening waves, which seemed darker than they were because the foam crowned them with plumes of snow, made their way through the narrow mouth of the port, like a man elbowing his way through a crowd.</t1935> <t1936>For no apparent reason, I felt glad that Jonathan had not been at sea, but on land.</t1936> <t1937>But, oh! Is he on land or at sea?</t1937> <t1938>Where is he, and how is he?</t1938> <t1939>I am becoming truly anxious about his whereabouts.</t1939> <t1940>If only I knew what I should do, and if I could do something!</t1940>
<t1941>August 10.</t1941> <t1942>The funeral of the poor captain today was most moving.</t1942> <t1943>All the boats in the harbor seemed to be there, and the coffin was carried on the shoulders of captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier to the churchyard.</t1943> <t1944>Lucy came with me, and we went very early to our old seat, while the procession of boats went up the river to the viaduct and then came down again.</t1944> <t1945>We had a magnificent view, and we saw the procession almost the entire way.</t1945> <t1946>The poor man was laid to rest near our seat, so we stood up and, when the time came, we could see everything.</t1946> <t1947>Poor Lucy seemed very nervous.</t1947> <t1948>She was restless and agitated the whole time, and I can't help but think that her dreams at night are affecting her.</t1948> <t1949>There is something very strange: she doesn't want to admit to me that there is any cause for her unease; or if there is a cause, she herself does not understand it.</t1949> <t1950>There is an additional reason in the fact that the poor old man, Mr. Swales, was found dead this morning in our seat, with his neck broken.</t1950> <t1951>Evidently, as the doctor said, he fell backward onto the seat, stricken with fear, for there was a look of dread and horror on his face that the men said made them tremble.</t1951> <t1952>Poor dear old man!</t1952> <t1953>Perhaps he saw death with his dying eyes!</t1953> <t1954>Lucy is so sweet and feels influences more keenly than other people.</t1954>
<t1955>Right now she is very excited about a small detail to which I did not pay much attention, even though I myself love animals very much.</t1955><t1956>One of the men who always came up here to look at the boats was followed by his dog.</t1956><t1957>The dog was always with him.</t1957><t1958>Both are very calm, and I never saw the man angry, nor did I hear the dog bark.</t1958><t1959>During the service, the dog did not want to approach his owner, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few meters away, barking and howling.</t1959><t1960>His owner spoke to him first softly, then in a harsher tone, and finally very angrily; but the animal did not want to come closer nor did it stop making noise.</t1960><t1961>It was possessed as if by some kind of rage, with its eyes shining wildly, and all its hairs standing on end like a cat's tail when preparing for a fight.</t1961><t1962>Finally, the man also got angry, and jumping off the seat, he kicked the dog, and then, grabbing it by the neck, dragged it and threw it onto the tombstone on which the seat is mounted.</t1962><t1963>At the moment it touched the tombstone, the poor creature regained its peaceful demeanor but began to tremble desperately.</t1963><t1964>It did not try to leave, but curled up, trembling and crouching, and was in such a state of terror that I tried to calm it, though without effect. Lucy also felt compassion, but did not try to touch the dog, only looking at it with pity.</t1964><t1965>I fear very much that she has too sensitive a nature to be able to go through the world without problems.</t1965><t1966>I am sure that tonight she will dream of everything that has happened.</t1966><t1967>All the accumulation of strange events (the ship piloted into the harbor by a dead man; his posture, tied to the helm with a crucifix and rosaries; the emotional funeral; the dog, sometimes furious and other times terrified) will give her plenty of material for her dreams.</t1967>
<t1968>I think the best thing for her would be to retire to her bed, physically tired, so I will take her for a long walk along the cliffs of Robin Hood's Bay, and then back.</t1968> <t1969>I don't think she will have much inclination to sleepwalk afterwards.</t1969>
<t1970>VIII.–</t1970> <t1971>FROM MINAMURRAY'S DIARY</t1971>
<t1972>Same day, 11 p.m. Oh, how tired I am!</t1972> <t1973>If it weren't for the fact that I have taken it as a duty to write in my diary every night, I wouldn't open it today.</t1973> <t1974>We had a lovely walk.</t1974> <t1975>After a while, Lucy was in a better mood, due, I think, to some peaceful cows that came to sniff us in the field near the lighthouse, and they completely drove us crazy.</t1975> <t1976>I think we forgot everything, except, of course, personal fear, and this seemed to erase everything and give us the chance to start anew.</t1976>
<t1977>We had a magnificent "English tea" at a small and charming old-fashioned inn in Robin Hood's Bay, with an arched window overlooking the seaweed-covered rocks on the beach.</t1977> <t1978>I think we would have scared the "New Woman" with our appetites.</t1978> <t1979>Men are more tolerant, bless them!</t1979> <t1980>Then, we set off on the walk back home, making some or rather many stops to rest, and with our hearts in constant fear of the wild bulls.</t1980> <t1981>Lucy was truly tired, and we intended to sneak off to bed as soon as we could.</t1981> <t1982>However, the young priest arrived, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay for dinner.</t1982> <t1983>Lucy and I both had a quarrel about it with the miller; I know that on my part it was a very tough fight, and I am quite heroic.</t1983>
<t1984>I believe that someday the bishops should meet and see how to raise a new class of priests, who do not accept staying for dinner, no matter how much they are insisted upon, and who know when the young women are tired.</t1984> <t1985>Lucy is asleep and breathing softly.</t1985> <t1986>She has more color in her cheeks than other times, and she looks so sweet!</t1986> <t1987>If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her just by seeing her in the living room, I wonder what he would say if he could see her now.</t1987> <t1988>Some of the "New Woman" writers might someday put into practice the idea that men and women should be able to see each other sleeping first before proposing or accepting.</t1988> <t1989>But I suppose that the "New Woman" will not condescend to accept in the future; she will make the proposal herself.</t1989> <t1990>And what a job she will have!</t1990> <t1991>There is some consolation in this.</t1991> <t1992>Tonight I am very happy because my dear Lucy seems to be quite better.</t1992>
<t1993>I really believe that he has turned the corner, and that the problems caused by his sleepwalking have been overcome.</t1993> <t1994>I would be completely happy just to hear news from Jonathan...</t1994> <t1995>God bless him and keep him.</t1995>
<t1996>August 11, 3 a.m.</t1996> <t1997>I am not sleepy, so it would be better if I write.</t1997> <t1998>I am too agitated to be able to sleep.</t1998> <t1999>We have had an extraordinary adventure; a very painful experience.</t1999> <t2000>I fell asleep as soon as I closed my diary…</t2000>
<t2002>Suddenly I woke up completely and sat up, with a terrible sensation of fear all over my body; with a feeling of emptiness around me.</t2002><t2003>The room was dark, so I couldn't see Lucy's bed; I approached it and searched for her by touch.</t2003><t2004>The bed was empty.</t2004><t2005>I lit a match and discovered that she was not in the room.</t2005><t2006>The door was closed, but not locked as I had left it.</t2006><t2007>I feared waking her mother, who has been quite ill lately, so I put on some clothes and prepared to look for her.</t2007><t2008>As I was leaving the room, it occurred to me that the clothes she was wearing might give me some clue about her sleepwalking intentions.</t2008><t2009>A robe would mean the house; a dress, the street.</t2009><t2010>But both the robe and her dresses were in their place.</t2010><t2011>"My God," I said to myself, "she can't be far, as she is only wearing her nightgown."</t2011><t2012>I ran downstairs and looked in the living room.</t2012><t2013>She wasn't there!</t2013><t2014>Then I searched the other open rooms in the house, with a cold, ever-growing fear in my heart.</t2014><t2015>Finally, I reached the hallway door and found it open.</t2015><t2016>It wasn't fully open, but the latch was not fastened.</t2016><t2017>The people in the house are always very careful to close the door every night, so I feared that Lucy had gone out just as she was.</t2017><t2018>There was no time to think about what might happen; a vague, invincible fear overshadowed all the details.</t2018><t2019>I took a large, heavy shawl and ran outside.</t2019><t2020>The clock was striking one when I was on the Crescent, and there wasn't a soul in sight.</t2020><t2021>I ran along North Terrace but could not see any sign of the white figure I expected to find.</t2021><t2022>At the edge of West Cliff, over the pier, I looked across the harbor towards East Cliff, with hope or fear, I don't know which, of seeing Lucy in our favorite seat.</t2022><t2023>There was a full, bright moon, with fast-moving black and heavy clouds, giving the whole scene a diorama of light and shadow as they sailed across; for a few moments, I couldn't see anything, as the shadow of a cloud darkened St. Mary's Church and all around it.</t2023><t2024>Then, as the cloud passed, I could see the ruins of the abbey becoming visible; and when a narrow strip of light as sharp as a sword's edge passed along, I could see the church and the churchyard appear within the field of light.</t2024><t2025>Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for there, in our seat, the silvery moonlight illuminated a half-reclined figure, white as snow.</t2025><t2026>The arrival of the cloud was too quick for me, and it didn't allow me to see much, as the shadows fell over the light almost immediately; but it seemed to me as if something dark was behind the seat where the white figure shone, and was leaning over it.</t2026><t2027>Whether it was man or beast, I cannot say.</t2027><t2028>I didn't wait to take another look, but ran down the steps to the pier and hurried through the fish market to the bridge, which was the only way to get to East Cliff.</t2028><t2029>The town seemed dead, as there wasn't a soul around.</t2029><t2030>I was glad it was so, as I didn't want any witnesses to the poor condition Lucy was in.</t2030><t2031>Time and distance seemed infinite, and my knees trembled and my breath became labored as I climbed the endless steps to the abbey.</t2031><t2032>I must have run fast, and yet, it seemed to me that my feet were weighed down with lead, and as if every joint in my body was rusted.</t2032>
<t2033>When I had almost reached the top, I could see the seat and the white figure, for now I was close enough to distinguish it even through the cloak of shadows.</t2033> <t2034>Undoubtedly, there was something long and black leaning over the half-reclined white figure.</t2034> <t2035>Filled with fear, I shouted, "Lucy! Lucy!", and something lifted a head, and from where I was, I could see a white face with red, gleaming eyes.</t2035> <t2036>Lucy did not respond to me, and I ran towards the entrance of the churchyard.</t2036> <t2037>As I entered, the church stood between me and the seat, and for a minute I lost sight of it.</t2037>
<t2038>When I saw her again, the cloud had already passed, and the moonlight illuminated the place so brightly that I could see Lucy half-reclined with her head resting on the back of the seat.</t2038> <t2039>She was completely alone, and there were no signs of living beings anywhere.</t2039>
<t2040>When I leaned over her, I could see that she was still asleep.</t2040> <t2041>Her lips were open, and she was breathing, but not with the usual softness; rather, in large and heavy gasps, as if she were trying to fully fill her lungs with each breath.</t2041>
<t2042>As I approached, she raised her hand and pulled at the neck of her nightgown, as if she felt cold.</t2042><t2043>However, she remained asleep.</t2043><t2044>I placed the warm shawl over her shoulders, tying the ends tightly around her neck, as I was very afraid she might catch a deadly cold from the night air, being almost naked as she was.</t2044><t2045>I feared waking her abruptly, so to have my hands free to help her, I fastened the shawl near her throat with a large safety pin; but in my anxiety, I must have acted clumsily and pricked her with it, because shortly after, when her breathing became more regular, she brought her hand to her throat again and moaned.</t2045><t2046>Once I had carefully wrapped her, I put my shoes on her feet and began to wake her very gently.</t2046><t2047>At first, she did not respond: but gradually she became more and more restless in her sleep, occasionally moaning and sighing.</t2047><t2048>Finally, as time was passing quickly and for many other reasons, I wanted to take her home immediately, I shook her more forcefully until she finally opened her eyes and woke up.</t2048><t2049>She did not seem surprised to see me, as, of course, she did not immediately realize where we were.</t2049><t2050>Lucy always wakes up with a beautiful expression, and even at that moment, when her body must have been pierced by the cold and her mind terrified upon knowing she had walked semi-naked through the cemetery at night, she did not seem to lose her grace.</t2050><t2051>She shivered a little and hugged me tightly; when I told her to come back home with me immediately, she got up without a word and obeyed me like a child.</t2051><t2052>As we began to walk, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed my jump.</t2052><t2053>She stopped and wanted to insist that I put on my shoes, but I refused.</t2053><t2054>However, when we reached the path outside the cemetery, where there was a puddle of water, a remnant of the storm, I smeared my feet with mud using one foot over the other, so that when we went home, no one, in case we met anyone, could notice my bare feet.</t2054>
<t2055>Fortune favored us and we arrived home without encountering a soul.</t2055> <t2056>On one occasion, we saw a man, who did not seem to be entirely sober, crossing a street in front of us; but we hid behind a door until he disappeared into an open field like the ones that abound here, small sloping courtyards, or winds, as they are called in Scotland.</t2056> <t2057>During all this time, my heart pounded so strongly that at times I thought I would faint.</t2057> <t2058>I was filled with anxiety for Lucy, not so much for her health, even though the cold air could affect her, but for her reputation in case the story of what happened became public.</t2058> <t2059>When we entered, and once we had washed our feet and prayed together a prayer of thanks, I put her to bed.</t2059> <t2060>Before falling asleep, she asked me, implored me, not to say a word to anyone, not even to her mother, about what had happened that night.</t2060>
<t2061>At first, I hesitated to make the promise; but when I thought about her mother's state of health, and how the news of such an event would excite her, and also considering how that story could be twisted (no, it would infallibly be falsified) if it became known, I thought it was wiser to promise what was asked of me.</t2061> <t2062>I hope I have acted rightly.</t2062> <t2063>I have closed the door and tied the key to my wrist, so I may not be disturbed again.</t2063> <t2064>Lucy is sleeping deeply; the reflection of the dawn appears high and far over the sea…</t2064>
<t2065>Same day, in the afternoon.</t2065> <t2066>Everything is going well.</t2066> <t2067>Lucy slept until I woke her up and it seemed she hadn't even changed sides.</t2067> <t2068>The night's adventure doesn't seem to have caused her any harm; on the contrary, it has benefited her, as she is much better this morning than in the past few weeks.</t2068> <t2069>I felt sad to notice that my clumsiness with the safety pin had hurt her.</t2069> <t2070>In fact, it could have been something serious, as the skin on her throat was punctured.</t2070> <t2071>I must have caught a piece of skin with the safety pin, piercing it, as there are two small red dots like pinholes, and there was a drop of blood on the neck of her nightgown.</t2071> <t2072>When I apologized and showed my concern about it, Lucy laughed and comforted me, saying she hadn't even felt it.</t2072> <t2073>Fortunately, there will be no scar, as they are tiny holes.</t2073>
<t2074>Same day, at night.</t2074> <t2075>We have spent the day very happily.</t2075> <t2076>The air was clear, the sun bright, and there was a fresh breeze.</t2076> <t2077>We took our lunch to the Mulgrave woods; Mrs. Westenra driving along the road, Lucy and I walking along the gorge path and meeting her at the entrance.</t2077> <t2078>I felt a little sad, as I could realize how absolutely happy I would have been if I had Jonathan by my side.</t2078> <t2079>But, oh well!</t2079> <t2080>I just need to be patient.</t2080> <t2081>In the evening, we took a walk to the Terrace Casino, and listened to some good music by Spohr and Mackenzie, and went to bed very early.</t2081> <t2082>Lucy seems to be calmer than she has been lately, and I fell asleep immediately.</t2082> <t2083>I will secure the door and keep the key in the same way as before, as I do not think there will be any problem tonight.</t2083>
<t2084>August 12.</t2084> <t2085>My predictions were wrong, as twice during the night I was awakened by Lucy, who was trying to get out.</t2085> <t2086>She seemed, even while asleep, to be a little impatient at finding the door locked, and lay back down uttering groans of protest.</t2086> <t2087>I woke at dawn and heard the birds chirping outside the window.</t2087> <t2088>Lucy woke up too, and I was glad to see that she was even better than yesterday morning.</t2088> <t2089>All her old cheerfulness seems to have returned, and she moved over to my bed, snuggling up to me to tell me all about Arthur.</t2089> <t2090>I told her how anxious I was about Jonathan, and then she tried to console me.</t2090> <t2091>Well, to some extent she succeeded, as although sympathy cannot alter facts, it can help make them more bearable.</t2091>
<t2092>August 13.</t2092> <t2093>Another quiet day, and I went to bed with the key on my wrist as before.</t2093> <t2094>Again I woke up during the night and found Lucy sitting on her bed, still asleep, pointing towards the window.</t2094> <t2095>I got up stealthily, and parting the blind, looked outside.</t2095> <t2096>The moon shone splendidly, and the soft effect of the light on the sea and sky, merged into one great and silent mystery, was of indescribable beauty.</t2096> <t2097>Between me and the moonlight fluttered a large bat, coming and going in wide circles.</t2097> <t2098>A couple of times it came quite close, but I suppose, frightened by seeing me, it flew back, heading towards the port and the abbey.</t2098> <t2099>When I returned from the window, Lucy had lain down again and was sleeping peacefully.</t2099> <t2100>She did not move again all night.</t2100>
<t2101>August 14th.</t2101> <t2102>I have been at East Cliff, reading and writing all day.</t2102> <t2103>Lucy seems to have fallen in love with this place as much as I have, and it is very difficult to tear her away from here when it is time to go home for lunch, tea, or dinner.</t2103> <t2104>This afternoon she made a very strange comment.</t2104> <t2105>We were on our way home for dinner, and we had reached the upper steps of the West Pier, stopping to look at the scenery as we always do.</t2105> <t2106>The setting sun, very low on the horizon, was hiding behind Kettleness; the red light fell on East Cliff and the old abbey, and it seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow.</t2106> <t2107>We were silent for a few moments, and suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:</t2107>
<t2108>–Again with his red eyes!</t2108> <t2109>They are exactly the same.</t2109>
<t2110>That was such a strange expression, out of context, that it left me perplexed.</t2110>
<t2111>I moved away a little, just enough to see Lucy well without seeming to be looking at her, and I saw that she was in a state of drowsiness, with such a strange expression on her face that I couldn't decipher it; so I didn't say anything, but I followed her eyes.</t2111> <t2112>She seemed to be looking at our own seat, where at that moment a dark and solitary figure was sitting.</t2112>
<t2113>I myself felt a bit uneasy, for a few moments it seemed that the stranger had large eyes like blazing flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion.</t2113> <t2114>The red light of the sun was shining on the windows of St. Mary's Church, situated behind our seat, and as the sun set, there was just enough change in the refraction and reflection of the light to give the appearance that the light was moving.</t2114> <t2115>I drew Lucy's attention to this peculiar effect, and she seemed to come to herself with a start, though at the same time she seemed very sad.</t2115> <t2116>It is possible that she was thinking about the terrible night she had spent up there.</t2116> <t2117>We never talked about it; so I said nothing, and we went home to have dinner.</t2117> <t2118>Lucy had a headache and went to bed early.</t2118> <t2119>When I saw her asleep, I went out for a little walk by myself; I walked along the cliffs to the west, and I was filled with a sweet sadness, for I was thinking about Jonathan.</t2119> <t2120>Upon returning home (the moonlight was shining intensely; so intensely that, although the front of our part of the Crescent was in shadow, everything could be seen distinctly) I glanced at our window and saw Lucy's head leaning out.</t2120> <t2121>I thought she might be waiting for my return, so I opened my handkerchief and waved it.</t2121> <t2122>However, she did not notice it, she made no movement.</t2122> <t2123>At that moment, the moonlight crept around a corner of the building, and its rays fell upon the window.</t2123> <t2124>There was Lucy, with her head leaning against the side of the window sill, and her eyes closed.</t2124>
<t2125>She was deeply asleep, and next to her, perched on the windowsill, there was something that seemed to be a bird of regular size.</t2125> <t2126>I felt afraid that she might catch a cold, so I ran upstairs, but when I got to the room she was already back in bed, deeply asleep and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her neck, as if protecting it from the cold.</t2126>
<t2127>I did not wake her, but rather I covered her as best as I could; I checked that the door was well closed, and the window too.</t2127> <t2128>She is so sweet when she sleeps!</t2128> <t2129>But she is paler than usual, and in her eyes there is a tired, wan look that I do not like.</t2129> <t2130>I fear that she is troubled by something.</t2130> <t2131>I wish I could find out what it is.</t2131>
<t2132>August 15.</t2132> <t2133>I got up later than usual.</t2133> <t2134>Lucy is languid and tired, and she slept until after we had been called.</t2134> <t2135>At breakfast, we had a pleasant surprise.</t2135> <t2136>Arthur's father is improved, and he wants the wedding to take place as soon as possible.</t2136> <t2137>Lucy is full of quiet joy, and her mother is both happy and sad.</t2137> <t2138>She told me the reason later.</t2138> <t2139>She is melancholy about having to lose Lucy, but she is glad that soon she will have someone to protect her.</t2139> <t2140>Poor lady, so dear and sweet!</t2140> <t2141>She confided in me that she will soon die.</t2141> <t2142>She hasn't told Lucy anything, and she made me promise to keep the secret; her doctor has told her that within a few months, at most, she will die, as her heart is weakening.</t2142> <t2143>At any moment, even now, a sudden shock would almost certainly cause her death.</t2143> <t2144>Ah! We did well not to tell her about that terrible night of Lucy's sleepwalking.</t2144>
<t2145>August 17.</t2145> <t2146>I have not written anything for two consecutive days.</t2146> <t2147>I have not felt like doing it.</t2147> <t2148>A kind of dark fate seems to be looming over our happiness.</t2148> <t2149>No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be getting weaker and weaker, while her mother's hours are drawing to a final close.</t2149> <t2150>I do not understand how Lucy is fading away as she is.</t2150> <t2151>She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are withering and day by day she becomes weaker and more languid; at night I hear her gasping as if she were short of breath.</t2151> <t2152>I always have the key to the door tied to my wrist during the night, but she gets up and walks back and forth across the room, and sits by the open window.</t2152> <t2153>Last night I found her leaning out, and when I tried to wake her I could not; she was unconscious.</t2153> <t2154>When I managed to bring her to, she was extremely weak and was quietly crying between long and painful efforts to breathe.</t2154>
<t2155>When I asked her how she had been able to go to the window, she shook her head and turned it to the other side of the pillow.</t2155> <t2156>I hope her illness is not due to that ill-fated pinprick.</t2156> <t2157>I observed her throat once she had fallen asleep, and the punctures did not seem to have healed.</t2157> <t2158>The scars are still open, and even wider than before; their edges appear whitish, like small white spots with red centers.</t2158> <t2159>Unless they heal in a day or two, I will insist that the doctor sees them.</t2159>

<t2189>From the journal of Mina Murray</t2189>
<t2190>August 18th.</t2190> <t2191>Today I am very happy, and I am writing while sitting on the seat in the church cemetery.</t2191> <t2192>Lucy is much better.</t2192> <t2193>Last night she slept well all night, and did not bother me even once.</t2193> <t2194>It seems that the roses are returning to her cheeks, although she is still sadly pale and discolored.</t2194> <t2195>I would understand her situation if she were anemic, but that is not the case.</t2195> <t2196>She is in very good spirits, and full of life and joy.</t2196> <t2197>All that morbid reticence seems to have left her, and just a moment ago she reminded me, as if I needed reminding, of that night, and what happened here, on this very seat, where I found her asleep.</t2197> <t2198>As she spoke to me, she playfully tapped her boot heel on the tombstone, and said:</t2198>
<t2199>–My poor feet didn't make much noise back then!</t2199> <t2200>I dare say that poor Mr. Swales would have told me it was because I didn't want to wake Geordie.</t2200>
<t2201>Since she was so communicative, I asked her if she had had any dreams that night.</t2201> <t2202>Before answering me, that sweet and mischievous look appeared on her face, which Arthur (I call him Arthur out of her habit) says he loves; and, in fact, it doesn't surprise me that he does.</t2202> <t2203>Then, she continued in a dreamy manner, as if she were trying to remember what had happened.</t2203>
<t2204>–I didn't exactly dream, but everything seemed very real.</t2204> <t2205>I just wanted to be here in this place, without knowing why, because I was afraid of something, I don't know what.</t2205> <t2206>Although I suppose I was asleep, I remember passing through the streets and over the bridge.</t2206> <t2207>As I was passing, a fish jumped, I leaned down to see it and heard many dogs howling; so many that the whole town seemed to be filled with dogs howling at the same time, while I was climbing the steps.</t2207> <t2208>Then I had a vague sensation of something long and dark with red eyes, similar to what we saw at that sunset, and suddenly I was surrounded by something very sweet and very bitter at the same time; then it seemed to me that I was sinking into green and deep water, and I heard a buzzing sound like I've heard people say they feel when they are drowning; and then everything seemed to evaporate and move away from me; my soul seemed to leave my body and float in the air.</t2208> <t2209>I seem to remember that at one point the western lighthouse was right below me, and then there was a kind of pain, as if I were in an earthquake, and I came back to myself, and I discovered that you were shaking me.</t2209> <t2210>I saw you doing it before I could feel you.</t2210>
<t2211>Then she began to laugh.</t2211> <t2212>To me, all of that seemed dreadful, and I listened breathlessly.</t2212> <t2213>It was suspicious, and I thought it would be better if her mind did not dwell on the subject any longer, so we started talking about other things, and Lucy was like her old self.</t2213> <t2214>When we returned home, the fresh breeze had invigorated her, and her pale cheeks were truly rosier.</t2214> <t2215>Her mother rejoiced to see her like that, and we all spent a very happy evening together.</t2215>
<t2216>August 19.</t2216> <t2217>Joy, joy, joy!</t2217> <t2218>Although not everything is joy.</t2218> <t2219>Finally news from Jonathan.</t2219> <t2220>The poor thing has been sick, and that's why he hadn't written.</t2220> <t2221>I'm no longer afraid to think it or say it, now that I know.</t2221> <t2222>Mr. Hawkins handed me the letter, and he wrote to me himself.</t2222> <t2223>Oh! How kind!</t2223> <t2224>I'm going to leave tomorrow morning and go to Jonathan, to take care of him if necessary and bring him home.</t2224> <t2225>Mr. Hawkins says it wouldn't be bad if we could get married there.</t2225> <t2226>I have cried over the letter from the good sister, to the point that I can feel it wet against my chest, where I keep it.</t2226> <t2227>It is about Jonathan, and it must be close to my heart, since he is in my heart.</t2227> <t2228>I have planned and foreseen my trip, and my luggage is ready.</t2228> <t2229>I'll only take a change of clothes; Lucy will take my trunk to London and keep it until I send for it, because it may be that...</t2229> <t2230>I must not write anymore.</t2230> <t2231>I must save it all to tell Jonathan, my husband.</t2231> <t2232>The letter he has seen and touched must comfort me until we meet.</t2232>
<t2233>Letter from Sister Agatha, Hospital of San José and Santa María, in</t2233>
<t2234>Budapest, to Miss Willhelmina</t2234>
<t2235>Murray</t2235>
<t2236>August 12</t2236>
<t2237>"Dear Miss:"</t2237>
<t2238>"I am writing to you at the request of Mr. Jonathan Harker, as he himself is not strong enough to write, although he is improving thanks to God, Saint Joseph, and the Virgin Mary.</t2238> <t2239>He has been under our care for almost six weeks, as he suffers from a violent brain fever.</t2239> <t2240>He sends you his love, and asks me to tell you that I am writing to Mr. Peter Hawkins in Exeter by this same mail, to inform him, with the deepest respect, that he is very distressed by his delay, and that all his work has been completely finished.</t2240> <t2241>Mr. Harker will have to remain resting in our hospital in the mountains for a few more weeks, but then he will return.</t2241> <t2242>He wishes me to say that he does not have enough money with him, and that he would like to pay for his stay here, so that others in need do not go without receiving help.</t2242>
<t2243>"Consider me always at your service, with my affection and blessings,"</t2243>
<t2244>SISTER AGATHA.</t2244>
<t2245>"P. D.</t2245> <t2246>While my patient is asleep, I open this to inform you of the events.</t2246> <t2247>Mr. Harker has told me everything about you, and that soon you will be his wife.</t2247> <t2248>All blessings to you both!</t2248> <t2249>He has suffered a terrible shock, so says our doctor, and in his delirium his ravings have been terrible; of wolves, poison and blood, of ghosts and demons, and I fear to say what else.</t2249>
<t2250>Always be very careful with him so that in the future there is nothing similar to these things that can excite him; the traces of an illness like the one he has had do not disappear so easily.</t2250> <t2251>We would have written a long time ago, but we knew nothing about his friends, and he did not say anything that we could understand.</t2251> <t2252>He arrived on the train from Klausenburg and the guard was notified by the station master of that place, who came running into the station shouting for a ticket to return home.</t2252> <t2253>Seeing from his violent gestures that he was an Englishman, they gave him a ticket to the furthest station in this direction, to which the train goes.</t2253>
<t2254>"Be assured that we are taking good care of him.</t2254> <t2255>He has won all our hearts with his sweetness and gentleness.</t2255> <t2256>He is truly improving, and I have no doubt that in a few weeks he will be completely recovered.</t2256> <t2257>But for the sake of safety, take good care of him.</t2257> <t2258>Surely there are, as I ask God and Saint Joseph and Saint Mary, many, many happy years ahead for both of you.</t2258><t2259>"</t2259>
<t2260>From the journal of Dr. Seward</t2260>
<t2261>August 19.</t2261> <t2262>Strange and sudden changes in Renfield last night.</t2262> <t2263>Around eight o'clock, he began to get restless and sniff around everywhere, like a dog when hunting.</t2263> <t2264>My assistant was amazed by his behavior, and knowing my interest in him, encouraged him to talk.</t2264> <t2265>He is usually very respectful to my assistant, and sometimes even servile; but last night, the man told me, he behaved quite arrogantly.</t2265> <t2266>He wouldn't deign to speak to him for anything in the world.</t2266>
<t2267>All he said was:</t2267>
<t2268>–I don't want to talk to you: you don't matter anymore; the boss is near.</t2268> <t2269>My assistant believes that some sudden form of religious mania has taken hold of him.</t2269> <t2270>If so, we must be on alert for storms, as a strong man with homicidal and religious manias at the same time can be dangerous.</t2270> <t2271>At nine in the evening, I visited him myself.</t2271> <t2272>His attitude towards me was the same as with my assistant; in his extreme withdrawal into himself, the difference between me and my assistant seems null to him.</t2272> <t2273>It seems to me that it is a religious mania; very soon he will think he is God himself.</t2273> <t2274>The infinitesimal distinctions between one man and another are too petty for an omnipotent being.</t2274> <t2275>How exalted these madmen can become!</t2275> <t2276>The true God pays attention even when a sparrow falls; but the God created by human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow.</t2276> <t2277>Oh, if only men knew!</t2277>
<t2278>For half an hour or more, Renfield was becoming increasingly excited.</t2278> <t2279>I pretended not to be observing him, but I kept a strict watch on everything he did.</t2279> <t2280>Suddenly, that cloudy look appeared in his eyes that we always see when a madman has grasped an idea, and with it that sideways movement of the head and back that doctors come to know so well.</t2280> <t2281>He became quite calm, and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly, staring into empty space with dull eyes.</t2281>
<t2282>I thought I would find out if his apathy was real or just feigned, and I tried to engage him in a conversation about his animals, a topic that had always captured his interest.</t2282> <t2283>At first, he did not respond, but finally, he said, with visible ill humor:</t2283>
<t2284>–Who cares about them?</t2284> <t2285>I don't give a damn!</t2285>
<t2286>–What? – I said-.</t2286> <t2287>Are you no longer interested in spiders?</t2287>
<t2288>(Spiders are currently their biggest entertainment, and their notebook is filling up with columns of small numbers.)</t2288>
<t2289>To this, he responded enigmatically:</t2289>
<t2290>The wedding godmothers rejoice their eyes, which await the arrival of the bride; but when the bride goes to bed, then the godmothers do not shine to the eyes that are full.</t2290>
<t2291>He did not want to give any explanation for what was said but remained obstinately seated on the bed the entire time I was with him.</t2291>
<t2292>Tonight I am quite tired and discouraged.</t2292> <t2293>I can't stop thinking about Lucy, and how things would have been different. If I don't sleep immediately, chloral, the modern Morpheus: CHCl3CHO.</t2293> <t2294>I must be very careful not to get used to it.</t2294> <t2295>No, I won't take anything tonight!</t2295> <t2296>I've thought about Lucy, and I won't dishonor her by mixing her with the other.</t2296> <t2297>If it has to be this way, I'll spend the night awake...</t2297>
<t2298>Later.</t2298> <t2299>I am glad to have made that resolution; even more glad to have carried it out.</t2299> <t2300>I had been tossing and turning in bed for some time; and I had only heard the clock chime twice when the guard on duty came to see me, sent by my assistant, to tell me that Renfield had escaped.</t2300> <t2301>I dressed and ran down immediately; my patient is too dangerous a person to be at large.</t2301> <t2302>Those ideas he has can work dangerously in front of strangers.</t2302>
<t2303>The assistant was waiting for me.</t2303> <t2304>He told me that he had seen him less than ten minutes ago, apparently asleep on his bed, when he looked through the observation slit in the door.</t2304> <t2305>Then his attention was drawn by the noise of a window being forced open.</t2305> <t2306>He ran back and saw his feet disappearing through the window, and then quickly sent the guard to call me.</t2306> <t2307>Renfield was only in his nightclothes, so he couldn't have gone far.</t2307> <t2308>The assistant thought it would be more useful to see where he was going than to chase him, as he might lose sight of him while turning to exit through the building's door.</t2308>
<t2309>He was a stout man, and he couldn't get out through the window.</t2309> <t2310>I am slender, so with his help, I got out, but feet first, and since we were only a few feet above the ground, I fell without hurting myself.</t2310> <t2311>The assistant told me that the patient had run to the left and had disappeared in a straight line.</t2311> <t2312>So I hurried in the same direction as fast as I could; as I was crossing the belt of trees, I saw a white figure climbing the high wall that separates our grounds from those of the deserted house.</t2312>
<t2313>I immediately ran back and told the guard to bring three or four men and follow me to the Carfax grounds, in case our friend was going to behave dangerously.</t2313> <t2314>I myself got a ladder, and climbing over the wall, jumped to the other side.</t2314> <t2315>I could see Renfield's figure disappearing behind the corner of the house, so I ran after him.</t2315> <t2316>At the other end of the house, I found him leaning heavily against the old oak door, framed in iron, of the chapel.</t2316> <t2317>He was talking, apparently to someone, but I was afraid to get too close to hear what he was saying, as I might scare him and he would run off again.</t2317> <t2318>Chasing after a wandering swarm of bees is nothing compared to following a naked lunatic when he has got it into his head that he must escape!</t2318> <t2319>However, after a few minutes, I could see that he was unaware of anything happening around him, and I dared to get closer, especially since my men had jumped over the wall and were approaching him.</t2319> <t2320>I heard him say:</t2320>
<t2321>–I am here to fulfill your orders, master.</t2321> <t2322>I am your slave, and you will reward me, for I will be faithful.</t2322> <t2323>I have adored you for a long time and from afar.</t2323> <t2324>Now that you are near, I await your orders, and you will not forget me, will you, my dear master?, in your distribution of good things.</t2324>
<t2325>Anyway, he is an old and selfish beggar.</t2325> <t2326>He thinks about bread and fish even when he believes he is in a real presence.</t2326> <t2327>His obsessions make an astonishing combination.</t2327> <t2328>When we fell upon him, he fought like a tiger; he is very strong, and he behaved more like a wild beast than a man.</t2328> <t2329>I had never seen a lunatic in such a paroxysm of fury; and I hope never to see it again.</t2329> <t2330>It is a good thing that we found out his intentions and his strength in time.</t2330> <t2331>With a strength and determination like his, he could have done many barbarities before being caged.</t2331> <t2332>In any case, he is in a safe place.</t2332> <t2333>Not even Jack Sheppard himself could have escaped from the straitjacket that holds him, and he is also chained to the wall in the security cell.</t2333> <t2334>His screams are sometimes horrible, but the silences that follow are even more deadly, for in every turn and movement he manifests his desire to kill.</t2334>
<t2335>A few moments ago, he said these first coherent words:</t2335>
<t2336>–I will have patience, master.</t2336> <t2337>It's coming..., coming..., coming!</t2337>
<t2338>So I took his hint, and I also arrived.</t2338> <t2339>I was too excited to sleep, but this journal has calmed me down and I feel that tonight I will sleep a bit.</t2339>
<t2340>IX.– MINA HARKER'S LETTER TO LUCY WESTENRA</t2340>
<t2341>Budapest, August 24</t2341>
<t2342>"My dearest Lucy:</t2342>
<t2343>"I know you must be very anxious to know everything that has happened since we parted at the railway station in Whitby.</t2343> <t2344>Well, dear, I arrived in Hull without any trouble, took the boat to Hamburg, and then the train from there.</t2344> <t2345>I feel like I can barely remember what happened during the journey, except that I knew I was on my way to Jonathan, and that, as I would surely have to act as a nurse, it was best to sleep as much as I could…</t2345> <t2346>I found my beloved very thin, pale, and weak.</t2346> <t2347>All the strength has escaped from his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity that I have always told you he showed on his face has disappeared.</t2347> <t2348>He is only a shadow of what he was, and he remembers nothing of what has happened to him in recent times.</t2348> <t2349>At least, that is what he wants me to believe, and therefore I will never ask him.</t2349> <t2350>He has had a terrible experience, and I fear his poor brain will pay the consequences if he tries to remember.</t2350> <t2351>Sister Agatha, who is a wonderful nun and a born nurse, tells me that he raved about horrible things while his head was disturbed.</t2351> <t2352>I wanted her to tell me what it was about, but she only crossed herself and told me she would never say anything; that the ravings of the sick were secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation came to hear them, she must respect her vows.</t2352> <t2353>She is a sweet, good soul; and the next day, when she saw that I was very distressed, she herself brought up the subject again, and after saying that she would never mention what my poor patient raved about, she added: 'I can tell you this, dear: it was not about anything bad that he himself had done; and you, who will be his wife, have nothing to worry about.</t2353> <t2354>He has not forgotten you nor what he owes you.</t2354> <t2355>His fears were about great and terrible things, which no mortal should speak of.</t2355> <t2356>I believe the sweet sister thought I might be jealous, fearing that my beloved had fallen in love with another woman.</t2356>
<t2357>The idea that I could be jealous of Jonathan!.</t2357> <t2358>And yet, my dear Lucy, let me whisper to you that when I found out that it was not another woman causing all the trouble, I felt a rush of joy throughout my body.</t2358> <t2359>I am now sitting beside his bed, from where I can see his face as he sleeps.</t2359> <t2360>He is waking up…!</t2360>
<t2361>"Upon waking, he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to take something out of his pocket; I asked Sister Agatha if he could do it, and she brought all his things.</t2361> <t2362>I saw that among them was his notebook, and I was going to ask him to let me see it (for I knew that in it I might find some clue to his ailment), but I suppose he must have seen my desire in my eyes, for he told me to go to the window for a moment, as he wished to be alone for a while.</t2362> <t2363>Then he called me and said very solemnly:</t2363>
<t2364>"Willhelmina (I knew she wanted to speak to me with all seriousness, as she had never called me by my name since she asked me to marry her), you know, dear, my ideas about the trust that must exist between husband and wife: there should be no secrets, no hiding places between them.</t2364> <t2365>I have suffered a great shock, and when I try to think about what it was, I feel my head spinning, and I don't know if it was all real or the dreams of a madman.</t2365> <t2366>You know that I have had a brain fever, and that means being mad.</t2366> <t2367>The secret is here, and I do not wish to know it.</t2367> <t2368>I want to start my life anew at this moment, with our marriage.</t2368> <t2369>(For, my dear Lucy, we have decided to marry as soon as the formalities are arranged.)</t2369> <t2370>Do you wish, Willhelmina, to share my ignorance?</t2370> <t2371>Here is the book.</t2371> <t2372>Take it and keep it, read it if you want, but never mention to me what it contains; unless, of course, some solemn duty falls upon me and forces me to return to the bitter hours recorded here, asleep or awake, sane or mad.</t2372>
<t2373>"And upon saying that, he reclined exhausted, and I placed the book under his pillow and kissed him.</t2373> <t2374>I have asked Sister Agatha to plead with the superior that our wedding can take place this afternoon, and I am waiting for her response…</t2374>
<t2375>"He has returned and told me that they have already gone to fetch the chaplain of the English Mission church.</t2375> <t2376>We will get married within an hour, or as soon as Jonathan wakes up…</t2376>
<t2377>"Lucy, the time came and she left."</t2377> <t2378>I feel very solemn, but very, very happy.</t2378> <t2379>Jonathan woke up shortly after the hour, and everything was prepared; he sat on the bed, surrounded by pillows.</t2379> <t2380>He responded 'yes, I accept' with firmness and strength.</t2380> <t2381>I could barely speak; my heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me.</t2381>
<t2382>The sisters were all very refined.</t2382> <t2383>Never, never will I forget them, nor the serious and sweet responsibilities that have fallen upon me.</t2383> <t2384>I must tell you about my wedding gift...</t2384>
<t2385>When the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband, oh, Lucy! It's the first time I have written the words 'my husband'! When they had left me alone with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, wrapped it in white paper, tied it with a small pale blue ribbon that I wore around my neck, and sealed it over the knot with wax, using my wedding ring as a seal.</t2385>
<t2386>Then I kissed it and showed it to my husband; I told him that I would keep it that way, and that it would be an outward and visible sign for us throughout our lives that we trusted each other; that I would never open it, unless it was for his own good or to fulfill an unavoidable duty.</t2386> <t2387>Then he took my hand in his, and, oh, Lucy, it was the first time he took his wife's hands!, and he said they were the most beautiful things in the whole wide world, and that if necessary he would go through everything again to deserve them.</t2387> <t2388>The poor thing must have meant part of the past, but he still can't think about time, and it wouldn't surprise me if at first he mixed not only the months but also the years.</t2388>
<t2389>"Well, dear, what more can I say?</t2389> <t2390>I can only tell you that I am the happiest woman in this wide world, and that I had nothing to give him except myself, my life, and my trust, and with these things went my love and my duty for all the days of my life.</t2390> <t2391>And, dear, when he kissed me, and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn prayer between the two of us…</t2391>
<t2392>"Lucy, dear, do you know why I am telling you all this?</t2392> <t2393>Not only because it is so sweet for me, but also because you have been, and are, my dearest friend.</t2393> <t2394>It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you left the classroom to prepare yourself in the world of life.</t2394> <t2395>I want to see you now, and with the eyes of a very happy wife, to what duty has led me, so that in your own married life you too can be as happy as I am.</t2395> <t2396>My dear, may Almighty God make your life all that it promises to be: a long day of bright sunshine, without adverse winds, without forgetting duty, without distrust.</t2396> <t2397>I must not wish you to have no sorrows, for that can never be; but I do wish you to always be as happy as I am now.</t2397> <t2398>Goodbye, dear.</t2398>
<t2399>I will put this letter in the mail immediately, and perhaps I will write to you again very soon.</t2399>
<t2400>I must finish now, for Jonathan is waking up.</t2400> <t2401>I must attend to my husband!</t2401>
<t2402>"Who always loves you,</t2402>
<t2403>MINA HARKER</t2403>
<t2404>Letter from Lucy Westenra to Mina Harker</t2404>
<t2405>Whitby, August 30</t2405>
<t2406>"My dearest Mina:</t2406>
<t2407>"Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own home with your husband.</t2407> <t2408>I would like you to return soon so that you could spend some time here with us.</t2408> <t2409>The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it has done so with me.</t2409>
<t2410>I have a voracious appetite, I am full of life, and I sleep well.</t2410> <t2411>You will be pleased to know that I no longer sleepwalk.</t2411> <t2412>I believe I haven't moved from the bed for a week, that is, once I lie down at night.</t2412> <t2413>Arthur says I am getting fat.</t2413> <t2414>By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here.</t2414> <t2415>We take long walks, ride horses, row, play tennis, and fish together; I love him more than ever.</t2415>
<t2416>She tells me that she loves me more: but I doubt it, because at the beginning she told me that she couldn't love me more than she already did.</t2416> <t2417>But these are silly things.</t2417> <t2418>There she is, calling me, so that's all for today.</t2418>
<t2419>LUCY</t2419>
<t2420>"P.S. - Mom sends her regards.</t2420> <t2421>She seems to be quite a bit better, poor thing.</t2421><t2422>"</t2422>
<t2423>“P.S. again.</t2423> <t2424>We will get married on September 28th.</t2424><t2425>”</t2425>

<t2427>August 20.</t2427> <t2428>Renfield's case is becoming more and more interesting.</t2428> <t2429>For now, we have been able to establish that there are periods of decline in his passion.</t2429> <t2430>For a week after his first attack, he remained in perpetual violence.</t2430> <t2431>Then, one night, just as the moon rose, he calmed down and was murmuring to himself: "Now I can wait; now I can wait."</t2431> <t2432>The assistant came to call me, so I quickly ran downstairs to take a look at him.</t2432> <t2433>He was still in the straitjacket and in the security room; but the congested expression had disappeared from his face, and his eyes had something of their former pleading; I might almost say their "cringing" softness.</t2433> <t2434>I was satisfied with his current condition and gave orders for him to be released.</t2434> <t2435>My assistants hesitated, but finally carried out my wishes without protest.</t2435> <t2436>A strange thing was that the patient had enough good sense to notice their distrust, for, approaching me, he said in a whisper, while looking at them furtively:</t2436>
<t2437>–They think I can hurt you!</t2437> <t2438>Imagine that, me hurting you!</t2438> <t2439>Idiots!</t2439>
<t2440>It was somewhat consoling, for my feelings, to find myself dissociated even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but in any case, I do not understand his thoughts.</t2440> <t2441>Should I accept that I have something in common with him, so that being as we are, as we were, we must unite?</t2441> <t2442>Or does he have to obtain such a great benefit from me that my health is necessary to him?</t2442> <t2443>I will have to find out later.</t2443> <t2444>Tonight he will not speak.</t2444> <t2445>Not even the offer of a kitten, or even a big cat, is capable of tempting him.</t2445> <t2446>He only says: "I don't care about cats at all.</t2446> <t2447>Now I have more to think about, and I can wait; I can wait.</t2447><t2448>"</t2448>
<t2449>After a while, I left him.</t2449> <t2450>The assistant tells me that he was calm until a little before dawn and then began to show signs of nervousness.</t2450>
<t2451>Finally, he became violent, until, at last, he fell into a kind of paroxysm that exhausted him so much that, finally, he fainted into a kind of coma.</t2451>
<t2452>… Three nights in a row the same thing has happened: violent all day and calm from moonrise to sunrise.</t2452> <t2453>I really wish I could discover some clue to the cause.</t2453> <t2454>It almost seems as if there were some influence that comes and goes.</t2454> <t2455>What an idea!</t2455> <t2456>Tonight we are going to pit healthy brains against sick brains in a game.</t2456> <t2457>Once he escaped without our help.</t2457> <t2458>Tonight he will escape with it.</t2458> <t2459>We will give him the opportunity, and the men will be ready to follow him if necessary…</t2459>
<t2460>August 23.</t2460> <t2461>"The unexpected always happens."</t2461> <t2462>How well Disraeli knew life.</t2462> <t2463>When our bird found the cage open, it did not want to fly, so all our subtle preparations were for nothing.</t2463> <t2464>In any case, we have proven one thing: that periods of tranquility last a reasonable amount of time.</t2464> <t2465>In the future, we will be able to loosen the restrictions a bit for a few hours each day.</t2465> <t2466>I have given instructions to my night assistant to only lock him in the secure room once he has calmed down, until an hour before sunrise.</t2466> <t2467>The poor patient's body will enjoy this benefit, even if his mind cannot appreciate it.</t2467> <t2468>Stop! The unexpected!</t2468> <t2469>They are calling me: the patient has escaped again.</t2469>
<t2470>Later.</t2470> <t2471>Another night of adventures.</t2471> <t2472>Renfield cunningly waited until the attendant was entering the room to inspect.</t2472> <t2473>Then, he ran out beside him and flew down the corridor.</t2473> <t2474>I sent orders to the attendants to follow him.</t2474> <t2475>Again, he went directly to the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him in the same place, leaning against the old chapel door.</t2475> <t2476>When he saw me, he became furious, and if the attendants hadn't restrained him in time, he would have tried to kill me.</t2476> <t2477>While we were holding him, a strange thing happened.</t2477> <t2478>Suddenly, he redoubled his efforts, and then, just as suddenly, he regained his calm.</t2478> <t2479>I instinctively looked around, but I couldn't see anything.</t2479> <t2480>Then I caught the patient's eye and followed it, but I couldn't discover anything while looking at the moonlit sky, except for a large bat, flapping in its silent and ghostly journey towards the west.</t2480> <t2481>Bats usually circle indecisively, but this one seemed to go straight, as if it knew where it was heading or as if it had its own intentions.</t2481> <t2482>The patient calmed down more, and after a while, he said:</t2482>
<t2483>–You don't need to tie me up; I'll follow you calmly.</t2483>
<t2484>Without any other mishap, we returned to the house.</t2484> <t2485>I feel that there is something threatening in its calm, and I will not forget this night...</t2485>
<t2486>From the diary of Lucy Westenra</t2486>
<t2487>Hillingham, August 24th.</t2487> <t2488>I must imitate Mina and write things down in a book.</t2488> <t2489>That way, when we see each other we can have long talks.</t2489> <t2490>I wonder when that will be.</t2490> <t2491>I wish she were here with me again, for I feel so unhappy.</t2491> <t2492>Last night it seemed I was dreaming again like in Whitby.</t2492> <t2493>Perhaps it is the change of climate, or the fact that I am home again.</t2493> <t2494>Everything is dark and dreadful to me, for I cannot remember anything; but I am filled with a vague fear, and I feel weak and exhausted.</t2494> <t2495>When Arthur came to dinner he looked quite worried upon seeing me, and I did not have the spirit to try to appear cheerful.</t2495> <t2496>I wonder if I might sleep in mother's room tonight.</t2496> <t2497>I will invent an excuse and try...</t2497>
<t2498>August 25.</t2498> <t2499>Another bad night.</t2499> <t2500>My mother didn't seem to fall for my proposal.</t2500> <t2501>She herself doesn't seem to be doing so well, and there's no doubt that she worries a lot about me.</t2501> <t2502>I tried to stay awake, and for a while I managed; but when the clock struck twelve, it woke me from a stupor, so I must have been dozing off.</t2502> <t2503>There were some kind of flapping and scratching at the window, but I didn't pay them any mind, and since I don't remember what happened next, I suppose I must have fallen asleep.</t2503> <t2504>More nightmares.</t2504> <t2505>How I wish I could remember them!</t2505> <t2506>This morning I felt terribly weak.</t2506>
<t2507>My face is extremely pale, and my throat hurts.</t2507> <t2508>Something must be wrong with my lungs, as it seems I never inhale enough air.</t2508> <t2509>I will try to appear cheerful when Arthur arrives, because otherwise I know he will suffer greatly seeing me like this.</t2509>

<t2512>"My dear Jack:</t2512>
<t2513>"I want you to do me a favor.</t2513> <t2514>Lucy is sick; that is, she doesn't have any specific illness, but she looks sickly and is getting worse every day.</t2514> <t2515>I have asked her if there is any cause; I don't dare to ask her mother, as disturbing the poor lady's mind about her daughter would be fatal, since her own health is very poor.</t2515> <t2516>Mrs. Westenra has confided in me that her fate is already sealed (heart disease), although poor Lucy still doesn't know.</t2516> <t2517>I am sure that something is influencing the mind of my beloved fiancée.</t2517> <t2518>When I think of her, I almost get distracted; looking at her always gives me a start.</t2518> <t2519>I told her that I would ask you to see her, and although at first she had some reservations, I know why, old friend, she finally gave her consent.</t2519> <t2520>It will be a painful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for her good, and I must not hesitate to ask you, nor you to act.</t2520> <t2521>You can come to lunch at Hillingham tomorrow at two, so that Mrs. Westenra doesn't suspect anything, and after lunch, Lucy will find an opportunity to be alone with you.</t2521> <t2522>I will come at tea time, and we can leave together; I am full of anxiety, and I would like to talk to you alone as soon as you have seen her.</t2522> <t2523>Don't miss it!</t2523>

<t2531>Letter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood</t2531>
<t2532>September 2</t2532>
<t2533>"My dear old friend:</t2533>
<t2534>"Regarding Miss Westenra's health, I hasten to tell you immediately that in my opinion there is no functional disorder or disease that I am aware of.</t2534> <t2535>At the same time, I cannot in any way consider myself satisfied with her appearance; it is totally different from what it was the last time I saw her.</t2535> <t2536>Of course, you must keep in mind that I did not have the opportunity to conduct a thorough examination as I would have liked; our very friendship poses a small difficulty here that neither medical science nor custom can overcome.</t2536> <t2537>The best thing will be for me to tell you exactly what happened, leaving you free to draw your own conclusions to a certain extent.</t2537> <t2538>Then I will tell you what I have done and what I intend to do.</t2538>
<t2539>"I found Miss Westenra in quite good spirits.</t2539> <t2540>Her mother was present, and within a few seconds, I realized that she was trying by all means to deceive her mother, and thus spare her any anxieties.</t2540> <t2541>I have no doubt that she guesses, if she does not know, that there is a need for caution.</t2541> <t2542>We dined alone, and as we endeavored to appear cheerful, we achieved, as a sort of reward for our efforts, some real cheerfulness between us.</t2542> <t2543>Then, Mrs. Westenra retired to rest, and Lucy stayed with me.</t2543> <t2544>We went to her boudoir, and until we got there, her reserve did not change, as the servants were coming and going.</t2544>
<t2545>However, as soon as the door closed, the mask fell from his face, and he sank into an armchair with a great sigh, hiding his eyes with his hand.</t2545>
<t2546>When I saw that his animosity had failed, I immediately took advantage of his reaction to make a diagnosis.</t2546> <t2547>He told me very sweetly:</t2547>
<t2548>"I cannot tell you how much I detest having to talk to you about myself."</t2548>
<t2549>"I reminded her that a doctor's confidences were sacred, but that you were truly very anxious about her.</t2549> <t2550>She immediately grasped the meaning of my words and settled the whole matter with a couple of words.</t2550>
<t2551>"Tell Arthur anything you think is appropriate.</t2551> <t2552>I don't worry about myself, but about him!</t2552>
<t2553>"Therefore, I have the freedom to speak."</t2553>
<t2554>"I could easily tell that she is a bit low on blood, but I couldn't see the typical symptoms of anemia, and by chance, I actually had the opportunity to test the quality of her blood, because when opening a window that was nailed shut, a cord broke and she slightly cut her hand on the broken glass.</t2554> <t2555>In itself, it was an insignificant event, but it gave me an obvious opportunity, so I took a few drops of blood and analyzed them.</t2555> <t2556>The qualitative analysis shows that there are normal conditions, and moreover, I can infer, they indicate the existence of a vigorous state of health.</t2556> <t2557>In other physical matters, I was fully convinced that there is no need to fear; but since there must be a cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something mental.</t2557> <t2558>She complains of sometimes having difficulty breathing, and of having heavy, lethargic dreams with nightmares that frighten her, but which she cannot remember.</t2558> <t2559>She says that as a child she used to sleepwalk, and that while in Whitby the habit returned, and that once she walked out at night and went to East Cliff, where Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that lately this habit has disappeared again.</t2559> <t2560>I have been left with doubts, so I have done the best I know: I have written to my old friend and teacher, Professor Van Helsing, from Amsterdam, who is one of the most knowledgeable people about rare diseases in the world.</t2560> <t2561>I have asked him to come, and as you told me that all these things would be under your charge, I have mentioned you and your relationship with Miss Westenra.</t2561> <t2562>This, my old friend, is in deference to your wishes, for I feel too proud and too happy to be able to do whatever I can for her.</t2562> <t2563>I know that Van Helsing will do anything for me for a personal reason, so it doesn't matter why he comes, we must accept his wishes.</t2563> <t2564>He is an apparently very arbitrary man, but this is because he knows what he is talking about more than anyone else.</t2564> <t2565>He is a philosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of our time; and he has, I suppose, an absolutely open mind.</t2565> <t2566>This, with nerves of steel, a cool temperament, an indomitable resolution, self-control, and an exalted tolerance of virtues and blessings, and the kindest of the most sincere hearts that beat, form his equipment for the noble task he is performing for humanity, working both in theory and practice, for his vision is as broad as his sympathy.</t2566> <t2567>I tell you this so that you can know why I have so much confidence in him.</t2567> <t2568>I have asked him to come immediately.</t2568>
<t2569>Tomorrow I will see Miss Westenra again.</t2569> <t2570>We will meet in the city, so that I do not alarm her mother with my visit.</t2570>
<t2571>"Your friend,</t2571>

<t2575>to Dr. Seward</t2575>
<t2576>September 3</t2576>
<t2577>"My good friend:</t2577>
<t2578>"When I received your letter, I was already on my way to you."</t2578> <t2579>"Fortunately, I can leave immediately, without harm to any of those who have trusted me."</t2579>
<t2580>If the circumstances were different, it would be detrimental to those who have trusted me, for I go to my friend when he calls me to help those he cares about.</t2580> <t2581>Tell your friend that when you quickly sucked the venom of gangrene from my wound caused by that knife that our other friend, so nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants my help and you request it, than all that his great fortune can do.</t2581> <t2582>But it is a double pleasure to do it for him, your friend; and towards you I go.</t2582> <t2583>Have it ready, and please arrange it so, that we can see the young lady not so late tomorrow, for it is likely that I will have to return here that night.</t2583> <t2584>But if there is a need, I will return again three days later, and I will stay longer if necessary.</t2584> <t2585>Until then, my good friend John, goodbye.</t2585>
<t2586>VAN HELSING "</t2586>
<t2587>Letter from Dr. Seward to the Honorable Arthur Holmwood</t2587>
<t2588>September 3</t2588>
<t2589>"Dear Art:</t2589>
<t2590>"Van Helsing came and went.</t2590> <t2591>He went with me to Hillingham, and I found that, by Lucy's discretion, her mother had been invited out to dinner, so we were left alone with her.</t2591> <t2592>Van Helsing conducted a very thorough examination of the patient.</t2592>
<t2593>He agreed to communicate it to me, and I will advise you, since of course I was not present.</t2593> <t2594>He is, I fear, very worried, but he told me he needed to reflect.</t2594> <t2595>When I told him about our friendship and how you had confided the matter to me, he said: 'You must tell him everything you think.</t2595> <t2596>Tell him what I think, if you can guess, and you will guess.</t2596> <t2597>No; I am not joking.</t2597> <t2598>This is no joke, but life and death; perhaps more.'</t2598> <t2599>I asked him what he meant by that, as he was very serious.</t2599> <t2600>This happened when we had already returned to the city, and he was having a cup of tea before starting his return to Amsterdam.</t2600> <t2601>He did not give me any more clues.</t2601> <t2602>You must not be angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that his entire brain is working for her good.</t2602> <t2603>You can be sure that, in due time, he will speak with complete clarity.</t2603> <t2604>So I told him I would simply write a record of our visit, just as if I were doing a special descriptive article for the Daily Telegraph.</t2604> <t2605>He seemed not to take note of it, and only commented that the soot of London was not as bad as it used to be when he was a student here.</t2605> <t2606>I will receive his report tomorrow, if he has time to do it.</t2606> <t2607>In any case, I will receive a letter.</t2607>
<t2608>"Well, now, to the visit.</t2608> <t2609>Lucy was more cheerful than the day I first saw her, and she certainly seemed much better.</t2609> <t2610>She had lost some of that ghostly look that unsettles you so much, and her breathing was normal.</t2610> <t2611>She was very sweet with the professor (she always is), and tried to make him feel at ease; however, I could see that the poor girl was making a great effort.</t2611> <t2612>I think Van Helsing noticed it too, for under his thick eyebrows I saw that quick look that I know so well.</t2612>
<t2613>Then, he began to chat about all sorts of things except for us and illnesses, and he did it so cleverly that I could see how Lucy's feigned liveliness turned into reality.</t2613> <t2614>Then, without the change being noticeable, my teacher smoothly steered the conversation to the reason for his visit, and said calmly:</t2614>
<t2615>"My dear young lady, I have this great pleasure because you are charming.</t2615> <t2616>That is a lot, dear, even if he whom I do not see were here.</t2616> <t2617>They told me you were discouraged, and that you had a ghostly pallor.</t2617> <t2618>To them I say: bah! (and he snapped his fingers, adding afterwards):</t2618> <t2619>But you and I are going to show them how wrong they are.</t2619> <t2620>How can he (he said, and pointed at me with the same look and gesture with which he had once dismissed me from his class, or rather, after that occasion), how can he know anything about young people?</t2620> <t2621>He has his madmen with whom he plays, and to whom he returns happiness, along with the happiness of those who love him.</t2621> <t2622>It is quite a lot he does, and, oh!, but there are rewards, in the very act of being able to restore that happiness.</t2622> <t2623>More so with young ladies!</t2623> <t2624>He has no wife or daughter, and young people do not trust the young, but the old like me, who have already known so many pains and their causes.</t2624> <t2625>So, dear, we will send him to smoke a cigar in the garden, while you and I have a little confidential chat.</t2625>
<t2626>"I accepted the suggestion and left the room, until after a while the professor came out the window and asked me to come in.</t2626> <t2627>He seemed worried, but said: "I have conducted a thorough examination, but there is no functional cause.</t2627>
<t2628>I agree with you that there has been a lot of blood loss; there has been, but there is none now.</t2628> <t2629>Moreover, the young woman's general condition does not show any symptoms of anemia.</t2629>
<t2630>I have asked him to send me his maid so that I can ask her a couple of questions, in such a way that there is no chance of missing anything.</t2630> <t2631>I know very well what she will say.</t2631> <t2632>And yet, there is a cause; there is always a cause for everything.</t2632> <t2633>I must return home and think.</t2633> <t2634>You must send me the telegram every day; and if there is a reason, I will come again.</t2634> <t2635>The illness, for not being completely well is an illness, interests me and she interests me too, the sweet young lady.</t2635> <t2636>I adore her, and for her, if not for you, or for the illness, I will come.</t2636>
<t2637>"And as I tell you, he didn't want to say more, not even when we were alone.</t2637> <t2638>So it is, Art, that now you know everything I know.</t2638> <t2639>I will keep a strict watch.</t2639> <t2640>I hope your poor father continues to improve.</t2640> <t2641>It must be a terrible thing for you, my dear old friend, to be in such a position between two people who are so dear to you.</t2641> <t2642>I know your sense of duty towards your father, and you do well to be faithful to it; but if there is a need, I will send you a message to come immediately to where Lucy is; so do not distress yourself too much, unless you hear from me.</t2642><t2643>"</t2643>
<t2644>From the diary of Dr. Seward</t2644>
<t2645>September 4th.</t2645> <t2646>My zoophagous patient always keeps me interested.</t2646> <t2647>He has only had one attack, and that was yesterday at an unusual hour.</t2647> <t2648>Shortly before noon, he began to show signs of restlessness.</t2648> <t2649>The attendant recognized the symptoms and immediately called for help.</t2649>
<t2650>Fortunately, the men arrived running, and just in time, because at noon he became so furious that they had to use all their strength to hold him down.</t2650> <t2651>However, after about five minutes he began to calm down gradually, until he finally sank into a kind of melancholy, a state in which he has remained until now.</t2651> <t2652>The assistant tells me that his screams, during the paroxysm, were truly chilling; when I entered, I found myself with my hands full, attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by his behavior.</t2652> <t2653>In fact, I can quite understand the effect, because the noise of his screams disturbed even me, although I was far away, at a certain distance.</t2653> <t2654>We have just finished dinner at the asylum, and yet, my patient is still sitting in a corner muttering, with a gloomy, threatening, and distressing look.</t2654> <t2655>His face rather seems to indicate, instead of showing something directly.</t2655> <t2656>I cannot quite understand it.</t2656>
<t2657>Later.</t2657> <t2658>Another change in my patient.</t2658> <t2659>At five in the afternoon I went to see him and found him almost as cheerful as he used to be before.</t2659> <t2660>He was catching flies and eating them, and keeping track of his catches by making marks with his nails on the edge of the door between the channels of the filling.</t2660> <t2661>When he saw me, he approached me and apologized for his bad behavior, and begged me in a very humble and attentive manner to allow him to return to his room again and to give him his notebook.</t2661> <t2662>I thought it best to please him; so he is back in his room with the window open.</t2662> <t2663>He has spread the sugar from his tea on the window sill, and is once again devoted to his collection of flies.</t2663> <t2664>At the moment he is not eating them, but putting them in a box, just like before, and he is already examining the corners of his room to find spiders.</t2664> <t2665>I tried to get him to talk about what happened in the last few days, as any clue about his thoughts would be very useful to me, but he did not want to engage in conversation.</t2665> <t2666>For a few moments he put on a rather sad expression, and said in a muted voice, as if he were talking to himself rather than to me:</t2666>
<t2667>–Everything is over!</t2667> <t2668>Everything is over!</t2668> <t2669>He has abandoned me.</t2669> <t2670>I have no hope, unless I do it myself!</t2670>
<t2671>Then, suddenly, turning to me resolutely, he said:</t2671>
<t2672>–Doctor, would you be so kind as to give me a little more sugar?</t2672> <t2673>I think it would do me a lot of good.</t2673>
<t2674>–And the flies? – I asked him.</t2674>
<t2675>–Yes!</t2675> <t2676>Flies like it too, and I like flies; therefore, I like it.</t2676>
<t2677>And to think that there are people so ignorant that they believe a madman has no arguments!</t2677> <t2678>I gave him a double portion of sugar and left him happy, as I suppose a man can be happy in this world.</t2678> <t2679>I wish I could penetrate his mind.</t2679>
<t2680>Midnight.</t2680> <t2681>Another change in him.</t2681> <t2682>I had gone to visit Miss Westenra, whom I found much better, and had just returned; I was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset when I heard the madman scream.</t2682> <t2683>Since his room is on this side of the house, I could hear him better than in the morning.</t2683> <t2684>It was a very strong surprise for me, and with displeasure, I turned my gaze away from the wonderful smoky beauty of the sunset over London, with its fantastic lights and purplish shadows, and all the wonderful hues seen in the dirty clouds as well as in the dirty water, to realize the sad austerity of my own cold stone building, with its wealth of breathing miseries, and my own desolate heart that endures it.</t2684> <t2685>I reached the patient at the moment the sun was sinking, and from his window, I saw the red disk disappear.</t2685> <t2686>As it sank, the patient began to calm down, and as it completely disappeared, he slipped from the hands holding him, like an inert mass, falling to the ground.</t2686> <t2687>However, the intellectual recuperative power that lunatics have is wonderful, for after a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around.</t2687> <t2688>I signaled to the attendants not to restrain him, as I was anxious to see what he would do.</t2688> <t2689>He went directly to the window and cleaned off the remains of the sugar; then he took his box of flies and emptied it outside, subsequently throwing the box away; then he closed the window and, crossing the room, sat on his own bed.</t2689> <t2690>All this surprised me, so I asked him:</t2690>
<t2691>–Aren't you going to keep catching more flies?</t2691>
<t2692>–No -he replied to me-, I am tired of so much garbage!</t2692>
<t2693>Of course, it is a formidable and interesting case study.</t2693> <t2694>I wish I could have a slight insight into his mind, or the causes of his sudden passion.</t2694> <t2695>Wait: there may be, after all, a clue, if we can find out why today his paroxysms occurred at noon and not at sunset.</t2695> <t2696>Could it be possible that there are malignant influences of the sun at certain periods that affect certain natures, just as the moon affects others?</t2696> <t2697>We shall see.</t2697>

<t2710>X.– LETTER FROM DOCTOR SEWARD TO THE HONORABLE ARTHUR HOLMWOOD</t2710>
<t2711>September 6.</t2711>
<t2712>"My dear Art:</t2712>
<t2713>"My news today is not very good.</t2713> <t2714>This morning Lucy had relapsed a little.</t2714> <t2715>However, one good thing has come of it: Mrs. Westenra was naturally anxious about Lucy, and she consulted me professionally about her.</t2715> <t2716>I took the opportunity to tell her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was going to spend a few days with me, and that I would put Lucy under his care; so now we can come and go without causing her alarm, for a shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, combined with Lucy's weakness, could be disastrous for her.</t2716> <t2717>We are all full of tribulations, but, my old friend, God willing, we will be able to endure and overcome them.</t2717> <t2718>If there is any need, I will write to you, so if you don't hear from me, you can be sure that I am simply waiting.</t2718> <t2719>I am in a hurry.</t2719> <t2720>Goodbye.</t2720>
<t2721>Your friend forever,</t2721>
<t2722>JOHN SEWARD</t2722>
<t2723>From the journal of Dr. Seward</t2723>
<t2724>September 7.</t2724> <t2725>The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met on Liverpool Street was: "Have you told your friend, her fiancé?"</t2725>
<t2726>–No –I said–.</t2726> <t2727>I wanted to wait until I saw you first, as I mentioned in my telegram.</t2727> <t2728>I wrote a letter simply stating that you were coming, since Miss Westenra was not in good health, and that I would send more news later.</t2728>
<t2729>"Very well, very well, my friend," he told me.</t2729> <t2730>"It is better that he does not know yet; perhaps he will never come to know."</t2730> <t2731>"I hope so; but if it is necessary, then he will know everything."</t2731> <t2732>"And, my old friend John, let me warn you: you are dealing with madmen."</t2732> <t2733>"All men are more or less mad; and just as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal discreetly with God's madmen: the rest of the world."</t2733> <t2734>"You do not tell your madmen what you do or why you do it; you do not tell them what you think."</t2734> <t2735>"So you must keep knowledge in its place, where it can rest; where it can gather with its kind and procreate."</t2735> <t2736>"You and I will keep to ourselves what we know, as we have done so far..."</t2736>
<t2737>And upon saying this, he touched my heart and my forehead, and then he touched himself in a similar manner.</t2737>
<t2738>–For my part, I have some ideas for the moment.</t2738> <t2739>Later, I will present them to you.</t2739>
<t2740>–Why not now? – I asked him-.</t2740> <t2741>They might yield good results; we could reach some conclusion.</t2741>
<t2742>He looked at me intently, and said:</t2742>
<t2743>–My friend John, when the corn has grown, even before it has matured, while the sap of its mother earth is still in it, and the sun has not yet begun to paint it with its gold, the husband pulls his ear and rubs it between his rough hands, and cleans the green foliage, and tells you: "Look!: it is good corn; when the time comes, it will be a good grain.</t2743><t2744>"</t2744>
<t2745>I didn't see the application, and I told him.</t2745> <t2746>In response, he extended his arm and took my ear between his hands, pulling it playfully, as he used to do during his classes in the past, and said:</t2746>
<t2747>–The good husband says so because he knows, but not until then.</t2747> <t2748>But you don't find the good husband by digging up the planted corn to see if it grows; that's for children who play at being sowers.</t2748> <t2749>But not for those who have that trade as a means of subsistence.</t2749> <t2750>Do you understand now, friend John?</t2750> <t2751>I have sown my corn, and now nature has the job of making it grow; if it grows, then there is some hope; and I will wait until the grain begins to show.</t2751>
<t2752>Upon saying this, he stopped, as he evidently saw that I had understood him.</t2752>
<t2753>Then, he continued with all seriousness:</t2753>
<t2754>–You were always a careful student, and your case was always fuller than the others.</t2754> <t2755>Back then you were just a student; now you are a teacher, and I hope your good habits have not disappeared.</t2755> <t2756>Remember, my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not rely on the weaker.</t2756> <t2757>Even if you have not maintained the good practice, let me tell you that this case of our dear miss is one that may be, mind you, I say may be, of such interest to us and to others that all other cases are nothing compared to it.</t2757> <t2758>Take, then, good note of it.</t2758> <t2759>Nothing is too small.</t2759> <t2760>I give you a piece of advice: write down in the record even your doubts and conjectures.</t2760> <t2761>Later it might be interesting for you to see how much truth you can guess.</t2761> <t2762>We learn from failures; not from successes.</t2762>
<t2763>When I described Lucy's symptoms to him (the same as before, but infinitely more pronounced), he became very serious, but said nothing.</t2763> <t2764>He took a briefcase containing many instruments and medicines, "the horrible attire of our benevolent trade," as he had called it in one of his classes, the equipment of a professor of medical science.</t2764> <t2765>When we were shown in, Mrs. Westenra came out to meet us.</t2765> <t2766>She was alarmed, but not as much as I had expected to find her.</t2766>
<t2767>Nature, in one of its moments of good disposition, has decreed that even death has some antidote for its own errors.</t2767> <t2768>Here, in a case where any impression could be fatal, matters are arranged in such a way that, for one reason or another, non-personal things (not even the terrible change in her daughter, whom she loved so much) seem to reach her.</t2768> <t2769>It is something akin to how Mother Nature gathers around a foreign body and envelops it with some insensitive tissue, which can protect it from the harm it would otherwise be subjected to by contact.</t2769> <t2770>If this is an ordered selfishness, then we should refrain for a moment before condemning anyone for the defect of selfishness, for its causes may have deeper roots than we know so far.</t2770>
<t2771>I put my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology into practice and established the rule that she should not be present with Lucy, or think about her illness, except when absolutely necessary.</t2771> <t2772>She agreed readily; so readily that once again I saw the hand of nature protecting life.</t2772> <t2773>Van Helsing and I were led to Lucy's room.</t2773> <t2774>If I had been impressed seeing her yesterday, when I saw her today I was horrified.</t2774> <t2775>She was terribly pale; white as chalk.</t2775> <t2776>The red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently; it pained one to see or hear her breathing.</t2776> <t2777>Van Helsing's face became rigid as marble, and his eyebrows converged until they almost met over his nose.</t2777> <t2778>Lucy lay motionless and did not seem to have the strength to speak, so for a moment we all remained silent.</t2778> <t2779>Then, Van Helsing signaled to me and we quietly left the room.</t2779> <t2780>As soon as we closed the door, he walked quickly down the corridor to the next door, which was open.</t2780> <t2781>Then he quickly pushed me inside and closed it.</t2781>
<t2782>–My God! – he said-.</t2782> <t2783>This is terrible!</t2783> <t2784>There is no time to lose.</t2784> <t2785>He will die from lack of blood to keep the heart functioning.</t2785> <t2786>We must perform a blood transfusion immediately.</t2786> <t2787>You, or me?</t2787>
<t2788>–Master, I am younger and stronger; it should be me.</t2788>
<t2789>–Then, get ready immediately.</t2789> <t2790>I will bring my briefcase.</t2790> <t2791>I am already prepared.</t2791>
<t2792>I accompanied him downstairs, and as we descended, someone knocked on the hallway door.</t2792> <t2793>When we reached it, the maid had just opened the door and Arthur was swiftly entering.</t2793> <t2794>He ran towards me, speaking in an anguished whisper.</t2794>
<t2795>–Jack, I was very distressed.</t2795> <t2796>I read between the lines of your letter, and I have been in constant torment.</t2796> <t2797>My father is better, so I rushed here to see things for myself.</t2797> <t2798>Isn't this gentleman Dr. van Helsing?</t2798> <t2799>Doctor, I am very grateful that you have come.</t2799>
<t2800>When the professor's eyes first fell upon him, there was a glint of anger in them due to the interruption at such a moment: but upon seeing his sturdy proportions and recognizing the strong youthful manliness that seemed to emanate from him, his eyes brightened.</t2800> <t2801>Without any delay, he said to him while extending his hand:</t2801>
<t2802>–Young man, you have arrived just in time.</t2802> <t2803>You are the fiancé of our patient, correct?</t2803> <t2804>She is in bad shape; very, very bad.</t2804> <t2805>No, son, don't react like that -he said, seeing that my friend suddenly turned pale and sat in a chair almost fainting-.</t2805> <t2806>You are going to help her.</t2806> <t2807>You can do more than anyone else to keep her alive, and your courage is your best help.</t2807>
<t2808>–What can I do? – asked Arthur, with a hoarse voice-.</t2808> <t2809>Tell me and I will do it.</t2809> <t2810>My life is hers, and I would give up to the last drop of my blood to help her.</t2810>
<t2811>The professor had a strong sense of humor, and because I knew him so well, I could detect a trait of his in his response:</t2811>
<t2812>–My young friend, I do not ask so much of you; at least not the last one.</t2812>
<t2813>–What should I do?</t2813>
<t2814>There was fire in his eyes, and his nose quivered with emotion.</t2814> <t2815>Van Helsing patted him on the shoulder.</t2815>
<t2816>"Come on," he said to him.</t2816> <t2817>"You are a man, and a man is what we need."</t2817> <t2818>"You are better than me, and better than my friend John."</t2818>
<t2819>Arthur looked perplexed, and then my teacher began to explain to him kindly:</t2819>
<t2820>–The young lady is in a bad way, very bad.</t2820> <t2821>She needs blood, and blood must be given to her, or she will die.</t2821> <t2822>My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform what we call a blood transfusion: transferring blood from the full veins of one to the empty veins of another who is in need of it.</t2822> <t2823>John was going to give his blood, as he is younger and stronger than I am (and here Arthur took my hand and squeezed it tightly in silence), but now you are here; you are stronger than any of us, old or young, who spend much of our energy in the world of thought.</t2823> <t2824>Our nerves are not as steady nor is our blood as rich as yours!</t2824>
<t2825>Then Arthur turned to the eminent doctor and said to him:</t2825>
<t2826>–If you knew how happily I would die for her, then you would understand...</t2826>
<t2827>He stopped, with a kind of choking in his voice.</t2827>
<t2828>–Well done, young man! – said Van Helsing.</t2828> <t2829>In the not too distant future, you will be glad you did everything possible to help the one you love.</t2829> <t2830>Now come and remain silent.</t2830> <t2831>Before we proceed, you will kiss her once, but then you must leave: and you must leave at my signal.</t2831> <t2832>Do not say a word of this to the lady; you already know her condition!</t2832> <t2833>She must not have any impression; any upset would kill her.</t2833> <t2834>Come!</t2834>
<t2835>We all entered Lucy's room.</t2835> <t2836>At the teacher's suggestion, Arthur stayed outside.</t2836> <t2837>Lucy turned her head towards us and looked at us, but said nothing.</t2837>
<t2838>She was not asleep, but she was simply so weak that she could not make any effort.</t2838> <t2839>Her eyes spoke to us; that was all.</t2839> <t2840>Van Helsing took some things out of his bag and placed them on a small table out of her sight.</t2840> <t2841>Then, he mixed a narcotic and, approaching the bed, said to her cheerfully:</t2841>
<t2842>–Well, miss, here is your medicine.</t2842> <t2843>Take it all like a good girl.</t2843> <t2844>See; I will lift you up so you can swallow easily.</t2844> <t2845>Like this.</t2845>
<t2846>He made the effort with good results.</t2846>
<t2847>I was surprised at how long it took for the drug to take effect.</t2847> <t2848>This, in fact, was a clear symptom of its weakness.</t2848> <t2849>The time seemed endless until sleep began to flutter on their eyelids.</t2849> <t2850>However, in the end, the narcotic began to manifest its potency, and they fell into a deep sleep.</t2850> <t2851>When the professor was satisfied, he called Arthur into the room and asked him to take off his jacket.</t2851> <t2852>Then he added:</t2852>
<t2853>–You can give that short kiss while I bring the table.</t2853> <t2854>Friend John, help me!</t2854>
<t2855>Thus, neither of us saw while he leaned over her.</t2855> <t2856>Then, turning to me, Van Helsing said:</t2856>
<t2857>–She is so young and so strong, and of such pure blood, that we do not need to defibrinate her.</t2857>
<t2858>Then, quickly but methodically, Van Helsing carried out the operation.</t2858>
<t2859>As it was being done, something like life seemed to return to the cheeks of poor Lucy, and through Arthur's growing paleness, the joy on his face seemed to shine.</t2859>
<t2860>After a short time, I began to feel anguish, for despite Arthur being a strong man, the loss of blood was already affecting him.</t2860> <t2861>This gave me an idea of the terrible strain Lucy's body must have been under, since what weakened Arthur only partially improved her.</t2861> <t2862>But my master's face was rigid, and he stood with the watch in his hand and his gaze fixed sometimes on the patient, sometimes on Arthur.</t2862> <t2863>I could hear the beating of my heart.</t2863> <t2864>Finally, he said in a low voice:</t2864>
<t2865>–Don't move for a moment.</t2865> <t2866>That's enough.</t2866> <t2867>You take care of him; I'll take care of her.</t2867>
<t2868>When everything was over, I could see how Arthur was weakened.</t2868> <t2869>I bandaged his wound and took him by the arm to help him out, when Van Helsing spoke without turning; the man seemed to have eyes in the back of his head.</t2869>
<t2870>–The brave groom, I think, deserves another kiss, which he shall have immediately.</t2870>
<t2871>And since he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the pillow under the patient's head.</t2871> <t2872>In doing so, the narrow velvet ribbon that she always seemed to wear around her throat, fastened with an old diamond brooch her boyfriend had given her, slid up a bit and revealed a red mark on her throat.</t2872> <t2873>Arthur didn't notice it, but I could hear the deep hiss of inhaled air, which is one of the ways van Helsing betrays his emotion.</t2873> <t2874>He said nothing at the moment, but turned to me and said:</t2874>
<t2875>–Now, go down with our brave groom, give him some wine, and let him rest for a while.</t2875> <t2876>Then you must go home and rest; sleep a lot and eat a lot, so you can recover what you have given to your love.</t2876> <t2877>You must not stay here.</t2877> <t2878>Wait a moment!</t2878> <t2879>I presume, sir, that you are anxious about the result; then take him with you, since the operation has been successful anyway.</t2879> <t2880>You have saved his life this time, and you can go home and rest peacefully, as everything that needed to be done has been done.</t2880> <t2881>I will tell her what happened when she is well; I don't think she will stop loving you for what you have done.</t2881> <t2882>Goodbye.</t2882>
<t2883>When Arthur had gone, I returned to the room.</t2883> <t2884>Lucy was sleeping peacefully, but her breathing was stronger; I could see the quilt rise as she breathed.</t2884> <t2885>Next to her bed sat Van Helsing, watching her intently.</t2885> <t2886>The velvet choker covered the red mark.</t2886> <t2887>I asked the professor:</t2887>
<t2888>–What do you think about that mark on your throat?</t2888>
<t2889>–And you, what do you think?</t2889>
<t2890>–I still haven't examined it -I replied, and at that very moment, I proceeded to unfasten the necklace.</t2890>
<t2891>Precisely over the external jugular vein, there were two punctures, not large, but neither did they bode well.</t2891> <t2892>There was no sign of infection, but the edges were white and seemed worn, as if they had been mistreated.</t2892> <t2893>At the moment, it occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it was, could be the means of the evident blood loss; but I abandoned the idea as soon as I had formulated it, for such a thing could not be.</t2893> <t2894>The entire bed would have been soaked red with the blood the girl must have lost to have a pallor like the one she showed before the transfusion.</t2894>
<t2895>–Well? – said van Helsing.</t2895>
<t2896>–Well -I said-, I can't explain what it could be.</t2896>
<t2897>My teacher stood up.</t2897>
<t2898>–I must return to Amsterdam tonight -he said-.</t2898> <t2899>There are books and documents there that I wish to consult.</t2899> <t2900>You must stay here all night, and you must not take your eyes off him.</t2900>
<t2901>–Should I hire a nurse? – I asked him.</t2901>
<t2902>–We are the best nurses, you and I.</t2902> <t2903>You watch over her all night; make sure she eats well and that nothing bothers her.</t2903> <t2904>You must not sleep all night.</t2904> <t2905>Later we can sleep, you and I.</t2905> <t2906>I will return as soon as possible, and then we can start.</t2906>
<t2907>–Can we start? – I said-.</t2907> <t2908>What do you mean by that?</t2908>
<t2909>–We'll see about that! – replied my teacher, as he hurriedly left.</t2909>
<t2910>He returned a moment later, poked his head through the door, and said, raising a finger in warning: "Remember: she is your responsibility."</t2910> <t2911>"If you leave her and something happens, you will not be able to sleep peacefully in the future!"</t2911>
<t2912>From the diary of Dr. Seward (continued)</t2912>
<t2913>September 8.</t2913> <t2914>I spent the whole night sitting beside Lucy.</t2914> <t2915>The sedative lost its effect at dusk, and she woke up naturally; she seemed like a different person from who she had been before the operation.</t2915> <t2916>Her mood was excellent, and she was full of cheerful vivacity, but I could see the traces of the extreme exhaustion she had gone through.</t2916> <t2917>When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had ordered that I sit beside her, she almost scoffed at the idea, pointing out her daughter's renewed strength and excellent mood.</t2917> <t2918>However, I stood firm and made preparations for my long vigil.</t2918> <t2919>When her maid had prepared her for the night, I entered, having dined in the meantime, and took a seat beside her bed.</t2919> <t2920>She made no objection, but simply looked at me with gratitude whenever I could catch her eyes.</t2920> <t2921>After a long while, she seemed about to fall asleep, but with an effort, she seemed to recover and shake off the sleep.</t2921> <t2922>This happened several times, with more effort and shorter pauses as time went by.</t2922> <t2923>It was apparent that she did not want to sleep, so I addressed the matter immediately:</t2923>
<t2924>–Don't you want to fall asleep?</t2924>
<t2925>–No.</t2925> <t2926>I'm scared.</t2926>
<t2927>–Fear of falling asleep!</t2927> <t2928>Why?</t2928> <t2929>It is a blessing that we all long for.</t2929>
<t2930>–Ah!</t2930> <t2931>Not if you were like me.</t2931> <t2932>If sleep were a harbinger of horror for you...!</t2932>
<t2933>–A premonition of horror!</t2933> <t2934>What do you mean by that?</t2934>
<t2935>–I don't know, alas, I don't know.</t2935> <t2936>And that is what makes it so terrible.</t2936> <t2937>All this weakness comes to me while I sleep; in such a way that now even the very idea of sleeping frightens me.</t2937>
<t2938>–But, my dear girl, you can sleep tonight.</t2938> <t2939>I will be here watching over your sleep, and I can promise you that nothing will happen.</t2939>
<t2940>–Ah! I can trust you!</t2940>
<t2941>I seized the opportunity and said:</t2941>
<t2942>–I promise that if I see any evidence of nightmares, I will wake you up immediately.</t2942>
<t2943>–Will you do it? Really?</t2943> <t2944>You are so good to me!</t2944> <t2945>Then, I will sleep.</t2945>
<t2946>And almost at the same time, she let out a deep sigh of relief and sank into the pillow, asleep.</t2946>
<t2947>All night I stayed by her side.</t2947> <t2948>She did not move even once, but slept with a calm, restorative sleep.</t2948> <t2949>Her lips were slightly parted, and her chest rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum.</t2949> <t2950>A smile was drawn on her face, and it was evident that no nightmares had come to disturb the peace of her mind.</t2950>
<t2951>Early in the morning, his maid arrived; I left her in charge of him and returned home, as I was worried about many things.</t2951> <t2952>I sent a short telegram to van Helsing and Arthur, informing them of the excellent result of the transfusion.</t2952> <t2953>My own work, with all its setbacks, kept me busy throughout the day; it was already dark when I had the opportunity to inquire about my zoophagous patient.</t2953> <t2954>The report was good; he had been calm during the last day and the last night.</t2954>
<t2955>While I was having dinner, I received a telegram from Van Helsing, from Amsterdam, suggesting that I go to Hillingham at night, as it might be convenient to be nearby, and letting me know that he would leave with the night mail and would reach me early in the morning.</t2955>
<t2956>September 9.</t2956> <t2957>I was quite tired when I arrived at Hillingham.</t2957> <t2958>For two nights I had barely been able to sleep, and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness that indicates cerebral exhaustion.</t2958> <t2959>Lucy was up and cheerful.</t2959>
<t2960>As he shook my hand, he looked me straight in the face and said:</t2960>
<t2961>–You will not sit up all night.</t2961> <t2962>You are exhausted.</t2962> <t2963>I am quite well again; in fact, I feel perfectly fine, and if anyone is going to take care of someone, then I will be the one to take care of you.</t2963>
<t2964>I didn't have the energy to argue, so I went to have dinner.</t2964>
<t2965>Lucy went up with me, and invigorated by her charming presence, I ate with quite an appetite and had a couple of glasses of the finest port.</t2965> <t2966>Then Lucy led me upstairs and showed me a room adjacent to hers, where a cozy fireplace was lit.</t2966>
<t2967>"Now," she said, "you must stay here."</t2967> <t2968>"I will leave this door open, and also my door."</t2968> <t2969>"You can lie on the sofa, for I know that nothing could induce a doctor to rest properly in a bed while there is a patient nearby."</t2969> <t2970>"If I need anything, I will shout, and you can be by my side in a moment."</t2970>
<t2971>I could do nothing but nod, as I was dead tired, and I wouldn't have been able to stay seated even if I had tried.</t2971> <t2972>So, making him renew his promise to call me if he needed anything, I lay down on the sofa and completely forgot about everything.</t2972>
<t2973>From the diary of Lucy Westenra</t2973>
<t2974>September 9.</t2974> <t2975>I feel happy tonight.</t2975> <t2976>I have been so tremendously weak that being able to think and move is like feeling the sun's rays after a long period of east wind and cloudy, gray skies.</t2976> <t2977>Arthur feels very close to me.</t2977> <t2978>I seem to feel his warm presence around me.</t2978> <t2979>I suppose it is because illness and weakness make one selfish, turning our inner eyes and sympathy upon ourselves, while health and strength give free rein to love, and in thought and feeling one can go wherever one wishes.</t2979> <t2980>I know where my thoughts are.</t2980> <t2981>If only Arthur knew!</t2981> <t2982>My dear, your ears must be buzzing while you sleep, just as mine buzz when I walk.</t2982> <t2983>Oh, the wonderful rest of last night!</t2983> <t2984>How I slept, with dear, good Dr. Seward watching over me.</t2984> <t2985>And tonight I will not be afraid to sleep, as he is very close and I can call him.</t2985> <t2986>Thanks to everyone for being so good to me!</t2986> <t2987>Thank God!</t2987> <t2988>Good night, Arthur.</t2988>
<t2989>From the journal of Dr. Seward</t2989>
<t2990>September 10th.</t2990> <t2991>I became aware of the professor's hand on my head, and I woke up suddenly in an instant.</t2991> <t2992>That is one of the things we at least learn in an asylum.</t2992>
<t2993>–And how is our patient?</t2993>
<t2994>–Well, when I left her, or rather, when she left me -I replied to him.</t2994>
<t2995>–Come on, let's see -he said, and together we entered the adjoining room.</t2995>
<t2996>The lattice was lowered, and I raised it very carefully while Van Helsing advanced, with his soft, feline step, towards the bed.</t2996>
<t2997>When I raised the lattice and the morning light flooded the room, I heard the professor's faint hiss of intake, and knowing his peculiarity, a mortal fear froze my blood.</t2997> <t2998>As I approached, he stepped back, and his exclamation of horror, "Gott in Himmel!" did not need the reinforcement of his pained face.</t2998> <t2999>He raised his hand and pointed towards the bed, and his iron face was furrowed and white as ash.</t2999> <t3000>I felt my knees begin to tremble.</t3000>
<t3001>There on the bed, in an apparent faint, lay poor Lucy, more terribly white and pale than ever.</t3001> <t3002>Even her lips were white, and her gums seemed to have shrunk back behind her teeth, as we sometimes see in bodies after a prolonged illness.</t3002> <t3003>Van Helsing lifted his foot to kick in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habits restrained him, and he placed it back down gently.</t3003>
<t3004>–Quick! – he told me-.</t3004> <t3005>Bring the brandy,</t3005>
<t3006>I flew to the dining room and came back with the bottle.</t3006> <t3007>He moistened the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed the palms, wrists, and heart.</t3007> <t3008>He listened to the heart, and after a few moments of agonizing wait, he said: "It is not too late."</t3008> <t3009>It still beats, although very weakly.</t3009> <t3010>All our work has been lost; we must start again.</t3010> <t3011>There is no young Arthur here now; this time I have to ask you yourself to donate your blood, friend John.</t3011>
<t3012>And as he spoke, he reached into the briefcase and took out the instruments for the transfusion; I took off my jacket and rolled up the sleeve of my shirt.</t3012> <t3013>In such a situation, there was no possibility of using a soporific, but there was also no need for one; and so, without losing a moment, we began the transfusion.</t3013> <t3014>After a certain amount of time (it didn't seem so short either, as the flow of one's own blood, no matter how joyfully it is viewed, is a terrible sensation), Van Helsing raised a finger in warning:</t3014>
<t3015>–Don't move -he told me-, because I fear that when she regains her strength, she will wake up; and that would be very, very dangerous.</t3015> <t3016>But I will be cautious.</t3016> <t3017>I will give her a hypodermic injection of morphine.</t3017>
<t3018>Then he proceeded, swiftly and surely, to carry out his plan.</t3018> <t3019>The effect on Lucy was not bad, as the fainting seemed to subtly transform into a narcotic sleep.</t3019> <t3020>It was with a feeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tint of color slowly return to her pale cheeks and lips.</t3020> <t3021>No man knows, until he experiences it, what it is to feel his own blood being transferred to the veins of the woman he loves.</t3021>
<t3022>The professor was looking at me critically.</t3022>
<t3023>–That is enough, he said.</t3023>
<t3024>–Already? – I protested.</t3024> <t3025>You took quite a bit more from Art.</t3025>
<t3026>To which he smiled with a kind of sad smile, and replied to me:</t3026>
<t3027>–He is her boyfriend, her fiancé.</t3027> <t3028>You have work, a lot of work to do for her and for others; and with what we have provided, it is enough.</t3028>
<t3029>When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy while I applied digital pressure to my own wound.</t3029> <t3030>I lay down, waiting for him to have time to attend to me, as I felt weak and a bit dizzy.</t3030> <t3031>After a while, he bandaged my wound and sent me downstairs to drink a glass of wine.</t3031> <t3032>As I was leaving the room, he came behind me and whispered:</t3032>
<t3033>–Remember: you must not say anything about this.</t3033> <t3034>If our young lover appears unexpectedly, like last time, not a word to him.</t3034> <t3035>On one hand, it would scare him, and on top of that, it would make him jealous.</t3035> <t3036>There must be none of that, right?</t3036>
<t3037>When I returned, he examined me carefully and said:</t3037>
<t3038>–You are not much worse.</t3038> <t3039>Go to your room and rest on the sofa for a while; then have a good breakfast, and come back here again.</t3039>
<t3040>I followed his orders, for I knew how correct and wise they were.</t3040> <t3041>I had done my part and now my next duty was to regain my strength.</t3041> <t3042>I felt very weak, and in the weakness, I lost some of the pleasure of what had happened.</t3042> <t3043>I fell asleep on the sofa; however, I kept wondering over and over again how it was that Lucy had made such a retrograde move, and how she had been able to lose so much blood without leaving any trace of it anywhere.</t3043> <t3044>I think I must have continued wondering this in my sleep, for, sleeping and walking, my thoughts always returned to the tiny punctures in her throat and the withered and battered appearance of their edges despite how small they were.</t3044>
<t3045>Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke up she was quite well and strong, though not as much as the day before.</t3045> <t3046>When Van Helsing had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge of her, with strict instructions not to leave her for a moment.</t3046> <t3047>I could hear his voice in the corridor, asking which way to the nearest telegraph office.</t3047>
<t3048>Lucy chatted with me cheerfully, and seemed completely unaware of what had happened.</t3048> <t3049>I tried to keep her entertained and interested.</t3049> <t3050>When her mother came up to see her, she didn't seem to notice any change in her, and only said to me gratefully: We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for everything you have done!</t3050> <t3051>But really now you must be careful not to overwork yourself.</t3051> <t3052>You look a bit pale yourself.</t3052> <t3053>You need a woman to serve as a nurse and take care of you a bit; that's what you need!</t3053>
<t3054>As she spoke, Lucy blushed, although it was only momentarily, for her poor worn-out veins could not withstand the sudden rush of blood to her head.</t3054> <t3055>The reaction came as an excessive paleness when she turned her imploring eyes towards me.</t3055> <t3056>I smiled and shook my head, and brought my finger to my lips; exhaling a sigh, the young woman sank back into her pillows.</t3056>
<t3057>Van Helsing returned after a few hours and said to me:</t3057>
<t3058>–Now you go home, and eat a lot and drink plenty.</t3058> <t3059>Recover.</t3059> <t3060>I will stay here tonight, and I will sit myself next to the young lady.</t3060> <t3061>You and I must observe the case, and we cannot allow anyone else to know.</t3061> <t3062>I have strong reasons.</t3062> <t3063>No, do not ask me about them; think what you want.</t3063> <t3064>Do not be afraid to think even the most improbable.</t3064> <t3065>Good night.</t3065>
<t3066>In the hallway, two of the maids came to me and asked if they or any of them could stay the night with Miss Lucy.</t3066> <t3067>They implored me to let them, and when I told them it was an order from Dr. Van Helsing that either he or I should watch over her, they asked me to intercede with the "foreign gentleman."</t3067> <t3068>I was very moved by that kindness.</t3068> <t3069>Perhaps because I am weak at the moment, and perhaps because it was for Lucy that their devotion was manifested; for time and again I have seen similar displays of women's kindness.</t3069> <t3070>I returned here in time for lunch; I made all my visits and all my patients were well; and then I sat down while I waited for sleep to come.</t3070> <t3071>It is coming now.</t3071>
<t3072>September 11th.</t3072> <t3073>This afternoon I went to Hillingham.</t3073> <t3074>I found van Helsing in excellent spirits and Lucy much better.</t3074> <t3075>Shortly after my arrival, the mail brought a very large package for the professor.</t3075> <t3076>He opened it quite hastily, or so it seemed to me, and showed me a large bouquet of white flowers.</t3076>
<t3077>–These are for you, Miss Lucy -he said.</t3077>
<t3078>–For me? Oh, Doctor Van Helsing!</t3078>
<t3079>–Yes, dear, but not for playing with them.</t3079> <t3080>These are medicines.</t3080>
<t3081>Lucy made a charming pout.</t3081>
<t3082>–No, but it is not for you to take them cooked or in an unpleasant form; you don't need to wrinkle your charming little nose, or I will have to inform my friend Arthur of the dangers he will have to endure seeing such beauty, which he loves so much, distorted in that way.</t3082> <t3083>Aha, my beautiful lady, that's it: such a pretty nose is very straight again.</t3083> <t3084>This is medicinal, but you don't know how.</t3084> <t3085>I put it on your window, make a beautiful garland, and hang it around your neck so you can sleep well.</t3085> <t3086>Yes; these flowers, like lotus flowers, make one forget their sorrows.</t3086> <t3087>They smell like the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the conquerors sought in Florida, and found, but too late.</t3087>
<t3088>While she was talking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them.</t3088> <t3089>Then she threw them away, saying, half laughing and half serious:</t3089>
<t3090>–Professor, I think you are just playing a joke on me.</t3090> <t3091>These flowers are nothing but common garlic.</t3091>
<t3092>To my surprise, Van Helsing stood up and said with complete seriousness, his rigid steel jaw and thick eyebrows meeting:</t3092>
<t3093>–There is no game in this!</t3093> <t3094>I never joke!</t3094> <t3095>There is a serious purpose in what I do, and I warn you not to frustrate me.</t3095> <t3096>Take care, for the love of others if not for the love of yourself -he added, but seeing that poor Lucy had become frightened as she had every right to be, he continued in a softer tone-: Oh, miss, my dear, do not fear me!</t3096> <t3097>I only do this for your good; but there is much virtue for you in these common flowers.</t3097> <t3098>See, I will place them in your room myself.</t3098> <t3099>I will make the garland that you must wear myself.</t3099> <t3100>But be careful!</t3100> <t3101>You must not tell those who ask indiscreet questions.</t3101> <t3102>We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience; and obedience will bring you strong and healthy to the arms that await you.</t3102> <t3103>Now sit quietly for a while.</t3103> <t3104>Come with me, friend John, and help me cover the room with my garlic, which comes from very far away, from Haarlem, where my friend Vanderpool grows them in his greenhouses all year round.</t3104> <t3105>I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here today.</t3105>
<t3106>We entered the room, carrying the flowers with us.</t3106> <t3107>The professor's actions were truly strange, and I don't think one could find any pharmacopoeia in which I could find news.</t3107> <t3108>First, he closed the windows and secured them with a latch; then, taking a bouquet of flowers, he rubbed them on the guillotines, as if to ensure that every breath of air passing through them was laden with the smell of garlic.</t3108> <t3109>Afterwards, with the bunch, he rubbed the door jambs, up, down, and on each side, and around the fireplace in the same manner.</t3109> <t3110>Everything seemed very grotesque to me, and at the moment I said to the professor:</t3110>
<t3111>–Well, professor, I know that you always have a reason for what you do, but this truly leaves me perplexed.</t3111> <t3112>It's a good thing there are no skeptics around, or they would say that you are casting a spell to keep an evil spirit away.</t3112>
<t3113>–Maybe I am! – she quickly responded to me, while she began to make the garland that Lucy had to wear around her neck.</t3113>
<t3114>Then we waited until Lucy had finished getting ready for the night, and when she was already in bed, he himself placed the garlic wreath around her neck.</t3114> <t3115>The last words he said to her were:</t3115>
<t3116>–Be careful and do not disturb her; and although the room smells bad, do not open the window or the door tonight.</t3116>
<t3117>–I promise - said Lucy, and a thousand thanks to both of you for all your kindness towards me.</t3117> <t3118>Oh! What have I done to be blessed with such good friends?</t3118>
<t3119>When we left the house in my carriage, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:</t3119>
<t3120>–Tonight I can sleep in peace, and I want to sleep: two nights of travel, a lot of reading during the intermediate day, a lot of anxiety the next day, and a sleepless night, without closing my eyes.</t3120> <t3121>Tomorrow early in the morning come by for me, and we will go together to see our pretty young lady, much stronger because of my "spell" that I have cast.</t3121> <t3122>Ho!, ho!</t3122>
<t3123>He was so confident that I, recalling my own confidence from two nights before and the painful results, felt a deep and vague fear.</t3123> <t3124>It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell my friend, but I felt it nonetheless, like held-back tears.</t3124>
<t3125>XI.–</t3125> <t3126>LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY</t3126>
<t3127>September 12.</t3127> <t3128>How good everyone is to me!</t3128> <t3129>I almost feel that I love that adorable Dr. van Helsing.</t3129> <t3130>I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers.</t3130> <t3131>He really scared me.</t3131> <t3132>He seemed so serious!</t3132> <t3133>However, he must have been right, for I already feel the relief that comes from them.</t3133> <t3134>For some reason, I am not afraid to be alone tonight, and I can go to bed without fear.</t3134> <t3135>I won't mind the fluttering outside the window.</t3135> <t3136>Oh, the terrible struggle I have had against sleep so often lately!</t3136>
<t3137>The pain of insomnia or the pain of the fear of falling asleep, and with the unknown horrors it holds for me!</t3137> <t3138>What a blessing those people have whose lives are free from fears and threats; for whom sleep is a joy that comes every night, bringing nothing but sweet dreams!</t3138> <t3139>Well, here I am today, waiting to sleep, and doing like Ophelia in the play: with virgin crants and maiden strewments.</t3139> <t3140>I never liked garlic before today, but now I find it admirable!</t3140> <t3141>There is a great peace in its smell; I feel that sleep is coming.</t3141> <t3142>Good night, everyone.</t3142>
<t3143>From the journal of Dr. Seward</t3143>
<t3144>September 13.</t3144> <t3145>I passed by the Berkeley and found van Helsing, as usual, already prepared to leave.</t3145> <t3146>The car ordered by the hotel was waiting.</t3146> <t3147>The professor took his briefcase, which he now always carries with him.</t3147>
<t3148>I will note everything down in detail.</t3148> <t3149>Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at eight o'clock sharp.</t3149> <t3150>It was a pleasant morning; the bright sunlight and the fresh atmosphere of early autumn seemed to be the culmination of nature's annual work.</t3150> <t3151>The leaves were turning all beautiful colors, but they had not yet begun to fall from the trees.</t3151> <t3152>When we entered, we found Mrs. Westenra coming out of the hall.</t3152> <t3153>She always gets up early.</t3153> <t3154>She greeted us warmly and said:</t3154>
<t3155>–You will be glad to know that Lucy is better.</t3155> <t3156>The little one is still sleeping.</t3156> <t3157>I looked into her room and saw her, but I did not go in, so as not to disturb her.</t3157>
<t3158>The professor smiled, and his gaze was cheerful.</t3158> <t3159>He rubbed his hands, and said:</t3159>
<t3160>–Aha!</t3160> <t3161>I thought I had diagnosed the case correctly.</t3161> <t3162>My treatment is yielding good results.</t3162>
<t3163>To which she replied:</t3163>
<t3164>–You should not take all the credit for yourself, doctor.</t3164> <t3165>Lucy’s good condition this morning is partly due to my work.</t3165>
<t3166>–What do you mean by that, ma'am? – asked the professor.</t3166>
<t3167>–Well, I was so anxious about the poor creature during the night that I went to her room.</t3167> <t3168>She was sleeping deeply; so deeply that my arrival did not wake her.</t3168> <t3169>But the air in the room was terribly stale.</t3169> <t3170>There were heaps of those horrible, foul-smelling flowers everywhere, and she even had a bunch around her neck.</t3170> <t3171>I feared that the heavy odor would be too much for my dear creature in her weak state, so I took them away and opened the window a little to let in some fresh air.</t3171> <t3172>I'm sure you will find her better.</t3172>
<t3173>He said goodbye to us and went to his room where he usually had breakfast early.</t3173> <t3174>While he was speaking, I observed the professor's face and saw that it turned gray like ash.</t3174> <t3175>He was able to restrain himself through self-control while the poor lady was present.</t3175> <t3176>For he knew her condition and the harm that an impression would cause her; in fact, he even managed to smile and held the door open for her to enter her room.</t3176> <t3177>But the moment she disappeared, he gave me a sudden and strong pull, taking me to the dining room and closing the door behind him.</t3177>
<t3178>There, for the first time in my life, I saw van Helsing dejected.</t3178> <t3179>He put his hands to his head in a sort of mute despair, and then he punched his palms helplessly; finally, he sat in a chair, and covering his face with his hands, he began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come from his very broken heart.</t3179> <t3180>Then he raised his hands again, as if imploring the entire universe.</t3180>
<t3181>–God! God! God! –he said-.</t3181> <t3182>What have we done, what has this poor creature done, that has caused us so much sorrow?</t3182> <t3183>Is there still a fate among us, inherited from the ancient pagan world, by which such things must happen, and in such a way?</t3183> <t3184>This poor mother, ignorant, and according to her doing everything the best way, does something to lose her daughter's body and soul; and we cannot tell her, we cannot even warn her, or she dies, and then both die.</t3184> <t3185>Oh, how we are harassed!</t3185> <t3186>How all the powers of the demons are against us! –he added, but suddenly jumped-.</t3186> <t3187>Come -he said-, come; we must see and act.</t3187> <t3188>Demons or no demons, or all the demons at once, it doesn't matter: we fight with him, or them and for all.</t3188>
<t3189>He went out to the corridor door again with his briefcase, and together we went up to Lucy's room.</t3189> <t3190>Once again I raised the shutter, while Van Helsing went towards her bed.</t3190> <t3191>This time he did not recoil in horror upon seeing the poor face with the same waxy pallor, terrible, as before.</t3191> <t3192>He only cast a look of rigid sadness and infinite pity.</t3192>
<t3193>–Just as I expected -he murmured, with that hissing aspiration that meant so much.</t3193>
<t3194>Without saying another word, he went and locked the door, then began to lay out the instruments on the table for another blood transfusion.</t3194> <t3195>I had immediately recognized his need and started to take off my jacket, but he stopped me with a warning hand.</t3195>
<t3196>–No -he said-.</t3196> <t3197>Today you must perform the operation.</t3197> <t3198>I will be the donor.</t3198> <t3199>You are already weak.</t3199>
<t3200>And upon saying this, he took off his jacket and rolled up his shirt sleeve.</t3200>
<t3201>Again the operation; once more the narcotic.</t3201> <t3202>Once again color returned to the ashen cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep.</t3202> <t3203>This time I watched over her while Van Helsing secluded himself and rested.</t3203>
<t3204>Shortly thereafter, he took the opportunity to tell Mrs. Westenra that nothing should be removed from Lucy's room without consulting him.</t3204> <t3205>That the flowers had medicinal value, and that breathing their scent was part of the healing system.</t3205> <t3206>Then he took charge of the case himself, saying that he would watch over her that night and the next, and that he would send word when I should come.</t3206>
<t3207>After another hour, Lucy awoke from her sleep, fresh and bright, and certainly looking much better than could be expected given her terrible ordeal.</t3207>
<t3208>What does all this mean?</t3208> <t3209>I'm beginning to wonder if my long habit of living among madmen is starting to influence my own brain.</t3209>
<t3210>From the diary of Lucy Westenra</t3210>
<t3211>September 17.</t3211> <t3212>Four days and nights of peace.</t3212> <t3213>I am getting so strong again that I hardly recognize myself.</t3213> <t3214>It is as if I have passed through a long nightmare, and have just awakened to see the wonderful rays of the sun around me, and to feel the fresh morning air.</t3214> <t3215>I have a faint memory of long and anxious times of waiting and fear; a darkness in which there was not even the slightest hope to lessen the sharpness of despair.</t3215> <t3216>And then, the long periods of forgetfulness, and the return to life like a diver surfacing after a dive.</t3216> <t3217>However, since Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all these nightmares seem to have gone; the noises that used to frighten me out of my wits, the flapping against the windows, the distant voices that seemed so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I don't know where and ordered me to do I don't know what, all have ceased.</t3217> <t3218>Now I go to bed without any fear of sleeping.</t3218> <t3219>I don't even try to stay awake.</t3219> <t3220>I have gotten quite used to the garlic; every day a box full arrives from Haarlem.</t3220> <t3221>Tonight Dr. Van Helsing will leave, as he has to be in Amsterdam for a day.</t3221> <t3222>But I don't need to be taken care of; I am well enough to stay alone.</t3222> <t3223>Thank God in the name of my mother, and dear Arthur, and all our friends who have been so kind!</t3223> <t3224>I won't even feel the change, for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his bed for quite a while.</t3224> <t3225>I found him asleep twice when I woke up; but I was not afraid to go back to sleep, even though the branches or bats, or whatever it was, were flapping furiously against my window panes.</t3225>
<t3226>Clipping from The Pall Mall Gazette, September 18</t3226>
<t3227>THE WOLF THAT ESCAPED: A DANGEROUS ADVENTURE OF OUR REPORTER</t3227>
<t3228>Interview with the Guardian of the Zoological Garden</t3228>
<t3229>After many inquiries and just as many refusals, and repeatedly using the words Pall Mall Gazette as a sort of talisman, I managed to find the keeper of the section of the Zoological Garden which includes the wolf department.</t3229> <t3230>Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages behind the elephant enclosure, and he was about to sit down for tea when I found him.</t3230> <t3231>Thomas and his wife are hospitable people, and childless, and if the display of hospitality I enjoyed is the average of their behavior, their lives must be quite pleasant.</t3231> <t3232>The keeper did not want to get into what he called "business" until we had finished dinner and everyone was satisfied.</t3232> <t3233>Then, when the table had been cleared, and he had already lit his pipe, he said:</t3233>
<t3234>–Now, sir, you can go ahead and ask me whatever you want.</t3234> <t3235>You will forgive me for refusing to talk about professional matters before eating.</t3235> <t3236>I give the wolves, the jackals, and the hyenas in our entire section their tea before starting to ask them questions.</t3236>
<t3237>–What do you mean by "before asking them questions"? – I inquired, wishing to get him to talk.</t3237>
<t3238>–Hitting them on the head with a stick is one way; scratching their ears is another, when some male wants to impress his girls a bit.</t3238> <t3239>I don't mind the racket much, hitting them with a stick before giving them their dinner, but I wait, so to speak, until they've had their brandy and coffee before trying to scratch their ears.</t3239> <t3240>You know? – he added philosophically – there's quite a bit of the same nature in us as in those animals.</t3240> <t3241>Here you are, coming and asking about my trade, when I had nothing in my belly.</t3241> <t3242>My first attempt was to dismiss you without saying anything.</t3242> <t3243>Not even when you asked me somewhat sarcastically if I wanted you to ask the superintendent if you could ask me some questions.</t3243> <t3244>Without offending you, did I tell you to go to hell?</t3244>
<t3245>–Yes, he told me.</t3245>
<t3246>–And when you said you would report me for using obscene language, it was as if you hit me over the head; but I restrained myself: I did very well.</t3246> <t3247>I wasn't going to fight, so I waited for the food and did with my bowl as wolves, lions, and tigers do.</t3247> <t3248>But, may God have mercy on you now that the old lady has put a piece of her cake in my belly, soaked me with her flourishing teapot, and I have lit my tobacco.</t3248> <t3249>You can scratch my ears all you want, and I won't let out a single growl.</t3249> <t3250>Start asking me.</t3250> <t3251>I know why you're here: it's about that wolf that escaped.</t3251>
<t3252>–Exactly.</t3252> <t3253>I want you to give me your point of view on it.</t3253> <t3254>Just tell me how it happened, and once I know the facts, I'll have you tell me your opinions on their cause, and how you think the whole matter will end.</t3254>
<t3255>–Very well, Governor.</t3255> <t3256>What I'm telling you is almost the whole story.</t3256> <t3257>The wolf we called Bersicker was one of the three gray ones that came from Norway for Jamrach, and that we bought four years ago.</t3257> <t3258>He was a good, calm wolf, who never caused any trouble worth mentioning.</t3258> <t3259>I'm truly surprised that it was him, among all the animals, who wanted to leave here.</t3259> <t3260>But there you have it, you can't trust wolves, just like you can't trust women.</t3260>
<t3261>–Don't pay him any mind, sir! – interrupted Mrs. Bilder, laughing cheerfully-.</t3261> <t3262>This old man has been taking care of animals for so long, damn it if he isn't like an old wolf himself!</t3262> <t3263>But he means no harm.</t3263>
<t3264>–Well, sir, it was about two hours after lunch yesterday when I first heard the commotion.</t3264> <t3265>I was making a bed in the monkey house for a young puma that is sick; but when I heard the growls and howls, I came immediately to see.</t3265> <t3266>And there was Bersicker scratching the bars like a madman, as if he wanted to get out.</t3266> <t3267>There weren't many people that day, and near him there was only one man, a tall, thin guy with an aquiline nose and a pointed beard.</t3267> <t3268>He had a hard and cold look, and red eyes, and he gave me a bad feeling from the start, as it seemed that it was him the animals were irritated with.</t3268> <t3269>He had white kid gloves on his hands; he pointed to the animals and said to me:</t3269>
<t3270>"Guardian, these wolves seem to be irritated by something."</t3270>
<t3271>"Maybe it's because of you," I said, as I didn't like the airs he was giving himself.</t3271>
<t3272>"He didn't get angry, as I had expected him to, but instead smiled with a kind of insolent smile, his mouth full of sharp white teeth.</t3272>
<t3273>"-Oh, no, they wouldn't like me! – he told me.</t3273>
<t3274>"-Oh, yes! I think they would like it," I replied, imitating him.</t3274> <t3275>They always like one or two bones to clean their teeth after tea time.</t3275> <t3276>And you have a bag full of them.</t3276>
<t3277>"Well, it was a strange thing, but when the animals saw us talking, they lay down, and I went towards Bersicker and he allowed me to pet his ears as usual.</t3277> <t3278>Then the man also approached, and bless him if he didn't also extend his hand and pet the old wolf's ears!</t3278>
<t3279>"Be careful," I told him.</t3279> <t3280>"Bersicker is fast."</t3280>
<t3281>"Don't worry," he replied to me. </t3281> <t3282>"I'm used to them!"</t3282>
<t3283>"-Are you also in the trade? – I asked him, taking off my hat, since a man who has something to do with wolves, etc., is a good friend of the keepers.</t3283>
<t3284>"No," he replied, "I'm not exactly in the trade, but I have tamed several of them."</t3284>
<t3285>"And saying this, he lifted his hat like a lord, and left.</t3285> <t3286>The old Bersicker watched him until he disappeared, and then went to lie down in a corner and did not want to come out of there all night.</t3286> <t3287>Well, last night, as soon as the moon came out, all the wolves started howling.</t3287> <t3288>There was nothing and no one they could howl at.</t3288> <t3289>There was no one near them, except for someone who was evidently calling a dog somewhere behind the gardens on Park Street.</t3289> <t3290>Once or twice I went out to make sure everything was in order, and it was, and then the howling stopped.</t3290> <t3291>A little before midnight, I went out to do one last round before going to bed and, strike me down, when I got in front of old Bersicker's cage, I saw the bars broken and bent, and the cage empty.</t3291> <t3292>And that's all I know."</t3292>
<t3293>–Was there no one else who saw anything?</t3293>
<t3294>–One of our gardeners was returning home around that time from a celebration when he saw a large gray dog coming out through the garden cages.</t3294> <t3295>At least that's what he says, but I don't give it much credit myself, because he didn't say a word about it to his wife when he got home, and it was only after the wolf's escape that it became known; and we had already spent the whole night searching the park for Bersicker when he remembered seeing something.</t3295> <t3296>I rather think the wine from the celebration had gone to his head.</t3296>
<t3297>–Well, Mr. Bilder, can you explain the wolf's escape?</t3297>
<t3298>–Well, sir -he said, with a somewhat suspicious modesty-, I think I can; but I don't know if you will be completely satisfied with my theory.</t3298>
<t3299>–Of course, I will stay.</t3299> <t3300>If a man like you, who knows animals from experience, cannot venture a good hypothesis, who can?</t3300>
<t3301>–Well, sir, then I will tell you the way I explain this to myself.</t3301> <t3302>It seems to me that this wolf escaped... simply because it wanted to get out.</t3302>
<t3303>By the warm manner in which both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke, I could tell that it had already worked on other occasions, and that the entire explanation was simply a premeditated trick.</t3303> <t3304>I couldn't compete in cunning with the valiant Thomas, but I believed I knew a much safer path to his heart, so I said:</t3304>
<t3305>–Now, Mr. Bilder, we will consider that this first half-sovereign has already been redeemed, and its brother is waiting to be claimed when you tell me what you think is going to happen.</t3305>
<t3306>–You are right, sir -he said quickly-.</t3306> <t3307>You will have to excuse me, I know, for having played a joke on you, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much as telling me to go ahead.</t3307>
<t3308>–But... never! – said the old woman.</t3308>
<t3309>–My opinion is this: that wolf is hiding somewhere, the gardener says he saw it galloping north faster than a horse would; but I don't believe him, because, you know, sir, wolves don't gallop any more than dogs do, as they are not built that way.</t3309> <t3310>Wolves are very nice in storybooks, and I would say when they gather in packs and start harassing something that is more scared than they are, they can make a devil of a racket and tear it to pieces, whatever it is.</t3310> <t3311>But, God bless him, in real life a wolf is just an inferior creature, not half as intelligent as a good dog; and they don't have a quarter of their fighting ability.</t3311> <t3312>This one that escaped is not used to fighting, not even to procuring its own food, and most likely it is somewhere in the park hiding and trembling, if it is capable of thinking about anything, wondering where it will be able to get its breakfast; or maybe it has retreated and is holed up in a coal cave.</t3312> <t3313>Ugh! The fright some cook is going to get when they go down and see its green eyes shining in the dark.</t3313> <t3314>If it can't get food, it is very likely that it will go out looking for it, and it might just happen to end up at a butcher's shop in time.</t3314>
<t3315>"If that doesn't happen and some governess goes for a walk with her soldier, leaving the infant in their baby carriage, well, then I wouldn't be surprised if the census shows one less child.</t3315> <t3316>That's all.</t3316>
<t3317>He was handing over the half-sovereign when something appeared at the window, and Mr. Bilder's face lengthened to twice its natural dimensions due to the surprise.</t3317>
<t3318>God bless me! – he exclaimed -.</t3318> <t3319>There is old Bersicker back, without anyone bringing him!</t3319>
<t3320>He got up and went to the door to open it; a procedure that seemed unnecessary to me.</t3320> <t3321>I have always thought that a wild animal is never as attractive as when some obstacle of known durability is between it and me; personal experience has intensified, rather than diminished, this idea.</t3321>
<t3322>After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor his wife thought any more of the wolf than I would think of a dog.</t3322> <t3323>The animal itself was as peaceful as the father of all those wolf tales, the old-time friend of Little Red Riding Hood, while disguised trying to earn her trust.</t3323>
<t3324>The whole scene was a complicated mix of comedy and tragedy.</t3324> <t3325>The wicked wolf that for a day and a half had paralyzed London and made all the children in the village tremble in their shoes, was there with a penitent look, and was being received and petted like some sort of vulpine prodigal son.</t3325> <t3326>Old Bilder examined him all over with the most tender attention, and when he had finished examining the penitent, he said:</t3326>
<t3327>–Wow, I already knew that the poor animal was going to get into some kind of trouble!</t3327> <t3328>Didn't I always say so?</t3328> <t3329>Here is its head all cut and full of broken glass.</t3329> <t3330>Surely it tried to jump over some wall or something else.</t3330> <t3331>It's a shame that people are allowed to put pieces of bottles on top of their walls.</t3331> <t3332>These are the results.</t3332> <t3333>Come with me, Bersicker.</t3333>
<t3334>He took the wolf and locked it in a cage with a piece of meat that satisfied, at least in terms of quantity, the basic conditions of a fat calf, and then went to write the report.</t3334>
<t3335>I also went to make the report on the unique and exclusive information given today regarding the strange escape from the zoo.</t3335>
<t3336>From the diary of Dr. Seward</t3336>
<t3337>September 17th.</t3337> <t3338>I was busy, after dinner, in my study dating my books, which, due to the urgency of other work and the many visits to Lucy, were sadly behind.</t3338> <t3339>Suddenly, the door burst open and my patient entered like a whirlwind, his face distorted with anxiety.</t3339> <t3340>I was startled, as it is almost unheard of for a patient to enter in such a manner and on their own into the superintendent's office.</t3340> <t3341>Without any pause, he headed directly towards me.</t3341> <t3342>In his hand was a kitchen knife, and seeing that it was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us.</t3342> <t3343>However, he was too quick and too strong for me; before I could regain my balance, he had struck the first blow, cutting my left wrist quite deeply.</t3343> <t3344>But before he could strike me again, I punched him with my right hand and he fell to the floor with his arms and legs spread out.</t3344> <t3345>My wrist was bleeding profusely, and a small pool formed on the carpet.</t3345> <t3346>I saw that my friend did not seem to be making another effort, so I focused on bandaging my wrist, all the while keeping a cautious watch on the prostrate figure.</t3346> <t3347>When my assistants came running in and we turned our attention to him, his appearance positively sickened me.</t3347> <t3348>He was lying on his stomach on the floor, licking like a dog the blood that had fallen from my wounded wrist.</t3348> <t3349>We restrained him easily, and to my surprise, he allowed himself to be taken away quite docilely by the assistants, repeating over and over:</t3349>
<t3350>–"Blood is life!"</t3350> <t3351>"Blood is life!"</t3351>
<t3352>I cannot afford to lose blood at present; I have already lost too much lately to be healthy, in addition to the prolonged strain of Lucy's illness and its horrible phases which are wearing me down.</t3352> <t3353>I am very irritated and tired, and I need rest, rest, rest.</t3353> <t3354>Fortunately, Van Helsing has not called me, so I do not need to deprive myself of sleep this time; I don't think I could go without a good rest tonight.</t3354>
<t3355>Telegram from van Helsing to Seward, in Carfax</t3355>
<t3356>(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as it did not mention any county; delivered with a delay of twenty-two hours.)</t3356>
<t3357>September 17.</t3357> <t3358>Do not fail to be at Hillingham tonight.</t3358> <t3359>If not observing all the time, visit frequently and ensure that the flowers are placed; very important; do not fail.</t3359> <t3360>I will be with you as soon as possible after arrival.</t3360>
<t3361>From the journal of Dr. Seward</t3361>
<t3362>September 18.</t3362> <t3363>I have just taken the train to London.</t3363> <t3364>The arrival of van Helsing's telegram filled me with anxiety.</t3364> <t3365>An entire night lost, and from bitter experience, I know what can happen in a night.</t3365> <t3366>Of course, it is possible that everything is fine, but what could have happened?</t3366> <t3367>Surely there is a horrible fate hanging over us, which causes every possible accident to thwart what we are trying to do.</t3367> <t3368>I will take this cylinder with me, and then I will be able to complete my notes on Lucy's phonograph.</t3368>
<t3369>Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra</t3369>
<t3370>September 17.</t3370> <t3371>Night.</t3371> <t3372>I write this and leave it so that it can be seen, in order that no one may find themselves in trouble because of me.</t3372> <t3373>This is an exact record of what happened tonight.</t3373> <t3374>I feel that I am dying of weakness and I barely have the strength to write, but I must do it, even if I die in the attempt.</t3374>
<t3375>I went to bed as usual, making sure that the flowers were placed as Dr. Van Helsing had ordered, and soon I fell asleep.</t3375>
<t3376>I was awakened by the flapping at the window, which had begun since that night when I sleepwalked to the Whitby gorge, where Mina saved me, and which I now know so well.</t3376> <t3377>I wasn't afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in the adjoining room (as Dr. Van Helsing had said he would be), so that I could speak to him at any moment.</t3377> <t3378>I tried to fall asleep again, but I couldn't.</t3378> <t3379>Then the old anguish from before falling asleep returned, and I decided to stay awake.</t3379> <t3380>Perversely, sleep tried to return when I no longer wanted to sleep; so, fearing to be alone, I opened my door and shouted: "Is anyone there?"</t3380> <t3381>I received no response.</t3381> <t3382>I was afraid of waking up my mother, so I closed the door again.</t3382> <t3383>Then, outside, in the bushes, I heard a kind of dog howl, but fiercer and deeper.</t3383> <t3384>I went to the window and looked outside, but I couldn't make out anything except a large bat, which had evidently been flapping its wings against the window.</t3384> <t3385>So I returned to bed again, but with the firm determination not to fall asleep.</t3385> <t3386>At that moment, the door opened and my mother looked through it; seeing from my movement that I wasn't asleep, she came in and sat by my side.</t3386> <t3387>She spoke to me, more sweetly and gently than usual:</t3387>
<t3388>–I was worried about you, dear, and I came in to see if you were alright.</t3388>
<t3389>I feared she might catch a cold sitting there, and I asked her to come and sleep with me, so she got into bed and lay down next to me; she did not take off her robe, as she said she was only going to stay for a moment and then return to her own bed.</t3389> <t3390>As she lay there in my arms, and I in hers, the fluttering and rubbing returned to the window.</t3390> <t3391>She was startled, and a little scared, and asked, "What is that?"</t3391> <t3392>I tried to calm her; finally, I was able to do so, and she lay still; but I could hear how her poor dear heart was still beating terribly.</t3392> <t3393>After a while, there was a crash at the window and a lot of pieces of glass fell to the floor.</t3393> <t3394>The window shutter flew inward with the wind coming in, and in the opening of the broken panes appeared the head of a large, thin wolf.</t3394> <t3395>My mother let out a scream of fear and quickly sat up in bed, nervously clutching at anything that could help her.</t3395> <t3396>Among other things, she grabbed the garland of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing insisted I wear around my neck, and she tore it off with a yank.</t3396> <t3397>For a second or two she remained sitting, pointing at the wolf, and suddenly there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she collapsed, as if struck by lightning, and her head hit me on the forehead, leaving me somewhat dazed for a few moments.</t3397> <t3398>The room and everything around seemed to spin.</t3398> <t3399>I kept my eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf withdrew its head and a whole myriad of small spots seemed to fly in through the broken window, spiraling and circling like the dust column travelers describe when there is a simoom in the desert.</t3399> <t3400>I tried to move, but there was a kind of spell over me, and poor mama's body, which seemed to be cooling already, as her dear heart had stopped beating, weighed on me; and for a while, I remember nothing more.</t3400>
<t3401>It did not seem to take long, but rather it was very, very terrible, until I could regain consciousness again.</t3401> <t3402>Somewhere nearby, a bell was tolling; all the neighborhood dogs were howling, and in our bushes, seemingly very close, a nightingale was singing.</t3402> <t3403>I was dazed and dulled by pain, terror, and weakness, but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother returning to comfort me.</t3403> <t3404>The noises also seemed to wake the maids, as I could hear their bare footsteps running outside my door.</t3404> <t3405>I called them and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what was lying on me in the bed, they screamed.</t3405> <t3406>The wind burst through the broken window and the door slammed shut.</t3406> <t3407>They lifted the body of my beloved mother and laid her, covering her with a sheet, on the bed after I had gotten up.</t3407> <t3408>They were so scared and nervous that I ordered them to go to the dining room and each have a glass of wine.</t3408> <t3409>The door burst open for a few moments and then closed again.</t3409> <t3410>The maids screamed in horror, and then they went in a tight group to the dining room, and I placed the flowers I had had around my neck on my dear mother's chest.</t3410> <t3411>When they were already there, I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I did not want to remove them, and besides, one of the maids could sit with me now.</t3411> <t3412>I was surprised that the maids did not return.</t3412> <t3413>I called them, but received no response, so I went down to the dining room to look for them.</t3413>
<t3414>My heart sank when I saw what had happened.</t3414> <t3415>The four lay helpless on the ground, breathing heavily.</t3415> <t3416>The sherry jug was on the table half full, but there was a strange acrid smell around.</t3416> <t3417>I had my suspicions and examined the jug.</t3417> <t3418>It smelled of laudanum, and looking in the cupboard I found that the bottle my mother's doctor uses for her (oh, used!) was empty.</t3418> <t3419>What should I do? What should I do?</t3419> <t3420>I am back in the room, with mom.</t3420> <t3421>I cannot leave her, and I am alone, except for the sleeping maids, whom someone has drugged.</t3421> <t3422>Alone with death!</t3422> <t3423>I do not dare to go out, for I hear the faint howl of the wolf through the broken window.</t3423> <t3424>The air seems full of spots, floating and swirling in the window's draft, and the lights flicker blue and dim.</t3424> <t3425>What should I do?</t3425> <t3426>God protect me from any harm tonight!</t3426> <t3427>I will hide this paper in my bosom, where they will find it when they come to shroud me.</t3427> <t3428>My dear mother is gone!</t3428> <t3429>It is time for me to go too.</t3429>
<t3430>Goodbye, dear Arthur, if I do not survive this night.</t3430> <t3431>May God protect you, dear, and may God help me!</t3431>
<t3432>XII.–</t3432> <t3433>FROM THE DIARY OF DR. SEWARD</t3433>
<t3434>September 18.</t3434> <t3435>I went immediately to Hillingham and arrived early.</t3435> <t3436>Leaving my carriage at the gate, I ran down the avenue alone.</t3436> <t3437>I rang the bell softly, as delicately as possible, for I feared disturbing Lucy or her mother, and hoped that only a servant would answer the door.</t3437> <t3438>After a while, finding no response, I rang again; still, no one answered.</t3438> <t3439>I cursed the laziness of the servants who might still be in bed at that hour, as it was ten in the morning, so I rang again, but more impatiently, still without obtaining a response.</t3439> <t3440>Up to this point, I had only blamed the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me.</t3440> <t3441>Was this desolation another link in the chain of misfortunes that seemed to be surrounding us?</t3441> <t3442>Could it be that I had arrived at a mansion of death, too late?</t3442> <t3443>I know that minutes, or even seconds of delay can mean hours of danger for Lucy if she had another one of those terrible relapses; and I went around the house to see if I could find by chance another entrance.</t3443>
<t3444>I couldn't find any way to get in.</t3444> <t3445>Every window and door was bolted and locked, so I returned puzzled to the porch.</t3445> <t3446>As I did so, I heard the rapid clatter of a horse's hooves approaching swiftly, and then stopping at the gate.</t3446> <t3447>A few seconds later, I found van Helsing running down the avenue.</t3447> <t3448>When he saw me, he managed to murmur:</t3448>
<t3449>–So it was you who just arrived.</t3449> <t3450>How is she?</t3450> <t3451>Did we arrive too late?</t3451> <t3452>Did you not receive my telegram?</t3452>
<t3453>I replied as quickly and coherently as I could, warning him that I had not received his telegram until early in the morning, that I had not wasted a minute in getting there, and that I had not been able to make anyone in the house hear me.</t3453> <t3454>He paused and lifted his hat, saying solemnly:</t3454>
<t3455>–Then I fear that we have arrived too late.</t3455> <t3456>Let God's will be done! – but then he continued, regaining his usual energy-: Come.</t3456> <t3457>If there is no door open to enter, we must make one.</t3457> <t3458>I believe we now have plenty of time.</t3458>
<t3459>We took a detour and went to the back of the house, where a kitchen window was open.</t3459> <t3460>The professor took a small surgical saw from his briefcase, and handing it to me, pointed towards the iron bars guarding the window.</t3460> <t3461>I attacked them immediately and very soon cut three of them.</t3461> <t3462>Then, with a long, thin knife, we pushed back the bolt of the guillotines and opened the window.</t3462> <t3463>I helped the professor to climb in, and then I followed him.</t3463> <t3464>There was no one in the kitchen or in the nearby service rooms.</t3464> <t3465>We pressed the knob of every room as we walked, and in the dining room, dimly lit by the rays of light passing through the blinds, we found the four maids lying on the floor.</t3465> <t3466>There was no need to think they were dead, as their labored breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt about their condition.</t3466> <t3467>Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we moved away, he said: "We can attend to them later."</t3467> <t3468>Then we went up to Lucy's room.</t3468> <t3469>For a few brief seconds, we paused at the door and listened, but we couldn't hear any sound.</t3469> <t3470>With pale faces and trembling hands, we gently opened the door and entered the room.</t3470>
<t3471>How can I describe what we saw?</t3471> <t3472>On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her mother.</t3472> <t3473>The latter lay further in, covered with a white sheet whose end had been turned by the draft coming through the broken window, revealing her hollow-eyed white face, with a look of terror fixed upon it.</t3473> <t3474>Beside her lay Lucy, with a white and even more hollow-eyed face.</t3474> <t3475>The flowers that had been around her neck were on her mother's chest, and her own throat was bare, showing the two small wounds we had seen earlier, but this time terribly white and bruised.</t3475> <t3476>Without saying a word, the professor leaned over the bed with his head almost touching poor Lucy's chest; then he quickly turned his head, like someone listening, and standing up, he shouted at me:</t3476>
<t3477>–It's not too late yet!</t3477> <t3478>Quick, quick!</t3478> <t3479>Bring the brandy!</t3479>
<t3480>I flew down the stairs and returned with it, being careful to smell and taste it, just in case it was also drugged like the sherry I found on the table.</t3480> <t3481>The maids were still breathing, but more calmly, and I supposed that the effects of the narcotic were already wearing off.</t3481> <t3482>I did not stay to make sure, but went back to where Van Helsing was.</t3482> <t3483>As on the previous occasion, he rubbed brandy on his lips and gums, wrists, and palms.</t3483> <t3484>He said to me:</t3484>
<t3485>–I can do this; it is all that can be done for now.</t3485> <t3486>You go and wake up those maids.</t3486> <t3487>Gently slap their faces with a damp towel, and slap them hard.</t3487> <t3488>Make them gather heat and fire and warm up some water.</t3488> <t3489>This poor soul is almost as cold as the other one.</t3489> <t3490>We will need to warm her up before we can do anything else.</t3490>
<t3491>I went immediately and found little difficulty in waking up three of the women.</t3491> <t3492>The fourth was just a young girl and the narcotic had evidently affected her more strongly, so I lifted her onto the sofa and let her sleep.</t3492> <t3493>The others were initially dazed, but as they began to remember what had happened, they sobbed hysterically.</t3493> <t3494>However, I was strict with them and did not allow them to speak.</t3494> <t3495>I told them that losing one life was painful enough, and that if they took too long, they would also sacrifice Miss Lucy.</t3495> <t3496>So, sobbing, they began to make arrangements, half-dressed as they were, and prepared the fire and water.</t3496>
<t3497>Fortunately, the kitchen and heater fire were still working, so there was no need for hot water.</t3497><t3498>We fixed the bathroom and took Lucy as she was to the bathtub.</t3498><t3499>While we were busy scrubbing her limbs, someone knocked on the hallway door.</t3499><t3500>One of the maids ran, hastily threw on some more clothes, and opened the door.</t3500><t3501>Then she returned and whispered to us that it was a gentleman who had arrived with a message from Mr. Holmwood.</t3501><t3502>I simply begged her to tell him that he had to wait, as we couldn't see anyone at the moment.</t3502><t3503>She went out with the message, and absorbed in our work, I completely forgot about the presence of that man.</t3503>
<t3504>In all my experience, I had never seen my teacher work with such solemn seriousness.</t3504> <t3505>I knew, as he did, that it was a desperate struggle against death, and in a pause, I told him so.</t3505> <t3506>He responded in a way I couldn't understand, but with the most serious look his face could reflect:</t3506>
<t3507>–If that were all, I would stop right here where we are now and let her fade away in peace, for I see no light on the horizon of her life.</t3507>
<t3508>He continued his work with a vigor, if possible, renewed and more frenetic.</t3508>
<t3509>After a while, we both began to become aware that the heat was starting to have some effect.</t3509> <t3510>Lucy's heart beat a little more audibly through the stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement.</t3510> <t3511>Van Helsing's face almost beamed when we lifted her out of the bath and wrapped her in a warm sheet to dry her.</t3511> <t3512>He said to me:</t3512>
<t3513>–The first victory is ours! Check to the king!</t3513>
<t3514>We took Lucy to another room, which by then had already been prepared, and put her to bed and made her drink a few drops of brandy.</t3514> <t3515>I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief around her neck.</t3515> <t3516>She was still unconscious, and she was as bad, if not worse, than we had ever seen her.</t3516>
<t3517>Van Helsing called one of the women and told her to stay with her and not to take her eyes off her until we returned.</t3517> <t3518>Then he signaled me to leave the room.</t3518>
<t3519>–We need to consult about what we are going to do -he told me, as we descended the stairs.</t3519>
<t3520>In the hallway, he opened the dining room door, and we entered, carefully closing the door behind us.</t3520> <t3521>The blinds had been left open, but the shutters were already lowered, with that adherence to the etiquette of death that British women of the lower classes always observe rigidly.</t3521> <t3522>Therefore, the room was quite dark.</t3522> <t3523>However, there was enough light for our purposes.</t3523> <t3524>Van Helsing's seriousness was somewhat mitigated by a look of perplexity.</t3524> <t3525>He was evidently torturing his brain about something, so I waited a few moments, after which he said:</t3525>
<t3526>–What are we going to do now?</t3526> <t3527>Who can we turn to?</t3527> <t3528>We must perform another blood transfusion, and that promptly, or the life of that poor girl will not last an hour.</t3528> <t3529>You are already exhausted; I am exhausted too.</t3529> <t3530>I fear trusting those women, even if they had the courage to submit.</t3530> <t3531>What should we do for someone who wishes to open their veins for her?</t3531>
<t3532>–Well, then, what's going on with me?</t3532>
<t3533>The voice came from the sofa on the other side of the room, and its tones brought breath and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris.</t3533> <t3534>Van Helsing looked angry at the first sound, but his face softened and a joyful look appeared in his eyes when I shouted, "Quincey Morris!" and ran towards him with outstretched arms.</t3534>
<t3535>–What brought you here? – I asked him as we shook hands.</t3535>
<t3536>–I suppose the cause is Art.</t3536>
<t3537>He handed me a telegram:</t3537>
<t3538>"I haven't heard from Seward for three days, and I am terribly anxious.</t3538> <t3539>I cannot go.</t3539> <t3540>My father in the same state.</t3540> <t3541>Send me news of Lucy's condition.</t3541> <t3542>Don't delay.</t3542> <t3543>HOLMWOOD."</t3543>
<t3544>I think I have arrived just in time.</t3544> <t3545>You know that you only have to tell me what I should do.</t3545>
<t3546>Van Helsing took a few steps forward and took his hand, looking him straight in the eyes as he said:</t3546>
<t3547>–The best thing in this world when a woman is in danger is the blood of a brave man.</t3547> <t3548>You are a man, and there is no doubt about it.</t3548> <t3549>Well, the devil may work against us with all his efforts, but God sends us men when we need them.</t3549>
<t3550>Once again we had to perform the horrendous operation.</t3550> <t3551>I do not have the courage to describe it again in detail.</t3551> <t3552>Lucy was terribly weak, and the weakness had affected her more than the other times, for although quite a bit of blood entered her veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as quickly as on other occasions.</t3552>
<t3553>His struggle to stay alive was something terrible to see and hear.</t3553> <t3554>However, the functioning of both his heart and lungs improved, and Van Helsing administered a subcutaneous injection of morphine, as before, with good results.</t3554> <t3555>His fainting turned into a deep sleep.</t3555> <t3556>The professor watched her while I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and I sent one of the maids to pay the coachman who was waiting.</t3556> <t3557>I left Quincey lying down after serving him a glass of wine, and I told the cook to prepare a good breakfast.</t3557> <t3558>Then I had an idea and went back to the room where Lucy was.</t3558> <t3559>When I entered, quietly, I found Van Helsing with one or two sheets of paper in his hands.</t3559> <t3560>It was evident that he had read them, and that he was now reflecting on their content, sitting with one hand on his forehead.</t3560> <t3561>There was a look of grim satisfaction on his face, like that of someone who has resolved a doubt.</t3561>
<t3562>He handed me the papers, saying only:</t3562>
<t3563>–It fell from Lucy's chest when we were carrying her to the bathroom.</t3563>
<t3564>When I had read them, I stared at the professor, and after a pause, I asked him:</t3564>
<t3565>–In the name of God, what does all this mean?</t3565> <t3566>Was she, or is she crazy?</t3566> <t3567>Or what kind of horrible danger is this?</t3567>
<t3568>I was so perplexed that I couldn't find anything else to say.</t3568> <t3569>Van Helsing extended his hand and took the paper, saying:</t3569>
<t3570>–Don't worry about it now.</t3570> <t3571>For the moment, forget it.</t3571> <t3572>You will know and understand everything in due time; but that will be later.</t3572> <t3573>And now, what did you come to tell me?</t3573>
<t3574>This brought me back to reality, and once again, I was myself.</t3574>
<t3575>–I came to talk to you about the death certificate.</t3575> <t3576>If we do not act properly and wisely, there could be inquiries, and we would have to show that paper.</t3576> <t3577>I hope there will be no need for inquiries, because if there were, that would surely kill poor Lucy, if something else doesn't kill her first.</t3577> <t3578>I know, and you know, and the other doctor who attended to her also knows, that Mrs. Westenra suffered from a heart condition; we can certify that she died from it.</t3578> <t3579>Let's fill out the certificate immediately and I will take it to the registry myself, and then proceed to the funeral service.</t3579>
<t3580>–Well done, friend John! Very well thought out!</t3580> <t3581>Truly, if Miss Lucy has to be sad because of the enemies that besiege her, at least she can be happy for the friends who love her.</t3581> <t3582>One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides an old man like me.</t3582> <t3583>Ah yes! I know it, friend John; I am not blind; I love you more for it!</t3583> <t3584>Now, go away.</t3584>
<t3585>In the corridor, I found Quincey Morris with a telegram for Arthur telling him that Mrs. Westenra had died; that Lucy had also been ill, but was now improving; and that Van Helsing and I were with her.</t3585> <t3586>I told him where I was going, and he urged me to hurry.</t3586> <t3587>But when I was about to do so, he said to me:</t3587>
<t3588>–When you return, Jack, can I speak to you alone?</t3588>
<t3589>I nodded affirmatively and left.</t3589> <t3590>I found no difficulty in making the arrangements, and I agreed with the local funeral home that they would come at night to take the measurements of the coffin and make the other preparations.</t3590>
<t3591>When I returned, Quincey was waiting for me.</t3591> <t3592>I told him that I would see him as soon as I knew something about Lucy, and I went up to her room.</t3592> <t3593>She was still sleeping, and apparently my master had not moved from his seat beside her.</t3593> <t3594>From the way he put his finger to his lips, I guessed that he expected her to wake up at any moment, and was afraid of getting ahead of nature.</t3594> <t3595>So I went down to where Quincey was and took him to the breakfast room, where the shutters were not drawn and therefore it was a bit more cheerful, or rather, less sad than the other rooms.</t3595> <t3596>When we were alone, he said to me:</t3596>
<t3597>–Jack Seward, I don't want to intrude anywhere I have no right to be, but this is no ordinary case.</t3597> <t3598>You know that I loved this girl and wanted to marry her; but, although all that is past and buried, I can't help feeling anxious about her.</t3598> <t3599>What is happening to her?</t3599> <t3600>What is she suffering from?</t3600> <t3601>The Dutchman, and I well realize he is a formidable old man, said, the moment you two entered the room, that another blood transfusion was needed and that you two were already exhausted.</t3601> <t3602>Now, I know very well that you doctors speak in camera, and that one should not expect to know what you discuss in private.</t3602> <t3603>But this is not a common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part.</t3603> <t3604>Isn't that so?</t3604>
<t3605>–That's right, I told him, and he continued:</t3605>
<t3606>–I suppose that you two, you and Van Helsing, already did what I did today.</t3606> <t3607>Isn't that so?</t3607>
<t3608>–That's right.</t3608>
<t3609>–And I imagine that Art is also involved in the matter.</t3609> <t3610>When I saw him four days ago at his house, he seemed quite strange.</t3610> <t3611>I had never seen anyone lose weight so quickly, since I was in the Pampas and had a mare that liked to graze at night.</t3611> <t3612>One of those big bats they call vampires got her at night and left her with her throat and vein open, without enough blood inside her to allow her to stand, so I had to put a bullet in her while she lay there.</t3612> <t3613>Jack, if you can talk to me without betraying the trust they have placed in you, tell me, Arthur was the first, wasn't he?</t3613>
<t3614>As he spoke, my poor friend showed signs of being terribly anxious.</t3614> <t3615>He was in a torture of restlessness for the woman he loved, and his total ignorance of the terrible mystery that seemed to surround her intensified his pain.</t3615> <t3616>His own heart was bleeding, and it took all the manliness in him (of which there was plenty, I can assure you) to keep from collapsing.</t3616> <t3617>I paused before responding, as I felt I should not say anything that would betray the secrets the doctor wished to keep; but in any case, he already knew so much, and guessed so much, that there was no reason not to respond, so I answered him with the same phrase:</t3617>
<t3618>–That's right.</t3618>
<t3619>–And how long has this been happening?</t3619>
<t3620>–For about ten days,</t3620>
<t3621>–Ten days!</t3621> <t3622>Then I suppose, Jack Seward, that the poor creature we all love has had the blood of four strong men put into her veins during that time.</t3622> <t3623>A single man himself couldn't endure it for long -he added, and then, approaching me, he spoke in a kind of angry whisper-: Who took it from her?</t3623>
<t3624>I shook my head no.</t3624>
<t3625>–Therein lies the problem.</t3625> <t3626>Van Helsing is simply frantic about it, and I am about to rack my brains.</t3626> <t3627>I can no longer even venture a guess.</t3627> <t3628>There has been a series of small circumstances that have thwarted all our calculations for Lucy to be properly watched.</t3628> <t3629>But this will not happen again.</t3629> <t3630>We will stay here until everything is either right... or wrong.</t3630>
<t3631>Quincey extended his hand.</t3631>
<t3632>"Count on me," he said.</t3632> <t3633>"You and the Dutchman just have to tell me what to do, and I will do it."</t3633>
<t3634>When Lucy woke up in the afternoon, her first movement was to feel her chest, and, to my surprise, she pulled out from it the paper that Van Helsing had given me to read.</t3634>
<t3635>The careful professor had placed it back in its spot again, to prevent her from feeling alarmed when she woke up.</t3635> <t3636>Her eyes turned to Van Helsing and me and brightened.</t3636> <t3637>Then she looked around the room and, seeing where she was, trembled; she let out a sharp cry and put her poor, thin hands over her pale face.</t3637> <t3638>We both understood what it meant (she had fully realized her mother's death), so we tried to console her.</t3638> <t3639>There is no doubt that our compassion calmed her a bit, but she still remained very disheartened and continued to sob silently and weakly for a long time.</t3639> <t3640>We told her that either one of us, or both, would stay with her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her a little.</t3640> <t3641>Towards the evening, she fell into a sort of stupor.</t3641> <t3642>Then something very strange happened.</t3642> <t3643>While she was still asleep, she took the paper from her chest and tore it into two pieces.</t3643> <t3644>Van Helsing stepped forward and took the pieces from her hands.</t3644>
<t3645>In any case, she continued with the intention of breaking, as if she still had the material in her fingers; finally, she raised her hands and opened them, as if scattering the fragments.</t3645> <t3646>Van Helsing seemed surprised and his eyebrows came together as if he were thinking, but he said nothing.</t3646>
<t3647>September 19.</t3647> <t3648>All last night she slept fitfully, always feeling afraid to fall asleep and appearing a bit weaker each time she woke up.</t3648> <t3649>The professor and I took turns keeping watch, and we did not leave her unattended for a single moment.</t3649> <t3650>Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I know that he spent the whole night walking around the house.</t3650>
<t3651>When the day arrived, its enlightening light revealed the ravages in poor Lucy's fortitude.</t3651> <t3652>She was barely able to turn her head, and the few foods she could take seemed to do no good.</t3652> <t3653>At times she slept, and both Van Helsing and I noted the difference in her, while she slept and while she was awake.</t3653>
<t3654>While she slept, she looked stronger, though more haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale gums receding from her teeth, which thus appeared positively longer and sharper than usual; upon waking, the softness of her eyes evidently changed her expression, as she looked more like herself, though still agonizing.</t3654> <t3655>In the afternoon, she asked about Arthur, and we telegraphed him.</t3655> <t3656>Quincey went to the station to meet him.</t3656>
<t3657>When he arrived, it was already around six in the evening, and the sun was setting with all its splendor and color, and the red light flowed through the window, giving more color to her pale cheeks.</t3657> <t3658>Upon seeing her, Arthur was simply overwhelmed with emotion, and none of us could speak.</t3658> <t3659>In the hours that had passed, the periods of sleep, or the comatose condition that seemed to mimic it, had become more frequent, so much so that the pauses during which conversation was possible had been reduced.</t3659> <t3660>However, Arthur's presence seemed to act as a stimulant; she revived a bit and spoke with him more lucidly than she had since our arrival.</t3660> <t3661>He also composed himself and spoke as cheerfully as he could, so that the best was made of it.</t3661>
<t3662>It's about to be one in the morning, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with her.</t3662> <t3663>I will relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am recording this in Lucy's phonograph.</t3663>
<t3664>They will try to rest until six.</t3664> <t3665>I fear that our watch will end tomorrow, for the shock has been too great; the poor girl cannot be revived.</t3665>
<t3666>God help us all.</t3666>
<t3667>Letter from Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra (unopened)</t3667>
<t3668>September 17</t3668>
<t3669>"My dear Lucy:</t3669>
<t3670>"It seems to me that centuries have passed since I last heard from you, or rather since I last wrote to you.</t3670> <t3671>I know you will forgive all my faults when you have read the news I am going to give you.</t3671> <t3672>Well, I brought my husband back in good condition; when we arrived in Exeter, a carriage was waiting for us, and in it, despite having a gout attack, Mr. Hawkins took us to his house, where there were rooms for us, all arranged and comfortable, and we had dinner together.</t3672> <t3673>After dinner, Mr. Hawkins said:</t3673>
<t3674>"My dear ones, I want to toast to your health and prosperity, and may all blessings fall upon you both.</t3674> <t3675>I have known you since you were children, and I have watched with love and pride as you grew up.</t3675> <t3676>Now I wish for you to make your home here with me.</t3676> <t3677>I leave behind neither descendants nor children; all are gone, and in my will, I appoint you as universal heirs.</t3677>
<t3678>"I cried, dear Lucy, while Jonathan and old Mr. Hawkins shook hands.</t3678> <t3679>We had a very, very happy evening.</t3679>
<t3680>"So here we are, settled in this beautiful and ancient house, and from both my bedroom and the living room I can see very close the great elms of the cathedral, with their strong trunks erect against the old yellow stones of the cathedral, and I can hear the crows above cawing and chattering, gossiping in the manner of crows... and humans.</t3680> <t3681>I am very busy, and I don't need to tell you, arranging things and doing household chores.</t3681> <t3682>Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for now that Jonathan is his partner, Mr. Hawkins wants him to know everything concerning his clients.</t3682>
<t3683>"How is your dear mother doing?"</t3683> <t3684>I wish I could go to the city for one or two days to see you, dear, but I don't dare to go yet, with so much work on my shoulders; and Jonathan still needs to be taken care of.</t3684> <t3685>He is beginning to put flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the long illness; even now sometimes he wakes up startled from his sleep in a sudden way, and he starts trembling until I manage, with cuddles, to restore his usual calmness.</t3685> <t3686>However, thank God these occasions are becoming less frequent as the days go by, and I trust that in time they will disappear completely.</t3686> <t3687>And now that I have given you my news, let me ask about yours.</t3687> <t3688>When are you going to get married, and where, and who is going to perform the ceremony, and what are you going to wear?</t3688> <t3689>Is it going to be a public ceremony, or private?</t3689> <t3690>Tell me everything you can about it, dear; tell me everything about everything, for there is nothing that interests you that is not dear to me.</t3690> <t3691>Jonathan asks me to send you his 'respectful regards', but I don't think that is fitting for the young partner of the important firm Hawkins and just as you love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the modes and tenses of the verb, I simply send you his 'affection'.</t3691> <t3692>Goodbye, my dearest Lucy, and all blessings to you.</t3692>

<t3700>"Dear Sir:</t3700>
<t3701>"In compliance with your wishes, I am sending attached a report on the conditions of everything that has been left in my charge...</t3701> <t3702>Regarding the patient, there is something more to say.</t3702> <t3703>He had another escape attempt, which could have had a terrible end, but fortunately, as it happened, did not reach the tragic outcome that was expected.</t3703>
<t3704>This afternoon, a carriage with two men arrived at the empty house whose grounds border ours, the house to which, you will recall, the patient escaped on two occasions.</t3704> <t3705>The men stopped at the gate to ask the porter for directions, as they were strangers.</t3705> <t3706>I myself was looking out the study window, smoking after dinner, and saw one of the men approach the house.</t3706> <t3707>As he passed by Renfield's room window, the patient began to taunt him from inside and call him every rotten name he could put on his tongue.</t3707> <t3708>The man, who seemed a decent type, merely told him to "shut his rotten beggar's mouth," to which our inmate accused him of stealing from him and wanting to kill him, adding that he would thwart his plans even if they hanged him for it.</t3708> <t3709>I opened the window and signaled to the man not to take things seriously, so he contented himself with taking a look around the place, perhaps to get an idea of the kind of site he had ended up at.</t3709> <t3710>And then he said: 'God bless you, sir; I don't get upset by what they say to me in a madhouse like this.</t3710> <t3711>You and the director rather have my pity for having to live in a house with a wild beast like that.</t3711> <t3712>Then he asked for directions quite courteously, and I showed him where the gate of the empty house was; he walked away, followed by threats and insults from our man.</t3712> <t3713>I went down to see if I could discover the cause of his anger, as usually he is a proper man, and except for violent periods nothing like this ever happens to him.</t3713> <t3714>To my astonishment, I found him quite calm and behaving in the most cordial manner.</t3714> <t3715>I tried to get him to talk about the incident, but he gently asked me what I was talking about, leading me to believe he had completely forgotten the matter.</t3715> <t3716>It was, however, I regret to say, just another instance of his cunning, for half an hour later I had news of him again.</t3716> <t3717>This time he had escaped again from his room window and was running down the avenue.</t3717> <t3718>I called the attendants to follow me and ran after him, fearing he was attempting some trick.</t3718> <t3719>My fear was justified when I saw the same carriage that had passed by us earlier coming down the road, loaded with some wooden boxes.</t3719> <t3720>The men were wiping their foreheads and had flushed faces, as if they had just done some violent exercise.</t3720> <t3721>Before I could reach him, the patient ran towards them and, pulling one of them off the carriage, began to bash his head against the ground.</t3721> <t3722>If I hadn't restrained him at that moment, I believe he would have beaten the man to death right there.</t3722> <t3723>The other fellow jumped off the carriage and struck him with the handle of his heavy whip.</t3723> <t3724>It was a terrible blow, but he didn't seem to feel it; instead, he grabbed the man too and fought us three, tossing us around like kittens.</t3724> <t3725>You know very well that I am not light, and the other two men were burly.</t3725> <t3726>At first, he fought silently, but as we began to overpower him, and when the attendants were putting the straitjacket on him, he started to shout: 'I will stop it.</t3726> <t3727>You won't rob me!</t3727> <t3728>You won't murder me by inches!</t3728> <t3729>I will fight for my master and lord!’, and all that kind of incoherent nonsense.</t3729> <t3730>With considerable difficulty, they managed to bring him back to the house and we locked him in the secure room.</t3730> <t3731>One of the attendants, Hardy, has a bruised finger.</t3731> <t3732>However, he splinted it well, and it is improving.</t3732> <t3733>At first, the two coachmen shouted loud threats of suing us for damages and promised that all the penalties of the law would rain down on us.</t3733> <t3734>However, their threats were mixed with a sort of indirect lamentation over the defeat they had suffered at the hands of a weak madman.</t3734> <t3735>They said that if it hadn't been for the way they had exhausted their strength lifting the heavy boxes onto the carriage, they would have finished him off quickly.</t3735> <t3736>They gave another reason for their defeat: the extraordinary state of dryness to which they had been reduced by the very nature of their occupation, and the reprehensible distance of any public entertainment establishment from the scene of their labors.</t3736> <t3737>I understood their insinuation well, and after a good glass of grog, or rather, several glasses of the same thing, and each of them having a sovereign in hand, they began to joke about the attack and swore they would find any day a madman worse than that just for the pleasure of meeting 'such a charming fool' as the one who writes this.</t3737> <t3738>I noted down their names and addresses, in case we need them.</t3738> <t3739>They are as follows: Jack Smollet, from Dudding's Rents, King George's Road.</t3739> <t3740>Great Walworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley's Row, Guide Court, Bethnal Green.</t3740> <t3741>Both are employees of Harris & Sons, Moving and Shipping Company, Orange Master's Yard, Soho.</t3741>
<t3742>"I will inform you of any matter of interest that occurs here, and I will call you immediately in case something important happens."</t3742>

<t3748>“My dearest Lucy:</t3748>
<t3749>We have suffered a terrible blow.</t3749> <t3750>Mr. Hawkins died suddenly.</t3750> <t3751>Some may think this is not sad for us, but we had both come to care for him so much that it truly feels as if we have lost a father.</t3751>
<t3752>I never knew either my father or my mother, so the death of this dear old man has been a real blow to me.</t3752> <t3753>Jonathan is also very downcast.</t3753> <t3754>He not only feels sad, very sad, for the dear old man who has helped him so much in his life, and who now at the end has treated him as if he were his own son and has left him a fortune that for people of our modest origin is a wealth beyond the dreams of avarice.</t3754> <t3755>Jonathan also feels something else: he says that the great responsibility that falls on him makes him nervous.</t3755> <t3756>He begins to doubt himself.</t3756> <t3757>I try to encourage him, and my faith in him helps him to have faith in himself.</t3757> <t3758>But it is precisely in this way that the great impression he has experienced affects him more.</t3758> <t3759>Oh!</t3759> <t3760>It is too hard that a nature as sweet, simple, noble, and strong as his (a nature that enabled him, with the help of our friend, to rise from a simple employee to the position he holds today) is so damaged that the very essence of his strength has disappeared.</t3760> <t3761>Forgive me, dear, if I trouble you with my problems in the midst of your own happiness; but, dear Lucy, I must talk to someone, for the effort I make to maintain a cheerful appearance before Jonathan tires me, and here I have no one to confide in.</t3761> <t3762>I fear going to London, as we must do the day after tomorrow, for the poor Mr. Hawkins left in his will that he wished to be buried in the tomb with his father.</t3762> <t3763>As there are no relatives, Jonathan will have to preside over the funeral.</t3763> <t3764>I will try to stop by to see you, dear, even if only for a few minutes.</t3764> <t3765>Forgive me again for causing you distress.</t3765> <t3766>With all blessings, lovingly,</t3766>
<t3767>MINA HARKER</t3767>
<t3768>From the diary of Dr. Seward</t3768>
<t3769>September 20.</t3769> <t3770>Only a great effort of will and habit allow me to make these notes tonight.</t3770> <t3771>I feel too miserable, too dejected, too weary of the world and everything in it, including life itself, in such a way that I wouldn't mind hearing at this very moment the fluttering of the wings of the angel of death.</t3771> <t3772>And those dark wings have been fluttering lately for some reason: Lucy's mother and Arthur's father, and now…</t3772>
<t3773>Let's continue my work.</t3773>
<t3774>I promptly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy.</t3774> <t3775>We wanted Arthur to go rest as well, but at first, he refused.</t3775> <t3776>He only agreed when I told him that we would need him during the day to help us, and that we should not all exhaust ourselves at the same time because Lucy might suffer the consequences.</t3776> <t3777>Van Helsing was very kind to him.</t3777>
<t3778>–Come, son -he said to him-; come with me.</t3778> <t3779>You are sick and weak and have had many sorrows and much pain, as well as a depletion of your strength that we know well.</t3779> <t3780>You should not be alone, for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.</t3780> <t3781>Come to the living room, where there is a good fire and two sofas.</t3781> <t3782>You will lie on one and I on the other, and our company will give us some relief, even if we do not speak, and even if we sleep.</t3782>
<t3783>Arthur went with him, casting a nostalgic glance at Lucy's face, which lay on her pillow almost whiter than the sheet.</t3783> <t3784>She lay quite still, and I looked around the room to see that everything was in order.</t3784> <t3785>I could see that the professor had carried out in this room, as in the other, his intention to use garlic; all the window sashes smelled strongly of it.</t3785> <t3786>And around Lucy's neck, over the silk scarf that Van Helsing had made her wear, was a rough necklace made of the same fragrant flowers.</t3786> <t3787>Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously and her face was contorted, for her open mouth revealed pale gums.</t3787> <t3788>In the dim and uncertain light, her teeth seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning.</t3788> <t3789>In particular, perhaps due to some play of light, the canines seemed longer and sharper than the rest.</t3789> <t3790>I sat by her side, and after a short time she moved restlessly.</t3790> <t3791>At that very moment, a kind of dull flapping or scratching came from the window.</t3791> <t3792>I went silently towards it and peered through a corner of the lattice.</t3792>
<t3793>There was a full moon, and I could see that the noise was caused by a large bat fluttering about, undoubtedly attracted by the light, although it was so faint, and occasionally hitting the window with its wings.</t3793> <t3794>When I returned to my seat, I saw that Lucy had moved slightly and the garlic flowers had fallen from her neck.</t3794> <t3795>I placed them back in their spot as best as I could, and sat down, watching her.</t3795>
<t3796>Shortly after, she woke up, and I gave her food just as van Helsing had prescribed.</t3796> <t3797>She only took a little, and reluctantly.</t3797> <t3798>It seemed that her former unconscious struggle for life, and the strength that had marked her illness until then, were no longer with her.</t3798> <t3799>I was surprised by the curious fact that at the moment she became conscious, she pressed the garlic flowers against her chest.</t3799> <t3800>It was certainly very strange that whenever she entered that lethargic state, with stertorous breathing, she tried to remove the flowers, but upon waking, she held onto them.</t3800> <t3801>There was no possibility of making a mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many periods of sleep and wakefulness, and repeated both actions many times.</t3801>
<t3802>At six in the morning, Van Helsing arrived to relieve me.</t3802> <t3803>Arthur had fallen into a stupor, and kindly he allowed him to continue sleeping.</t3803> <t3804>When he saw Lucy's face, I could hear the hissing intake of his breath, and he said to me in a sharp whisper:</t3804>
<t3805>–Raise the lattice; I want light!</t3805>
<t3806>Then he leaned over and, with his face almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully.</t3806> <t3807>He removed the flowers and then took off the silk handkerchief from her throat.</t3807> <t3808>As he did so, he stepped back, and I could hear his exclamation: "Mein Gott!…" which got stuck in his throat.</t3808> <t3809>I leaned over and looked as well, and when I did, a strange chill ran through my body.</t3809>
<t3810>The wounds on the throat had completely disappeared.</t3810>
<t3811>For almost five minutes, Van Helsing was looking at her, with a face more serious and tense than ever.</t3811> <t3812>Then he turned to me and said calmly:</t3812>
<t3813>–He is dying.</t3813> <t3814>He won't have much time left.</t3814> <t3815>There will be a big difference, believe me, if he dies conscious or if he dies while sleeping.</t3815> <t3816>Wake up the poor boy and let him come and see the end; he trusts us, and we had promised him.</t3816>
<t3817>I went down to the dining room and woke him up.</t3817> <t3818>He was dazed for a moment, but when he saw the sunlight coming through the slats of the blinds, he thought it was already late, and expressed his fear to me.</t3818> <t3819>I assured him that Lucy was still asleep, but I told him as gently as I could that both van Helsing and I feared the end was near.</t3819> <t3820>He covered his face with his hands and slid to his knees beside the sofa, where he remained, perhaps a minute, with his head bowed, praying, while his shoulders shook with sorrow.</t3820> <t3821>I took him by the hand and lifted him up.</t3821>
<t3822>–Come -I said, my dear old friend; gather all your strength: it will be the best and the easiest for her.</t3822> <t3823>When we arrived at Lucy's room, I could see that Van Helsing, with his usual foresight, had been putting everything in its place and making everything as pleasant as possible.</t3823> <t3824>He had even brushed Lucy's hair, so that it spread out over the pillow in its usual golden curls.</t3824> <t3825>When we entered the room, she opened her eyes, and upon seeing him, she weakly whispered:</t3825>
<t3826>–Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so happy that you have come!</t3826>
<t3827>He stopped to kiss her, but Van Helsing ordered him to step back.</t3827>
<t3828>–No -he whispered-, not yet!</t3828> <t3829>Hold her hand; it will give her more comfort.</t3829>
<t3830>So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she glowed, with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes.</t3830> <t3831>Then, gradually, her eyes closed and she sank into sleep.</t3831> <t3832>For a short time her chest rose gently; and it rose and fell like that of a tired child.</t3832>
<t3833>Then, imperceptibly, came the strange change that I had noticed during the night.</t3833>
<t3834>His breathing became stertorous, he opened his mouth, and the pale gums stretched back made the teeth appear longer and sharper than ever.</t3834> <t3835>He opened his eyes in a vague, somnambulistic manner, as if unconscious, now reflecting both vagueness and hardness, and spoke in a soft and voluptuous voice, such as I had never heard from his lips before:</t3835>
<t3836>–Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so happy you came! Kiss me!</t3836>
<t3837>Arthur leaned forward anxiously to kiss her, but at that very moment van Helsing, who, like me, had been astonished by the young woman's voice, rushed at the groom and, grabbing him by the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a strength I never thought he could possess, and indeed threw him almost to the other side of the room.</t3837>
<t3838>–Never in your life! – he told him –; don't do it, for the love of your soul and hers!</t3838>
<t3839>And then, he positioned himself between the two like a cornered lion.</t3839> <t3840>Arthur was so surprised that for a moment he didn't know what to do or say; and before any impulse of violence could take hold of him, he realized the place and the circumstances and remained silent, waiting.</t3840>
<t3841>I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, just like Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm of anger quickly pass like a shadow across her face; her sharp teeth snapped shut.</t3841> <t3842>Then her eyes closed and she breathed heavily.</t3842>
<t3843>Soon after, her eyes opened with all their softness, and extending her poor, pale, and thin hand, she took van Helsing's heavy and dark hand; bringing it closer, she kissed it.</t3843>
<t3844>–My true friend -she said, in a weak voice but with an indescribable painful accent-.</t3844> <t3845>My true friend, and his friend! Oh, protect him, and give me peace!</t3845>
<t3846>–I swear! – he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding her hand, like someone taking an oath.</t3846> <t3847>Then he turned to Arthur and said: Come, son, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the forehead, and only once.</t3847>
<t3848>Their eyes met instead of their lips; and thus they parted.</t3848>
<t3849>Lucy’s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took Arthur by the arm and led him away from the bed.</t3849>
<t3850>Then Lucy's breathing became labored once more, and suddenly it stopped altogether.</t3850>
<t3851>"It's all over," said Van Helsing. "She is dead!"</t3851>
<t3852>I took Arthur by the arm and led him to the living room, where he sat down and covered his face with his hands, sobbing like a child.</t3852>
<t3853>I returned to the room and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and his face was more serious than ever.</t3853> <t3854>Her body had changed somewhat.</t3854> <t3855>Death had returned some of her beauty to her, as her eyebrows and cheeks had regained some of their soft lines; even her lips had lost their mortal pallor.</t3855> <t3856>It was as if the blood, no longer necessary for the functioning of the heart, had wanted to mitigate as much as possible the rigidity and desolation of death.</t3856>
<t3857>"We think he was dying while he was sleeping, and sleeping when he died."</t3857><t3858>"</t3858>
<t3859>I stood next to Van Helsing, and I said to him:</t3859>
<t3860>–Ah! Poor girl!</t3860> <t3861>At last, there is peace for her.</t3861> <t3862>It is the end!</t3862> <t3863>He turned to me and said with grave solemnity:</t3863>
<t3864>–None of that.</t3864> <t3865>Oh, none of that.</t3865> <t3866>It's just the beginning!</t3866>
<t3867>When I asked him what he meant, he shook his head and replied:</t3867>
<t3868>–We can't do anything for her yet.</t3868> <t3869>Wait.</t3869> <t3870>You'll see…</t3870>
<t3871>XIII.–</t3871> <t3872>FROM THE DIARY OF DR. SEWARD (continued)</t3872>
<t3873>The funeral was arranged for the following day, so that Lucy and her mother could be buried together.</t3873> <t3874>I took care of all the unpleasant formalities, and the courteous funeral director proved to me that his employees were affected, or blessed, by some of his own gratuitous gentleness.</t3874> <t3875>Even the woman who performed the last rites for the dead commented to me, in a confidential manner, as if between colleagues, when she had left the death chamber:</t3875>
<t3876>–Sir, the young lady is a magnificent corpse.</t3876> <t3877>It is truly a privilege to attend to her.</t3877> <t3878>I do not exaggerate when I say that attending to such clients accredits our establishment!</t3878>
<t3879>–I noticed that van Helsing never strayed far.</t3879> <t3880>This was possible due to the disordered state of the house.</t3880> <t3881>There were no relatives at hand, and since Arthur had to be back the next day to attend his father's funeral, we were unable to notify anyone who might have taken charge of the affairs.</t3881> <t3882>Under these circumstances, van Helsing and I began the examination of the papers, etc.</t3882> <t3883>My mentor insisted on personally taking charge of Lucy's papers.</t3883> <t3884>I asked him why, as I feared that he, being a foreigner, might not be aware of the English legal requirements, and could thus, out of ignorance, cause some unnecessary complications.</t3884> <t3885>He answered me:</t3885>
<t3886>–I know; I know.</t3886> <t3887>You forget that I am also a lawyer, besides being a doctor.</t3887> <t3888>But this is not for the law anyway.</t3888> <t3889>You clearly foresaw that when you avoided the coroner.</t3889> <t3890>I have to avoid others besides him.</t3890> <t3891>There may be other papers…</t3891>
<t3892>While speaking, he took from his pocket notebook the memo that had been on Lucy's chest, and which she had torn while sleeping.</t3892>
<t3893>–When you discover something from the lawyer of the late Mrs. Westenra, seal all her papers and write to him tonight.</t3893> <t3894>As for me, I will keep watch here in the room and in the old room of Miss Lucy all night, and I will search for whatever it may be myself.</t3894> <t3895>It is not good for her most intimate thoughts to fall into the hands of strangers.</t3895>
<t3896>I dedicated myself to my part of the work, and within half an hour I had found the name and address of Mrs. Westenra's lawyer, and I had written to him.</t3896> <t3897>All the papers of the poor lady were in order; they contained explicit instructions regarding the burial place.</t3897> <t3898>I had not finished sealing the letter when, to my surprise, Van Helsing entered the room, saying:</t3898>
<t3899>–Can I help you, friend John?</t3899> <t3900>I am free, and if you allow me, I will collaborate with you.</t3900>
<t3901>"Did you find what you were looking for?" I asked him, to which he replied:</t3901>
<t3902>–I wasn't looking for anything specific.</t3902> <t3903>I just hoped to find, and I found some letters and a few notes, and a recently started diary.</t3903> <t3904>But I have them here, and for now, we won't say anything about them.</t3904> <t3905>I will see the poor boy tomorrow night, and, with his consent, I will use these documents.</t3905>
<t3906>When we finished the work we had at hand, he told me:</t3906>
<t3907>–And now, friend John, I think we can go to bed.</t3907> <t3908>We want to sleep, both you and I, and rest to recover.</t3908> <t3909>Tomorrow we will both have a lot to do, but for tonight there is no need for us.</t3909>
<t3910>Before we left, we went to see poor Lucy.</t3910> <t3911>The undertaker had undoubtedly done a good job, as the room had been transformed into a small chapelle ardente.</t3911> <t3912>There was an abundance of beautiful white flowers, and death had been made as least repulsive as possible.</t3912> <t3913>The end of the shroud was placed over her face; when the professor leaned over and gently pulled it back, we were both surprised by the beauty before us, with the tall wax candles providing enough light for us to notice it.</t3913> <t3914>All of Lucy's beauty had returned to her in death, and the hours that had passed, instead of leaving traces of the "annihilators of death," had restored the beauty of life, so much so that I could hardly believe my eyes that I was looking at a corpse.</t3914>
<t3915>The professor looked with grave seriousness.</t3915> <t3916>He had not loved her like I did, and therefore there was no need for tears in his eyes.</t3916> <t3917>He said to me: "Stay here until I return," and left the room.</t3917> <t3918>He came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box that was in the corridor but had not yet been opened, and placed the flowers among the others, on top of and around the bed.</t3918> <t3919>Then, he took from his neck, beneath his shirt, a small gold crucifix, and placed it over the mouth of the deceased.</t3919> <t3920>He returned the sheet to its place and we left the room.</t3920>
<t3921>I was undressing in my own room when, with a few warning taps, he entered and immediately began to speak:</t3921>
<t3922>–Tomorrow I want you to bring me, before nightfall, a set of dissection scalpels.</t3922>
<t3923>–Should we perform an autopsy? – I asked him.</t3923>
<t3924>–Yes, and no.</t3924> <t3925>I want to operate, but not in the way you think.</t3925> <t3926>Let me tell you now, but not a word to anyone else.</t3926> <t3927>I want to cut off her head and take out her heart.</t3927> <t3928>Ah! You are a surgeon and you are horrified.</t3928> <t3929>You, whom I have seen without a tremor in your hand or heart, performing life-and-death operations that make others tremble.</t3929> <t3930>Oh!</t3930> <t3931>But I must not forget, my dear friend John, that you loved her; and I have not forgotten, for I am the one who will operate and you must not help.</t3931> <t3932>I would like to do it tonight, but I won't because of Arthur; he will be free after his father's funeral tomorrow and will want to see her, see that.</t3932> <t3933>Then, when she is already in the coffin the next day, you and I will come when everyone is asleep.</t3933> <t3934>We will unscrew the coffin lid and perform our operation; then we will put everything back in place, so that no one will know, except us.</t3934>
<t3935>–But, why should we do that?</t3935> <t3936>The girl is dead.</t3936> <t3937>Why unnecessarily mutilate her poor body?</t3937> <t3938>And if there is no need for an autopsy and nothing can be gained from it (it does not benefit Lucy, it does not benefit us, nor science, nor human knowledge), why should we do it?</t3938> <t3939>Such a thing is monstrous.</t3939>
<t3940>In response, he placed his hand on my shoulder and then said, with infinite tenderness:</t3940>
<t3941>–Friend John, I sympathize with your poor bleeding heart; and I love you more because it bleeds in that way.</t3941> <t3942>If I could, I would take the burden you carry myself.</t3942> <t3943>But there are things you do not know, and yet you will know, and you will bless me for knowing them, even though they are not pleasant things.</t3943> <t3944>John, my son, you have been my friend for many years, but did you ever know me to do anything without a good reason?</t3944> <t3945>I can make mistakes, I am only a man: but I believe in everything I do.</t3945> <t3946>Wasn't it for this that you sent for me when the great problem arose? Yes!</t3946> <t3947>Weren't you astonished, rather horrified, when I did not allow Arthur to kiss his beloved, even though she was dying, and I dragged him away with all my strength?</t3947> <t3948>Yes!</t3948> <t3949>However, you saw how she thanked me, with her beautiful dying eyes, her voice also so weak, and kissed my rough and old hand and blessed me.</t3949> <t3950>And did you not hear me make a promise to her so that she would gratefully close her eyes? Yes!</t3950>
<t3951>"Well, now I have a good reason for everything I want to do.</t3951> <t3952>For many years you have trusted me; in the past weeks you have believed in me, when there have been things so strange that you might well have doubted.</t3952> <t3953>Trust me a little longer, friend John.</t3953> <t3954>If you do not trust me, then I must say what I think; and that may not be right.</t3954> <t3955>And if I work, as I will work, it doesn't matter the trust or distrust, without my friend's trust in me, I work with a heavy heart, and I feel, oh!, that I am alone when I desire all the help and courage that can be—he paused for a moment, and continued solemnly—: Friend John, strange and terrible days lie ahead of us.</t3955> <t3956>Let us be not two, but one, so that we can work successfully.</t3956> <t3957>Will you have faith in me?"</t3957>
<t3958>I took his hand and promised him.</t3958> <t3959>As he walked away, I kept my door open and watched him enter his room and close the door.</t3959> <t3960>While I stood motionless, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the corridor (she had her back to me, so she didn't see me) and enter the room where Lucy lay.</t3960> <t3961>This impressed me.</t3961> <t3962>Devotion is so rare, and we feel so grateful to those who show it towards our loved ones without us asking them to…!</t3962> <t3963>There was a poor girl overcoming the natural terrors she felt about death, to go and keep solitary watch by the coffin of the mistress she loved, so that the poor woman would not be lonely until she was laid to her eternal rest…</t3963>
<t3964>I must have slept long and deeply, for it was already broad daylight when Van Helsing woke me upon entering my room.</t3964> <t3965>He came close to my bed and said:</t3965>
<t3966>–You don't need to bother with the scalpels.</t3966> <t3967>We won't use them.</t3967>
<t3968>“Why not?” I asked him, for the solemnity he had shown the previous night had deeply impressed me.</t3968>
<t3969>Because - he said, solemnly too late... or too early.</t3969> <t3970>Look! - he added, holding the small golden crucifix in his hand.</t3970> <t3971>This was stolen during the night.</t3971>
<t3972>–What? Stolen? – I asked him in astonishment-.</t3972> <t3973>If you have it now…</t3973>
<t3974>–Because I have recovered it from the useless unfortunate woman who stole it; from the woman who stole from the dead and the living.</t3974> <t3975>Her punishment will surely come, but not by my hand: she did not know what she was doing, and out of ignorance, she only stole.</t3975> <t3976>Now, we must wait.</t3976>
<t3977>He walked away after saying this, leaving me with a new mystery to ponder, a new puzzle to grapple with.</t3977>
<t3978>The morning passed without incident, but at noon the lawyer arrived: Mr. Marquand, from Wholeman, Sons, Marquand Lidderdale.</t3978> <t3979>He was very cordial and grateful for what we had done, and he took all the care regarding the details off our hands.</t3979> <t3980>During lunch, he told us that Mrs. Westenra had been expecting a sudden death due to her heart for some time, and had put all her affairs in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of certain property with a title from Lucy's father, which now, in the absence of a direct heir, would go to a distant branch of the family, the entire estate was absolutely left to Arthur Holmwood.</t3980> <t3981>When he had told us all that, he continued:</t3981>
<t3982>–Frankly, we did everything possible to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and we pointed out certain contingencies that could leave your daughter either without a cent, or not as free as she should be to act considering a matrimonial alliance.</t3982> <t3983>In fact, we pressed the matter so much that we almost came to a clash, as she asked us whether we were or were not prepared to fulfill her wishes.</t3983> <t3984>Of course, we had no alternative but to accept.</t3984> <t3985>In principle, we were right, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we could have proven, by the logic of events, the soundness of our judgment.</t3985> <t3986>However, frankly, I must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have resulted in the impossibility of carrying out her wishes.</t3986> <t3987>For her daughter would have come into possession of the property and, even if she had only survived her mother by five minutes, her property, in the event that there was no will, and a will was practically impossible in such a case, would have been treated upon her death as ab intestato.</t3987> <t3988>In which case, Lord Godalming, although he was a close friend of theirs, would not have any right.</t3988> <t3989>And the heirs, being distant relatives, would not so easily abandon their rightful claims for sentimental reasons related to a complete stranger.</t3989> <t3990>I assure you, my esteemed gentlemen, that I am happy with the outcome; very happy.</t3990>
<t3991>He was a good guy, but his happiness over that small part (in which he was officially interested) amidst such a great tragedy was an objective lesson in the limitations of commiseration.</t3991>
<t3992>He did not stay long, but said he would return later in the day and see Lord Godalming.</t3992> <t3993>His arrival, however, had been a certain relief for us, as it ensured that we would not have the threat of hostile criticism for any of our actions.</t3993> <t3994>Arthur was expected to arrive at five, so shortly before that time we visited the mortuary chamber.</t3994> <t3995>And so it could truly be called, for now both mother and daughter lay in it.</t3995> <t3996>The undertaker, true to his skill, had made the best display of his goods that he possessed, and throughout the place there was a gloomy atmosphere that immediately depressed us.</t3996> <t3997>Van Helsing ordered that everything be put back as it was before, explaining that, since Lord Godalming would soon arrive, it would be less heartbreaking for his feelings to see all that remained of his fiancée alone.</t3997> <t3998>The undertaker seemed distressed by his own stupidity and made every effort to rearrange everything just as it had been the previous night, so that when Arthur arrived, as many bad impressions as possible would be avoided.</t3998>
<t3999>Poor man!</t3999> <t4000>He was desperately sad and dejected; even his steel-like manliness seemed to have diminished somewhat under the strain of his many emotions.</t4000> <t4001>He had been, I know, genuinely and devotedly attached to his father; and losing him, at a time like that, was a bitter blow for him.</t4001> <t4002>With me, he was more affectionate than ever, and he was sweetly courteous with Van Helsing; but I couldn't help but see that there was some reticence in him.</t4002> <t4003>The professor noticed it too and signaled to me to take him upstairs.</t4003>
<t4004>I did it and left it at the door of the room, as I felt that he would want to be completely alone with her, but he took me by the arm and led me inside, saying dryly:</t4004>
<t4005>–You loved her too, old friend; she told me everything about it, and there was no friend who had a closer place in her heart than you.</t4005> <t4006>I don't know how to thank you for everything you've done for her.</t4006> <t4007>I still can't think...</t4007>
<t4008>And here he suddenly showed his dejection, and put his arms around my shoulders, resting his head on my chest, crying:</t4008>
<t4009>–Oh, Jack! Jack!</t4009> <t4010>What will I do?</t4010> <t4011>All the life seems to have suddenly left me, and there is nothing in the wide world for which I wish to live.</t4011>
<t4012>I comforted him as best as I could.</t4012> <t4013>In such cases, men do not need much expression.</t4013> <t4014>A handshake, or pats on the shoulder, a sob in unison, are pleasant expressions for a man's heart.</t4014> <t4015>I remained still and silent until he stopped sobbing, and then I said to him softly:</t4015>
<t4016>–Come and look at it.</t4016>
<t4017>Together we walked towards the bed, and I removed the shroud from her face.</t4017> <t4018>God!</t4018> <t4019>How beautiful she was.</t4019> <t4020>Every hour seemed to increase her beauty.</t4020> <t4021>In some way, that astonished and frightened me; and as for Arthur, he fell trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as if it were a chill.</t4021> <t4022>After a long pause, he said to me, exhaling a very weak sigh:</t4022>
<t4023>–Jack, is she really dead?</t4023>
<t4024>I assured him sadly that it was so, and then I suggested (for I felt that such a terrible doubt should not live even a moment longer than I could allow) that it often happened that after death the faces softened and even regained their youthful beauty; this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering.</t4024> <t4025>It seemed that my words dispelled any doubt, and after kneeling for a while beside the bed and looking at her long and lovingly, he left.</t4025> <t4026>I told him that this had to be the farewell, as the coffin had to be prepared, so he returned and took her dead hand in his, kissed it, and leaned down and kissed her forehead.</t4026> <t4027>Then he withdrew, looking lovingly over his shoulder at her as he walked away.</t4027>
<t4028>I left him in the room and told van Helsing that Arthur had already said his goodbyes to his beloved; so he went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's employees to continue the preparations and screw down the coffin.</t4028> <t4029>When he came out of the room again, I relayed Arthur's question to him, and he replied:</t4029>
<t4030>–It doesn't surprise me.</t4030> <t4031>Just a moment ago, I was doubting the same thing!</t4031>
<t4032>We all had dinner together, and I could see how poor Art tried to do his best.</t4032> <t4033>Van Helsing remained silent throughout the entire dinner, but when we lit our cigarettes, he said:</t4033>
<t4034>–Lord...</t4034>
<t4035>But Arthur interrupted him:</t4035>
<t4036>–No, no, not that, for the love of God!</t4036> <t4037>Anyway, not yet.</t4037> <t4038>Forgive me, sir, I didn't mean to offend you; it's just that my loss is very recent.</t4038>
<t4039>The professor responded very kindly:</t4039>
<t4040>–I only used that title because I was unsure.</t4040> <t4041>I mustn't call you "sir" and I've grown very fond of you; yes, my dear boy, very fond; I will call you Arthur.</t4041>
<t4042>Arthur extended his hand and warmly shook the old man's.</t4042>
<t4043>–Call me whatever you like -he said-.</t4043> <t4044>And I hope that you always hold the title of friend.</t4044> <t4045>And let me tell you that I cannot find the words to thank you for all your kindness towards my poor beloved -he paused and then continued-.</t4045> <t4046>I know that she understood your kindness even better than I did; and if I was rude or in any way bothersome when you acted strangely, do you remember? – the professor nodded -, you must forgive me.</t4046>
<t4047>My teacher replied with solemn kindness:</t4047>
<t4048>–I know it was terrible for you to give me your trust back then, because to trust in such violences one needs to understand; and I suppose you don't trust me now, you can't trust, because you still don't understand.</t4048> <t4049>And there may be other occasions when I want you to trust when you can't, or shouldn't, and still don't come to understand.</t4049> <t4050>But the time will come when your trust in me will be unrestricted, and you will understand, as if the very light of the sun penetrated your mind.</t4050> <t4051>Then, you will bless me for your own good, for the good of others, and for the good of the one you swore to protect.</t4051>
<t4052>–And, in fact, sir -said Arthur warmly-, I will trust you anyway.</t4052> <t4053>I know and believe that you have a noble heart, and you are a friend of Jack, and you were a friend of hers.</t4053> <t4054>Do whatever you deem appropriate.</t4054>
<t4055>The professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as if he were about to speak, and finally said:</t4055>
<t4056>–Can I ask you something now?</t4056>
<t4057>–Of course.</t4057>
<t4058>–Do you know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her properties?</t4058>
<t4059>–No.</t4059> <t4060>Poor lady!</t4060> <t4061>I never thought about it.</t4061>
<t4062>–And since everything belongs to you, you have the right to do with it as you please.</t4062> <t4063>I wish for you to give me your authorization to read all the papers and letters of Miss Lucy.</t4063> <t4064>Believe me, it is not mere curiosity.</t4064> <t4065>I have a motive that, you can be sure, she would have approved.</t4065> <t4066>I have them all here.</t4066> <t4067>I took them before we knew that everything belonged to you, so that no strange hand would touch them, so that no strange eye could see through the words into her soul.</t4067> <t4068>I will keep them, if you allow me; not even you will be able to see them yet, but I will keep them safe.</t4068> <t4069>Not a word will be lost, and in due time I will return them to you.</t4069> <t4070>It is a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, won't you, for the love of Lucy…</t4070>
<t4071>Arthur spoke sincerely, as he usually did:</t4071>
<t4072>–Doctor van Helsing, you can do as you wish.</t4072> <t4073>I feel that by saying this I am doing what my Lucy would have approved.</t4073> <t4074>I will not bother you with questions until the time comes.</t4074>
<t4075>The elderly professor stood up as he solemnly said:</t4075>
<t4076>–And you are right.</t4076> <t4077>There will be much pain for all of us; but not everything will be pain, nor will this pain be the last.</t4077> <t4078>We and you too, you more than anyone, my dear friend, will have to pass through the bitter water before reaching the sweet.</t4078> <t4079>But we must be brave and selfless, and fulfill our duty; everything will turn out well.</t4079>
<t4080>I slept on a sofa in Arthur's room that night.</t4080> <t4081>Van Helsing did not go to bed.</t4081>
<t4082>He walked back and forth, as if he were patrolling the house, and never strayed far from the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, sprinkled with wild garlic flowers, which emitted, through the scent of lilacs and roses, a heavy and overwhelming smell in the silence of the night.</t4082>
<t4083>From the diary of Mina Harker</t4083>
<t4084>September 22.</t4084> <t4085>On the train to Exeter, Jonathan sleeps.</t4085> <t4086>It seems like it was only yesterday when I made those intimate notes, and yet, how much has transpired between them, in Whitby and all over the world before me!</t4086> <t4087>Jonathan was far away and I had no news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan as a solicitor, partner in a firm, wealthy, owner of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and Jonathan with another attack that could harm him greatly.</t4087> <t4088>Someday he may ask me about it.</t4088> <t4089>Everything is going downhill.</t4089> <t4090>I am rusty in my shorthand; see what unexpected prosperity does for us, so it's not bad that I refresh it again by practicing a little.</t4090>
<t4091>The service was very simple and solemn.</t4091> <t4092>Only we ourselves and the servants attended, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his agent in London, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the president of the Legal Society.</t4092> <t4093>Jonathan and I held hands, and we felt that our best and dearest friend had left us.</t4093>
<t4094>We returned to the city in silence and took a bus to the corner of Hyde Park. Jonathan thought I might be interested in going to the Row for a moment, so we sat down; but there were so few people there that it was sad and desolate to see so many empty chairs.</t4094> <t4095>It made us think of the empty chair we had at home; so we got up and walked towards Piccadilly.</t4095> <t4096>Jonathan held my hand, just as he used to do before I went to school.</t4096> <t4097>To me, it seemed very bold, because you can't spend years teaching etiquette and decorum to girls without the pedantry of it impressing you a little.</t4097> <t4098>But it was Jonathan, and he was my husband, and we didn't know anyone we saw (and we didn't care if they knew us), so we kept walking in the same way.</t4098>
<t4099>I was looking at a very beautiful girl, with a carriage wheel hat, who was sitting in a victoria outside Giuliano's, when I felt Jonathan squeeze my hand so hard that it hurt, and he said in a whisper: "My God!"</t4099> <t4100>I am always anxious about Jonathan, as I always fear that some nervous attack might make him ill again; so I turned to him quickly and asked what had bothered him.</t4100>
<t4101>He was very pale, and his eyes seemed to be popping out of their sockets, while, with a mixture of terror and astonishment, he stared fixedly at a tall, thin man with an aquiline nose, black mustache, and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty girl.</t4101> <t4102>He was looking at her so intently that he didn't notice our presence, and because of that, I was able to get a good look at him.</t4102> <t4103>His face was not a good face; it was hard and cruel, and sensual, and his large white teeth, which looked even whiter against the bright red of his lips, were sharp like an animal's.</t4103> <t4104>Jonathan was staring at him so fixedly that I was even afraid the individual would notice.</t4104> <t4105>And I feared he would take it badly, as he looked so fierce and detestable.</t4105> <t4106>I asked Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he replied, evidently thinking that I knew as much as he did when he answered:</t4106>
<t4107>–Don't you see who is there?</t4107>
<t4108>–No, dear -I said-; I don't know him, who is he?</t4108>
<t4109>Her response impressed me and filled me with anxiety, as she gave it as if she didn't know it was me, her Mina, she was speaking to:</t4109>
<t4110>–It's the man himself.</t4110>
<t4111>My poor beloved was evidently terrified by something; very terrified.</t4111>
<t4112>I truly believe that if he hadn't had me to lean on and to hold him, he would have collapsed.</t4112> <t4113>He stood staring in amazement; a man came out of the shop with a small package and gave it to the lady, who then resumed her walk.</t4113> <t4114>The mysterious man kept his eyes fixed on the beautiful lady, and when the carriage moved away down Piccadilly, he followed in the same direction and hired a cabriolet.</t4114>
<t4115>Jonathan followed him with his gaze, and said, as if to himself:</t4115>
<t4116>–I think it's the count, but he has rejuvenated a lot.</t4116> <t4117>My God! Oh, my God!</t4117> <t4118>My God!</t4118> <t4119>If I only knew, if I only knew!</t4119>
<t4120>I was so nervous that I feared hurting him by asking questions, so I kept silent.</t4120> <t4121>Very gently, I began to lead him away from the place, and he, holding onto my arm, followed me easily.</t4121> <t4122>We walked a bit more and then sat for a while in Green Park.</t4122> <t4123>It was a hot day for autumn, and there was a fairly comfortable seat in a shaded spot.</t4123> <t4124>After staring into space for a few minutes, Jonathan closed his eyes and quickly fell asleep, with his head resting on my shoulder.</t4124>
<t4125>I thought it was best for him, and I didn't wake him.</t4125> <t4126>After about twenty minutes, he woke up and said to me quite cheerfully:</t4126>
<t4127>–But, Mina, I fell asleep!</t4127> <t4128>Oh, forgive me for being so inattentive!</t4128> <t4129>Come; we'll have a cup of tea somewhere.</t4129>
<t4130>Evidently, he had forgotten everything related to the strange stranger, just as during his illness he had forgotten everything that this episode had reminded him of again.</t4130> <t4131>I don't like these attacks of amnesia; it can cause or prolong some brain ailment.</t4131> <t4132>But I must not ask him about it, for fear of causing him more harm than good; however, I must somehow learn the facts of his trip abroad.</t4132> <t4133>I fear the time has come when I must open that package and know what it contains.</t4133> <t4134>Oh, Jonathan, you will forgive me, I know, if I do wrong, but it is for your own sacred good!</t4134>
<t4135>Later.</t4135> <t4136>It was a sad return home in all respects: the empty house of the dear deceased who had been so kind to us: Jonathan still pale and dazed under a slight relapse of his illness, now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he may be: "I regret to inform you that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and that Lucy died the day before yesterday.</t4136> <t4137>Both were buried today.</t4137><t4138>"</t4138>
<t4139>Oh, what a heap of sorrows in so few words!</t4139> <t4140>Poor Mrs. Westenra! Poor Lucy!</t4140> <t4141>They are gone; they are gone never to return to us again!</t4141> <t4142>And poor, poor Arthur, who has lost such sweetness from his life!</t4142> <t4143>God help us to bear all our sorrows.</t4143>
<t4144>From the journal of Dr. Seward</t4144>
<t4145>September 22.</t4145> <t4146>Everything has culminated.</t4146> <t4147>Arthur has returned to Ring and has taken Quincey Morris with him.</t4147> <t4148>What a magnificent fellow this Quincey is!</t4148> <t4149>I believe deep in my heart that he suffered as much as any of us did over Lucy's death; but he managed to overcome his grief like a stoic.</t4149> <t4150>If America can continue producing men like this, there is no doubt that it will become a great power in the world.</t4150> <t4151>Van Helsing is lying down, taking a preparatory rest for his journey.</t4151> <t4152>He is going to leave for Amsterdam tonight, but he says he will return tomorrow night; he just wants to make some arrangements that can only be done in person.</t4152> <t4153>When he returns, if he can, he will stay at my house; he says he has work to do in London that may take some time.</t4153> <t4154>Poor old friend!</t4154> <t4155>I fear that the effort of the past few weeks has broken even his iron strength.</t4155>
<t4156>During the entire time of the funeral, I could see that he was making a terrible effort to restrain himself.</t4156> <t4157>When everything was over, we were standing next to Arthur, who, poor thing, was talking about his part in the operation when his blood was transferred to Lucy's veins; I could see that van Helsing's face was turning alternately white and purple.</t4157> <t4158>Arthur was saying that since then he felt as if the two had really been married and that she was his wife in the eyes of God.</t4158> <t4159>None of us said a word about the other operations, and none of us ever will.</t4159> <t4160>Arthur and Quincey went together to the station, and van Helsing and I came back here.</t4160> <t4161>The moment we were alone in the carriage, he gave free rein to a regular fit of hysteria.</t4161> <t4162>Since then he has refused to admit that it was hysteria, and insists that it was only his sense of humor manifesting under very terrible conditions.</t4162> <t4163>He laughed until he cried and I had to lower the blinds so that no one could see us and misinterpret the situation; and then he cried until he laughed again; and he laughed and cried at the same time, just like a woman does.</t4163> <t4164>I tried to be stern with him, in the same way one is with a woman in similar circumstances; but it had no effect.</t4164> <t4165>Men and women are so different in their nervous strength or weakness!</t4165>
<t4166>Then, when his face became grave and serious again, I asked him the reason for his joy and why precisely at that moment.</t4166> <t4167>His reply was in some way characteristic of him, as it was logical, full of strength and mystery.</t4167> <t4168>He said:</t4168>
<t4169>–Ah, you do not understand, friend John.</t4169> <t4170>Do not think that I am not sad, even though I laugh.</t4170> <t4171>Look, I have cried even when laughter choked me.</t4171> <t4172>But do not think that I am entirely sad when I cry, for laughter would have come in the same way.</t4172> <t4173>Always remember that the laughter that knocks on your door and says, "may I come in?" is not true laughter.</t4173> <t4174>No!</t4174> <t4175>Laughter is a queen, and it arrives when and how it wants.</t4175> <t4176>It does not ask anyone; it does not choose time or appropriateness.</t4176> <t4177>It says: "here I am."</t4177> <t4178>Remember, for example, I hurt in my heart for that young sweet girl; I give my blood for her, even though I am old and worn out; I gave my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my others suffer need so that she could have everything.</t4178> <t4179>And yet, I can laugh at her own grave, laugh when the gravedigger's shovel earth fell on her coffin and said thud!, thud!, over my heart, until it drained the blood from my cheeks.</t4179> <t4180>My heart bled for that poor boy, that dear boy, so much the age my own boy would have been if he had blessedly lived, and with hair and eyes so alike.</t4180> <t4181>Well, now you know why I love him so much.</t4181> <t4182>And yet, when he says things that move my man's heart so deeply, and make my father's heart nostalgic for him like no other man, not even you, friend John, because we are more balanced in experiences than a father and a son, for even then, in those moments, the queen laughter comes to me and shouts and roars in my ear: "here I am, here I am!", until laughter comes dancing again and brings with it some of the sunshine that she brings to my cheeks.</t4182> <t4183>Oh, friend John, it is a strange world, a world full of miseries, and threats, and troubles, and yet, when the queen laughter comes, it makes us all dance to the tune she plays.</t4183> <t4184>Bleeding hearts, and dry bones in cemeteries, and tears that burn as they fall... all dance together to the same music that she plays with that laughterless mouth she possesses.</t4184> <t4185>And believe me, friend John, she is good to come, and kind.</t4185> <t4186>Ah, we men and women are like strings in the midst of different forces pulling us in different directions.</t4186> <t4187>Then come the tears; and like rain on the strings, they tighten us, until perhaps the tension becomes too great and we break.</t4187> <t4188>But the queen laughter, she comes like the sunshine, and relieves the tension again; and we can endure and continue with our work, whatever it may be.</t4188>
<t4189>I didn't want to hurt him by pretending I didn't see his idea; but, since I didn't understand the reasons for his joy anyway, I asked him.</t4189> <t4190>When he responded, his face became very serious, and he told me in a rather different tone:</t4190>
<t4191>–Oh, it was the sad irony of it all, this charming lady adorned with flowers, who looked as fresh as if she were alive, so that one by one we doubted whether she was really dead; she lying in that fine marble house in the lonely cemetery, where so many of her kind rest, lying there with her mother who loved her so much, and whom she loved in return; and that sacred bell going: dong!, dong!, dong!, so sad and slow; and those holy men, in the white robes of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet, all the time their eyes were never on a page; and all of us with our heads bowed.</t4191> <t4192>And all for what?</t4192> <t4193>She is dead; so then, is she not?</t4193>
<t4194>–Well, for my part, professor -I said to him-, I don't see anything in all that which is funny.</t4194> <t4195>The truth is that your explanation makes it even harder to understand.</t4195> <t4196>But even if the funeral service was comical, what about poor Art and his problems?</t4196> <t4197>Because I think his heart was simply breaking.</t4197>
<t4198>–Exactly.</t4198> <t4199>Did he say that the transfusion of his blood into her veins had made her his true wife?</t4199>
<t4200>–Yes, and it was a sweet and consoling idea for him.</t4200>
<t4201>–That's right.</t4201> <t4202>But there was a difficulty, my friend John.</t4202> <t4203>If that was the case, what about the others? Ha, ha!</t4203> <t4204>Well, this poor and sweet maiden is a polyandrist, and I, with my poor wife dead to me but alive to the law of the church, though without jokes, free from everything, even I, who am a faithful husband to this current non-wife, am a bigamist.</t4204>
<t4205>–Well, I don't see what's funny here either -I said, and I didn't feel very happy with him because he was saying those things.</t4205> <t4206>He put his hand on my arm and said:</t4206>
<t4207>–Friend John, forgive me if I cause pain.</t4207> <t4208>I did not show my feelings to others when they would have hurt, but only to you, my old friend, in whom I can trust.</t4208> <t4209>If you could have looked inside my own heart then, when I wanted to laugh; if you could have done so when the laughter came, if you could do so, when the queen laughter has packed her crowns, and all that is hers, for she goes far away, very far from me, and for a long time, a very long time, perhaps you might pity me more than anyone.</t4209>
<t4210>I was moved by the tenderness of her tone and asked her why.</t4210>
<t4211>–Because I know!</t4211>
<t4212>And now we are all scattered; and for many long days, solitude will sit upon our roofs with its wings outspread.</t4212> <t4213>Lucy rests in her family's tomb, a stately mausoleum in a solitary cemetery, far from prolific London, where the air is fresh and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill, and where wildflowers grow according to their own accord.</t4213>
<t4214>So I can finish this diary; and only God knows if I will ever start another.</t4214> <t4215>If I do start one, or if I merely open this one again, it will deal with different people and different subjects; for here at the end, where the romance of my life is narrated, here I take up the thread of my daily work again, and I say it sadly and without hope.</t4215>

<t4219>A MYSTERY OF HAMPSTEAD</t4219>
<t4220>The neighborhood of Hampstead is currently being harassed by a series of events that seem to run parallel to those known by headline writers as "The Horror of Kensington," or "The Dagger Killer," or "The Woman in Black."</t4220> <t4221>Over the past two or three days, several cases have occurred of small children wandering away from their homes or forgetting to return from their play on the Heath.</t4221> <t4222>In all these cases, the children have been too young to provide an adequately intelligible explanation of what happened, but the consensus of their accounts is that they have been with the "bloofer lady."</t4222> <t4223>It has always been late at night when their absence has been noticed, and on two occasions the children were not found until early the next morning.</t4223> <t4224>In the neighborhood, it is generally assumed that, since the first lost child gave as his reason for being away that a "bloofer lady" had asked him to go with her for a walk, the others have picked up the phrase and used it on the appropriate occasion.</t4224> <t4225>This is all the more natural as the favorite game of the little ones is currently to lure each other through deceit.</t4225> <t4226>A correspondent writes to us that seeing the little ones pretending to be the "bloofer lady" is truly amusing.</t4226> <t4227>He says that some of our caricaturists should take a lesson in the irony of the grotesque by comparing reality and theater.</t4227> <t4228>It is only in accordance with the general principles of human nature that the "bloofer lady" should be the popular role in these open-air performances.</t4228> <t4229>Our correspondent naively says that not even Ellen Terry could be as delightfully attractive as some of these wrinkled-faced little ones pretend to be, and even imagine they are.</t4229>
<t4230>However, there may be a serious side to the matter, as some of the children, in fact all those who have been lost during the night, have been slightly torn or injured in the throat.</t4230> <t4231>The wounds seem such that they could have been made by a rat or a small dog, and although individually they lack much importance, they tend to show that whatever animal causes them has its own system or method.</t4231> <t4232>The local police have been instructed to keep a sharp watch on stray children, especially if they are very young, in the vicinity and within Hampstead Heath, and also for any stray dog that may be around.</t4232>

<t4236>THE HORROR OF HAMPSTEAD ANOTHER CHILD INJURED</t4236>
<t4237>The "Boastful Lady"</t4237>
<t4238>We have just received news that another child lost last night could only be found late this morning under a broom shrub on the Shooter's Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is perhaps less frequented than other parts.</t4238> <t4239>He had the same tiny wounds on his throat that have been noted in other cases.</t4239> <t4240>He was terribly weak and seemed quite exhausted.</t4240> <t4241>He too, when he had partially recovered, had the same story of being lured away by the "boisterous lady".</t4241>
<t4242>XIV.– FROM THE DIARY OF MINA HARKER</t4242>
<t4243>September 23rd.</t4243> <t4244>Jonathan has improved after a bad night.</t4244> <t4245>I am glad that he has enough work to do, as it keeps his mind away from terrible things; and, oh, I am happy that he is no longer overwhelmed by the responsibility of his new position!</t4245> <t4246>I knew he would be true to himself, and now I am proud to see my Jonathan rising to the heights of his advanced position and keeping pace in every way with the duties that fall upon him.</t4246> <t4247>He will be out of the house all day until late, as he said he would not return for lunch.</t4247> <t4248>I have finished my household chores, so I will take his foreign journal and lock myself in my room to read it…</t4248>
<t4249>September 24th.</t4249> <t4250>I didn't have the heart to write last night; that terrible account of Jonathan's startled me.</t4250> <t4251>My poor dear! How he must have suffered, whether it is true or just his imagination.</t4251> <t4252>I wonder if there is any truth in all of this.</t4252> <t4253>Did he first have brain fever and then write all those terrible things, or was there another cause for all of it?</t4253> <t4254>I suppose I will never know, for I do not dare to open a conversation on the subject with him... And yet, that man he saw yesterday!</t4254> <t4255>He seemed quite sure of him...</t4255>
<t4256>Poor Jonathan!</t4256> <t4257>I suppose it was the funeral that unsettled him and sent his mind back in a chain of thoughts...</t4257> <t4258>He himself believes it all.</t4258> <t4259>I remember how on our wedding day he said: "Unless some solemn duty falls upon me to make me return to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane."</t4259> <t4260>There seems to be a thread of continuity through this...</t4260> <t4261>That terrible count was going to come to London...</t4261> <t4262>If that were so and he came to London, with his prolific millions...</t4262> <t4263>There may be a solemn duty; and if that duty comes, we must not shrink from it...</t4263> <t4264>I will be prepared.</t4264> <t4265>I will take my typewriter right now and begin the transcription.</t4265> <t4266>Then we will be ready for other eyes if necessary.</t4266> <t4267>And if it is so desired, then perhaps, if I am ready, poor Jonathan need not be startled, for I can speak for him and never let him be bothered or worried about the matter at all.</t4267> <t4268>If ever Jonathan overcomes his nervousness, he may want to tell me everything, and I can ask him questions and find things out, and see how I can comfort him.</t4268>
<t4269>Letter from Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker</t4269>
<t4270>September 24 (Confidential)</t4270>
<t4271>"Dear Madam:"</t4271>
<t4272>"I beg you to forgive me for writing to you, as I am such a distant friend, and for sending you the bad news of Miss Lucy Westenra's death.</t4272> <t4273>By the kindness of Lord Godalming, I have the power to read your letters and papers, as I am deeply interested in certain vitally important matters.</t4273> <t4274>In them, I find some letters from you, which show how great a friend you were to her and how much you loved her.</t4274> <t4275>Oh, Mrs. Mina, for that love, I implore you to help me!</t4275> <t4276>For the sake of others, I ask you, to avoid much harm, and to avoid many and very terrible disturbances that may be much greater than you imagine, would you grant me an interview?</t4276> <t4277>You can trust me.</t4277> <t4278>I am a friend of Dr. John Seward and Lord Godalming (that was Miss Lucy's Arthur).</t4278> <t4279>For the moment, I must maintain strict confidentiality.</t4279> <t4280>I would come to Exeter to see you immediately if you tell me that I can have the honor of seeing you, and where and how.</t4280> <t4281>Madam, I beg your pardon.</t4281> <t4282>I have read your letters to poor Lucy, and I know how good you are and how your husband suffers; therefore, I beg you, if possible, do not tell him anything, as it might cause him harm.</t4282> <t4283>Again, I ask your forgiveness and remain respectfully yours,</t4283>

<t4285>Telegram from Mrs. Harker to</t4285>
<t4286>Doctor Van Helsing</t4286>
<t4287>September 25.</t4287> <t4288>Come today by the fourth train past ten if you can catch it.</t4288>
<t4289>I can receive you at any time you arrive.</t4289>
<t4290>WILHELMINA HARKER</t4290>
<t4291>From the journal of Mina Harker</t4291>
<t4292>September 25.</t4292> <t4293>I can't help feeling terribly anxious as the time for Dr. Van Helsing's visit approaches, for I hope he will enlighten me about Jonathan's sad experience; and since he attended poor Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me many things about her.</t4293> <t4294>That is the reason he is coming; it is because of Lucy and her sleepwalking, and not about Jonathan.</t4294> <t4295>Then I will never know the true reality!</t4295> <t4296>How foolish I am!</t4296> <t4297>That horrible diary takes over my imagination and colors everything with something of its own hue.</t4297> <t4298>Of course it is something about Lucy.</t4298> <t4299>The illness returned to the poor girl, and the terrible night on the cliff must have made her sick.</t4299> <t4300>Due to all the matters I have at hand, I had almost forgotten how ill she had been afterward.</t4300> <t4301>She must have told him about her sleepwalking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about it; and now he wants me to tell him what I know, so that he can understand it.</t4301>
<t4302>I hope I have done the right thing by not telling Mrs. Westenra anything; I could never forgive myself if any of my actions, even if by accident, had caused harm to my poor Lucy.</t4302> <t4303>I also hope that Dr. Van Helsing does not blame me; I have had so many troubles and so much anxiety lately that I feel I cannot bear any more at the moment.</t4303>
<t4304>I suppose that crying every now and then does us all some good...</t4304> <t4305>Tears cleanse the environment, just like rain.</t4305> <t4306>Perhaps it was reading yesterday's journal that unsettled me, and then Jonathan left this morning not to return for an entire day and night, this being the first time we've been apart since our marriage.</t4306> <t4307>I truly hope my beloved husband can take care of himself, and that nothing happens to distress him.</t4307> <t4308>It's two in the afternoon, and the doctor should be arriving soon.</t4308> <t4309>I won't say anything about Jonathan's journal, unless he asks me about it.</t4309> <t4310>I'm now glad I typed my journal, so that, in case he asks me anything about Lucy, I can give it to him; that will save a lot of questions.</t4310>
<t4311>Later.</t4311> <t4312>He came, and now he's gone.</t4312> <t4313>Oh, what a strange encounter, and how it makes everything spin in my head!</t4313> <t4314>I feel as if I were in a dream.</t4314> <t4315>Can it all be possible, or even part of it?</t4315> <t4316>If I hadn't read Jonathan's diary first, I would never have accepted even a possibility... Poor, poor dear Jonathan!</t4316> <t4317>How he must have suffered!</t4317> <t4318>May God grant that all this does not unsettle him again.</t4318> <t4319>I will try to save him from it, but it may even be a comfort or help to him, though it is very terrible and horrifying in its consequences, to know for certain that his eyes, his ears, and his brain did not deceive him, and that it is all real.</t4319>
<t4320>It may be that it is doubt that unsettles him; that when the doubt ends, regardless of the truth, whether awake or dreaming, he will be more satisfied and more capable of bearing the impression.</t4320> <t4321>Dr. Van Helsing must be a good and intelligent man, if he is a friend of Arthur and Dr. Seward, and if they brought him from Holland just to take care of Lucy.</t4321> <t4322>I have the impression, after having seen him, that he is good, kind, and noble.</t4322> <t4323>When he returns tomorrow, I will ask him about Jonathan; and then, I hope that all this sadness and anxiety will lead us to a happy conclusion.</t4323> <t4324>I used to think that I liked interviews; Jonathan's friend at the Exeter News told him that memory was everything in a job like that; that one must be able to write down almost every word that is said, even if it has to be refined later.</t4324> <t4325>This was a strange interview; I will try to record it verbatim.</t4325>
<t4326>It was half past two in the afternoon when they knocked on the door.</t4326> <t4327>I summoned up my courage and waited.</t4327> <t4328>Shortly after, Mary opened the door and announced: "Doctor van Helsing."</t4328>
<t4329>I stood up and made a bow, and he approached me; he is a man of medium weight, sturdy, with shoulders thrown back, a broad and deep chest, and a neck well-set on the trunk just like the head on the neck.</t4329> <t4330>His head immediately impressed me as indicative of strength of thought and intelligence; the head is noble, of regular size, broad, and wide behind the ears.</t4330>
<t4331>The face, clean-shaven, shows a hard and square chin, a long, resolute, and restless mouth, a nose of regular size, rather straight, but with very sensitive nostrils that seem to flare as the thick eyebrows fall and the mouth tightens.</t4331> <t4332>The forehead is broad and fine, rising almost straight at first and then sloping back over two very separated protuberances; it is a forehead on which the reddish hair cannot fall, but naturally falls back or to the sides.</t4332> <t4333>The dark blue eyes are very far apart, and are quick and tender or serious, depending on the man's mood.</t4333> <t4334>He told me:</t4334>
<t4335>–Mrs. Harker?</t4335>
<t4336>I tilted my head, nodding.</t4336>
<t4337>–Were you Miss Mina Murray?</t4337>
<t4338>I nodded again.</t4338>
<t4339>–I have come to see Mina Murray; the one who was a friend of the unfortunate, dear Lucy Westenra.</t4339> <t4340>Mrs. Mina, I come in the name of the deceased.</t4340>
<t4341>"Gentleman," I said, "you cannot have a better letter of introduction than having been a friend and doctor to Lucy Westenra."</t4341>
<t4342>And I extended my hand to him.</t4342> <t4343>He took it and said tenderly:</t4343>
<t4344>–Oh, Mrs. Mina! I know that the friend of that poor little girl must be good, but I still had to know...</t4344>
<t4345>He ended his speech with a courteous bow.</t4345> <t4346>I asked him why he wanted to see me, to which he immediately began:</t4346>
<t4347>–I have read your letters to Miss Lucy.</t4347> <t4348>Forgive me, but I had to start the investigations somewhere, and there was no one to ask.</t4348> <t4349>I know that you were with her in Whitby.</t4349> <t4350>She sometimes kept a diary, you need not look surprised, Mrs. Mina; she started it after you had left and it was an imitation of yours, and in that diary she infers certain things related to sleepwalking, and notes that you saved her.</t4350> <t4351>With great perplexity then I come to you, and I ask, abusing your great kindness, that you tell me everything you can remember about it.</t4351>
<t4352>I think I can tell you, Dr. Van Helsing, everything that happened.</t4352>
<t4353>–Ah! So you have a good memory for events, for details!</t4353> <t4354>That is not always the case with all young women.</t4354>
<t4355>–No, doctor, but it happens that I wrote down everything that was happening.</t4355> <t4356>I can show it to you, if you want.</t4356>
<t4357>–Oh, Mrs. Mina, I thank you very much!</t4357> <t4358>You will honor me and help me a lot.</t4358>
<t4359>I couldn't resist the temptation to play a joke on him; I suppose that is the taste of the original apple that still remains in us, so I handed him the stenographic journal.</t4359> <t4360>He took it, bowing in gratitude, and said to me:</t4360>
<t4361>–Can I read it?</t4361>
<t4362>–If you want -I replied, as modestly as I could.</t4362>
<t4363>He opened it and for an instant his face was fixed on the paper.</t4363> <t4364>Then he stood up and made a bow.</t4364>
<t4365>–Oh, you are a very clever woman! – he told me-.</t4365> <t4366>I have known for a long time that Mr. Jonathan was a man of many merits; but look, his wife is not far behind.</t4366> <t4367>And wouldn't you do me the honor of helping me read this? Oh!</t4367> <t4368>I don't know shorthand.</t4368>
<t4369>By that time, my joke had already passed, and I felt almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my sewing basket and handed it to him</t4369>
<t4370>–Forgive me -I said-, I couldn't help it; but I had been thinking that it was something about dear Lucy that you wanted to ask me, and so that you don't have to wait a long time, not from my part, but because I know that time must be precious to you, I have made a typewritten copy of this for you.</t4370>
<t4371>He took it, and his eyes shone.</t4371>
<t4372>–You are very kind -he said-.</t4372> <t4373>Can I read it now?</t4373> <t4374>Perhaps I would like to ask you some questions after having read it.</t4374>
<t4375>"Of course," I said, "read it all while I order the food; and then you can ask me whatever you want while we eat."</t4375>
<t4376>He made a bow and settled into a chair, with his back to the light, and immersed himself in the papers, while I went to check on the food, mainly to let him read at his leisure.</t4376> <t4377>When I returned, I found him walking quickly from one side of the room to the other, his face all lit up with excitement.</t4377> <t4378>He quickly approached me and took both of my hands.</t4378>
<t4379>–Oh, Mrs. Mina! – he said to me-, how can I tell you what I owe you?</t4379> <t4380>This paper is clear as the sun.</t4380> <t4381>It opens doors for me.</t4381> <t4382>I am stunned, dazzled by so much light, and yet, clouds always hover behind the light.</t4382> <t4383>But you do not understand that; you cannot understand it.</t4383> <t4384>Oh!</t4384> <t4385>But I am very grateful to you.</t4385> <t4386>You are a very clever woman.</t4386> <t4387>Madam, he added this time with a solemn tone-, if ever Abraham van Helsing can do something for you or yours, I hope you will let me know.</t4387> <t4388>It will be a true pleasure and a joy if I can serve you as a friend; as a friend, but with all that I have learned, all that I can do, for you and those you love.</t4388> <t4389>There are darknesses in life and there are lights; you are one of those lights.</t4389> <t4390>You will have a happy life and a good life, and your husband will be blessed in you.</t4390>
<t4391>–But, doctor, you praise me too much, and you don't know me.</t4391>
<t4392>–I don't know her…!</t4392> <t4393>I, who am already an old man, and all my life I have studied men and women; I, who have made the brain and everything related to it and everything that arises from it, my specialty.</t4393> <t4394>And I have read your diary, which you have so kindly written for me, and which breathes truthfulness in every line.</t4394> <t4395>I, who have read your sweet letter to poor Lucy telling her about your marriage and confiding your troubles to her.</t4395> <t4396>How could I not know her!</t4396> <t4397>Oh! Mrs. Mina, good women tell their whole lives, and day by day, hour by hour, and minute by minute, many things that angels can read; and we men who wish to know have something of angel eyes within us.</t4397> <t4398>Your husband is of very noble nature, and you are also noble, for you trust, and trust cannot exist where there are petty souls.</t4398> <t4399>And your husband, tell me, is he well? Has the fever ceased, and is he strong and happy?</t4399>
<t4400>Here I saw an opportunity to consult him about Jonathan, so I said:</t4400>
<t4401>–He had almost recovered, but he has become very restless due to Mr. Hawkins' death.</t4401>
<t4402>The doctor interrupted me:</t4402>
<t4403>–Oh, yes!</t4403> <t4404>I already know.</t4404> <t4405>I read your last two letters.</t4405>
<t4406>I continued:</t4406>
<t4407>–I suppose this made him nervous, because when we were in the city on Thursday, he had some kind of shock.</t4407>
<t4408>–A fright, and then the cerebral fever so close!</t4408> <t4409>That is not good.</t4409> <t4410>What kind of fright was it?</t4410>
<t4411>–He thought he saw someone who reminded him of terrible things; events that caused his brain fever.</t4411>
<t4412>And upon saying that, the whole story seemed to suddenly overwhelm me.</t4412> <t4413>The pity for Jonathan, the horror he had experienced, all the terrifying mystery of his diary, and the fear that had been haunting me since then, all came rushing to me in turmoil.</t4413> <t4414>I suppose I was hysterical, for I fell to my knees and raised both my hands towards him, begging him to heal my husband and make him well again.</t4414>
<t4415>He took me by the hands and lifted me up, and made me sit on the sofa, sitting himself next to me; he held my hands in his, and said to me with an indescribable tenderness:</t4415>
<t4416>–My life is barren and solitary, and so full of work that I have not had much time for friendship, but since I have been called here by my friend John Seward, I have come to know so many good people, and I have seen so much nobility that I feel more than ever, and this has been growing as my years advance, the loneliness of my life.</t4416> <t4417>Believe me, then, that I come here full of respect for you, and you have given me hope…</t4417> <t4418>Hope, not of what I am seeking, but that there are still good women left to make life happy…</t4418> <t4419>Good women, whose lives and truths can be good lessons for the men of tomorrow.</t4419> <t4420>I am very glad to be able to be of use to you, for if your husband suffers, he suffers within the domains of my studies and experiences.</t4420> <t4421>I promise you that I will gladly do everything I can for him; everything I can to make his life stronger, and also to make your life happy.</t4421> <t4422>Now you must eat.</t4422> <t4423>You are exhausted and perhaps emotional.</t4423> <t4424>Your husband will not like to see you pale; and what he does not like about the one he loves is not good for him.</t4424> <t4425>Therefore, for love of him, you must eat and smile.</t4425> <t4426>You have already told me everything about Lucy, so now we will not talk about it, as it may upset you.</t4426> <t4427>I will stay tonight in Exeter, for I want to think a lot about what you told me, and when I have thought, I will ask you questions, if you allow me.</t4427> <t4428>And then, you will also tell me your husband's problems as much as you can, but not yet.</t4428> <t4429>Now you must eat; afterwards we will talk long and hard.</t4429>
<t4430>After the meal, when we had already returned to the living room, he said to me:</t4430>
<t4431>–And now, tell me about him.</t4431>
<t4432>At the moment I was about to start talking to this great man, I began to feel afraid that he might think I was a silly girl and Jonathan a madman (given his diary was so extraordinarily strange), and for a moment I hesitated on how to proceed.</t4432> <t4433>But he was very sweet and kind, and he had promised to try to help me, so I had confidence in him, and I said to him:</t4433>
<t4434>–Doctor van Helsing, what I have to say to you is very strange, but you must not laugh at me or my husband.</t4434> <t4435>Since yesterday I have been in a kind of fever of uncertainty; you must be patient with me, and not think that I am foolish for having believed some very strange things.</t4435>
<t4436>He reassured me again with his manners and his words when he said:</t4436>
<t4437>–Oh, my dear friend! If you knew how strange the matter for which I am here is, then you would be the one laughing.</t4437> <t4438>I have learned not to think ill of anyone's beliefs, no matter how strange they may be.</t4438> <t4439>I have tried to keep an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things in life that can close it, but the strange things; the extraordinary things, the things that make one doubt whether they are madness or reality.</t4439>
<t4440>–Thank you, thank you, a thousand times thank you!</t4440> <t4441>You have taken a weight off my mind.</t4441> <t4442>If you allow me, I will give you a paper for you to read.</t4442> <t4443>It is long, but I have typed it out.</t4443> <t4444>In it, my problem and Jonathan's are described.</t4444> <t4445>It is a copy of the diary he kept while he was out of the country and of everything that happened.</t4445> <t4446>I do not dare to say anything about it.</t4446> <t4447>You must read it for yourself and judge.</t4447> <t4448>And after you have seen it, perhaps you would be so kind as to tell me what you think about it.</t4448>
<t4449>–I promise -he told me, as I handed him the papers-; in the same morning, as soon as I can, I will come to see you and your husband, if you allow me.</t4449>
<t4450>–Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch with us and see him then; you could take the 3:34 express train, which will get you to Paddington before eight.</t4450>
<t4451>He was surprised by my knowledge of the train schedule, but he doesn't know that I have memorized all the trains that depart and arrive at Exeter, so that I can help Jonathan in case he is in a hurry.</t4451>
<t4452>So he took the papers with him and left, and I am sitting here thinking...</t4452>
<t4453>Thinking about I don't know what.</t4453>
<t4454>Handwritten letter from Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker</t4454>
<t4455>September 25, 6 PM</t4455>
<t4456>"Dear Mrs. Mina:</t4456>
<t4457>"I have read your husband's wonderful diary.</t4457> <t4458>You can sleep without a doubt.</t4458> <t4459>Strange and terrible as it is, it is true!</t4459> <t4460>I could bet my life on it.</t4460> <t4461>It may be worse for others; but for you and him, there is no threat.</t4461> <t4462>He is a very noble type; and let me tell you, from the experience of men, that someone who did as he did, climbing down the wall and entering through that room (alas, and entering a second time), is not someone who can be permanently harmed by an impression.</t4462> <t4463>His brain and heart are very well; I swear this, even before having seen him; therefore, be at ease.</t4463>
<t4464>I will have many questions to ask you about other things.</t4464> <t4465>I am very happy to be able to come to see you today, because suddenly I have learned so many things that once again I am dazzled...</t4465> <t4466>Dazzled more than ever, and I must think.</t4466>
<t4467>"Your faithful servant,</t4467>
<t4468>ABRAHAM VAN HELSING</t4468>
<t4469>Letter from Mrs. Harker to the doctor</t4469>
<t4470>van Helsing</t4470>
<t4471>September 25, 6:30 p.m.</t4471>
<t4472>"My dear Dr. Van Helsing:</t4472>
<t4473>"A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken a great weight off my mind.</t4473> <t4474>And yet, to tell the truth, what terrible things there are in the world, and what more horrifying things if that man, that monster, is really in London.</t4474> <t4475>I fear to think of it.</t4475> <t4476>At this moment, while I was writing, I received a call from Jonathan, telling me that he is leaving Launceston on the 6:25 train tonight, and that he will be here at 10:18 so that I won't be afraid at night.</t4476> <t4477>So, could you instead of coming to dine with us tomorrow, come for breakfast at eight in the morning if it is not too early for you?</t4477> <t4478>If you are in a hurry, you can leave on the 10:30 train, which will get you to Paddington at 2:35.</t4478> <t4479>Do not reply to this, for if I do not hear from you, I will know that you will come to have breakfast with us.</t4479>
<t4480>"Yours sincerely, your faithful and grateful friend,"</t4480>
<t4481>MINA HARKER</t4481>
<t4482>From the journal of Jonathan Harker</t4482>
<t4483>September 26.</t4483> <t4484>I thought I would never write in this diary again, but the time has come.</t4484> <t4485>When I arrived home last night, Mina had already prepared dinner, and when we finished dining, she told me about van Helsing's visit and that she had given him typewritten copies of both diaries, and that she had been very worried about me.</t4485> <t4486>She showed me that in the doctor's letter it was assured that everything I had written was true.</t4486> <t4487>I think that has made a new man of me.</t4487> <t4488>What truly tormented me was the doubt about the reality of the whole matter.</t4488>
<t4489>I felt powerless, in the dark, and distrustful.</t4489> <t4490>But now, now that I know, I am not afraid even of the count.</t4490> <t4491>He has managed, despite everything, to carry out his plans to reach London, and surely it was him whom I saw.</t4491> <t4492>He has rejuvenated, but how?</t4492> <t4493>Van Helsing is the man who can unmask and pursue him if he is as Mina has described him to me.</t4493> <t4494>We stayed awake until very late and talked about all this.</t4494> <t4495>Mina is getting dressed and I will go to the hotel in a few minutes to look for the doctor.</t4495>
<t4496>I think he was astonished to see me.</t4496> <t4497>When I entered the room where he was and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, turned my head towards the light, and said, after a careful scrutiny:</t4497>
<t4498>–But Mrs. Mina told me that you were ill and under a strong impression.</t4498>
<t4499>It was very amusing to hear this elderly man with a strong and kind face call my wife "Mrs. Mina".</t4499> <t4500>I smiled and said to him:</t4500>
<t4501>-I was sick, and I had a strong impression: but you already cured me.</t4501>
<t4502>–And how?</t4502>
<t4503>–By your letter to Mina, last night.</t4503> <t4504>I felt uncertainty, and then everything took on an aura of supernaturalness, and I didn't know what to trust; not even the evidence of my senses.</t4504> <t4505>Not knowing what to trust, I also didn't know what to do; and then I could only keep working on what had been the routine of my life up to that point.</t4505> <t4506>The routine ceased to be useful to me, and I doubted myself.</t4506> <t4507>Doctor, you don't know what it's like to doubt everything; even oneself.</t4507> <t4508>No, you don't know, you couldn't know with those eyebrows you have.</t4508>
<t4509>He seemed pleased, and laughed as he said:</t4509>
<t4510>–So, you are a physiognomist!</t4510> <t4511>Every hour that passes, I learn something more here.</t4511>
<t4512>I will have breakfast with you with great pleasure, and, oh, sir, you will allow praise from an old man like me, but you have a wife who is a blessing.</t4512>
<t4513>I would listen to his praises for Mina for an entire day, so I simply nodded and kept silent.</t4513>
<t4514>–She is one of God's women, crafted by His own hands to show us men and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its light can be here on earth.</t4514> <t4515>So truthful, so sweet, so noble, so selfless, and that, allow me to tell you, is a lot in this very skeptical and selfish age.</t4515> <t4516>And you, sir, I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy, and some of them speak of you, in such a way that through the knowledge of others I have known you for some days; but I have known your true personality since last night.</t4516> <t4517>You will give me your hand, won't you?</t4517> <t4518>And let us be friends for life.</t4518>
<t4519>We shook hands, and he behaved so serious and so kind that for a moment I felt overwhelmed.</t4519>
<t4520>–And now -he said-, could I ask you for a little more help?</t4520> <t4521>I have to carry out a great task, and at the beginning I must know something more.</t4521> <t4522>In that you can help me.</t4522> <t4523>Can you tell me what happened before you went to Transylvania?</t4523> <t4524>Later, I might ask you for more help, of a different kind; but for now, this will suffice.</t4524>
<t4525>–Look, just a moment, sir -I said to him-, is what you have to do related to the count?</t4525>
<t4526>–He is -he told me solemnly.</t4526>
<t4527>–Then I am with you in body and soul.</t4527> <t4528>Since you are leaving on the 10:30 train, you won't have time to read them, but I will bring you the bundle of papers.</t4528> <t4529>You can take them and read them on the train during the journey.</t4529>
<t4530>After breakfast, I accompanied him to the station.</t4530> <t4531>When we were saying goodbye, he said:</t4531>
<t4532>–Perhaps you will come to the city when I call you, and also bring Mrs. Mina.</t4532>
<t4533>–We will both arrive when you ask us to.</t4533>
<t4534>I had bought him the morning newspapers and the London newspapers from the previous night, while we talked through the car window, waiting for the train to depart; he began to leaf through them.</t4534> <t4535>His eyes suddenly seemed to catch something in one of them: The Westminster Gazette; I recognized it by the color, and he turned quite pale.</t4535> <t4536>He read something intensely, murmuring to himself: "Mein Gott! Mein Gott!</t4536> <t4537>So soon!</t4537> <t4538>So soon!"</t4538> <t4539>I don't think he remembered me at that moment.</t4539> <t4540>At that very moment, the whistle blew and the train started.</t4540> <t4541>This seemed to bring him back to his senses, and he leaned out the window, waving his hand and shouting: "Regards to Mrs. Mina; I will write as soon as possible.</t4541><t4542>"</t4542>

<t4544>September 26.</t4544> <t4545>Truly, there is nothing that is definitive.</t4545> <t4546>Not a week has passed since I said "Finis," and here I am starting again, or rather, continuing my old record.</t4546> <t4547>Until this afternoon, I had no reason to think about what I am doing.</t4547> <t4548>Renfield had become, against all odds, as sane as ever.</t4548> <t4549>He was already well advanced in his fly business, and had started on the line of spiders; so he had not caused me any trouble.</t4549> <t4550>I received a letter from Arthur written on Sunday, and from its content, it seems to me that he is bearing it very well.</t4550> <t4551>Quincey Morris is with him, and that helps him a lot, as he himself is a bubbling source of good humor.</t4551> <t4552>Quincey also wrote me a line, and through him, I know that Arthur is regaining some of his old animation; as for them, then, my mind is at ease.</t4552> <t4553>As for myself, I was settling into work with the enthusiasm I used to have for it, so I could well have said that the wound caused by poor Lucy's disappearance had begun to heal.</t4553> <t4554>However, everything has opened up again; and how it will end, only God knows.</t4554> <t4555>I have the vague impression that Van Helsing also thinks he knows something, but he only hints enough to stimulate curiosity.</t4555> <t4556>Yesterday he went to Exeter, and stayed there overnight.</t4556> <t4557>He returned today, and almost jumped into my room around half-past five, putting last night's Westminster Gazette in my hands.</t4557>
<t4558>–What do you think about that? – he asked me, as he stepped back and crossed his arms.</t4558>
<t4559>I looked at the newspaper, as I really didn't know what he wanted to tell me; but he took it from me and pointed to some paragraphs about some children who had been lured with deceit in Hampstead.</t4559> <t4560>The news didn't make much sense to me until I reached a passage where it described small puncture wounds on their throats.</t4560> <t4561>An idea crossed my mind, and I looked up.</t4561>
<t4562>–Well? – he said.</t4562>
<t4563>–They are like those of poor Lucy.</t4563>
<t4564>–And what do you conclude from that?</t4564>
<t4565>–Simply that there is some common cause.</t4565> <t4566>That which hurt her has hurt them.</t4566>
<t4567>I didn't fully understand his response.</t4567>
<t4568>–That is true indirectly, but not directly.</t4568>
<t4569>–What do you mean by that, professor? – I asked him.</t4569> <t4570>I was somewhat inclined to take his seriousness as a joke, because, after all, four days of rest and freedom from the horrifying and exhausting anxiety help one to regain good spirits.</t4570> <t4571>But when I saw his face, I became somber.</t4571> <t4572>Never; not even in the midst of our despair for poor Lucy, had he shown such a serious expression.</t4572>
<t4573>–How? – I said to him-.</t4573> <t4574>I cannot venture opinions.</t4574> <t4575>I don't know what to think, and I have no data on which to base a conjecture.</t4575>
<t4576>–Do you mean to tell me, my friend John, that you have no suspicion about the reason why poor Lucy died; you have none after all the clues given, not only by the facts but also by me?</t4576>
<t4577>–From nervous prostration, as a consequence of a great loss or depletion of blood.</t4577>
<t4578>–And how was the blood lost or spent?</t4578>
<t4579>I shook my head.</t4579> <t4580>The teacher approached me and sat by my side.</t4580>
<t4581>–You are a clever man, friend John; and you have a sharp mind, but you also have too many prejudices.</t4581> <t4582>You do not let your eyes see and your ears hear, and what is beyond your daily life does not interest you.</t4582> <t4583>Do you not think that there are things you cannot understand, and yet they exist?</t4583> <t4584>That some people can see things and others cannot?</t4584> <t4585>But there are old and new things that should not be seen by the eyes of men, because they believe or think they believe in things that other men have told them.</t4585> <t4586>Ah, it is the error of our science to want to explain everything!</t4586> <t4587>And if it cannot explain it, it says there is nothing to explain.</t4587> <t4588>But you see around us that new beliefs grow every day, which consider themselves new, and yet they are the old ones, pretending to be young like the fine ladies at the opera.</t4588> <t4589>I suppose you do not believe in bodily transfer.</t4589> <t4590>No? Nor in materialization.</t4590> <t4591>No? Nor in astral bodies.</t4591> <t4592>No?</t4592> <t4593>Nor in thought reading.</t4593> <t4594>No? Nor in hypnotism...</t4594>
<t4595>–Yes -I said-.</t4595> <t4596>Charcot has proven this last point quite well.</t4596>
<t4597>My teacher smiled as he continued:</t4597>
<t4598>–So you are satisfied with that.</t4598> <t4599>Yes?</t4599> <t4600>And of course, then you understand how he acts and can follow the mind of the great Charcot.</t4600> <t4601>What a pity he is no longer alive!</t4601> <t4602>He was within the very soul of the patient he treated.</t4602> <t4603>Isn't that so?</t4603> <t4604>Then, my friend John, I must deduce that you simply accept the facts, and are satisfied to leave completely blank from the premise to the conclusion.</t4604> <t4605>Isn't that so?</t4605> <t4606>Then tell me, for I am a student of the brain, how do you accept hypnotism and reject thought reading?</t4606> <t4607>Let me tell you, my friend, that there are currently things in physical sciences that would have been considered impious by the same man who discovered electricity, who not long ago could have been burned as a sorcerer.</t4607> <t4608>There are always mysteries in life.</t4608> <t4609>Why did Methuselah live nine hundred years, and "Old Parr" one hundred and sixty-nine, and yet poor Lucy, with the blood of four men running through her veins, could not live even a day?</t4609> <t4610>Well, if she had lived one more day, we could have saved her.</t4610> <t4611>Do you know all the mysteries of life and death?</t4611> <t4612>Do you know all comparative anatomy to be able to say why the qualities of brutes are found in some men, and not in others?</t4612> <t4613>Can you tell me why, if all spiders die small and quickly, why did that great spider live for centuries in the tower of an old Spanish church, and grew, until descending it could drink the oil from all the lamps in the church?</t4613> <t4614>Can you tell me why in the pampas, oh, and in many other places, there are bats that come during the night and open the veins of cattle and horses to suck them and dry their veins?</t4614> <t4615>How in some islands of the western seas there are bats that hang all day from the trees, and those who have seen them describe them as giant nuts or pods, and when sailors sleep on deck, because it is very hot, they fly over them and then in the morning their corpses are found, as white as Miss Lucy's?</t4615>
<t4616>–Holy God, professor! – I said, standing up-.</t4616> <t4617>Do you mean to tell me that Lucy was bitten by one of those bats, and that something like that is here in London, in the 19th century?</t4617>
<t4618>He moved his hand, asking me for silence, and continued:</t4618>
<t4619>–Can you tell me why a turtle lives much longer than many generations of men?</t4619> <t4620>Why does the elephant continue to live until it has seen dynasties, and why does the parrot never die unless it is bitten by a cat or a dog, or some other accident?</t4620> <t4621>Can you tell me why in all ages and places men believe that there are some men who live if they are allowed to, that is, that there are some men and women who do not die a natural death?</t4621> <t4622>We all know, because science has attested to the fact, that some little frogs have been enclosed in rock formations for thousands of years, in a small hole that has sustained them since the early years of the world.</t4622> <t4623>Can you tell me how the Hindu fakir can let himself die and be buried, and seal his tomb by planting corn over it, and that the corn matures and is harvested and shelled and sown and matures and is harvested again, and then men come and remove the unbroken seal and find the Hindu fakir there, not dead, but rising and walking among them as before?</t4623>
<t4624>And upon arriving here, I interrupted him.</t4624> <t4625>I was losing control; I was piling up in my mind his list of all the "possible" eccentricities and impossibilities to such an extent that my imagination seemed to have caught fire.</t4625> <t4626>I had the vague idea that he was giving me some kind of lesson, as he used to do some time ago in his studio in Amsterdam; but he used to tell me things in a way that I could keep the object in my mind all the time.</t4626> <t4627>But now I was without this help, and yet I wanted to follow him, so I said:</t4627>
<t4628>–Master, allow me to be your favorite disciple once again.</t4628> <t4629>Tell me the thesis, so that I can apply your knowledge as you advance.</t4629> <t4630>At the moment, I am going from one point to another like a madman, and not like a sane person who follows an idea.</t4630> <t4631>I feel like a novice stumbling through a swamp shrouded in fog, jumping from one bush to another in the blind effort to walk without knowing where I am going.</t4631>
<t4632>–That is a good image -he told me-.</t4632> <t4633>Well, I will tell you.</t4633> <t4634>My thesis is this: I want you to believe.</t4634>
<t4635>–What do you think it creates?</t4635>
<t4636>–That believes in things that cannot be.</t4636> <t4637>Allow me to illustrate.</t4637> <t4638>Once I heard an American define faith in this way: "It is that faculty that allows us to believe in what we know is not true."</t4638> <t4639>For once, I followed that man.</t4639> <t4640>He meant that we must keep an open mind and not let a small piece of truth interrupt the torrent of the great truth, just as a stone can derail a train.</t4640> <t4641>First, we obtain the small truth.</t4641> <t4642>Fine!</t4642> <t4643>We keep it and evaluate it; but at the same time, we must not allow it to believe itself to be the entire truth of the universe.</t4643>
<t4644>–So, you don't want any prior conviction to disturb the receptivity of my mind in relation to something very strange.</t4644> <t4645>Am I interpreting your lesson correctly?</t4645>
<t4646>–Ah! You are still my favorite student.</t4646> <t4647>It is worth teaching you.</t4647> <t4648>Now that you are eager to understand, you have taken the first step towards understanding.</t4648> <t4649>Do you think those small holes in the children's throats were made by the same thing that made the punctures in Miss Lucy?</t4649>
<t4650>–That's what I suppose.</t4650>
<t4651>He stood up and said solemnly:</t4651>
<t4652>–Then, you are mistaken.</t4652> <t4653>Oh, if only it were so!</t4653> <t4654>But it is not!</t4654> <t4655>It is much worse, much, much worse.</t4655>
<t4656>–In the name of God, Professor Van Helsing, what is it that you mean?</t4656>
<t4657>He let himself fall into a chair with a gesture of despair, and placed his elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke.</t4657>
<t4658>–They were made by Miss Lucy!.</t4658>
<t4659>XV.–</t4659> <t4660>DOCTOR SEWARD'S DIARY (continued)</t4660>
<t4661>For a moment, a strong anger overcame me; it was as if I had slapped Lucy in life.</t4661> <t4662>I slammed the table hard and stood up as I said to him:</t4662>
<t4663>–Doctor van Helsing, are you crazy?</t4663>
<t4664>He lifted his head and looked at me: the tenderness reflected in his face calmed me immediately.</t4664>
<t4665>–I wish it were so! – he said-.</t4665> <t4666>Madness would be easier to bear compared to truths like this.</t4666> <t4667>Oh, my friend! Why do you think I took such a long detour?</t4667> <t4668>Why did I take so much time to tell you something so simple?</t4668> <t4669>Is it because I hate you and have hated you all my life?</t4669> <t4670>Is it because I wanted to cause you harm?</t4670> <t4671>Was it because I wanted, now, after so much time, to take revenge for that time you saved my life, and from a terrible death? Ah! No!.</t4671>
<t4672>–Forgive me - I said to him.</t4672>
<t4673>My teacher continued:</t4673>
<t4674>–My friend, it was because I wanted to be careful in giving you the news, because I know that you loved that sweet girl.</t4674> <t4675>But even now I do not expect you to believe me.</t4675> <t4676>It is so difficult to suddenly accept any very abstract truth, since we can doubt that it is possible if we have always believed in its impossibility..., and it is even more difficult and hard to accept such a sad concrete truth, and about a person like Miss Lucy.</t4676> <t4677>Tonight I will go to prove it.</t4677> <t4678>Do you dare to come with me?</t4678>
<t4679>This made me stagger.</t4679> <t4680>A man does not like to have such truths proven to him; Byron said of jealousy: "And they prove the pure truth of what he most abhorred.</t4680><t4681>"</t4681>
<t4682>He saw my indecision, and spoke:</t4682>
<t4683>–The logic is simple, although this time it is not the logic of a madman, jumping from one little hill to another in a foggy swamp.</t4683> <t4684>If it is not true, the proof will be a relief; in the worst case, it will do no harm.</t4684> <t4685>If it is true…! Ah, there lies the threat.</t4685> <t4686>However, each threat must help my cause, for in it there is a need to believe.</t4686> <t4687>Come; I will tell you what I propose: first, we go out right now and go see the child at the hospital.</t4687> <t4688>Dr. Vincent, from the North Hospital, where the newspaper says the child is, is a friend of mine, and I believe of yours too, since you studied with him in Amsterdam.</t4688> <t4689>He will allow two scientists to see his case, if he does not want two friends to do so.</t4689> <t4690>We will not tell him anything, except that we wish to learn.</t4690> <t4691>And then…</t4691>
<t4692>–And then?</t4692>
<t4693>He took a key out of his pocket and held it in front of me.</t4693>
<t4694>–Then, we spend the night, you and I, in the cemetery where Lucy lies.</t4694> <t4695>This is the key that locks her tomb.</t4695> <t4696>The man who made the coffin gave it to me, so that I could give it to Arthur.</t4696>
<t4697>My heart sank when I felt that a horrifying adventure seemed to be before us.</t4697> <t4698>However, I could do nothing, so I steeled myself and said it would be better to hurry, as the afternoon was passing...</t4698>
<t4699>We found the child awake.</t4699> <t4700>He had slept and eaten something, and overall he was improving noticeably.</t4700> <t4701>Dr. Vincent removed the bandage from his throat and showed us the stitches.</t4701> <t4702>There was no doubt about their resemblance to those that had been on Lucy's throat.</t4702> <t4703>They were smaller, and the edges seemed fresher; that was all.</t4703> <t4704>We asked Vincent what he attributed them to, and he replied that they must be bites from some animal; perhaps a rat; but he leaned towards thinking it was one of those bats that were so numerous in the heights of North London.</t4704>
<t4705>–Among so many harmless ones -he said-, there could be some wild species from the south of some more malevolent types.</t4705> <t4706>Some sailor might have brought it home, and it could have escaped; or even some chick might have gotten out of the zoological gardens, or one of those there might have been created by a vampire.</t4706> <t4707>These things happen; you know, just ten days ago a wolf escaped, and I think they followed it in this direction.</t4707> <t4708>For a week after that, the children did nothing but play "Little Red Riding Hood" on the Heath and in every alleyway of the place until the fright of this "boastful lady" appeared.</t4708> <t4709>Since then, they have had a lot of fun.</t4709> <t4710>Even this poor little one, when he woke up today, asked one of the nurses if he could leave.</t4710> <t4711>When she asked him why he wanted to leave, he said he wanted to go play with the "boastful lady".</t4711>
<t4712>"I hope," said Van Helsing, "that when you send this child home, you will take precautions to ensure that his parents keep a strict watch over him."</t4712> <t4713>"Giving free rein to these fantasies is the most dangerous thing; and if the child were to stay out another night, it would probably be fatal for him."</t4713> <t4714>"But in any case, I suppose you won't let him out for a few days, will you?"</t4714>
<t4715>–Surely not; he will stay here for at least a week; longer if the wound has not yet healed.</t4715>
<t4716>Our visit to the hospital lasted longer than we had anticipated, and before we left, the sun had already set.</t4716> <t4717>When Van Helsing saw that it was dark, he said:</t4717>
<t4718>–There is no rush.</t4718> <t4719>It is later than I thought.</t4719> <t4720>Come on; let's find a place where we can eat, and then we will continue on our way.</t4720>
<t4721>We had dinner at the Jack Straw's Castle, along with a small group of cyclists and others who were cheerfully noisy.</t4721> <t4722>Around ten o'clock at night, we left the inn.</t4722>
<t4723>It was already quite dark by then, and the scattered lamps made the darkness even greater once one stepped out of their individual radius.</t4723> <t4724>The professor had evidently studied the path we were to follow, as he continued with full determination; in contrast, I was quite confused about the locality.</t4724> <t4725>As we advanced, we encountered fewer people, until we were finally surprised when we even found the mounted police patrol doing their normal suburban round.</t4725> <t4726>At last, we reached the cemetery wall, which we climbed.</t4726> <t4727>With some but not much difficulty (as it was dark, and the whole place seemed strange to us), we found the Westenra crypt.</t4727> <t4728>The professor took out the key, opened the creaking door, and stepping aside courteously, but without realizing it, gestured for me to go ahead.</t4728> <t4729>There was a delightful irony in this gesture; in the kindness of yielding the way on such a gloomy occasion.</t4729> <t4730>My companion followed me immediately and carefully closed the door, after ensuring that the lock was open and not shut.</t4730> <t4731>In the latter case, we would have been in quite a mess.</t4731> <t4732>Then, he fumbled in his bag, and taking out a box of matches and a piece of candle, proceeded to make light.</t4732> <t4733>The tomb, during the day and when adorned with fresh flowers, was already sufficiently gloomy; but now, some days later, when the flowers hung withered and dead, with their wilted petals and their brown calyxes and stems; when the spider and the worm had resumed their usual work; when the stone discolored by time, the dust-covered mortar, and the rusty and damp iron, and the tarnished metals, and the dirty silver filigree reflected the faint glimmer of a candle, the effect was more horrifying and sordid than can be imagined.</t4733>
<t4734>Irresistibly, I thought that life, animal life, was not the only thing that came and went.</t4734>
<t4735>Van Helsing began to work systematically.</t4735> <t4736>Holding his candle in such a way that he could read the inscriptions on the coffins, and holding it so that the whale sperm fell in white drops that froze upon touching the metal, he searched for and found Lucy's sarcophagus.</t4736> <t4737>Another search in his bag, and he took out a screwdriver.</t4737>
<t4738>–What are you going to do? – I asked him.</t4738>
<t4739>–I am going to open the coffin.</t4739> <t4740>Then you will be convinced.</t4740>
<t4741>Without wasting any time, he began to remove the screws and finally lifted the lid, revealing the lead cover beneath it.</t4741> <t4742>The sight of it all was almost too much for me.</t4742> <t4743>It seemed to me that it was as much an insult to the dead as if her clothes had been removed while she was alive and sleeping; in fact, I held his hand and tried to stop him.</t4743> <t4744>He only said, "You will see," and fumbling again in his bag, he took out a small fret saw.</t4744> <t4745>Driving a screw through the lead with a short downward stroke, which made me shudder, he made a small hole that was, however, large enough to admit the tip of the saw.</t4745> <t4746>I expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse.</t4746> <t4747>We doctors, who have to study our dangers, have to get used to such things, and I stepped back towards the door.</t4747> <t4748>But my master did not stop for a moment; he sawed about sixty centimeters along one side of the coffin, then across, and then down the other side.</t4748> <t4749>Then, taking the edge of the loose flap, he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and holding the candle in the opening, he indicated that I should take a look.</t4749>
<t4750>I approached and looked.</t4750> <t4751>The coffin was empty.</t4751>
<t4752>It certainly caused me great surprise, and it made a strong impression on me; but Van Helsing remained motionless.</t4752> <t4753>Now he was more sure than before about what he was doing, and more determined to continue his task.</t4753>
<t4754>–Are you satisfied now, my friend John? – he asked me.</t4754>
<t4755>I felt that all the hidden rebellion of my character was awakening within me, and I responded to him:</t4755>
<t4756>–I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in the coffin; but that only proves one thing...</t4756>
<t4757>–And what does it prove, my friend John?</t4757>
<t4758>–That it's not there.</t4758>
<t4759>–That is good logic -he said-, up to a certain point.</t4759> <t4760>But, how can you explain that it is not there?</t4760>
<t4761>–Maybe a body snatcher -I suggested-.</t4761> <t4762>One of the employees of the undertaker could have stolen it.</t4762>
<t4763>I felt that I was talking nonsense, and yet, that was the only real cause I could suggest.</t4763> <t4764>The professor sighed.</t4764>
<t4765>–Ah! We must have more evidence.</t4765> <t4766>Come with me, John.</t4766>
<t4767>He closed the coffin lid again, gathered all his things and put them in the briefcase, turned off the light, and placed the candle back in its previous spot.</t4767> <t4768>We opened the door and went out.</t4768> <t4769>He closed the door behind us and locked it.</t4769> <t4770>He handed me the key, saying:</t4770>
<t4771>–Do you want to keep it?</t4771> <t4772>It would be better if it were well kept.</t4772>
<t4773>I laughed, with a laughter that I am compelled to say was not very joyful, and I gestured for him to keep it.</t4773>
<t4774>–A key is nothing -I told him-, there can be duplicates; and anyway, it's not very difficult to open a lock of that kind.</t4774>
<t4775>My teacher said nothing, but put the key in his pocket.</t4775> <t4776>Then he told me to watch one side of the cemetery while he watched the other.</t4776> <t4777>I took my place behind a yew tree and saw his dark figure moving until the tombstones and trees hid him from my sight.</t4777>
<t4778>It was a very lonely watch.</t4778> <t4779>Shortly after being in my place, I heard a distant clock strike twelve, and in due course, it struck one and two.</t4779> <t4780>I was shivering from the cold, very nervous, and angry with the professor for assigning me such a task and with myself for having shown up.</t4780> <t4781>I was too cold and too drowsy to maintain sharp observation, but not drowsy enough to betray the master's trust; in short, I had a very unpleasant long time.</t4781>
<t4782>Suddenly, as I turned around, I thought I saw a white streak moving between two dark yew trees at the far end of the grave on the other side of the cemetery; at the same time, a dark mass moved from the professor's side and hurried towards it.</t4782> <t4783>Then I also walked: but I had to take a detour around some tombstones and fenced graves, and I stumbled over some graves.</t4783> <t4784>The sky was cloudy, and somewhere far away an early rooster crowed.</t4784> <t4785>A little further on, behind a line of juniper trees that marked the path to the church, a faint and white figure hurried towards the grave.</t4785> <t4786>The grave itself was hidden among the trees, and I couldn't see where the figure disappeared.</t4786> <t4787>I heard the crunch of footsteps on the leaves in the same place where I had previously seen the white figure, and upon arriving there I found the professor holding a tender child in his arms.</t4787>
<t4788>When he saw me, he placed it before me and said:</t4788>
<t4789>–Are you satisfied now?</t4789>
<t4790>–No, I said in a manner that I felt was aggressive.</t4790>
<t4791>–Don't you see the child?</t4791>
<t4792>–Yes; it is a child, but who brought him here?</t4792> <t4793>Is he injured?</t4793>
<t4794>"We'll see," said the professor, and driven by the same impulse, we sought the exit of the cemetery, carrying the sleeping child with us.</t4794>
<t4795>When we had moved a little distance away, we took shelter behind a cluster of trees, lit a match, and looked at the child's throat.</t4795> <t4796>It didn't have a scratch or any scar.</t4796>
<t4797>– Was I right? – I asked triumphantly.</t4797>
<t4798>–We arrived just in time -said the professor, as if pondering.</t4798>
<t4799>Now we had to decide what we were going to do with the child, so we consulted about him.</t4799> <t4800>If we took him to a police station, we would have to give a statement about our movements during the night; at the very least, we would have to declare in some way how we had found the child.</t4800> <t4801>So we finally decided that we would take him to the Heath, and that if we heard a policeman approaching, we would leave him in a place where he would have to find him.</t4801> <t4802>Then we could go home as soon as possible. At the edge of Hampstead Heath, we heard the heavy steps of a policeman and left the child at the side of the road, and then we waited and watched until we saw that he had illuminated him with his flashlight.</t4802> <t4803>We listened to his exclamations of astonishment and then quietly walked away.</t4803> <t4804>Luckily, we found a cab near "The Spaniards," and we took it to the city.</t4804>
<t4805>I cannot sleep, so I am making these notes.</t4805> <t4806>But I must try to sleep at least a few hours, as Van Helsing will come for me at noon.</t4806> <t4807>He insists that I accompany him on another expedition similar to today's.</t4807>
<t4808>September 27.</t4808> <t4809>It was two in the afternoon before we found an opportunity to make our attempt.</t4809> <t4810>A funeral held at noon had ended, and the last lingering mourners were lazily drifting away in groups, when, carefully looking from behind a clump of alder trees, we saw the gravedigger closing the gate behind him.</t4810> <t4811>We knew we would be safe until morning if we wished; but my master told me we would need no more than an hour, at most.</t4811> <t4812>Once again, I felt that horrible sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of the imagination seems out of place; and I distinctly realized the threats of the law that hung over us due to our impious work.</t4812> <t4813>Moreover, I felt that it was all useless.</t4813> <t4814>As criminal as it was to open a lead coffin to see if a woman dead for nearly a week was truly dead, it now seemed the height of folly to open that tomb again, when we knew, having seen it with our own eyes, that the coffin was empty.</t4814> <t4815>I shrugged my shoulders, however, I remained silent, for Van Helsing had a way of following his own path, regardless of who protested.</t4815> <t4816>He took out the key, opened the crypt, and once again made a courteous gesture for me to precede him.</t4816> <t4817>The place was not as dreadful as the night before, but, oh!, how an indescribable sadness was felt when the sunlight shone upon it.</t4817> <t4818>Van Helsing walked towards Lucy's coffin and I followed him.</t4818> <t4819>He leaned over it and once again twisted back the lead flap.</t4819> <t4820>A shiver of surprise and dread ran through my body.</t4820>
<t4821>There lay Lucy, apparently the same as we had seen her the night before her burial.</t4821> <t4822>She was, if possible, more beautiful and radiant than ever; I could not believe she was dead.</t4822> <t4823>Her lips were red, redder than before, and her cheeks glowed slightly.</t4823>
<t4824>–What kind of trickery is this? – I said to van Helsing.</t4824>
<t4825>–Are you convinced now? – said the professor in response, and as he spoke, he extended a hand in a way that made me tremble, lifted his dead lips, and showed his white teeth.</t4825> <t4826>Look -he continued-, they are even sharper than before.</t4826> <t4827>With this one and this one -and he touched one of the canines and the tooth below them, little ones can be bitten.</t4827> <t4828>Do you believe it now, friend John?</t4828>
<t4829>Once again, hostility awoke within me.</t4829> <t4830>I could not accept such an overwhelming idea as the one he was suggesting; so, with an intention to argue that I was ashamed of at that moment, I said to him:</t4830>
<t4831>–They could have placed it here last night.</t4831>
<t4832>–It's true.</t4832> <t4833>That's possible.</t4833> <t4834>Who?</t4834>
<t4835>–I don't know.</t4835> <t4836>Someone has done it.</t4836>
<t4837>–And yet, she has been dead for a week.</t4837> <t4838>Most people wouldn't look like that after so much time...</t4838>
<t4839>For this, I had no answer and remained silent.</t4839> <t4840>Van Helsing did not seem to notice my silence; at least, he showed neither displeasure nor triumph.</t4840> <t4841>He was attentively looking at the face of the deceased; he lifted the eyelids, looked into her eyes, and once again, parted her lips and examined her teeth.</t4841> <t4842>Then, he turned to me and said:</t4842>
<t4843>–Here is something different from everything known; there is some dual life that is not like the common ones.</t4843> <t4844>She was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance, sleepwalking.</t4844> <t4845>Oh! You are astonished.</t4845> <t4846>You don't know that, my friend John, but you will know it later; and in trance would be the best way to return to take more blood.</t4846> <t4847>She died in a trance, and also in a trance she is an "undead."</t4847> <t4848>That is why she is different from all the others.</t4848>
<t4849>Generally, when the "undead" sleep at home - and as he spoke, he made a broad gesture with his arms to designate what "home" meant for a vampire - their face shows what they are, but this one is so sweet that when she is "undead" she returns to the nothingness of common dead.</t4849> <t4850>See; there is nothing apparently evil here, and it is very unpleasant that I have to kill her while she sleeps.</t4850>
<t4851>This chilled my blood, and I began to realize that I was accepting van Helsing's theories; but if she was really dead, what was so terrifying about the idea of killing her?</t4851> <t4852>He lifted his gaze towards me, and evidently saw the change in my face, for he said almost cheerfully:</t4852>
<t4853>–Ah! Do you believe now?</t4853>
<t4854>I replied:</t4854>
<t4855>–Don't pressure me too much.</t4855> <t4856>I am willing to accept.</t4856> <t4857>How are you going to do this macabre job?</t4857>
<t4858>–I will cut off his head and fill his mouth with garlic, and I will pierce his heart with a stake.</t4858>
<t4859>It made me tremble to think about the mutilation of the body of the woman I had loved.</t4859> <t4860>However, the feeling was not as strong as I would have expected.</t4860> <t4861>In fact, I began to feel repulsion at the presence of that being, that "undead," as van Helsing had called it, and to detest it.</t4861> <t4862>Is it possible that love is entirely subjective, or entirely objective?</t4862>
<t4863>I waited a considerable amount of time for Van Helsing to begin, but he remained still, as if he were absorbed in deep thoughts.</t4863> <t4864>Finally, he snapped his briefcase shut and said:</t4864>
<t4865>–I have been thinking about it, and I have decided on what I consider to be the best course of action.</t4865> <t4866>If I were to act simply following my inclination, I would do now, at this moment, what must be done; but other things will follow, things that are a thousand times more difficult and that we do not yet know.</t4866> <t4867>This is simple.</t4867> <t4868>She has not yet killed anyone, although that is a matter of time; and acting now would remove the danger from her forever.</t4868> <t4869>But then we may need Arthur, and how will we tell him this?</t4869> <t4870>If you, who saw the wounds on Lucy's throat, and saw the similar wounds on the child, in the hospital; if you, who saw the empty coffin last night and have seen it today full, with a woman who not only has not changed but has become rosier and more beautiful a week after her death, if you know this and know of the white figure that brought the child to the cemetery last night, and yet do not believe your own senses, how then can I expect Arthur, who is unaware of all these things, to believe?</t4870> <t4871>He doubted me when I prevented him from kissing the dying woman.</t4871> <t4872>I know that he has forgiven me, but believing that due to mistaken ideas I did something that prevented him from saying goodbye as he should have; and he may think that due to another mistake this woman was buried alive; and in the greatest of all mistakes, that we have killed her.</t4872> <t4873>Then he will argue that we, the mistaken ones, are the ones who have killed her due to our ideas; and then he will remain very sad forever.</t4873> <t4874>However, he will never be sure of anything, and that is the worst of all.</t4874> <t4875>And sometimes he will think that the one he loved was buried alive, and that will paint his dreams with the horrors she must have suffered; and other times, he will think that perhaps we are right, and that after all, his beloved was an "undead."</t4875> <t4876>No!</t4876> <t4877>I told you once, and since then I have learned a lot.</t4877> <t4878>Now, since I know that everything is true, a hundred thousand times more I know that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet ones.</t4878> <t4879>The poor boy must have an hour that will make the very face of heaven seem black; then we can act decisively and thoroughly, and put him at peace with himself.</t4879> <t4880>I have decided.</t4880> <t4881>Let's go.</t4881> <t4882>You go back to your home, at night, to your asylum, and see that everything is well.</t4882> <t4883>As for me, I will spend this night here in the cemetery.</t4883> <t4884>Tomorrow night come to pick me up at the Berkeley Hotel at ten.</t4884> <t4885>I will notify Arthur to come as well, and also that fine young American who gave his blood.</t4885> <t4886>Later, we will all have much to do.</t4886> <t4887>I will go with you to Piccadilly and have dinner there, for I must be back here before sunrise.</t4887>
<t4888>Thus, we locked the tomb and left, and we climbed the cemetery wall, which was not a very difficult task, and drove back to Piccadilly.</t4888>
<t4889>Note left by Van Helsing in his coat, at the Berkeley Hotel, and</t4889>
<t4890>directed to</t4890>
<t4891>John Seward, M.D. (not delivered).</t4891>
<t4892>September 27</t4892>
<t4893>"Friend John:</t4893>
<t4894>"I write this in case something happens.</t4894> <t4895>I am going alone to watch over that church cemetery.</t4895> <t4896>I would like the undead, or "not dead," Miss Lucy, not to come out tonight, so that tomorrow night she will be more anxious.</t4896> <t4897>Therefore, I must prepare certain things that she will not like: garlic and a crucifix, to seal the entrance of the tomb.</t4897> <t4898>She has not been undead for long, and she will be careful.</t4898> <t4899>Moreover, these things are meant to prevent her from coming out, as they cannot overcome her if she wishes to enter; because, in that case, the undead is desperate and must find the path of least resistance, whatever it may be.</t4899> <t4900>I will stay alert throughout the night, from sunset until dawn, and if there is anything to observe, I will do so.</t4900> <t4901>I am not afraid of Miss Lucy nor do I fear for her; as for the cause of her being undead, we now have the power to search her tomb and protect ourselves.</t4901> <t4902>She is intelligent, as Mr. Jonathan has told me, and by the way she has deceived us all the time she fought with us to take control of Miss Lucy.</t4902> <t4903>The best proof of this is that we lost.</t4903> <t4904>In many ways, the undead are strong.</t4904> <t4905>They have the strength of twenty men, and even of us four, who gave our strength to Miss Lucy.</t4905> <t4906>Furthermore, she can call her wolf and I don't know what might happen.</t4906> <t4907>Therefore, if she goes there tonight, she will find me there; but no one else will see me, until it is already too late.</t4907> <t4908>However, that place may not be very attractive to her.</t4908> <t4909>There is no reason why she should show up, as her hunting ground contains more important prey than the church cemetery where the undead woman sleeps and an old man watches.</t4909>
<t4910>"Therefore, I write this just in case…</t4910> <t4911>Gather the papers that are next to this note: Harker's journals and all the rest, read them, and then find that great undead, cut off his head and burn his heart or pierce it with a stake, so that the world may be at peace without his presence.</t4911>
<t4912>"If what I fear happens, goodbye."</t4912>
<t4913>VAN HELSING</t4913>
<t4914>From the journal of Dr. Seward</t4914>
<t4915>September 28.</t4915> <t4916>It is wonderful what a good night of restorative sleep can do for one.</t4916> <t4917>Yesterday I was almost willing to accept van Helsing's monstrous ideas, but at this moment, I see clearly that they are true challenges to common sense.</t4917> <t4918>I have no doubt that he believes them all to the letter.</t4918> <t4919>I wonder if he has lost his mind.</t4919> <t4920>Surely there must be some logical explanation for all these strange and mysterious things.</t4920> <t4921>Is it possible that the professor has done it all himself?</t4921> <t4922>He is so abnormally intelligent that, if he loses his mind, he would carry out everything he set out to do, related to some fixed idea, in an extraordinary way.</t4922> <t4923>I refuse to believe it, since it would be as strange as the other to discover that van Helsing is crazy; but, in any case, I have to watch him carefully.</t4923> <t4924>It is possible that in this way I will discover something related to the mystery.</t4924>
<t4925>September 29, in the morning...</t4925> <t4926>Last night, shortly before ten, Arthur and Quincey entered Van Helsing's room; he told us everything he wanted us to do; but, especially, he addressed Arthur, as if all our wills were concentrated in his.</t4926> <t4927>He began by saying that he hoped all of us would accompany him.</t4927>
<t4928>–Since something very serious needs to be done there, are you coming?</t4928> <t4929>Were you surprised by my letter?</t4929>
<t4930>The questions were directed to Lord Godalming.</t4930>
<t4931>–Yes.</t4931> <t4932>I felt a little annoyed at first.</t4932> <t4933>There have been so many entanglements around my house lately that I didn't like the idea of one more.</t4933> <t4934>Also, I was curious to know what you meant.</t4934> <t4935>Quincey and I discussed it; but the more we delved into the matter, the more puzzled we felt.</t4935> <t4936>As far as I'm concerned, I think I've completely lost the ability to understand.</t4936>
<t4937>–I am in the same situation -said Quincey Morris, laconically.</t4937>
<t4938>–Oh! – said the professor-.</t4938> <t4939>In that case, you are closer to the beginning than our friend John, who has to retrace a lot of steps to even get near the beginning.</t4939>
<t4940>By all indications, he had understood that he had come to doubt all of it again, without me uttering a single word.</t4940> <t4941>Then, he turned to the other two and said to them, very gravely:</t4941>
<t4942>–I wish for you to grant me your authorization to do tonight what I deem appropriate.</t4942> <t4943>Although I know that is a lot to ask; and only when you know what I intend to do will you understand its importance.</t4943> <t4944>Therefore, I am compelled to ask you to promise me permission without knowing anything, so that later, even if you get angry with me and remain upset for some time, a possibility I have not overlooked, you cannot blame yourselves for anything.</t4944>
<t4945>–It seems to me that his conduct is very loyal -interrupted Quincey-.</t4945> <t4946>I vouch for the professor.</t4946> <t4947>I have not the slightest idea what his intentions might be; but I assure you he is an honorable gentleman, and that is enough for me.</t4947>
<t4948>–Thank you very much, sir -said Van Helsing with pride-.</t4948> <t4949>I have been honored to consider you a trusted friend, and your support is very gratifying to me.</t4949>
<t4950>He extended a hand, which Quincey accepted.</t4950>
<t4951>Then, Arthur spoke up:</t4951>
<t4952>–Doctor van Helsing, I do not like "buying a pig in a poke without seeing it first," as they say in Scotland, and if there is anything in which my honor as a gentleman or my faith as a Christian might be compromised, I cannot make that promise.</t4952> <t4953>If you can assure me that those high values are not in danger of being violated, I will give you my consent without hesitation; although I assure you that I do not understand what you intend.</t4953>
<t4954>"I accept your conditions," said Van Helsing, "and the only thing I ask is that if you find it necessary to condemn any of my actions, reflect carefully on it to ensure that your moral principles have not been violated."</t4954>
<t4955>–Alright! – said Arthur-.</t4955> <t4956>It seems very fair to me.</t4956> <t4957>And now that we have finished the negotiations, can I ask what we have to do?</t4957>
<t4958>–I wish for you to come with me in secret, to the cemetery of Kingstead church.</t4958>
<t4959>Arthur's face darkened as he said, in a tone that clearly denoted his bewilderment:</t4959>
<t4960>–Where is poor Lucy buried?</t4960>
<t4961>The professor nodded, and Arthur continued:</t4961>
<t4962>–And once there...?</t4962>
<t4963>–We will enter the tomb!</t4963>
<t4964>Arthur stood up.</t4964>
<t4965>–Professor, are you being serious, or is this some kind of monstrous joke?</t4965> <t4966>Excuse me, I see now that you mean it seriously.</t4966>
<t4967>He sat down again, but I saw that he remained in a rigid and haughty posture, like someone who wants to appear dignified.</t4967> <t4968>Silence reigned, until he asked again:</t4968>
<t4969>–And once in the grave?</t4969>
<t4970>–We will open the coffin.</t4970>
<t4971>–That's too much! – he exclaimed, standing up full of anger-.</t4971> <t4972>I am willing to be patient in everything that is reasonable; but, in this case… the desecration of a grave… from which…</t4972>
<t4973>She lost her voice, seized by indignation.</t4973> <t4974>The professor looked at him sadly.</t4974>
<t4975>–If I could spare you such pain, my friend -he said-, God knows I would; but tonight our feet will tread on thorns; otherwise, later and forever, the feet you love will tread on flames!</t4975>
<t4976>Arthur looked up, his face extremely pale and distraught, and said:</t4976>
<t4977>–Be careful, sir, be careful!</t4977>
<t4978>–Don't you think it would be better if you listened to what I have to say? – said Van Helsing.</t4978> <t4979>That way, you will at least know the limits of what I intend to do.</t4979> <t4980>Do you want me to continue?</t4980>
<t4981>–It seems fair to me, Morris intervened.</t4981>
<t4982>After a pause, Van Helsing continued speaking, making a great effort to be clear:</t4982>
<t4983>–Miss Lucy is dead; isn't that so? Yes!</t4983> <t4984>Therefore, it is not possible to harm her; but, if she is not dead...</t4984>
<t4985>Arthur jumped to his feet.</t4985>
<t4986>–Holy God! – he shouted.</t4986> <t4987>What do you mean?</t4987> <t4988>Has there been some mistake?</t4988> <t4989>Have we buried her alive?</t4989>
<t4990>He growled with such anger that not even hope could soften it.</t4990>
<t4991>–I didn't say she was alive, my friend; I don't believe that.</t4991> <t4992>I only say that it is possible that she is a "living dead," or "undead."</t4992>
<t4993>–Alive dead! Not dead!</t4993> <t4994>What do you mean?</t4994> <t4995>Is all this a nightmare, or what?</t4995>
<t4996>–There are mysteries that man can only guess at, and which he partially unravels with the passage of time.</t4996> <t4997>Believe me: we are currently facing one of them.</t4997> <t4998>But I have not finished.</t4998> <t4999>May I cut off Miss Lucy's head from her corpse?</t4999>
<t5000>–By all the devils, no! – shouted Arthur, with burning passion-.</t5000> <t5001>For nothing in the world will I consent to mutilate her corpse.</t5001> <t5002>Doctor van Helsing, you are abusing my patience.</t5002> <t5003>What have I done to you that you wish to torture me in this way?</t5003> <t5004>What did that poor and sweet girl do that you wish to cause her such great dishonor in her grave?</t5004> <t5005>Are you mad to say such a thing, or am I the one who is insane for listening to it?</t5005> <t5006>Do not even allow yourself to think of such desecration again.</t5006> <t5007>I will not give you my consent at all.</t5007> <t5008>I have the duty to protect her grave from that outrage.</t5008> <t5009>And I promise you that I will do it!</t5009>
<t5010>Van Helsing stood up from the seat where he had remained sitting all that time, and said, with gravity and firmness:</t5010>
<t5011>–Lord Godalming, I too have a duty; a duty to others, a duty to you, and a duty to the deceased.</t5011> <t5012>And I promise you that I will fulfill it!</t5012> <t5013>The only thing I ask of you now is to accompany me, to observe everything attentively, and to listen; and if when I make the same request later you are not more eager than I am for it to be carried out, then…</t5013> <t5014>Then I will fulfill my duty, no matter what happens.</t5014> <t5015>Afterwards, according to your wishes, I will make myself available to you to account for my conduct, whenever and wherever you want -the master's voice softened a bit, but continued, in a tone full of compassion-: But I beg you not to remain angry with me.</t5015> <t5016>Throughout my life I have had to carry out many things that have been deeply unpleasant to me, and that have sometimes broken my heart; however, I have never had such an ungrateful task in my hands.</t5016> <t5017>Believe me, if there ever comes a time when you change your opinion of me, a single look from you would erase all the immense sadness of these moments, since I am going to do everything humanly possible to spare you sadness and sorrow.</t5017> <t5018>Just think, why would I take so much trouble and so many pains?</t5018> <t5019>I have come from my country to do what I believe is right; firstly, to serve my friend John, and also to help a lady whom I too came to love.</t5019> <t5020>For her, and I regret having to say it, even though I do it for a constructive purpose, I gave the same as you: the blood of my veins.</t5020> <t5021>I gave it to her, despite not being like you, the man who loved her, but her doctor and her friend.</t5021> <t5022>I devoted my days and nights to her… before her death and after it, and if my death can do her any good, even now, when she is a "living dead," I will gladly put it at her disposal.</t5022>
<t5023>He said this with a very grave and firm dignity, and Arthur was very impressed by it.</t5023> <t5024>He took the old man's hand and said, with a choked voice:</t5024>
<t5025>–Oh!</t5025> <t5026>It's something hard to believe and I don't understand it.</t5026> <t5027>But, at the very least, I must go with you and observe the events.</t5027>
<t5028>XVI.–</t5028> <t5029>FROM THE DIARY OF DR. SEWARD (continued)</t5029>
<t5030>It was a quarter to twelve at night when we entered the church cemetery, climbing over the not very high wall.</t5030> <t5031>The night was dark, although, at times, the moonlight filtered through the dense clouds that covered the sky.</t5031> <t5032>We stayed very close to each other, with Van Helsing a little ahead, showing us the way.</t5032> <t5033>When we got near the tomb, I looked closely at Arthur, because I feared that the proximity of a place filled with such sad memories would deeply affect him; but he managed to control himself.</t5033> <t5034>I thought that the very mystery surrounding all of this was mitigating his anger.</t5034> <t5035>The professor opened the door and, seeing that we hesitated, which was very natural, resolved the difficulty by entering first himself.</t5035> <t5036>We all imitated him, and the old man closed the door.</t5036> <t5037>Next, he lit a dim lantern and illuminated the coffin.</t5037> <t5038>Arthur took a step forward, not very decisively, and Van Helsing said to me:</t5038>
<t5039>–You were with me here yesterday.</t5039> <t5040>Was Miss Lucy's body in this coffin?</t5040>
<t5041>–That's right.</t5041>
<t5042>The professor turned to the others, saying:</t5042>
<t5043>–You hear it already, and besides, I don't think there's anyone who doesn't believe it.</t5043>
<t5044>He took out the screwdriver and removed the lid from the coffin again.</t5044> <t5045>Arthur watched, very pale, but in silence.</t5045>
<t5046>When the lid was removed, he took a step forward.</t5046> <t5047>Evidently, he did not know that there was a lead box or, in any case, did not think about it.</t5047> <t5048>When he saw the light reflected on the lead, the blood rushed to his face for an instant; but, with the same speed, it receded, leaving his face extremely pale.</t5048> <t5049>He still remained silent.</t5049> <t5050>Van Helsing removed the lead lid and all of us looked and stepped back.</t5050>
<t5051>The coffin was empty!</t5051>
<t5052>For several minutes, none of us uttered a single word.</t5052> <t5053>The silence was broken by Quincey Morris:</t5053>
<t5054>–Professor, I have answered for you.</t5054> <t5055>All I desire is your word...</t5055> <t5056>I would not ordinarily ask this question..., dishonoring you or implying a doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond honor or dishonor.</t5056> <t5057>Did you do this?</t5057>
<t5058>I swear by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed her from here, and that I have not even touched her.</t5058> <t5059>What happened was the following: two nights ago, my friend Seward and I came here... with good intentions, believe me.</t5059> <t5060>I opened this coffin, which was then well sealed, and we found it as it is now, empty.</t5060> <t5061>Then we waited and saw a white form heading this way, among the trees.</t5061> <t5062>The next day we returned here, during the day, and saw that the corpse was lying there.</t5062> <t5063>Isn't that right, friend John?</t5063>
<t5064>–Yes.</t5064>
<t5065>–That night we arrived just in time.</t5065> <t5066>Another little boy was missing from his home and we found him, thank God, unharmed, among the tombs.</t5066> <t5067>Yesterday I came here before sunset, as at sunset the "living dead" can come out.</t5067> <t5068>I was waiting here all night, until the sun rose again; but I saw nothing.</t5068> <t5069>Perhaps it is because I placed garlic in the gaps of all those doors, which the "undead" cannot stand, and other things they try to avoid.</t5069> <t5070>This morning I removed the garlic and the rest.</t5070> <t5071>And now we have found this empty coffin.</t5071> <t5072>But believe me: so far there are already many things that seem strange; however, stay with me outside, waiting, without making noise or letting ourselves be seen, and even stranger things will happen.</t5072> <t5073>Therefore -he said, turning off the faint beam of the lantern-, let's go out.</t5073>
<t5074>He opened the door and we all hurried out; the professor was the last to leave and, once outside, he closed the door.</t5074> <t5075>Oh! How fresh and pure the night air seemed to us after those horrible moments!</t5075> <t5076>It was very pleasant to see the clouds moving across the sky and the moonlight filtering through the occasional gaps in the clouds... like the joy and sadness in a man's life.</t5076> <t5077>How pleasant it was to breathe the pure air that did not have that unpleasant smell of death and decay!</t5077> <t5078>How reassuring to see the reddish glow of the sky behind the hill and hear in the distance the dull noise that signifies the life of a big city!</t5078> <t5079>All of us, each in our own way, remained serious and full of solemnity.</t5079> <t5080>Arthur still kept obstinate silence and, as far as I could infer, he was striving to understand the purpose and deep meaning of the mystery.</t5080> <t5081>I myself felt quite calm and patient, inclined to reject my doubts and accept van Helsing's conclusions.</t5081> <t5082>Quincey Morris remained phlegmatic, in the manner of a man who accepts everything with a cool head, bravely exposing himself to whatever may happen.</t5082>
<t5083>Since he couldn't smoke, he took a rather large handful of tobacco and began to chew it.</t5083> <t5084>As for Van Helsing, he was busy with something specific.</t5084> <t5085>He took from his briefcase an object that seemed to be a biscuit similar to a wafer and that was carefully wrapped in a white napkin; then, he took out a good handful of a whitish substance, like dough or paste.</t5085> <t5086>He broke the wafer, carefully crumbling it, and mixed it all with the dough he had in his hands.</t5086> <t5087>Next, he cut narrow strips of the product and set about placing them in all the cracks and openings that separated the door from the wall of the crypt.</t5087> <t5088>I felt somewhat confused and, since I was near him, I asked him what he was doing.</t5088> <t5089>Arthur and Quincey also approached, driven by curiosity.</t5089> <t5090>The professor replied:</t5090>
<t5091>–I am closing the tomb, so that the "living dead" cannot enter.</t5091>
<t5092>–Is that substance you put there going to stop it?</t5092>
<t5093>–That's right.</t5093>
<t5094>–What are you using?</t5094>
<t5095>This time, it was Arthur who asked the question.</t5095>
<t5096>With a certain reverence, Van Helsing lifted the brim of his hat and replied:</t5096>
<t5097>–The Host.</t5097> <t5098>I brought it from Amsterdam.</t5098> <t5099>I have authorization to use it here.</t5099>
<t5100>It was an answer that impressed all of us, even the most skeptical, and we individually felt that in the presence of such an honorable purpose as the professor's, who used in this task what was most sacred to him, it was impossible to distrust.</t5100> <t5101>Amidst a respectful silence, each of us took the place that had been assigned to us, around the grave; but hidden, so that no person approaching could see us.</t5101> <t5102>I felt sorry for the others, especially for Arthur.</t5102> <t5103>I myself had become somewhat accustomed, because I had already made other visits and had been in contact with that horror; and even so, I, who had rejected the evidence about an hour ago, felt my heart pounding.</t5103> <t5104>The graves had never seemed so ghostly white to me; never had the cypresses, yews, or junipers seemed to be, as on that occasion, the embodiment of the spirit of funerals.</t5104> <t5105>Never before had the trees and the grass seemed so threatening to me.</t5105> <t5106>Never before had the branches creaked so mysteriously, nor had the distant barking of dogs ever sent such a horrendous omen in the middle of the darkness of the night.</t5106>
<t5107>There was a moment of profound silence: an almost painful void.</t5107> <t5108>Then, the professor ordered us to be quiet with a hiss.</t5108> <t5109>He pointed with his hand and, in the distance, among the yews, we saw a white figure approaching...</t5109> <t5110>A small white figure, holding something dark pressed against its chest.</t5110> <t5111>The figure stopped and, at that moment, a ray of moonlight filtered through the clouds, clearly showing a woman with dark hair, dressed in the waxed shroud of the grave.</t5111> <t5112>We couldn't see her face, as it was tilted over what we later identified as a blond-haired child.</t5112> <t5113>There was a pause and then a sharp cry, like that of a child in a dream or a dog lying near the fire, sleeping.</t5113> <t5114>We were about to rush forward, but the professor raised a hand, which we saw clearly against the yew that served as his hiding place, and we remained motionless; then, as we waited expectantly, the white figure began to move again.</t5114> <t5115>It was now close enough for us to see it clearly, and the moonlight still shone fully upon it.</t5115> <t5116>I felt my heart freeze, and I heard Arthur's exclamation and startle when we clearly recognized the features of Lucy Westenra.</t5116> <t5117>It was her.</t5117> <t5118>But, how she had changed!</t5118> <t5119>Her sweetness had turned into a terrible and inhuman cruelty, and her purity into a voluptuous perversity.</t5119> <t5120>Van Helsing left his hiding place and, following his example, we all moved forward; the four of us found ourselves lined up in front of the crypt door.</t5120> <t5121>Van Helsing raised the lantern and switched it on, and thanks to the faint light that fell on Lucy's face, we could see that her lips were red, full of fresh blood, and that a stream of the liquid had trickled down her chin, staining the immaculate whiteness of her shroud.</t5121>
<t5122>We shuddered, horrified, and I realized, from the convulsive trembling of the light, that even van Helsing's nerves of steel had faltered.</t5122> <t5123>Arthur was by my side, and if I hadn't taken him by the arm to support him, he would have collapsed to the ground.</t5123>
<t5124>When Lucy… (I called the thing we had in front of us Lucy, because it retained her shape) saw us, she backed away with a growl of rage, like that of a cat when surprised; then, her eyes settled on us.</t5124> <t5125>They were Lucy's eyes in shape and color; but Lucy's eyes, perverse and full of infernal fire, not the sweet and kind eyes we had known.</t5125> <t5126>In those moments, what remained of my love for her turned into hatred and repugnance; if it were necessary to kill her, I would have done it at that very moment, with unimaginable delight.</t5126> <t5127>As she looked, her eyes shone with a demonic glow, and her face wrinkled into a voluptuous smile.</t5127>
<t5128>Oh, my God, how I shuddered at seeing that smile!</t5128> <t5129>With a careless movement, like a she-devil full of wickedness, she threw the child she had been holding in her arms to the ground and remained growling over the creature, like a hungry dog beside a bone.</t5129> <t5130>The child screamed loudly and lay still, moaning.</t5130> <t5131>There was in that act such a monstrous display of cold blood that Arthur couldn't contain a cry; when the figure advanced towards him, with arms open and a smile of voluptuousness on her lips, he recoiled and hid his face in his hands.</t5131>
<t5132>Nevertheless, the figure continued to advance, with smooth and graceful movements.</t5132>
<t5133>–Come to me, Arthur -she said-.</t5133> <t5134>Leave everyone else and come to me.</t5134> <t5135>My arms are hungry for you.</t5135> <t5136>Come, and we can stay together.</t5136> <t5137>Come, my husband, come!</t5137>
<t5138>There was something devilishly sweet in the tone of her voice...</t5138> <t5139>Something akin to the sound produced by glass when struck that impressed all of us present, even though the words had not been directed at us.</t5139> <t5140>As for Arthur, he seemed to be under the influence of a spell; he removed his hands from his face and opened his arms.</t5140> <t5141>Lucy rushed towards them; but Van Helsing stepped forward, positioned himself between them, and held a gold crucifix in front of him.</t5141> <t5142>The form recoiled from the cross and, with a face suddenly contorted with rage, passed by him, as if to enter the tomb.</t5142>
<t5143>When she was thirty or sixty centimeters from the door, however, she stopped, as if paralyzed by some irresistible force.</t5143> <t5144>Then she turned, and her face was exposed under the glow of the moon and the light of the lantern, which no longer trembled, because Van Helsing had regained control of his nerves of steel.</t5144> <t5145>Never before had I seen so much evil in a face; and never, I hope, will other mortal beings see it again.</t5145> <t5146>Her beautiful color disappeared and her face turned livid, her eyes seemed to spark with infernal fire, her forehead was wrinkled, as if her flesh were formed by the tails of Medusa's serpents, and her adorable mouth, which was then stained with blood, formed an open square, like in the theatrical masks of the Greeks and the Japanese.</t5146> <t5147>At that moment we saw a face that reflected death like no other before.</t5147> <t5148>If looks could kill!</t5148>
<t5149>He remained like that for half a minute, which seemed like an eternity to us, between the raised crucifix and the sacred seals that were on his front door.</t5149> <t5150>Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur.</t5150>
<t5151>–Answer me, my friend: do you want me to continue?</t5151>
<t5152>Arthur dropped to his knees and covered his face with his hands, while responding:</t5152>
<t5153>–Do what you think is best, my friend.</t5153> <t5154>Do whatever you want.</t5154> <t5155>It's not possible that such a horror could exist - he moaned.</t5155>
<t5156>Quincey and I simultaneously advanced towards him and grabbed him by the arms.</t5156>
<t5157>We managed to hear the click produced by the lantern being turned off.</t5157> <t5158>Van Helsing moved even closer to the crypt and began to remove the sacred emblem he had placed in the cracks.</t5158> <t5159>We all watched, horrified and confused, as the professor stepped back, and the woman, with a human body as real at that moment as ours, passed through the crack where barely the blade of a knife could have passed.</t5159> <t5160>We all felt a huge relief when we saw the professor calmly place the mass he had removed back in its place.</t5160>
<t5161>After doing it, he lifted the child and said:</t5161>
<t5162>–Let's go, friends.</t5162> <t5163>We can't do anything else until tomorrow.</t5163> <t5164>There is a funeral at noon, so we will have to return here not long after that time.</t5164> <t5165>The friends of the deceased will all leave before two, and when the sexton closes the cemetery gate, we must stay inside.</t5165> <t5166>Then we will have other things to do; but it will be nothing like tonight.</t5166> <t5167>As for this little one, he is not badly injured, and by tomorrow night he will be perfectly fine.</t5167> <t5168>We must leave him where the police can find him, like the other night, and then we will return home.</t5168>
<t5169>He moved a little closer to Arthur, and said:</t5169>
<t5170>–Arthur, my friend, you have had to endure a very hard trial; but, later, when you remember it, you will understand that it was necessary.</t5170> <t5171>You are full of bitterness at this moment; but, tomorrow at this time, you will have already consoled yourself, and God willing, you will have had some reason for joy; therefore, do not despair too much.</t5171> <t5172>Until then, I will not ask you to forgive me.</t5172>
<t5173>Arthur and Quincey returned to my house with me, and we tried to console each other along the way.</t5173> <t5174>We had left the child in a safe place and we were tired.</t5174> <t5175>We all slept more or less deeply.</t5175>
<t5176>September 29, at night.</t5176> <t5177>Shortly before midnight, the three of us, Arthur, Quincey Morris, and I, went to see the professor.</t5177> <t5178>It was strange to notice that, as if by common agreement, we had all dressed in black.</t5178> <t5179>Of course, Arthur was in black because he was in deep mourning; but the rest of us dressed that way by instinct.</t5179> <t5180>We went to the church cemetery around half past one, and entered the graveyard, staying where we could not be seen, so that when the gravediggers had finished their work, and the sexton, believing no one was left in the cemetery, closed the gate, we remained quietly inside.</t5180> <t5181>Van Helsing, instead of his black portfolio, carried a long leather case that seemed to contain a cricket bat; it was obvious that it was quite heavy.</t5181>
<t5182>When we found ourselves alone, after hearing the last footsteps fade away up the street, in silence and as if by common agreement, we followed the professor towards the crypt.</t5182> <t5183>Van Helsing opened the door and we entered, closing it behind us.</t5183> <t5184>Then the old man took out the lantern, lit it, and also lit two wax candles which, after letting a few drops fall, he placed on other coffins, in such a way that they spread a glow that allowed us to work.</t5184> <t5185>When he removed the lid from Lucy's coffin again, we all looked, Arthur trembling violently, and saw the corpse lying there, with all its posthumous beauty.</t5185>
<t5186>But he did not feel love at all, only repugnance for the ghastly object that had taken the form of Lucy, without her soul.</t5186> <t5187>I saw that even Arthur's face hardened as he observed the dead body.</t5187> <t5188>At that moment, he asked van Helsing:</t5188>
<t5189>–Is it really Lucy's body, or just a demon that has taken her form?</t5189>
<t5190>–It is her body, and at the same time, it is not.</t5190> <t5191>But, wait a little and you will see her again as she was and is.</t5191>
<t5192>The corpse looked like Lucy seen in the middle of a nightmare, with her sharp fangs and voluptuous mouth stained with blood, which made one shudder at the mere sight of her.</t5192> <t5193>She had a carnal and vulgar appearance, which seemed like a diabolical caricature of Lucy's sweet laziness.</t5193> <t5194>Van Helsing, with his accustomed methodical movements, began to take out all the objects contained in the leather case and placed them around him, prepared to be used.</t5194> <t5195>First, he took out a soldering iron and a bar of tin, and then, a small oil lamp that, when lit in a corner of the crypt, released a gas that burned, producing an extremely strong heat; then, his scalpels, which he placed near his hand, and after that, a round wooden stake, about six or eight centimeters in diameter and about ninety centimeters in length.</t5195> <t5196>One of its ends had been hardened by putting it in the fire, and the tip had been carefully sharpened.</t5196> <t5197>Next to the stake was a small hammer, similar to those found in coal mines, used to break pieces of mineral that were too thick.</t5197> <t5198>For me, the preparations carried out by a doctor to perform any type of work were stimulating and reassuring; but all those manipulations filled Quincey and Arthur with consternation.</t5198> <t5199>However, both managed to control themselves and remained motionless and silent.</t5199>
<t5200>When everything was ready, Van Helsing said:</t5200>
<t5201>–Before doing anything, let me explain something that comes from the wisdom and experience of the ancients and all those who have studied the powers of the "undead".</t5201> <t5202>When they become undead, the change implies immortality; they cannot die and must continue through the ages taking new victims and increasing all the evil in this world; since all who die from the attacks of the "undead" themselves become those horrible monsters and, in turn, attack their fellow humans.</t5202> <t5203>Thus, the circle widens, like the ripples caused by a stone falling into water.</t5203> <t5204>Friend Arthur, if you had accepted that kiss before poor Lucy died, or last night, when she opened her arms to receive you, in time, upon dying, you would become a nosferatu, as they are called in Eastern Europe, and would continue producing more and more "undead", like the one that has horrified us.</t5204> <t5205>The career of this unfortunate lady has just begun.</t5205> <t5206>Those children whose blood she sucks are not yet the worst that can happen; but if she continues living, as an "undead", they will lose more and more blood, and because of her power over them, they will come to seek her; thus, she will suck their blood with that horrendous mouth.</t5206>
<t5207>But if it truly dies, then everything ceases; the throats' openings disappear, and the children can continue with their games, without even remembering what has been happening to them.</t5207> <t5208>But the best of all is that when we make this corpse that is now "undead" truly die, the soul of the poor lady whom we all love will be free again.</t5208> <t5209>Instead of carrying out her horrendous crimes at night and spending the days digesting her dreadful meal, she will take her place among the other angels. So, my friend, it will be a blessed hand by her that delivers the blow to free her.</t5209> <t5210>I feel ready to do it, but isn't there someone among us who has a greater right to do it?</t5210> <t5211>Wouldn't it be a joy to think, in the silence of the night, when sleep refuses to envelop him: "It was my hand that sent her to heaven; it was the hand of the one who loved her the most; the hand she would have chosen above all others, if she could have done so."?</t5211> <t5212>Tell me, is there someone like that among us?</t5212>
<t5213>We all looked at Arthur.</t5213> <t5214>He understood, just like all of us, the infinite kindness that suggested it should be his hand that would return Lucy to us as a sacred memory, no longer infernal; he took a step forward and said bravely, even though his hands were trembling and his face was as pale as if it were made of snow:</t5214>
<t5215>–My dear friend, I thank you from the bottom of my broken heart.</t5215> <t5216>Tell me what I have to do and I will not fail!</t5216>
<t5217>Van Helsing put a hand on his shoulder and said:</t5217>
<t5218>–Bravo!</t5218> <t5219>A moment of courage and everything will be over.</t5219> <t5220>You must pierce your body with this stake.</t5220> <t5221>It will be a terrible trial, think nothing else; but it will only last an instant, and afterwards, the joy you will feel will be much greater than the pain that action will cause you; from this sad crypt, you will emerge as if flying in the air.</t5221> <t5222>But you must not fail once you have started doing it.</t5222> <t5223>Just think that all of us, your best friends, will be around you, constantly praying for you.</t5223>
<t5224>Take that stake in your left hand, ready to place the tip over the corpse's heart, and the hammer in your right hand.</t5224> <t5225>Then, when we begin the prayer for the dead... I will read it.</t5225> <t5226>I have the book here and the others will recite with me.</t5226> <t5227>Then, strike in the name of God, for thus everything will go well for the soul of the one we love and the "undead" will die.</t5227>
<t5228>Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and, since his mind was occupied with something specific, his hands no longer trembled at all.</t5228> <t5229>Van Helsing opened his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I repeated what he said as best as we could.</t5229> <t5230>Arthur placed the tip of the stake over the heart of the corpse and, as I watched, I could see the depression in the white flesh.</t5230> <t5231>Then, he struck with all his might.</t5231>
<t5232>The object that was in the coffin writhed and a chilling and horrible scream came from between the slightly parted red lips.</t5232> <t5233>The body shook, shuddered, and writhed with wild movements; the sharp white teeth clenched until the lips parted and the mouth filled with scarlet foam.</t5233> <t5234>But Arthur did not hesitate for a moment.</t5234> <t5235>He seemed like a representation of the Scandinavian god Thor, as his firm arm rose and fell relentlessly, driving the pious stake deeper and deeper, while the blood from the shattered heart gushed out forcefully and spread around the wound.</t5235> <t5236>His face was contorted and hardened by what he believed to be a duty; seeing him gave us courage and our voices rang out clearly within the small crypt.</t5236>
<t5237>Gradually, the trembling and also the sudden movements of the body decreased, the teeth seemed to bite, and the face trembled.</t5237> <t5238>Finally, the corpse remained motionless.</t5238> <t5239>The terrible deed was done.</t5239>
<t5240>The hammer fell from Arthur's hands.</t5240> <t5241>He spun on his heels, and would have fallen to the ground if we hadn't held him up.</t5241> <t5242>Thick drops of sweat appeared on his forehead and he was breathing with difficulty.</t5242> <t5243>In reality, he had been subjected to tremendous tension, and if he hadn't been compelled to do so by considerations more important than anything human, he would never have been able to successfully complete that horrible task.</t5243>
<t5244>For a few minutes, we were so engrossed with him that we didn't look at the coffin at all.</t5244> <t5245>When we did, however, a murmur of astonishment escaped all our lips.</t5245> <t5246>We looked so strange that Arthur got up, as he had been sitting on the floor, and also approached to look; then, an expression full of joy, with a strange gleam, appeared on his face, replacing the horror that had been imprinted on his features until then.</t5246>
<t5247>There, in the coffin, no longer rested the dreadful thing we had hated so much, whose destruction we considered a privilege and entrusted to the most suitable person for it, but Lucy, just as we had known her in life, with her face of unparalleled sweetness and purity.</t5247> <t5248>It is true that her features reflected the pain and worry that we had all seen in life; but that seemed pleasant to us, because they were truly an integral part of the real Lucy.</t5248> <t5249>We all felt that the calm that shone like sunlight over the face and body of the deceased was only an earthly symbol of the tranquility she would enjoy for all eternity.</t5249>
<t5250>Van Helsing approached, placed his hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said to him:</t5250>
<t5251>–And now, Arthur, my dear friend, haven't you forgiven me?</t5251>
<t5252>The reaction to the terrible tension occurred when she took the old man's hand in hers, lifted it to her lips, pressed it against them, and said:</t5252>
<t5253>–Forgive him?</t5253> <t5254>May God bless him for having returned his soul to my beloved and peace to me!</t5254>
<t5255>She placed her hands on the professor's shoulder and, resting her head on his chest, cried silently while we remained motionless.</t5255> <t5256>When she lifted her head again, Van Helsing said to her:</t5256>
<t5257>–Now, my friend, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you wish, as she would wish if she could choose.</t5257> <t5258>Since she is no longer a smiling devil…, a cursed object for all eternity.</t5258> <t5259>She is no longer the diabolical "living dead."</t5259> <t5260>She is a dead woman who belongs to God and her soul is with Him!.</t5260>
<t5261>Arthur leaned in and kissed her.</t5261> <t5262>Then, we sent Arthur and Quincey out of the crypt.</t5262> <t5263>The professor and I cut off the top of the stake, leaving the tip inside the body.</t5263> <t5264>Then, we cut off her head and filled her mouth with garlic.</t5264> <t5265>We carefully welded the lead box, placed the coffin lid in its place, tightened the screws, and after gathering everything that belonged to us, we left the crypt.</t5265> <t5266>The professor closed the door and handed the key to Arthur.</t5266>
<t5267>Outside, the air was gentle, the sun was shining, the birds were chirping, and it seemed that all of nature had completely changed.</t5267> <t5268>There was joy, peace, and tranquility everywhere.</t5268> <t5269>We still felt like ourselves and full of joy, although it was not an intense joy, but rather something gentle and very pleasant.</t5269>
<t5270>Before we started moving away from that place, Van Helsing said:</t5270>
<t5271>–Now, my friends, we have already completed a stage of our work, the hardest for us.</t5271> <t5272>But a much more difficult task awaits us: to discover the author of all these sufferings that we have had to endure and eliminate them.</t5272> <t5273>I have clues that we can follow, but it is a long and difficult task, full of dangers and pain.</t5273> <t5274>Won't all of you help me?</t5274> <t5275>We have all learned to believe, haven't we?</t5275> <t5276>And, being so, don't we see what our duty is? Yes!</t5276> <t5277>Don't we promise to go to the end, no matter how bitter it may be?</t5277>
<t5278>We all accepted his hand, one by one, and promised.</t5278> <t5279>Then, as we walked away from the cemetery, the professor said:</t5279>
<t5280>–In two nights, you must meet with me to have dinner together at our friend John's house.</t5280> <t5281>I need to speak with two other friends, two people you do not know yet; and I must prepare to have the work program and all our plans ready.</t5281> <t5282>Friend John, come with me home, as I have many things to consult with you and you can help me.</t5282> <t5283>Tonight, I will leave for Amsterdam, but I will return tomorrow night.</t5283> <t5284>Then our work will truly begin.</t5284> <t5285>But before that, I will have many things to tell you, so you know what we have to do and what we must fear.</t5285> <t5286>Then, we will renew our promise to each other, as we face a terrible task, and once we set foot on this path, we will not be able to turn back.</t5286>
<t5287>XVII.–</t5287> <t5288>FROM THE DIARY OF DR. SEWARD (continued)</t5288>
<t5289>When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram that had arrived in his absence:</t5289>
<t5290>"I will arrive by train.</t5290> <t5291>Jonathan in Whitby.</t5291> <t5292>Important news.</t5292>
<t5293>MINA HARKER."</t5293>
<t5294>The professor was delighted.</t5294>
<t5295>"Ah! That wonderful Mrs. Mina," he said.</t5295> <t5296>"A pearl among women!"</t5296> <t5297>"She is coming; but I can't stay to wait for her."</t5297> <t5298>"You must take her to your house, friend John."</t5298> <t5299>"You must go to receive her at the station."</t5299> <t5300>"Send her a telegram on the way so she will be prepared."</t5300>
<t5301>When we sent the telegram, the professor took a cup of tea; then, he talked to me about a diary of Jonathan Harker and handed me a typed copy, as well as the diary that Mina Harker wrote in Whitby.</t5301>
<t5302>–Take them -he told me- and examine them carefully.</t5302> <t5303>By the time I return, you will be up to date with all the facts and we can better undertake our investigations.</t5303> <t5304>Take care of them, as their content is a true treasure.</t5304> <t5305>You will need all your faith, despite the experience you had today.</t5305> <t5306>What is said here -he placed his hand heavily, with gravity, on the pile of papers as he spoke-, could be the beginning of the end for you, for me, and for many others; or it could mean the end of the "living dead" that commits so many atrocities on earth.</t5306> <t5307>Read it all, I beg you, with attention.</t5307> <t5308>And if you can add anything to the story told here, do so, as in this case everything is important.</t5308> <t5309>You have recorded all those strange events in your diary, haven't you?</t5309> <t5310>Of course!</t5310> <t5311>Well, then, we will review everything together when I return.</t5311>
<t5312>Next, he made all the preparations for his trip and, shortly after, headed to Liverpool Street.</t5312> <t5313>I made my way to Paddington, where I arrived about a quarter of an hour before the train's arrival.</t5313>
<t5314>The crowd began to thin out after the characteristic movement on the arrival platforms.</t5314> <t5315>I was starting to feel uneasy, fearing I wouldn't find my guest, when a young woman with a sweet face and delicate appearance approached me, and after a quick glance, she said:</t5315>
<t5316>–You are Dr. Seward, aren't you?</t5316>
<t5317>–And you must be Mrs. Harker! – I responded immediately.</t5317>
<t5318>Then, the young woman extended her hand to me.</t5318>
<t5319>–I knew him from the description that poor Lucy gave me; but… she suddenly fell silent and a deep blush covered her cheeks.</t5319>
<t5320>The blush that appeared on my own face reassured both of us in a way, since it was a tacit response to hers.</t5320> <t5321>I took her luggage, which included a typewriter, and we took the subway to Fenchurch Street, after sending a message to my housekeeper to prepare a sitting room and a bedroom for the newcomer.</t5321>
<t5322>We arrived soon.</t5322> <t5323>The young woman knew, of course, that the place was an asylum for the insane; but I saw that she could not suppress a shudder when we entered.</t5323>
<t5324>He told me that if it was possible, he would like to accompany me to my study, because he had a lot to talk to me about.</t5324> <t5325>Therefore, I am finishing recording the knowledge in my phonographic diary while I wait for him.</t5325>
<t5326>Since I have not yet had the opportunity to read the papers entrusted to me by Van Helsing, although they are spread out in front of me, I will have to get the lady interested in something so that I can devote myself to reading them.</t5326> <t5327>She does not know how precious time is or the nature of the task we have undertaken.</t5327> <t5328>I must be careful not to scare her.</t5328> <t5329>Here she comes!</t5329>
<t5330>From the diary of Mina Harker</t5330>
<t5331>September 29.</t5331> <t5332>After settling in, I went down to Dr. Seward's study.</t5332>
<t5333>At the door, I paused for a moment because I thought I heard him talking to someone.</t5333> <t5334>However, since he had begged me not to waste time, I knocked on the door and entered the study once he gave me permission to do so.</t5334>
<t5335>I was very surprised to find that there was no one with him.</t5335> <t5336>He was absolutely alone, and on the table in front of him was what I immediately knew, from the descriptions, to be a phonograph.</t5336> <t5337>I had never seen one before and it interested me a lot.</t5337>
<t5338>"I hope I haven't kept you waiting long," I said to him, "but I stopped at the door because I thought I heard you talking and assumed there was someone in your study."</t5338>
<t5339>–Oh! – he replied, with a smile-.</t5339> <t5340>I was just recording the latest events in my diary.</t5340>
<t5341>"Your diary?" I asked, very surprised.</t5341>
<t5342>–Yes -he replied-, I record it on this device.</t5342> <t5343>As he spoke, he placed his hand on the phonograph.</t5343> <t5344>I felt very excited and exclaimed:</t5344>
<t5345>–Wow!</t5345> <t5346>This is even faster than shorthand!</t5346> <t5347>May I listen to the device for a bit?</t5347>
<t5348>–Naturally, he replied kindly and stood up to prepare the device so that it would speak.</t5348>
<t5349>Then, he stopped and a confused expression appeared on his face.</t5349>
<t5350>–The thing is -he began in a strange tone that only my diary records; and it refers entirely..., almost completely..., to my cases.</t5350> <t5351>It would be something very unpleasant...</t5351> <t5352>I mean...</t5352>
<t5353>He remained silent, and I tried to help him out of his confusion.</t5353>
<t5354>–You assisted my dear Lucy in her final moments.</t5354> <t5355>Let me hear how she died.</t5355> <t5356>I will be very grateful for anything you can tell me about her.</t5356> <t5357>She was truly very dear to me.</t5357>
<t5358>To my surprise, he responded with an expression of profound horror on his features:</t5358>
<t5359>–Do you want me to talk to you about your death? Not for anything in the world!</t5359>
<t5360>–Why not? – I asked, as a terrible feeling began to take hold of me.</t5360>
<t5361>The doctor paused again, and I could see that he was trying to come up with an excuse.</t5361> <t5362>Finally, he stammered:</t5362>
<t5363>–Do you see?</t5363> <t5364>I don't know how to remove all the particular details contained in the diary.</t5364>
<t5365>While speaking, an idea occurred to him, and he said, with a simplicity full of unconsciousness, in a different tone of voice and with the candor of a child:</t5365>
<t5366>–That is the truth, I give you my word on it.</t5366> <t5367>On my honor as an honest Indian!</t5367>
<t5368>I couldn't help but smile, and the doctor made a face.</t5368>
<t5369>–This time I have betrayed myself! – he said-.</t5369> <t5370>But, do you know that even though I have been keeping the diary up to date for several months now, I never worried about how I could find any particular part of it that I wanted to examine?</t5370>
<t5371>But this time I convinced myself that the diary of the doctor who attended to Lucy would have something to add to our sum of knowledge about the terrible being, and I said plainly:</t5371>
<t5372>–Then, Dr. Seward, it would be best if you let me make a copy for you on my typewriter.</t5372>
<t5373>He turned intensely pale, as he said to me:</t5373>
<t5374>–No! No! No!</t5374> <t5375>For nothing in the world will I let you know that terrible story!</t5375>
<t5376>Therefore, it was terrible.</t5376> <t5377>My intuition had not deceived me!</t5377> <t5378>For a few moments, I was thinking, and while my eyes carefully examined the room, looking for something or some opportunity that could help me, I saw a pile of typewritten papers on his desk.</t5378> <t5379>The doctor's eyes fixed on mine, and involuntarily, he followed the direction of my gaze.</t5379> <t5380>Seeing the papers, he understood what I was thinking.</t5380>
<t5381>–You don't know me -I said-.</t5381> <t5382>When you have read those papers, my husband's diary and my own, which I myself typed, you will know me a little better.</t5382> <t5383>I have not failed to express all my thoughts and the feelings of my heart in that diary; but, naturally, you don't know me… yet; and I can't expect you to trust me to reveal something so important.</t5383>
<t5384>Of course, he is a man of very noble nature; my poor Lucy was right about him.</t5384> <t5385>He stood up and opened a wide drawer, in which several hollow metal cylinders covered with dark wax were neatly stored, and said:</t5385>
<t5386>–You are right.</t5386> <t5387>I didn't trust you because I didn't know you.</t5387> <t5388>But now I know you; and let me tell you that I should have known you a long time ago.</t5388> <t5389>I know that Lucy spoke to you about me, just as she spoke to me about you.</t5389> <t5390>May I make the only adjustment I can?</t5390> <t5391>Take the cylinders and listen to them.</t5391> <t5392>The first half dozen are personal and won't horrify you; that way you can get to know me better.</t5392> <t5393>By the time you finish listening to them, dinner will be ready.</t5393> <t5394>In the meantime, I need to read part of these documents, so I will be in a better position to understand certain things.</t5394>
<t5395>He himself brought the phonograph to my little room and set it up so that I could hear it.</t5395> <t5396>Now I am going to know something pleasant, I am sure of it, since he is going to show me the other side of a true love of which I only know one part...</t5396>
<t5397>From the diary of Dr. Seward</t5397>
<t5398>September 29.</t5398> <t5399>I was so absorbed in reading Jonathan Harker's diary and that of his wife that I let time pass without thinking.</t5399> <t5400>Mrs. Harker had not yet come down when the maid announced that dinner was served.</t5400>
<t5401>–It's likely that she's tired.</t5401> <t5402>It would be better if we delayed dinner by an hour, I told her, and went back to immersing myself in my reading.</t5402>
<t5403>I had just finished reading Mrs. Harker's diary when she entered the study.</t5403> <t5404>She looked very pretty and sweet, but a little sad, and her eyes were a bit swollen, an unmistakable sign that she had been crying.</t5404> <t5405>For some reason, that moved me deeply.</t5405> <t5406>A few moments earlier, I myself had felt like crying, God knows!; but the relief that tears bring had been denied to me, and then, seeing those sweet-looking eyes that had been full of tears, affected me.</t5406> <t5407>Therefore, I said to her with all the kindness I could muster:</t5407>
<t5408>–I fear that my diary has distressed her.</t5408>
<t5409>–Oh, no!</t5409> <t5410>I am not heartbroken -she replied-; but your laments have moved me more than I can say.</t5410> <t5411>It is a wonderful machine, but cruelly true.</t5411> <t5412>It made me listen, in the exact tone, to the anguish of your heart.</t5412> <t5413>It was like a soul addressing Almighty God.</t5413> <t5414>No one should ever write that again!</t5414> <t5415>I have tried to be of use to you.</t5415> <t5416>I have copied your words on my typewriter and no one else needs to hear the beats of your heart now, as I have.</t5416>
<t5417>–Nobody ever needs to know, nor will they -I told him, in a very low tone.</t5417>
<t5418>She placed her hand on mine and told me gravely:</t5418>
<t5419>–You must meet him!</t5419>
<t5420>–They must! Why? – he asked.</t5420>
<t5421>–Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of the death of poor and dear Lucy and the causes that provoked it; because in the struggle that awaits us, to rid the earth of that terrible monster, we must acquire all the knowledge and all the help that is possible to obtain.</t5421> <t5422>I believe that the cylinders you entrusted to me contain more than you wanted me to know; but I have seen that in that record there are many clues for the solution of this dark mystery.</t5422> <t5423>Won't you let me help you?</t5423> <t5424>I know everything up to a certain point; and I already understand, although your diary only led me up to the seventh of September, how poor Lucy was being harassed and how her terrible fate was unfolding.</t5424> <t5425>Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van Helsing was with us.</t5425> <t5426>My husband has gone to Whitby to get more information and will arrive here tomorrow, to try to help us all.</t5426> <t5427>We must not have secrets among us; working together and with complete trust we can surely be more useful and effective than if any of us is kept in the dark.</t5427>
<t5428>He looked at me so pleadingly, and at the same time showing so much courage and determination in his attitude, that I immediately gave in to his wishes.</t5428>
<t5429>–Do whatever you think is best regarding this matter -I told him-.</t5429> <t5430>May God forgive me if I am doing wrong!</t5430> <t5431>There are still terrible things you are going to learn; but if you have already come this far concerning the death of poor Lucy, you will not be content, I know, remaining in ignorance.</t5431> <t5432>No, the very end might give you a bit of peace.</t5432> <t5433>Come, dinner is served.</t5433> <t5434>We must strengthen ourselves to endure what awaits us; we have a cruel and dangerous task ahead of us.</t5434> <t5435>When you have dined, you can learn the rest, and I will answer all the questions you wish to ask me… in case there is something you do not understand; although it was clear to all of us who were present.</t5435>
<t5436>From the diary of Mina Harker</t5436>
<t5437>September 29.</t5437> <t5438>After dinner, I accompanied Dr. Seward to his study.</t5438>
<t5439>He took the phonograph from my small room and I took my typewriter.</t5439> <t5440>He made me sit in a comfortable seat and placed the phonograph in such a way that I could operate it without needing to get up, and showed me how to stop it in case I wanted to take a break.</t5440> <t5441>Then, very concerned, he sat with his back to me so that I would feel more at ease, and began to read.</t5441> <t5442>I put the headset on my ears and listened.</t5442>
<t5443>When I learned the terrible story of Lucy's death and everything that followed, I remained reclined in my seat, as if paralyzed, absolutely powerless.</t5443>
<t5444>Fortunately, I am not prone to fainting.</t5444> <t5445>As soon as Dr. Seward saw me, he jumped to his feet with a horrified expression, hurriedly took a bottle from a cupboard, and gave me a small glass of brandy, which, in a few minutes, restored my strength.</t5445> <t5446>My mind was in utter chaos, and amidst all the horrors, a slight ray of light emerged knowing that my poor dear Lucy was finally at peace.</t5446> <t5447>If it weren't for that, I don't think I could have tolerated it without making a scene.</t5447> <t5448>Everything was so wild, mysterious, and strange that if I hadn't known about Jonathan's experience in Transylvania, I wouldn't have been able to believe it.</t5448> <t5449>In fact, I didn't know what to believe and tried to get by by occupying myself with something else.</t5449> <t5450>I uncovered my typewriter and said to Dr. Seward:</t5450>
<t5451>–Let me write all this down for you.</t5451> <t5452>We must be prepared for when Dr. Van Helsing returns.</t5452> <t5453>I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come here as soon as he arrives in London from Whitby.</t5453> <t5454>In this case, the dates are important, and I believe that if we prepare all the material and arrange everything in chronological order, we will have made significant progress.</t5454> <t5455>You have told me that Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are also coming.</t5455> <t5456>That way, we can be in a position to brief him on everything as soon as he arrives.</t5456>
<t5457>The doctor, in accordance with what was said, made the phonograph work more slowly and I began to type from the beginning of the seventh cylinder.</t5457>
<t5458>I used carbon paper and made three copies, just as I had done with everything else.</t5458> <t5459>It was already late when I finished the work, but the doctor went to fulfill his duty, on his round of visits to the patients; when he finished, he returned and sat by my side, reading, so that I wouldn't feel too lonely while working.</t5459> <t5460>How kind and understanding he is!</t5460> <t5461>The world seems to be full of good men, even though there are also monsters!</t5461> <t5462>Before saying goodbye to him, I remembered what Jonathan had written in his diary about the professor's disturbance when he read something in an evening newspaper at the Exeter station; so, seeing that Dr. Seward kept his newspapers organized, I took with me to the room, after asking his permission, the albums of The Westminster Gazette and The Pall Mall Gazette.</t5462> <t5463>I remembered how much The Dailygraph and The Whitby Gazette newspapers, from which I had kept clippings, had helped us to understand the terrible events in Whitby when Count Dracula arrived.</t5463> <t5464>Therefore, I intend to carefully examine the evening newspapers from then on, and perhaps I can find some clue.</t5464> <t5465>I am not sleepy, and the work will help to calm me.</t5465>
<t5466>From the journal of Dr. Seward</t5466>
<t5467>September 30.</t5467> <t5468>Mr. Harker arrived at nine o'clock sharp.</t5468> <t5469>He had received the telegram from his wife shortly before setting out.</t5469> <t5470>He has an uncommon intelligence, if one can judge that by his features, and he is full of energy.</t5470> <t5471>If his diary is true, and it must be, judging by the wonderful experiences we have had, he is also an energetic and brave man.</t5471> <t5472>His second trip to the tomb was a masterpiece of courage.</t5472> <t5473>After reading his report, I was prepared to meet a good specimen of the human race, but not the calm and serious gentleman who arrived here today.</t5473>
<t5474>Later.</t5474> <t5475>After lunch, Harker and his wife returned to their rooms, and as I passed by their door a while ago, I heard the noise made by his typewriter.</t5475> <t5476>They work a lot.</t5476> <t5477>Mrs. Harker told me that they were putting all the evidence they had in chronological order.</t5477> <t5478>Harker had received the letters between the consignment of the boxes in Whitby and the porters who took care of them in London.</t5478> <t5479>Now he is reading the copy of my journal typed by his wife.</t5479> <t5480>I wonder what conclusions they will draw.</t5480> <t5481>Here it is…</t5481>
<t5482>It's strange that it never occurred to me to think that the neighboring house could be the hiding place of the count!</t5482> <t5483>However, God knows that we had enough indications because of poor Renfield's behavior!</t5483> <t5484>The pile of letters related to the acquisition of the house was with the typed copies.</t5484> <t5485>If we had known earlier, we could have saved poor Lucy's life! Enough!</t5485> <t5486>Those thoughts lead to madness!</t5486> <t5487>Harker has returned to his rooms and is once again organizing the material he has.</t5487> <t5488>He says that by dinner time they will be able to present a narrative that has an absolute relation between all the facts.</t5488> <t5489>He thinks that, in the meantime, I should go see Renfield, since up to now he has been a sort of guide on the count's comings and goings.</t5489> <t5490>It's still difficult for me to see it; but, when I examine the dates, I suppose I will clearly see the existing relationship.</t5490> <t5491>How good that Mrs. Harker typed the contents of my cylinders!</t5491> <t5492>We would never have been able to find the dates otherwise...</t5492>
<t5493>I found Renfield sitting peacefully in his room and smiling like a blessed one.</t5493> <t5494>At that moment, he seemed as sane as any other person I know.</t5494> <t5495>I sat next to him and talked with him about countless topics, which he developed in an absolutely natural manner.</t5495> <t5496>Then, of his own accord, he spoke to me about returning to his home, a topic he had never touched upon, as far as I know, during his stay in the asylum.</t5496> <t5497>Indeed, he spoke to me confidently that he could be discharged immediately.</t5497>
<t5498>I believe that if I had not spoken with Harker beforehand and read the letters and the dates of his attacks, I would have been willing to sign his release after a short period of observation.</t5498> <t5499>As things stand, I suspect everything.</t5499> <t5500>All those attacks were somehow linked to the presence of the count in the vicinity.</t5500> <t5501>What did that absolute satisfaction mean then?</t5501> <t5502>Does it mean that his instincts are satisfied because of the conviction of the vampire's final triumph?</t5502> <t5503>He is the same zoophagous, and in his terrible rages, outside the chapel door of the house, he always speaks of the "master".</t5503> <t5504>All this seems to be a confirmation of our idea.</t5504> <t5505>However, after a moment, I left him; my friend was at that moment too sane to seriously test him with questions.</t5505> <t5506>He might start to reflect and then...</t5506> <t5507>Therefore, I walked away from him.</t5507> <t5508>I distrust those moments of calm he sometimes has, and I have given the nurse the order to watch him closely and to have a straitjacket ready to use if necessary.</t5508>
<t5509>From the journal of Jonathan Harker</t5509>
<t5510>September 29, on the train to London.</t5510> <t5511>When I received the kind message from Mr. Billington, in which he told me that he was willing to provide me with all the reports in his possession, I thought it appropriate to go directly to Whitby and carry out all the investigations I desired on the spot.</t5511> <t5512>My objective was to follow the Count's horrible cargo to his house in London.</t5512> <t5513>We could deal with it later.</t5513> <t5514>Billington's son, a very pleasant young man, went to the station to meet me and took me to his father's house, where they had decided I should spend the night.</t5514> <t5515>They were hospitable, with the typical Yorkshire hospitality: giving everything to the guests and leaving them entirely free to do as they wished.</t5515> <t5516>They knew I had a lot to do and that my stay was going to be very short, and Mr. Billington had all the documents related to the consignment of the boxes prepared in his office.</t5516>
<t5517>I was greatly impressed when I saw one of the letters that I had seen on the count's table again, before knowing about his diabolical plans.</t5517> <t5518>Everything had been carefully thought out and executed systematically and with precision.</t5518> <t5519>He seemed to have been prepared to overcome any obstacle that might arise by accident to prevent his intentions from being carried out.</t5519> <t5520>He had left nothing to chance, and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were followed was simply a logical result of his care.</t5520> <t5521>I saw the invoice and took note of it: "Fifty boxes of common earth, for experimental purposes."</t5521> <t5522>Also the copy of the letter addressed to Carter Paterson and his response; I made copies of both.</t5522> <t5523>That was all the information Mr. Billington could provide me, so I headed to the port to see the coast guards, the customs officers, and the port commander.</t5523> <t5524>All of them had something to say about the strange entry of the ship, which was already beginning to have its place in local traditions; but they could not add anything to the simple description "fifty boxes of common earth."</t5524> <t5525>Next, I went to see the station master, who kindly put me in touch with the men who had actually received the boxes.</t5525> <t5526>Their description matched the lists and they had nothing to add, except that the boxes were "extraordinarily heavy" and that their shipment had been very hard work.</t5526> <t5527>One of them said it was a pity that there hadn't been some gentleman present "like you, sir," to reward their efforts in some way, with a cash tip; another expressed the same, saying that the effort had made them so thirsty that they still hadn't managed to quench it completely.</t5527> <t5528>It is not necessary to add that, before leaving them, I made sure they would have no further complaints in this regard.</t5528>
<t5529>September 30.</t5529> <t5530>The station master was kind enough to give me a few written lines for his colleague at King's Cross, so when I arrived there in the morning, I was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes.</t5530> <t5531>He also immediately put me in touch with the appropriate employees, and I saw that their explanations matched the original invoice.</t5531> <t5532>The opportunities to have an abnormal thirst had been few in this last case; however, they had been generously taken advantage of, and I found myself forced to deal with the result in an ex post facto manner.</t5532>
<t5533>From there, I headed to the headquarters of Carter Paterson, where I was received with the utmost courtesy.</t5533> <t5534>They examined the transaction in their journal and correspondence files and immediately called their King's Cross office for more details.</t5534> <t5535>Fortunately, the men who handled the hauling were waiting for work, and the official sent them immediately, also sending with one of them the transit certificate and all the documents related to the delivery of the boxes at Carfax.</t5535> <t5536>Again, I found that the duplicate corresponded exactly; the carriers were able to supplement the scantiness of the documents with a few details.</t5536> <t5537>Soon I learned that these details were related to the dirtiness of the job and the terrible thirst it caused the workers.</t5537> <t5538>When given the opportunity later to quench it, one of the men remarked:</t5538>
<t5539>–That house, sir, is the most neglected I have seen in my entire life.</t5539> <t5540>Good heavens!</t5540> <t5541>It looks like it hasn't been touched in a century.</t5541> <t5542>There was such a thick layer of dust that we could have slept on the floor without hurting our backs, and it was in such disarray that it looked like the ancient temple of Jerusalem.</t5542> <t5543>But the old chapel… That was the last straw!</t5543> <t5544>My companions and I thought we would never get out of that house soon enough.</t5544> <t5545>Good heavens!</t5545> <t5546>For nothing in the world would I stay there a single moment after nightfall!</t5546>
<t5547>Since I had been in the house, I had no trouble believing him; but if he had known what I did, he surely would have used harsher words.</t5547>
<t5548>There is something I am satisfied with, however: that all the boxes that arrived in Whitby from Varna, on the Demeter, were deposited in the old chapel of Carfax.</t5548> <t5549>There should have been fifty of them, unless some had already been removed... as I feared, based on Dr. Seward's diary.</t5549>
<t5550>I have to try to interview the carrier who was taking the boxes from Carfax when Renfield attacked them.</t5550> <t5551>Following that lead, it is possible that we may come to know many important things.</t5551>
<t5552>Later.</t5552> <t5553>Mina and I have worked all day and have organized all the papers.</t5553>
<t5554>From the diary of Mina Harker</t5554>
<t5555>September 30.</t5555> <t5556>I am so happy that it is difficult for me to contain myself.</t5556> <t5557>I suppose it is the natural reaction after the horrible fear I had: that this terrible matter and the reopening of his old wounds could act to Jonathan's detriment.</t5557>
<t5558>I saw him leave for Whitby with as animated a face as possible; but I felt sick with apprehension.</t5558> <t5559>However, the effort had done him good.</t5559> <t5560>He had never been so resolute, strong, and with such volcanic energy, as now.</t5560> <t5561>It is exactly what the excellent Professor Van Helsing told me: he is truly resilient and improves under strains that would kill a person of a weaker nature.</t5561> <t5562>He has returned full of life, hope, and determination.</t5562> <t5563>We have arranged everything for tonight.</t5563> <t5564>I feel very excited.</t5564> <t5565>I suppose it is necessary to pity someone who is as persecuted as the Count.</t5565> <t5566>Only that… that thing is not human…</t5566> <t5567>It is not even a beast.</t5567> <t5568>Reading Dr. Seward's account of poor Lucy's death and everything that followed is enough to drown all feelings of compassion.</t5568>
<t5569>Later.</t5569> <t5570>Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we expected.</t5570> <t5571>Dr. Seward had gone out to take care of some matters and had taken Jonathan with him; therefore, I had to receive them myself.</t5571> <t5572>It was very unpleasant for me, as it reminded me of all the hopes of poor Lucy, just a few months ago.</t5572> <t5573>Naturally, they had heard Lucy talk about me and it seemed that Dr. Van Helsing had also been "promoting me," as Mr. Morris put it.</t5573> <t5574>Poor friends!</t5574> <t5575>None of them know that I am aware of all the proposals they made to Lucy.</t5575> <t5576>They didn't know exactly what to say or do, as they were unaware of how much I knew; therefore, they had to talk about trivialities.</t5576> <t5577>However, I thought deeply and concluded that the best thing I could do was to inform them of everything.</t5577> <t5578>I knew, from Dr. Seward's diary, that they had witnessed poor Lucy's death... the true death... and that I shouldn't be afraid of revealing a secret prematurely.</t5578> <t5579>Therefore, I told them in the best way possible that I had read all the documents and diaries, and that my husband and I, after typing them, had just finished putting them in order.</t5579> <t5580>I gave each of them a copy so they could read them in the library.</t5580> <t5581>When Lord Godalming received his and read it carefully (it was a considerable bundle of documents), he said:</t5581>
<t5582>–Have you written all this, Mrs. Harker?</t5582>
<t5583>I nodded, and he added:</t5583>
<t5584>–I do not quite understand the purpose of all this; but you are all so good and kind and have been working so energetically and honestly, that the only thing I can do is accept all your ideas blindly and try to help you.</t5584> <t5585>I have already received a lesson in having to accept facts that are enough to make a man feel sad until the last moments of his life.</t5585> <t5586>Besides, I know that you loved my poor Lucy…</t5586>
<t5587>Upon reaching this point, he turned and covered his face with his hands.</t5587> <t5588>I managed to perceive the crying in the tone of his voice.</t5588> <t5589>Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, placed a hand on his shoulder for a moment, and then slowly left the room.</t5589>
<t5590>I suppose there is something in the nature of a woman that makes a man feel free to collapse in front of her and express his emotional or tender feelings, without believing they are humiliating to his masculinity; because when Lord Godalming found himself alone with me, he sat on the divan and gave free rein to his tears sincerely and openly.</t5590>
<t5591>I sat down beside her and took her hand.</t5591> <t5592>I hope she didn't think it was presumptuous of me, and that if she thinks about it later, nothing of the sort will ever occur to her.</t5592>
<t5593>I am belittling him a bit; I know he will never do it...</t5593> <t5594>He is too chivalrous for that.</t5594> <t5595>I understood that his heart was broken, and I told him:</t5595>
<t5596>–I loved Lucy and I know what she meant to you, and what you meant to her.</t5596> <t5597>We were like sisters, and now that she is gone, won't you allow me to be like a sister to you in your time of sorrow?</t5597> <t5598>I know the sadness that has overwhelmed you, although I cannot fully measure its depth.</t5598> <t5599>If sympathy and understanding can help you in your grief, won't you let me help you... for Lucy's sake?</t5599>
<t5600>In an instant, the poor man found himself overwhelmed by pain.</t5600> <t5601>It seemed to me that everything he had had to suffer in silence until then burst out all at once.</t5601> <t5602>He went beside himself and, raising his open hands, clapped his palms together, expressing the magnitude of his pain.</t5602> <t5603>He stood up and, a moment later, sat back down, and the tears kept streaming down his cheeks.</t5603> <t5604>I felt enormous pity for him, and without thinking, I opened my arms.</t5604> <t5605>With a sob, he rested his head on my shoulder and cried like a tired child, while trembling with emotion.</t5605>
<t5606>We, women, have something of mothers in us that makes us rise above less important things when motherhood is invoked; I felt that man's head, gripped by pain, resting on me, as if it were the head of the baby I might one day have in my lap, and I stroked his hair, as if he were my son.</t5606> <t5607>At that moment, I did not think about how strange it all was.</t5607>
<t5608>After a while, his sobbing ceased and he straightened up, apologizing, though he did not try to hide his emotion.</t5608> <t5609>He told me that for many days and nights, days full of fatigue and sleepless nights, he had felt unable to talk to anyone, as a man should in moments of affliction like those.</t5609> <t5610>There was no woman whose comfort could be given to him or with whom, due to the terrible circumstances surrounding his grief, he could speak freely.</t5610>
<t5611>–Now I know how she suffered -he said, while wiping his eyes-.</t5611> <t5612>But, I don't know even at this moment and no other person will ever be able to understand, how much your sweet comfort has meant to me today.</t5612> <t5613>With time I will understand it better, and believe me that, although I am infinitely grateful now, my gratitude will increase as my understanding does.</t5613> <t5614>Will you allow us to be like siblings for all our lives... for Lucy's sake?</t5614>
<t5615>–For the love of our Lucy -I said, as I shook his hand.</t5615>
<t5616>–And for yourself -he added-, since if a man's esteem and gratitude have any value, you have earned them today.</t5616> <t5617>If ever in the future you find yourself in need of a man's help, believe me, you will not call upon me in vain.</t5617> <t5618>God willing, that moment when the sunlight disappears from your life will never come; but if it does, promise me you will turn to me.</t5618>
<t5619>He was so sincere and his pain had been so deep that I understood it would be a comfort for him, and I said to him:</t5619>
<t5620>–I promise you.</t5620>
<t5621>When I stepped into the hallway, I saw Mr. Morris, who was looking outside through one of the windows.</t5621> <t5622>He turned around when he heard the sound of my footsteps.</t5622>
<t5623>–How is Art? – he inquired.</t5623>
<t5624>Then, seeing my reddened eyes, he continued saying:</t5624>
<t5625>–Ah!</t5625> <t5626>I see that you have been consoling him.</t5626> <t5627>Poor friend of mine!</t5627> <t5628>That is what he needs.</t5628> <t5629>No one but a woman can console a man when his heart is broken, and he has no one...</t5629>
<t5630>He buried his own pain with such fortitude that my heart bled for him.</t5630> <t5631>I saw that he had the manuscript in his hand and knew that as soon as he read it, he would realize how much I knew; therefore, I said to him:</t5631>
<t5632>–I wish I could console all those who suffer deeply.</t5632> <t5633>Do you want to be my friend and come to me if you need comfort?</t5633> <t5634>Later, you will understand what I am talking about.</t5634>
<t5635>He saw that he was saying it sincerely and, making a bow to me, he took my hand, brought it to his lips, and kissed it.</t5635> <t5636>It seemed to be too poor a consolation for such a brave and selfless soul.</t5636> <t5637>Then, impulsively, I leaned in and kissed him.</t5637>
<t5638>His eyes filled with tears and a lump formed in his throat.</t5638> <t5639>Then, he said in a calm tone:</t5639>
<t5640>–Little one, you will never forget that sincere kindness, in all your life!</t5640>
<t5641>Then, he headed towards the study, where his friend was.</t5641>
<t5642>–Little one!</t5642>
<t5643>The same word with which he had referred to Lucy.</t5643>
<t5644>But he proved to be a friend!.</t5644>
<t5645>XVIII.–</t5645> <t5646>FROM THE DIARY OF DOCTOR SEWARD</t5646>
<t5647>September 30.</t5647> <t5648>I arrived home at five and discovered that Godalming and Morris had not only arrived but had also studied the transcripts of the various diaries and letters that Harker and his wonderful wife had prepared and organized.</t5648> <t5649>Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the carriers, about whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me.</t5649> <t5650>Mrs. Harker gave us a cup of tea, and I can say with all sincerity that, for the first time since I lived there, that old house felt like a home to me.</t5650> <t5651>When we finished, Mrs. Harker said:</t5651>
<t5652>–Doctor Seward, may I ask you a favor?</t5652> <t5653>I wish to see your patient, Mr. Renfield.</t5653> <t5654>Let me see him.</t5654> <t5655>I am very interested in what you say about him in your diary.</t5655>
<t5656>She looked so pleading and so pretty that I couldn't refuse her; consequently, I took her with me.</t5656> <t5657>When I entered the room, I told the man that there was a lady who would like to see him, to which he simply responded:</t5657>
<t5658>–Why?</t5658>
<t5659>–He is visiting the entire house and wants to see everyone in it -I replied.</t5659>
<t5660>–Ah, very well! – he said-.</t5660> <t5661>Let her in, no matter what; but wait a minute, until I put the place in order.</t5661>
<t5662>His method of tidying the room was very peculiar.</t5662>
<t5663>He simply swallowed all the flies and spiders that were in the boxes before he could be stopped.</t5663> <t5664>It was obvious that he feared or was jealous of any interference.</t5664>
<t5665>When he had finished his unpleasant task, he said kindly:</t5665>
<t5666>–Let the lady in.</t5666>
<t5667>And he sat on the edge of his bed with his head bowed down; but with his eyelids raised, so he could see the lady as soon as she entered the room.</t5667>
<t5668>For a moment, I thought that perhaps he had homicidal intentions.</t5668>
<t5669>I remembered how calm he had been shortly before attacking me in my own studio, and I positioned myself in such a way that I could restrain him immediately if he tried to jump on her.</t5669>
<t5670>Mrs. Harker entered the room with a natural grace that would have immediately earned her respect from any lunatic... since poise and grace are the qualities most respected by the insane.</t5670> <t5671>She approached him, smiling pleasantly, and extended her hand.</t5671>
<t5672>–Good afternoon, Mr. Renfield -he said-.</t5672> <t5673>As you can see, I know you.</t5673> <t5674>Dr. Seward has spoken to me about you.</t5674>
<t5675>The alienated one did not respond immediately, but examined her with a furrowed brow.</t5675>
<t5676>His expression changed, his face reflected astonishment and then doubt; then, to my profound surprise, I heard him say:</t5676>
<t5677>–You are not the woman the doctor wished to marry, are you?</t5677> <t5678>You cannot be, since she is dead.</t5678>
<t5679>Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:</t5679>
<t5680>–Oh, no!</t5680> <t5681>I already have a husband, with whom I have been married since long before I even met Dr. Seward.</t5681> <t5682>I am Mrs. Harker.</t5682>
<t5683>–Then, what are you doing here?</t5683>
<t5684>–My husband and I have come to visit Dr. Seward.</t5684>
<t5685>–Then don't stay.</t5685>
<t5686>–But, why not?</t5686>
<t5687>I thought that such a style of conversation could not be more pleasant for Mrs. Harker than it was for me.</t5687> <t5688>Consequently, I intervened:</t5688>
<t5689>–How do you know that I wanted to get married?</t5689>
<t5690>His response was profoundly disdainful, and he gave it during a pause in which he averted his eyes from Mrs. Harker and fixed his gaze on me, only to immediately return his focus to the lady.</t5690>
<t5691>–What a stupid question!</t5691>
<t5692>"I don't believe that at all, Mr. Renfield," Mrs. Harker said, defending me.</t5692>
<t5693>Renfield then spoke to him with as much courtesy and respect as he had shown disdain towards me just moments before.</t5693>
<t5694>–I am sure you will understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is as beloved and honored as our host, everything related to him becomes interesting in our small community.</t5694> <t5695>Dr. Seward is loved not only by his servants and friends, but also by his patients, who, since many of them have a certain mental imbalance, are in a position to distort certain causes and effects.</t5695> <t5696>Since I myself have been a patient in an asylum for the insane, I cannot help but notice that the mythomaniac tendencies of some of the inmates lead to errors of non causa and ignoratio elenchi.</t5696>
<t5697>I opened my eyes wide at this completely new development.</t5697> <t5698>There was the worst of all my lunatics, the most steadfast in his type that I have encountered in my entire life, speaking of elementary philosophy with the manners of a refined gentleman.</t5698> <t5699>I wondered if it was the presence of Mrs. Harker that had struck some chord in his memory.</t5699> <t5700>If that new phase was spontaneous or due to the unconscious influence of the lady, the lady must possess some strange gift or power.</t5700>
<t5701>We continued talking for a while and, seeing that he apparently reasoned perfectly, he ventured, looking at me questioningly at first, leading him towards his favorite topic of conversation.</t5701> <t5702>I was astonished again to see that Renfield approached the matter with the impartiality characteristic of absolute sanity; he even used himself as an example when mentioning certain things.</t5702>
<t5703>–Well, I myself am an example of a man who has a strange belief.</t5703> <t5704>In fact, it is not strange that my friends were alarmed and insisted that I needed to be controlled.</t5704> <t5705>I used to think that life was a positive and perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of living beings, no matter how low they are on the scale of creation, it is possible to prolong life indefinitely.</t5705> <t5706>Sometimes I believed in it so firmly that I tried to eat human flesh.</t5706> <t5707>The doctor, present here, can confirm that once I tried to kill him in order to strengthen my vital powers, by assimilating his life into my own body through his blood, based, of course, on the biblical phrase: "For the blood is the life."</t5707> <t5708>Although, in reality, the seller of a certain panacea has vulgarized the truism to the point of contempt.</t5708> <t5709>Isn't that true, doctor?</t5709>
<t5710>I nodded absentmindedly, because I was so astonished that I didn't exactly know what to think or say; it was hard to believe that I had seen him eating his flies and spiders less than five minutes ago.</t5710> <t5711>I looked at my wristwatch and saw that it was already time for me to head to the station to wait for van Helsing; consequently, I told Mrs. Harker that it was time for us to leave.</t5711> <t5712>She accompanied me immediately, after kindly telling Mr. Renfield:</t5712>
<t5713>–See you later.</t5713> <t5714>I hope to see you frequently, under somewhat more pleasant circumstances for you.</t5714>
<t5715>To which, to my astonishment, the deranged person replied:</t5715>
<t5716>–Goodbye, dear lady.</t5716> <t5717>I pray to God never to see your sweet face again.</t5717> <t5718>May He bless and keep you!</t5718>
<t5719>When I headed to the station, I left the boys behind.</t5719> <t5720>Poor Arthur seemed more lively than ever since Lucy had fallen ill, and Quincey was much more cheerful than he had been in many days.</t5720>
<t5721>Van Helsing descended from the carriage with the eager agility of a child.</t5721> <t5722>He saw me immediately and rushed to meet me, saying:</t5722>
<t5723>–Hello, my friend John!</t5723> <t5724>How is everything?</t5724> <t5725>Good? Great!</t5725> <t5726>I've been busy, but I've come back to stay here if necessary.</t5726> <t5727>I've taken care of all my affairs and I have a lot to talk about.</t5727> <t5728>Is Mrs. Mina with you? Yes.</t5728> <t5729>And her nice husband too?</t5729> <t5730>And are Arthur and my friend Quincey also at your house?</t5730> <t5731>Great!</t5731>
<t5732>While we were driving in the car towards the house, I brought him up to date on everything that had happened and how my own diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion.</t5732> <t5733>Then, the professor interrupted me:</t5733>
<t5734>–Oh! That wonderful lady Mina!</t5734> <t5735>She has the brain of a man; a very well-endowed man, and the heart of a woman.</t5735> <t5736>God created her with some exalted purpose, believe me, when He made such a good combination.</t5736> <t5737>Friend John, so far good luck has made that woman of great help to us; after tonight she should have nothing to do with this terrible matter.</t5737> <t5738>It is not convenient for her to run such a great danger.</t5738> <t5739>We men, since we have committed to it, are willing to destroy that monster; but there is no place in that plan for a woman.</t5739> <t5740>Even if she does not suffer physical harm, her heart may fail her on many occasions, due to that multitude of horrors; and then she may suffer from insomnia because of her nerves, and when sleeping, due to nightmares.</t5740> <t5741>Besides, she is a young woman and has not been married for long; there may be other things to think about at other times, though not currently.</t5741> <t5742>You have told me that she has written everything; therefore, she will consult with us; but tomorrow she will step away from this work, and we will continue alone.</t5742>
<t5743>I sincerely agreed with him, and then I told him everything we had discovered in his absence and that the house Drácula had acquired was next to mine.</t5743> <t5744>He was very surprised and seemed to fall into deep reflections.</t5744>
<t5745>–Oh! If we had known before! – he exclaimed.</t5745> <t5746>We could have reached in time to save poor Lucy.</t5746> <t5747>However, "there's no use crying over spilled milk," as you say.</t5747> <t5748>We must not think about it, but continue our journey to the end.</t5748>
<t5749>Then, he fell into a silence that lasted until we entered my house.</t5749> <t5750>Before going to get ready for dinner, he said to Mrs. Harker:</t5750>
<t5751>–My friend John has told me, Mrs. Mina, that your husband and you have put in order everything we have been able to obtain up to this moment.</t5751>
<t5752>–Not until this moment -she said impulsively-, but until this morning.</t5752>
<t5753>–But, why not until this moment?</t5753> <t5754>We have seen so far the good results that small details have given.</t5754> <t5755>We have revealed all our secrets and, nevertheless, none of them is going to be the worst of what we still have to learn.</t5755>
<t5756>Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper out of her pocket, said:</t5756>
<t5757>–Doctor van Helsing, do you want to read this and tell me if it is necessary to include it?</t5757> <t5758>It is my report for today.</t5758> <t5759>I have also understood the need to record everything now, no matter how trivial it may seem; but in this, there is very little that is not personal.</t5759> <t5760>Should we include it?</t5760>
<t5761>The professor read the note gravely and handed it back to Mina, saying:</t5761>
<t5762>–It is not necessary for us to include it if you do not wish so; but I beg you to accept doing it.</t5762> <t5763>It will only make your husband love you even more and all of us, your friends, honor, esteem, and love you even more.</t5763>
<t5764>Mrs. Harker took the piece of paper again with another blush and a wide smile.</t5764>
<t5765>And in this way, up to this very moment, all the records we have are complete and in order.</t5765> <t5766>The professor took a copy to examine it after dinner and before our meeting, which has been scheduled for nine o'clock in the evening.</t5766> <t5767>The rest of us have already read everything; thus, when we gather in the study, we will be well informed of all the facts and can prepare our battle plan against that terrible and mysterious enemy.</t5767>
<t5768>From the journal of Mina Harker</t5768>
<t5769>September 30.</t5769> <t5770>When we gathered in Dr. Seward's study, two hours after dinner, which took place at six in the evening, we unconsciously formed a sort of board or committee.</t5770> <t5771>Professor Van Helsing took his place at the head of the table, in the spot indicated by Dr. Seward as soon as he entered the room.</t5771> <t5772>He had me sit immediately to his right and asked me to act as secretary: Jonathan sat next to me, and across from us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris.</t5772> <t5773>Lord Godalming was next to the professor and Dr. Seward in the center.</t5773> <t5774>The professor said:</t5774>
<t5775>I think I can take it for granted that we are all aware of the facts contained in those documents.</t5775>
<t5776>We all nodded, and the doctor continued:</t5776>
<t5777>–So, I think it would be appropriate for me to tell you something about the type of enemy we are going to have to face.</t5777> <t5778>Therefore, I am going to reveal to you part of the history of that man, which I have been able to come to know.</t5778> <t5779>Afterwards, we can discuss our method of action, and we can agree on all the necessary arrangements together.</t5779>
<t5780>"There are beings called vampires; all of us have proof of their existence.</t5780> <t5781>Even if we did not have our unfortunate experiences, the teachings and records of antiquity provide sufficient evidence for sane people.</t5781> <t5782>I admit that, at first, I myself was skeptical about it.</t5782> <t5783>If I had not prepared for many years to keep my mind clear, I would not have been able to believe it until the facts showed me it was true, with reliable and irrefutable evidence.</t5783> <t5784>If, alas, I had known before what I know now and even what I guess, we might have been able to save a life that was so precious to all of us who loved her.</t5784> <t5785>But that is beyond remedy now, and we must continue working so that other poor souls do not perish, as long as we can save them.</t5785> <t5786>The nosferatu does not die like bees when they have stung, leaving their stinger.</t5786> <t5787>He is much stronger and, because of that, has much more power to do evil.</t5787> <t5788>That vampire among us is as strong personally as twenty men; he has a sharper intelligence than mortals, as it has grown over time; he still has the help of necromancy, which, as its etymology implies, is divination by death, and all the dead who die because of him are at his command; he is rough and more than rough; he can, without limitations, appear and disappear at will when and where he wishes and in any of the forms that are his own; he can, within his limits, command the elements; the storm, the mist, the thunder; he can give orders to harmful animals, to rats, owls, and bats...</t5788> <t5789>To moths, foxes, and wolves; he can grow and shrink in size; and he can sometimes make himself invisible.</t5789> <t5790>So, how are we going to carry out our attack to destroy him?</t5790> <t5791>How can we find the place where he hides and, after finding it, destroy him?</t5791> <t5792>My friends, it is a great task.</t5792> <t5793>We are going to undertake a terrible task, and there may be enough to make the brave tremble.</t5793> <t5794>Because if we fail in our struggle, he will necessarily have to defeat us and, where will we end up in that case?</t5794> <t5795>Life is nothing; I do not give it importance.</t5795> <t5796>But, failing in this case does not mean only life or death.</t5796> <t5797>It is that we would become like him; that henceforth we would be nefarious beings of the night, like him...</t5797> <t5798>Beings without heart or conscience, who dedicate themselves to the plunder of the bodies and souls of those they love most.</t5798> <t5799>For us, the gates of heaven will remain closed forever, because, who can open them for us?</t5799> <t5800>We will continue to exist, despised by all, as a stain before the splendor of God; like an arrow in the side of the one who died for us.</t5800> <t5801>But, we are face to face with duty and, in that case, can we retreat?</t5801> <t5802>As for me, I say no; but I am old, and life, with its brightness, its pleasant places, the singing of birds, its music and its love, is far behind.</t5802> <t5803>All the others are young.</t5803> <t5804>Some of you have known pain, but very happy days still await you.</t5804> <t5805>What do you say?"</t5805>
<t5806>While the professor was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand.</t5806> <t5807>I feared that the terrible nature of the danger was overwhelming him, when I saw that he extended his hand to me; but feeling his touch gave me life... so strong, so sure, with such resolve...</t5807> <t5808>The hand of a brave man can speak for itself; it doesn't even need to be a woman in love who listens to its music.</t5808>
<t5809>When the professor stopped talking, my husband looked me in the eyes and I looked at him; we didn't need to speak to understand each other.</t5809>
<t5810>–I speak for Mina and myself -he said.</t5810>
<t5811>"Count on me, professor," said Quincey Morris laconically, as usual.</t5811>
<t5812>–I am with you -said Lord Godalming-, for the love of Lucy, and for no other reason.</t5812>
<t5813>Dr. Seward merely nodded.</t5813> <t5814>The professor stood up and, after placing his gold crucifix on the table, extended his hands to both sides.</t5814> <t5815>I took his right hand and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan took my right hand with his left and extended his right to Mr. Morris.</t5815> <t5816>Thus, when we all held hands, our solemn promise was made.</t5816> <t5817>I felt a deadly coldness in my heart, but not for a moment did I think of retracting.</t5817> <t5818>We returned to our respective seats and Dr. Van Helsing continued speaking, with a satisfaction that clearly showed he had begun the work in earnest.</t5818> <t5819>It was necessary to take it with the same gravity and seriousness as any other important matter in life.</t5819>
<t5820>–Well, you already know what we will have to face; but we are not without strength either.</t5820> <t5821>We have, on our side, the power to unite...</t5821> <t5822>A power that is denied to the vampires; we have scientific resources; we are free to act and think, and both the daytime and nighttime hours belong to us.</t5822> <t5823>Indeed, as our powers are extensive, they are also overwhelming, and we are free to use them.</t5823> <t5824>We have a true devotion to a cause and a goal to achieve that is not selfish at all.</t5824> <t5825>That is already a lot.</t5825>
<t5826>"Now, let's see how limited the powers we are going to face are and how the individual is limited.</t5826> <t5827>Indeed, we are going to examine the limitations of vampires in general and of this one in particular.</t5827>
<t5828>"All we have as points of reference are traditions and superstitions.</t5828> <t5829>These foundations do not seem, at first, to be very important when life and death are at stake.</t5829> <t5830>We have no way to control other means, and secondly, because, after all, these things, tradition and superstitions, are something.</t5830> <t5831>Isn't it true that others maintain the belief in vampires, even if we do not?</t5831> <t5832>A year ago, who among us would have accepted such a possibility, in the midst of our nineteenth century, scientific, skeptical, and realistic?</t5832> <t5833>We even refused to accept a belief that seemed justified before our very eyes.</t5833> <t5834>Let us then accept that the vampire and the belief in its limitations and the remedy against it rest for the moment on the same basis.</t5834> <t5835>For let me tell you that it has been known in all places inhabited by men.</t5835> <t5836>In ancient Greece, in ancient Rome; it existed in Germany, in France, in India, even in the Chersonese; and in China, which is so far from us in every respect, it still exists, and people fear them even to this day.</t5836> <t5837>It has followed the trail of the Icelandic navigators, the accursed Huns, the Slavs, the Saxons, and the Magyars.</t5837> <t5838>So far, we have everything we might need to act; and let me tell you that many of the beliefs have been justified by what we have seen in our own unfortunate experience.</t5838> <t5839>The vampire continues to live and cannot die simply because of the passage of time; it can grow stronger when it has the opportunity to feed on the blood of living beings.</t5839> <t5840>Even more: we have seen among us that it can even rejuvenate; that its vital faculties become more powerful and seem to refresh when it has a sufficient supply of human blood.</t5840> <t5841>But it cannot thrive without that regimen; it does not eat like others.</t5841> <t5842>Not even our friend Jonathan, who lived with it for several weeks, ever saw it eat.</t5842> <t5843>It casts no shadow, nor is it reflected in mirrors, as Jonathan also observed.</t5843> <t5844>It has the strength of many in its hands, as Jonathan also testified, when it closed the door against the wolves and when it helped him down from the coach.</t5844> <t5845>It can transform into a wolf, as we know from its arrival in Whitby and from our friend John, who saw it fly out of the neighboring house, and from my friend Quincey who saw it at Miss Lucy's window.</t5845> <t5846>It can appear in the midst of a mist that it itself produces, as attested by the noble captain of the ship, who tested it; but, as far as we know, the distance to which it can extend that mist is limited and can only be found around it.</t5846> <t5847>It arrives in the moonlight rays like cosmic dust…</t5847> <t5848>As Jonathan again saw those sisters at Dracula's castle.</t5848> <t5849>It becomes so small…</t5849> <t5850>We ourselves saw Miss Lucy, before she regained peace, enter through a crack the size of a hair in the door of her tomb.</t5850> <t5851>Once it has found the way, it can exit or enter any place, no matter how hermetically sealed, or even joined by fire…, welded, we might say.</t5851> <t5852>It can see in the dark…, which is no small power in a world that is always half-submerged in darkness.</t5852> <t5853>But, listen to me well: it can do all these things, though it is not free.</t5853> <t5854>No, it is even more a prisoner than the slave in the galleys or the madman in his cell.</t5854> <t5855>It cannot go wherever it wants.</t5855> <t5856>Although it does not belong to nature, it must nevertheless obey some of the natural laws…</t5856> <t5857>We do not know why.</t5857> <t5858>It cannot enter any place at first, unless there is some inhabitant of the house who lets it in; although afterwards it can enter whenever and however it wants.</t5858> <t5859>Its powers cease, like those of all evil things, upon the arrival of day.</t5859>
<t5860>“Only on some occasions can he enjoy a certain margin of freedom.</t5860> <t5861>If he is not exactly in the right place, he can only move at noon or at the precise moment of sunset or sunrise.</t5861> <t5862>These are things we have known, and which we have proven in our records by inference.</t5862> <t5863>Thus, while he can do as he pleases within his limits, when he is in the place that belongs to him, on land, in his coffin or in hell, in a profane place, as we saw when he went to the suicide’s grave in Whitby; in other places, he can only move when the opportune moment arrives.</t5863> <t5864>It is also said that he can only cross running waters at the ebb of the tide.</t5864> <t5865>Furthermore, there are things that affect him in such a way that he loses his power, like garlic, which we already know, and sacred things, like this symbol, my crucifix, which was among us even now, when we made our resolution; for him all these things are nothing; but he keeps his distance and remains silent, with respect.</t5865> <t5866>There are other things as well, which I will tell you about, in case we need them in our investigation.</t5866> <t5867>The branch of wild rose placed over his coffin prevents him from leaving it; a consecrated bullet shot into his coffin kills him, so that he is truly dead; as for driving a wooden stake through him or cutting off his head, that makes him rest forever.</t5867> <t5868>We have seen it with our own eyes.</t5868>
<t5869>"Thus, when we find the place where that man from the past resides, we can make him remain in his coffin and destroy him, if we use all our knowledge on the matter.</t5869> <t5870>But he is intelligent.</t5870> <t5871>I asked my friend Arminius, from the University of Budapest, to give me information to establish his profile and, by all means at his disposal, he communicated what he knew to me.</t5871> <t5872>In fact, it must be the Voivode of Dracula who earned his nobility fighting against the Turks, over the great river that lies on the very border of Turkish lands.</t5872> <t5873>If so, then he was not an ordinary man; because in that time and for several centuries afterward, he was spoken of as the most intelligent and wise, as well as the bravest of the sons of the "land beyond the forests."</t5873> <t5874>That powerful brain and that iron resolution accompanied him to the grave and now confront us.</t5874> <t5875>The Draculas were, according to Arminius, a great and noble family; although, from time to time, there were offspring who, according to their contemporaries, had dealings with the evil one.</t5875> <t5876>They learned their secrets at the Scholomance, among the mountains above Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claimed the tenth student as his own.</t5876> <t5877>In the records, there are words like..., sorcerer, and... Satan and hell; and in a manuscript, this very Dracula is spoken of as a "wampyr," which we all understand perfectly.</t5877> <t5878>From that family emerged many great men and women, and their graves consecrated the land where only this evil being can dwell.</t5878> <t5879>For it is not the least of his horrors that this evil being is rooted in all good things, but that he cannot rest in soil that has holy relics.</t5879><t5880>"</t5880>
<t5881>While the teacher was speaking, Mr. Morris was staring intently at the window and, quietly standing up, left the room.</t5881> <t5882>There was a brief pause and the teacher continued:</t5882>
<t5883>–Now we must decide what we are going to do.</t5883> <t5884>We have many data at our disposal and we must make the necessary plans for our campaign.</t5884> <t5885>We know from the research carried out by Jonathan that fifty boxes of earth were sent from the castle to Whitby, and that all of them must have been delivered to Carfax; we also know that at least a few of those boxes have been removed.</t5885> <t5886>It seems to me that our first step should be to find out if the rest of those boxes still remain in the house beyond the wall we observed today, or if others have been removed.</t5886> <t5887>If so, we must follow them…</t5887>
<t5888>At that point, we were interrupted in an astonishing way.</t5888> <t5889>Outside the house, the sound of a gunshot rang out; the window glass was shattered by a bullet that, deflected off the edge of the frame, crashed into the opposite side of the room.</t5889> <t5890>I fear that I am at heart a coward, for I shuddered deeply.</t5890> <t5891>All the men stood up; Lord Godalming rushed to the window and opened it.</t5891> <t5892>As he did so, we heard Mr. Morris say:</t5892>
<t5893>–I'm sorry!</t5893> <t5894>I think I have alarmed you.</t5894> <t5895>I will come up and explain everything related to my act.</t5895>
<t5896>One minute later, he entered the room and said:</t5896>
<t5897>–It was foolish of me, and I sincerely apologize, Mrs. Harker.</t5897> <t5898>I believe I must have frightened you quite a bit.</t5898> <t5899>But the fact is that while the professor was talking, a large bat landed on the window ledge.</t5899> <t5900>I have such a great horror of those dreadful creatures since the recent events that I can't stand them, and I went out to shoot it, as I have been doing every night whenever I see one.</t5900> <t5901>You used to laugh at me for it, Art.</t5901>
<t5902>–Did it hurt him? – asked Dr. van Helsing.</t5902>
<t5903>–I don't know, but I think not, since it flew away towards the forest.</t5903>
<t5904>Without adding more, he returned to his seat, and the professor resumed his statements:</t5904>
<t5905>–We must find each and every one of those boxes, and when we are ready, we must capture or eliminate that monster or, so to speak, we must sterilize that land, so that it can no longer seek refuge there.</t5905> <t5906>Thus, at last, we will be able to find it in its human form, between noon and sunset, and attack it when it is at its weakest.</t5906>
<t5907>"Now, as for you, Mrs. Mina, tonight is the end, until everything goes well.</t5907> <t5908>You are too precious to us to take such risks.</t5908> <t5909>When we part tonight, you must no longer ask us questions.</t5909> <t5910>We will explain everything to you in due time.</t5910> <t5911>We are men, and we are in a position to endure it, but you must be our star and hope, and we will act with greater freedom if you are not in danger, like us.</t5911><t5912>"</t5912>
<t5913>All the men, including Jonathan, seemed to feel relieved, but it didn't seem right to me that they had to face danger and perhaps reduce their safety, being strength the best security... just because they had to take care of me; but they were determined, and although it was a hard pill for me to swallow, I couldn't say anything.</t5913> <t5914>I limited myself to accepting that quixotic care of my person.</t5914>
<t5915>Mr. Morris summarized the discussion:</t5915>
<t5916>–Since there is no time to lose, I propose we take a look at that house right now.</t5916> <t5917>Time is important, and quick action on our part could save another victim.</t5917>
<t5918>I felt my heart failing me when I saw that the moment to take action was approaching, but I said nothing because I was afraid that if I seemed to be a hindrance or a burden to their work, they might even exclude me from their counsel.</t5918> <t5919>Now they have gone to Carfax, which means they are going to enter the house.</t5919>
<t5920>In a very manly manner, I have been told to lie down and sleep, as if a woman could sleep when the people she loves are in danger.</t5920>
<t5921>I have to lie down and pretend to sleep, so that Jonathan doesn't feel more anxiety about me when he returns.</t5921>
<t5922>From the journal of Dr. Seward</t5922>
<t5923>October 1st, at four in the morning.</t5923> <t5924>At the moment we were about to leave the house, I received a message from Renfield, begging me to see him immediately, as he had something of the utmost importance to communicate to me.</t5924> <t5925>I told the messenger to inform him that I would fulfill his wishes in the morning; that I was busy at the moment.</t5925> <t5926>The nurse added:</t5926>
<t5927>–You seem very uneasy, sir.</t5927> <t5928>I've never seen you so anxious.</t5928> <t5929>I think that if you don't go to see him soon, he might have one of his violent outbursts.</t5929>
<t5930>I knew that the nurse wouldn't tell me that without having a justified cause for it, and therefore, I said to him:</t5930>
<t5931>–Very well, I will go see him right now.</t5931>
<t5932>And I asked the others to wait for me a few minutes, since I had to go visit my "patient".</t5932>
<t5933>–Take me with you, friend John -said the professor-.</t5933> <t5934>Your case, which is in your diary, interests me a lot and has also occasionally been related to our case.</t5934> <t5935>I would very much like to see it, especially when your mind is in a bad state.</t5935>
<t5936>–May I accompany you as well? – asked Lord Godalming.</t5936>
<t5937>–Me too? – inquired Mr. Morris.</t5937> <t5938>Can I join you?</t5938>
<t5939>–Can I go with you? – Harker wanted to know.</t5939>
<t5940>I nodded, and we all moved forward together down the hallway.</t5940>
<t5941>We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but much more reasonable in his way of speaking and his manners than I had ever seen him before.</t5941> <t5942>He had an unusual understanding of himself, which went beyond anything I had encountered so far in lunatics, and he took it for granted that his reasoning would prevail with other sane people.</t5942> <t5943>The five of us entered the room, but, at first, none of the others said anything.</t5943> <t5944>His request was to be let out of the asylum immediately and to be sent home.</t5944> <t5945>He supported his plea with arguments related to his complete recovery, and cited his own sanity at that moment as an example.</t5945>
<t5946>–I make an appeal to your friends -he said-.</t5946> <t5947>It is possible that they would not mind sitting down to examine my case.</t5947> <t5948>By the way, you have not introduced me to them.</t5948>
<t5949>I was so astonished that the act of introducing other people to a madman confined in an asylum did not seem strange to me at that moment.</t5949> <t5950>Moreover, there was a certain dignity in the man's manners, which revealed such a habit of considering himself as an equal, that I made the introductions immediately.</t5950>
<t5951>–Lord Godalming, Professor Van Helsing, Mr. Quincey Morris from Texas, Mr. Jonathan Harker, and Mr. Renfield.</t5951>
<t5952>He shook hands with all of them, saying as he did so:</t5952>
<t5953>–Lord Godalming, I had the honor of serving under your father in the Windham; I am sorry to know, by the fact that you hold the title, that he is no longer with us.</t5953> <t5954>He was a man loved and respected by all who knew him, and I have heard it said that in his youth he was the inventor of the rum punch that is so appreciated on Derby night.</t5954>
<t5955>“Mr. Morris, you must be proud of your great state.</t5955> <t5956>Your reception into the Union can be a far-reaching event that may have repercussions in the future, when the Poles and the Tropics can form an alliance with the Stars and Stripes.</t5956> <t5957>The power of the Treaty may still become an engine of expansion, when the Monroe Doctrine takes its rightful place as a political fable.</t5957> <t5958>What can any man say about the pleasure he feels upon meeting van Helsing?</t5958> <t5959>Sir, I do not apologize for abandoning all forms of traditional prejudice.</t5959> <t5960>When an individual has revolutionized therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of cerebral matter, traditional forms are not appropriate, as they would give the impression of limiting him to a specific class.</t5960> <t5961>To you, gentlemen, who by nationality, heritage, or natural gifts, are destined to occupy your respective places in the moving world, I take you as witnesses that I am as sane as, at least, the majority of men who are in full possession of their freedom.</t5961> <t5962>And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanist and forensic physician, as well as scientist, will consider it a moral duty to treat me as someone who must be considered under exceptional circumstances.</t5962><t5963>”</t5963>
<t5964>He made this final plea with an air of conviction that did not lack its own charm.</t5964>
<t5965>I think we were all astonished.</t5965> <t5966>For my part, I was convinced, despite knowing the man's character and history, that he had regained his sanity, and I felt compelled to tell him that I was satisfied regarding his sanity and that I would do everything necessary to release him from the asylum the next day.</t5966> <t5967>However, I thought it preferable to wait before making such a serious statement, since I had long been aware of the sudden changes that this particular patient experienced.</t5967>
<t5968>Thus, I contented myself with making a statement to the effect that he seemed to be healing very quickly; that I would have a long conversation with him in the morning, and that I would then decide what could be done to satisfy his wishes.</t5968> <t5969>That did not satisfy him at all, as he hastened to say:</t5969>
<t5970>–But, I fear, Dr. Seward, that you have not understood what my desire is.</t5970> <t5971>I wish to leave now… Immediately…, at this very moment…, without waiting another minute, if possible.</t5971> <t5972>Time is pressing, and in our implicit agreement with the old Scythian, that is the essence of the contract.</t5972> <t5973>I am sure that it is enough to communicate to such an admirable doctor as Dr. Seward a desire so simple yet so impulsive, to ensure that it is fulfilled.</t5973>
<t5974>He looked at me intelligently and, seeing the refusal on my face, turned to the others and examined them closely.</t5974> <t5975>Not finding a sufficiently favorable reaction, he continued saying:</t5975>
<t5976>–Is it possible that I was mistaken in my assumption?</t5976>
<t5977>–That's right, I told him frankly, but at the same time, as I immediately realized, with brutality.</t5977>
<t5978>There was a rather long pause, and then he said slowly:</t5978>
<t5979>–Then, I suppose I will have to change only the way I have formulated my request.</t5979> <t5980>Let me beg you for that concession..., gift, privilege, whatever you want to call it.</t5980> <t5981>In such a case, I am happy to implore, not for personal reasons, but for the love of others.</t5981> <t5982>I am not at liberty to provide you with all my reasons, but you can, I assure you, take my word that they are good, sound, and unselfish, and that they stem from a high sense of duty.</t5982> <t5983>If you could look into my heart, sir, you would wholeheartedly approve of the feelings that motivate me.</t5983> <t5984>Furthermore, you would count me among your best and most sincere friends.</t5984>
<t5985>He looked at us anxiously again.</t5985> <t5986>I was increasingly convinced that his sudden change in intellectual method was merely another form or phase of his madness and, therefore, I decided to let him talk a little more, knowing from experience that, in the end, like all lunatics, he would reveal himself.</t5986>
<t5987>Van Helsing was observing him with a look of extraordinary intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost touching each other due to the fixed concentration of his gaze.</t5987> <t5988>He spoke to Renfield in a tone that did not surprise me at the moment, but did when I thought about it later... since it was that of someone addressing an equal:</t5988>
<t5989>–Can you not frankly tell us what your reasons are for wanting to leave the asylum tonight?</t5989> <t5990>I am sure that if you wish to satisfy even me, who am an unprejudiced foreigner and accustomed to accepting all kinds of ideas, Dr. Seward will grant you, under his responsibility, the privilege you desire.</t5990>
<t5991>Renfield shook his head sadly and with an expression of immense feeling.</t5991> <t5992>The professor continued saying:</t5992>
<t5993>–Come on, my good sir, think it over carefully.</t5993> <t5994>You claim to enjoy the privilege of reason in its highest degree, since you try to impress us with your capacity for reasoning.</t5994> <t5995>You are doing something whose sanity we have the right to doubt, because you have not yet been discharged from medical treatment due to a mental defect precisely.</t5995> <t5996>If you do not help us choose the most reasonable option, how do you expect us to carry out the duties you yourself have assigned to us?</t5996> <t5997>It would be convenient for you to help us, and if we can, we will help you so that your wishes are fulfilled.</t5997>
<t5998>Renfield shook his head again and said:</t5998>
<t5999>–Doctor van Helsing, I have nothing to say.</t5999> <t6000>Your argument is complete, and if I had the freedom to speak, I would not hesitate for a single moment to do so, but it is not for me to decide in this matter.</t6000> <t6001>The only thing I can do is ask you to trust me.</t6001> <t6002>If you deny me that trust, the responsibility will not be mine.</t6002>
<t6003>I thought it was time to put an end to that scene, which was becoming too comically serious.</t6003> <t6004>Consequently, I headed towards the door, while saying:</t6004>
<t6005>–Let's go, my friends.</t6005> <t6006>We have many things to do.</t6006> <t6007>Good night!</t6007>
<t6008>However, when I approached the door, a new change occurred in the patient.</t6008> <t6009>He came towards me so quickly that, for a moment, I feared he was about to carry out another homicidal attack.</t6009> <t6010>However, my fears were unfounded, as he extended both hands in a pleading manner and made his request in an emotional tone.</t6010> <t6011>Seeing that the very excess of his emotion worked against him, making us revert to our old ideas, he became even more demonstrative.</t6011>
<t6012>I looked at Van Helsing and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; consequently, I became even more convinced of the correctness of my attitude and made a gesture that clearly meant his efforts were in vain.</t6012> <t6013>I had previously seen part of the same emotion that was constantly growing when he directed some request at me that, at those moments, meant a lot to him, such as, for example, when he wanted a cat; and I expected to witness the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion.</t6013> <t6014>What I expected did not happen, since, when he realized that his plea was in vain, he became quite frantic.</t6014> <t6015>He dropped to his knees and raised his hands together, remaining in that posture, in painful supplication, and repeated his plea insistently, while tears rolled down his cheeks, and both his face and body expressed intense emotion.</t6015>
<t6016>–Allow me to beg you, Dr. Seward; let me implore you to let me leave this house immediately.</t6016> <t6017>Command me as you wish and wherever you wish; send guards with me, with whips and chains; let them take me in a straitjacket, handcuffed and with my legs shackled, even to jail, but let me leave here.</t6017> <t6018>You do not know what you are doing by keeping me here.</t6018> <t6019>I am speaking to you from the bottom of my heart... with all my soul.</t6019> <t6020>You do not know whom you are harming, nor how, and I cannot tell you.</t6020> <t6021>Woe is me!</t6021> <t6022>I cannot say it.</t6022> <t6023>For all that is sacred to you, for all that is dear to you; for your lost love, for your hope that she lives, for the love of the Almighty, take me out of here and prevent my soul from feeling guilty.</t6023> <t6024>Do you not hear me, doctor?</t6024> <t6025>Do you not understand that I am sane, and that I am telling you the truth now, that I am not a lunatic in a moment of madness, but a sane man fighting for the salvation of his soul?</t6025> <t6026>Oh, listen to me!</t6026> <t6027>Let me leave here! Let me! Let me!</t6027>
<t6028>I thought that the longer it all lasted, the angrier he would become and that, thus, he would have another fit of madness.</t6028> <t6029>Therefore, I took him by the hand and made him get up.</t6029>
<t6030>–Let's go, I told him firmly.</t6030> <t6031>Do not continue that scene; we have witnessed it enough already.</t6031> <t6032>Go to your bed and try to behave more discreetly!</t6032>
<t6033>Suddenly, he fell silent and stared at me intently for a moment.</t6033> <t6034>Then, without uttering a single word, he turned and sat on the edge of the bed.</t6034> <t6035>The collapse had occurred, as on previous occasions, just as I had expected.</t6035>
<t6036>When I was about to leave the room, the last of the group, he said to me in a calm and well-controlled voice:</t6036>
<t6037>I hope, Dr. Seward, considering what may happen later, that I have done everything possible to convince you tonight.</t6037>
<t6038>XIX.–</t6038> <t6039>FROM THE JOURNAL OF JONATHAN HARKER</t6039>
<t6040>October 1st, at five in the morning.</t6040> <t6041>I left with the group to carry out the investigation with a calm mind, because I believe I had never seen Mina so firm and so well.</t6041> <t6042>I am very glad that she agreed to step aside and let us men take charge of the work.</t6042> <t6043>In a way, it was like a nightmare for me that she was involved in such a terrible matter, but now that her work is done and it is due to her energy and intelligence, as well as her foresight, that the whole story has been gathered, in such a way that every detail has meaning, she can rightfully feel that she has already done her part and that, from now on, she can let us take care of the rest.</t6043> <t6044>I think we were all a bit upset by the scene that had taken place with Mr. Renfield.</t6044> <t6045>When we left his room, we all kept silent until we returned to the study.</t6045> <t6046>Once there, Mr. Morris said, addressing Dr. Seward:</t6046>
<t6047>–Tell me, Jack, if that man wasn't acting out a scene to deceive us, I think he's the sanest lunatic I've ever met.</t6047> <t6048>I'm not sure, but I think he had some serious purpose, and in that case, it's very cruel that he wasn't given a single chance.</t6048>
<t6049>Lord Godalming and I remained silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:</t6049>
<t6050>–Friend John, you know more lunatics than I do, and I'm glad about it, because I fear that if it were up to me to decide, I would have set him free before that attack of neurosis occurred.</t6050> <t6051>But we live and learn, and at the present moment, we must not take unnecessary risks, as my friend Quincey would say.</t6051> <t6052>Everyone is better off as they are.</t6052>
<t6053>Dr. Seward seemed to respond to both of them in a concerned manner:</t6053>
<t6054>The only thing I know is that I agree with you.</t6054> <t6055>If that man had been an ordinary lunatic, I would have risked trusting him, but he seems to be so strangely connected to the count that I am afraid of doing something improper by satisfying his desires.</t6055> <t6056>I cannot forget how he almost begged with the same fervor because he wanted a cat, and how afterwards he tried to tear my throat with his teeth.</t6056>
<t6057>Moreover, he called the count "lord and master" and it is possible that he wishes to go out to help him in some diabolical plan.</t6057> <t6058>That horrible thing has wolves, rats, and its kind to help it, so I suppose it is capable of using a poor lunatic.</t6058> <t6059>However, it is true that he seemed sincere.</t6059> <t6060>It is only unfortunate that we have done the best we could in this case.</t6060> <t6061>Those things, along with the hard work that awaits us, are enough to affect a man's nerves.</t6061>
<t6062>The professor stepped forward and, placing a hand on his shoulder, said to him with the usual gravity and kindness:</t6062>
<t6063>–Don't worry, friend John.</t6063> <t6064>We are trying to fulfill our duty in an extremely sad and terrible case; we can only do what seems best to us.</t6064> <t6065>What else can we hope for, except the mercy of the Almighty?</t6065>
<t6066>Lord Godalming had stepped out for a few minutes, but he returned immediately.</t6066> <t6067>He raised a small silver whistle, while observing:</t6067>
<t6068>–It is possible that the old house is full of rats, and in that case, we have an antidote at hand.</t6068>
<t6069>After climbing over the wall, we headed towards the house, being careful to stay within the shadows of the trees cast on the lawn as the moon rose.</t6069> <t6070>When we reached the porch, the professor opened his briefcase and took out a bunch of objects, which he placed on one of the steps, arranging them into four groups, evidently one for each of us.</t6070> <t6071>Then he said:</t6071>
<t6072>–My friends, we are going to take a tremendous risk, and we must arm ourselves in various ways.</t6072> <t6073>Our enemy is not only a spiritual one.</t6073> <t6074>Remember that he has the strength of twenty men and that, although our necks or our respiratory systems are of the common type, meaning they can be broken or crushed, his cannot be overcome simply by force.</t6074> <t6075>A stronger man, or a group of men who, together, are stronger than he is, can sometimes restrain him, but they cannot hurt him, as we can be hurt by him.</t6075> <t6076>Therefore, we must be careful that he does not touch us.</t6076> <t6077>Keep this close to your hearts.</t6077>
<t6078>As he spoke, he lifted a small silver crucifix and handed it to me, as I was the one closest to him.</t6078>
<t6079>–Put these flowers around your neck.</t6079>
<t6080>When saying that, he handed me a necklace made of garlic heads.</t6080>
<t6081>–For other more earthly enemies, this revolver and this dagger, and to help everyone, these small electric lanterns, which you can attach to your chest, and above all and beyond all, finally, this, which we must not use unless necessary.</t6081>
<t6082>It was a piece of the Sacred Host, which he put in an envelope and handed to me.</t6082> <t6083>All the others were provided for in a similar manner.</t6083>
<t6084>–Now -he said-, my friend John, where are the master keys?</t6084> <t6085>If we manage to open the door, we won't need to enter the house through the window, as we did before at Miss Lucy's.</t6085>
<t6086>Dr. Seward tried a couple of master keys, with the manual dexterity of a surgeon, which gave him great advantages in performing that task.</t6086> <t6087>Finally, he found one that fit and, after several advances and retreats, the latch gave way and, with a creak, it withdrew.</t6087> <t6088>We pushed the door; the rusty hinges creaked and it opened.</t6088>
<t6089>It was something astonishingly similar to the image I had formed of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb, just as I had read in Dr. Seward's diary; I believe the same idea occurred to everyone else, as they all stepped back as if by common agreement.</t6089> <t6090>The professor was the first to advance and head towards the open door.</t6090>
<t6091>"Into your hands, Lord!" he said, crossing himself, as he crossed the threshold of the door.</t6091>
<t6092>We closed the door behind us to prevent the glow from attracting anyone who might see it from the street when we turned on the lamps.</t6092> <t6093>The professor carefully pressed the latch, in case we were not in a position to open it quickly if we had to leave the house in a hurry.</t6093>
<t6094>Then, we all lit our lamps and began our investigation.</t6094>
<t6095>The light from the tiny lamps fell on all sorts of strange shapes, when the rays crossed each other or our opaque bodies cast enormous shadows.</t6095> <t6096>The feeling that there was someone else among us did not leave me.</t6096> <t6097>I suppose it was the memory, so powerfully suggested by the eerie atmosphere, of the dreadful experience I had in Transylvania.</t6097> <t6098>I believe we all had the same feeling, as I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders whenever there was a slight noise or a new shadow was cast, just as I did.</t6098>
<t6099>The whole place was covered by a thick layer of dust.</t6099> <t6100>On the floor, that layer was several centimeters deep, except in the places where recent footprints could be seen, in which, lowering the lamp, I could see marks of tacks.</t6100> <t6101>The walls were moldy and covered with dust, and in the corners, there were thick cobwebs, upon which dust had accumulated, so much so that they hung like torn rags in the places where they had broken due to the weight they had to bear.</t6101> <t6102>On a table in the hall, there was a large bunch of keys, each of which had a yellowish tag due to the action of time.</t6102> <t6103>They had been used several times, as there were several marks in the dust similar to the one left when the professor lifted the keys.</t6103> <t6104>Van Helsing turned to me and said:</t6104>
<t6105>–You know this place, Jonathan.</t6105> <t6106>You have copied plans of it, and you know it at least better than all of us.</t6106> <t6107>Which way is it to the chapel?</t6107>
<t6108>I had an idea of where it was located, although during my last visit I had not managed to enter it; therefore, I guided them and, after a few wrong turns, I found myself in front of a low door, which formed an arch of oak wood, crossed by iron bars.</t6108>
<t6109>–This is the place -said the professor, while he let the small light of his lamp rest on a map of the house, copied from my files on the correspondence regarding the acquisition of the house.</t6109> <t6110>With some difficulty, we found the corresponding key in the bunch and opened the door.</t6110> <t6111>We were prepared for something unpleasant, as while opening the door, a faint and foul-smelling air seemed to emanate from the cracks, but none of us expected to encounter a smell like the one that reached us.</t6111> <t6112>None of the others had found the count in their vicinity, and when I had seen him, he was either in his rapid existence in the rooms or, when he was full of fresh blood, in a ruined building, open to the sky, where fresh air could penetrate; but here, the place was small and enclosed, and the long time it had remained undiscovered made the air stagnant and smell rotten.</t6112>
<t6113>There was a smell of earth, like that of some dry miasma, that stood out from the stale air.</t6113> <t6114>But, as for the smell itself, how could one describe it?</t6114> <t6115>It wasn't just that it was composed of all the evils of mortality and the acrid, penetrating smell of blood, but it gave the impression that corruption itself had rotted.</t6115> <t6116>Oh!</t6116> <t6117>I feel sick just remembering it.</t6117> <t6118>Every time that monster had breathed, its breath seemed to have stagnated in that place, intensifying its repugnance.</t6118>
<t6119>Under ordinary circumstances, such a smell would have put an end to our endeavor, but this was no ordinary case, and the lofty and terrible task we were engaged in gave us strength that overcame physical considerations.</t6119> <t6120>After the first involuntary shudder, a direct consequence of the initial gust of nauseating air, we all set to work as if that repugnant place were a true garden of roses.</t6120>
<t6121>We carefully examined the place, and the professor said, as he began:</t6121>
<t6122>–First of all, we need to see how many boxes are left; next, we should examine all the corners, holes, and crevices to see if we can find any indication of what happened to the others.</t6122>
<t6123>A glance was enough to check how many were left, as the large boxes of earth were very bulky, and it was not possible to make a mistake about them.</t6123>
<t6124>Only twenty-nine remained, out of fifty!</t6124> <t6125>At one point, I got quite a scare, as seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look through the entrance door towards the dark passageway beyond, I also looked and, for an instant, it seemed to me that I saw the most notable features of the Count's evil face: the pointed nose, the reddish eyes, the red lips, and the terrible pallor.</t6125> <t6126>That happened only for the space of a second, as Lord Godalming summarized:</t6126>
<t6127>–I thought I had seen a face, but it was just the shadows.</t6127>
<t6128>And he went back to dedicating himself to his research.</t6128> <t6129>I turned my lamp in that direction and headed towards the passageway.</t6129> <t6130>There were no signs of anyone's presence, and since there were no doors, no corners, no openings of any kind, only the solid walls of the passageway, there could be no hiding place, not even for him.</t6130> <t6131>I supposed that fear had fueled the imagination, and I said nothing.</t6131>
<t6132>A few minutes later, I saw Morris suddenly back away from the corner he was examining.</t6132> <t6133>All of us followed his movements with our eyes, because, undoubtedly, a certain nervousness was taking hold of us, and we saw a phosphorescent mass flickering like stars.</t6133> <t6134>Instinctively, we all backed away.</t6134> <t6135>The whole place was becoming populated with rats.</t6135>
<t6136>For a moment we remained motionless, astonished, all except Lord Godalming who, apparently, was prepared for a similar contingency.</t6136>
<t6137>Rushing towards the heavy oak door with iron bands, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, removed the enormous bolts, and flung the door open.</t6137> <t6138>Then, taking a silver whistle from his pocket, he blew it slowly and sharply.</t6138> <t6139>From behind Dr. Seward's house, the barking of several dogs responded, and a minute later, three terriers came running around one of the corners of the house.</t6139> <t6140>Unconsciously, we had all turned towards the door and, in doing so, saw that a lot of dust had been stirred up; the boxes that had been taken out had been taken out through there.</t6140> <t6141>But even in the single minute that had passed, the number of rats had increased greatly.</t6141> <t6142>They seemed to appear in the room all at once, to the point that the light from the lamps, reflecting off their dark, moving bodies and shining on their malevolent eyes, made the whole room seem filled with fireflies.</t6142> <t6143>The dogs appeared quickly, but at the threshold of the door, they suddenly stopped and sniffed; then, simultaneously, they raised their heads and began to howl in an extremely mournful manner.</t6143> <t6144>The rats were multiplying by the thousands, and we left the room.</t6144>
<t6145>Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs and, carrying it inside the room, gently placed it on the floor.</t6145> <t6146>The very moment its paws touched the ground, it seemed to regain its courage and rushed at its natural enemies.</t6146>
<t6147>The rats fled before him with such speed that before he had finished with a considerable number, the other dogs, which had been transported to the center of the room in the same way, had few prey to catch, since the entire mass of rats had vanished.</t6147>
<t6148>With its disappearance, it seemed that something diabolical had ceased to be present, since the dogs began to frolic and bark joyfully, while they rushed upon their prostrate enemies, shook them, and sent them into the air with fierce jerks.</t6148> <t6149>All of us felt emboldened.</t6149> <t6150>Whether it was due to the purification of the atmosphere of death, because we had opened the chapel door, or the relief we felt upon finding ourselves at the opening, I do not know; but the fact is that the shadow of fear seemed to abandon us, as if it were a shroud, and the occasion of our visit to the house lost part of its grim significance, although we did not lose our resolve at all.</t6150> <t6151>We closed the outer door, barred it, and slid the bolts; then, taking the dogs with us, we began to search the house.</t6151> <t6152>We found nothing but large amounts of dust, and everything seemed to have been untouched, except for the trace of my footsteps from my first visit.</t6152> <t6153>The dogs showed no signs of uneasiness at any time, and even when we returned to the chapel, they continued to frolic, as if they were hunting rabbits in the forest on a summer night.</t6153>
<t6154>The glow of dawn was breaking from the east when we went out through the main door.</t6154> <t6155>Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key to the front door from the bunch, carefully closed it, put the key in his pocket, and turned to us.</t6155>
<t6156>–So far -he said-, the night has truly been a success for us.</t6156> <t6157>We have not received any harm, as we might have feared, and moreover, we have been able to ascertain how many boxes are missing.</t6157> <t6158>Above all, I am very glad that this first step we have taken, perhaps the most difficult and dangerous of all, we have been able to carry out without our sweet lady Mina accompanying us, and without the need to disturb her thoughts, all the more so since she would be awake and asleep thinking of visions, noises, and smells that she could never forget.</t6158> <t6159>Likewise, we have learned a lesson, if we can say it particularly: that the beasts that are at the count's orders are not, however, docile to the count's spirit, since those rats would come at his call, just as he called the wolves from the tower of his castle, to come out to meet him and that poor mother.</t6159> <t6160>Although the rats came, they fled a moment later in disorder, at the presence of our friend Arthur's little dogs.</t6160> <t6161>We have other matters, other dangers, and other fears ahead of us; and that monster has not used his powers over the animal world for the last or only time tonight.</t6161> <t6162>Whether he has gone somewhere else... Well!</t6162> <t6163>He has given us the opportunity to give "check" in this chess game we are playing in the name of the good of human souls.</t6163> <t6164>Now, let's go back home.</t6164> <t6165>Dawn is already near, and we have reasons to feel pleased with the work of our first night.</t6165> <t6166>It is possible that we still have many days and nights full of dangers ahead, but we must move forward, without retreating from any risk.</t6166>
<t6167>The house was engulfed in a profound silence when we arrived, except for the screams of some poor creature that was in one of the farthest wings and a low, plaintive sound coming from Renfield's room.</t6167> <t6168>Undoubtedly, the poor man was torturing himself, in the manner of madmen, with unnecessarily painful thoughts.</t6168>
<t6169>I entered my room on tiptoe and found Mina asleep, breathing so softly that I had to strain my ears to catch the sound.</t6169> <t6170>She seemed paler than usual.</t6170> <t6171>I hoped that the meeting that night had not impressed her too much.</t6171> <t6172>I feel truly grateful that she remains out of our future work and even our deliberations.</t6172> <t6173>It is too great a strain for a woman to bear.</t6173> <t6174>I did not think so at first, but now I know much better what to expect.</t6174> <t6175>Therefore, I am glad that this has been resolved.</t6175> <t6176>There may be things that would frighten her if she heard them; however, hiding them from her would be worse than revealing them, if she comes to suspect that there is something we are not telling her.</t6176> <t6177>From this moment on, we must be like closed books to her, at least until we can announce that everything is over and that the land has been freed from that monster of the darkness.</t6177> <t6178>I suppose it will be difficult to keep silent, due to the trust that reigns between us, but I must continue in my resolution and completely silence everything related to our actions during that night, refusing to speak of what has happened.</t6178> <t6179>I lay down on the divan, so as not to disturb her.</t6179>
<t6180>October 1st, later.</t6180> <t6181>I suppose it is natural that we all slept until a late hour, as the day was filled with hard work and the night was heavy and sleepless.</t6181> <t6182>Even Mina must have felt the exhaustion, since, although I slept until the sun was very high, I woke up before her.</t6182> <t6183>In fact, she was so deeply asleep that for a few seconds she didn't even recognize me and looked at me with deep terror, as if she had been awakened in the middle of a terrible nightmare.</t6183> <t6184>She complained a bit about being tired and I let her rest until a later hour in the day.</t6184> <t6185>We now knew that twenty-one boxes had been removed, and in the event that several were taken at once, it was possible that we could find them.</t6185> <t6186>Of course, this would considerably simplify our work and the sooner we resolved this matter, the better it would be.</t6186> <t6187>I had to go see Thomas Snelling.</t6187>
<t6188>From the journal of Dr. Seward</t6188>
<t6189>October 1st.</t6189> <t6190>It was almost noon when I was awakened by the professor, who entered my room.</t6190> <t6191>He was more cheerful and kind than usual, and it was evident that the work from the previous night had helped to lighten some of the weight on his mind.</t6191> <t6192>After talking about the adventure from the previous night, he suddenly said:</t6192>
<t6193>–Your patient interests me a lot.</t6193> <t6194>Is it possible for me to visit him with you this morning?</t6194> <t6195>Or, in case you are very busy, I can go see him alone, if you permit me.</t6195> <t6196>It is a new experience for me to find a lunatic who talks about philosophy and discourses so sensibly.</t6196>
<t6197>I had some urgent work to do and I told him that I would like him to go alone, so that I wouldn't be forced to make him wait.</t6197> <t6198>Therefore, I called one of the assistants and gave him the necessary instructions.</t6198> <t6199>Before my teacher left the room, I advised him not to get a false impression about my patient.</t6199>
<t6200>"I wish you would tell me about yourself and your disappointment regarding your consumption of live animals."</t6200> <t6201>"You told Mrs. Mina, as I saw in her diary yesterday, that you once held those beliefs."</t6201> <t6202>"Why are you smiling, my friend John?"</t6202>
<t6203>–Excuse me -I said-, but the answer is right here.</t6203>
<t6204>I placed my hand on the typewritten pages.</t6204>
<t6205>–When our sane and intelligent lunatic made that statement, his mouth was still full of the flies and spiders he had just eaten, a moment before Mrs. Harker entered his room.</t6205>
<t6206>–Well! – he said.</t6206> <t6207>Your memory is good.</t6207> <t6208>I should have remembered it.</t6208> <t6209>And yet, that very deviation of thought and memory is what makes the study of mental illnesses so fascinating.</t6209> <t6210>It is possible that I may gain more knowledge from the madness of that poor lunatic than I could from the wisest of men.</t6210> <t6211>Who knows?</t6211>
<t6212>I continued my work and, before much time had passed, I had finished the most urgent tasks.</t6212> <t6213>It seemed that not much time had really passed, but van Helsing had already returned to the study.</t6213>
<t6214>–Am I interrupting? – he asked politely, remaining at the doorway.</t6214>
<t6215>–Not at all -I replied-.</t6215> <t6216>Come in.</t6216> <t6217>I've finished my work and I'm free.</t6217> <t6218>I can accompany you, if you wish.</t6218>
<t6219>–It's useless.</t6219> <t6220>I just saw it!</t6220>
<t6221>–And?</t6221>
<t6222>–I'm afraid he doesn't appreciate me much.</t6222> <t6223>Our interview was short.</t6223> <t6224>When I entered his room, he was sitting in a chair in the center, with his elbows resting on his knees and a sullen, grumpy expression on his face.</t6224> <t6225>I spoke to him with all the kindness possible, and with all the respect I could muster.</t6225> <t6226>He did not respond with a single word.</t6226>
<t6227>"-Don't you recognize me? – I inquired.</t6227>
<t6228>"His response was not very reassuring."</t6228>
<t6229>"-I know you perfectly well.</t6229> <t6230>You are the old fool van Helsing.</t6230> <t6231>I wish you would take your stupid psychological theories somewhere else.</t6231> <t6232>Damn all the stupid Dutch people!</t6232>
<t6233>"He did not utter another word and remained seated, wrapped in his discontent and ill-humor, exactly as if I had not been in the room at all; such was his indifference.</t6233> <t6234>Thus, I have lost the opportunity to learn something from that intelligent lunatic; consequently, I must leave to try to console myself by exchanging a few pleasant words with the sweet Mrs. Mina.</t6234> <t6235>Friend John, I am infinitely glad that she no longer has to suffer, nor worry about our terrible affairs.</t6235> <t6236>Although we will miss her help, it is better this way."</t6236>
<t6237>–I absolutely agree with you, I told him sincerely, since I did not want his decision on the matter to weaken.</t6237> <t6238>Mrs. Harker is better off staying out of all this.</t6238> <t6239>The situation is already quite bad for us men, who have sometimes found ourselves in unpleasant places, but it is not a suitable place for a woman, and if she had continued with this matter, it is very possible that she would have ended up being torn apart.</t6239>
<t6240>Thus, Van Helsing went to talk with Mr. and Mrs. Harker.</t6240> <t6241>Quincey and Art have gone out to discover everything possible regarding the disappearance of the boxes.</t6241> <t6242>I have to conclude my round of work, and we will meet tonight.</t6242>
<t6243>From the diary of Mina Harker</t6243>
<t6244>October 1st.</t6244> <t6245>I find it strange to remain in the dark, like today; after Jonathan's total trust for so many years, it is unpleasant to see him openly avoid certain topics of conversation: the most vital topics of all.</t6245> <t6246>This morning I slept until a late hour, due to the fatigue of yesterday, and although Jonathan also slept late, he woke up before me.</t6246> <t6247>He spoke to me before leaving, and never before had he done so with greater sweetness or tenderness, but he did not mention a single word about what had happened during his visit to the count's house.</t6247> <t6248>However, he must know the terrible anxiety I felt.</t6248> <t6249>Poor Jonathan!</t6249> <t6250>I suppose that must have distressed him even more than it did me.</t6250> <t6251>Everyone agreed that I should not continue with that horrible matter, and I agreed.</t6251>
<t6252>But, it is very unpleasant for me to think that he is hiding something from me!</t6252> <t6253>And now I am crying like an idiot, when, in reality, I know that all of this is a product of my husband's great love and the goodwill of all those strong men.</t6253>
<t6254>That has done me good.</t6254> <t6255>Well, someday Jonathan will tell me everything, and to avoid him thinking that I am also hiding something from him, I continue writing my diary, as usual.</t6255> <t6256>Thus, if he has doubted my trust, I must show it to him, including all the thoughts and feelings of my heart, so that he can read them clearly.</t6256> <t6257>Today I feel strangely sad and moody.</t6257> <t6258>I suppose it is the reaction due to the tremendous emotion.</t6258>
<t6259>Last night I went to bed when the men left, simply because they told me to go to bed.</t6259> <t6260>I wasn't sleepy, and I felt an enormous anxiety.</t6260> <t6261>I was thinking about everything that had happened since Jonathan came to see me in London, and it all seemed like a horrible tragedy, as if fate were driving everything towards a sinister end.</t6261>
<t6262>Everything we do, no matter how good our intentions, seems to lead to something that must be deeply deplored.</t6262> <t6263>If I had not gone to Whitby, it is possible that poor, dear Lucy would still be with us now.</t6263> <t6264>It had not occurred to her to visit the churchyard until the moment of my arrival, and if she had not gone there during the day, she would not have returned sleepwalking during the night, and the monster would not have destroyed her as it did.</t6264> <t6265>Oh! Why did I go to Whitby? Crying again!</t6265> <t6266>I don't know what's happening to me today.</t6266> <t6267>I must hide it from Jonathan, because if he knows that I have cried twice already this morning, I who never cry and have never had to shed a single tear for him, the poor man will be discouraged and worried.</t6267> <t6268>I must put on a serene face, and if I feel like crying, he must not know.</t6268> <t6269>I suppose it is one of the lessons that we poor women have to learn…</t6269>
<t6270>I can't stop remembering how I fell asleep.</t6270> <t6271>I remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a clamor of strange sounds, like prayers in a tumultuous range, coming from Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhere below mine.</t6271> <t6272>Then, silence reigned again, so deep that it startled me, and I got up to look out the window.</t6272> <t6273>Everything was dark and silent.</t6273>
<t6274>The dark shadows cast by the moonlight seemed to be filled with a mystery of their own.</t6274> <t6275>Nothing seemed to move, but everything appeared gloomy and eerie, so that a slight wisp of white fog, advancing with a slowness that made its movement almost imperceptible, towards the house, over the lawn, seemed to have a life of its own.</t6275> <t6276>I believe that these thoughts, by making me forget the previous ones, did me good, since when I went back to bed I felt a lethargy that gently enveloped me.</t6276> <t6277>I remained in bed for a while, but I couldn't fall asleep, so I got up again and looked out the window.</t6277> <t6278>The fog was spreading and was already very close to the house, so much so that I saw it cling heavily to the walls, as if it were climbing towards the windows.</t6278> <t6279>The poor man was speaking more forcefully than ever and, although I couldn't quite make out his words, I understood that it was a passionate plea on his part.</t6279> <t6280>Then, I heard the sound of a struggle and realized that the nurses were taking care of him.</t6280> <t6281>I felt so scared that I covered my head with the sheets, plugging my ears with my fingers.</t6281> <t6282>I wasn't sleepy at all or, at least, so I thought, but I must have fallen asleep, since, except for the dreams, I don't remember anything else until morning came, when Jonathan woke me up.</t6282> <t6283>I think it took me some effort and time to remember where I was and that it was Jonathan who was leaning over me.</t6283> <t6284>My dream was very peculiar, and it was something typical, in the way that upon waking, thoughts intermingle with dreams.</t6284>
<t6285>I thought I was asleep, waiting for Jonathan to return.</t6285><t6286>I felt very anxious about him and couldn't do anything; my legs, arms, and body felt weighed down, so much so that I couldn't move as usual.</t6286><t6287>Thus, I slept very restlessly and kept dreaming strange things.</t6287><t6288>Then, I began to feel that the air was heavy, humid, and cold.</t6288><t6289>I removed the sheets from my face and, to my great surprise, saw that everything was dark.</t6289><t6290>The little gas lamp I had left on for Jonathan, though very dim, seemed like a tiny red spark through the mist, which had evidently grown denser and entered the room.</t6290><t6291>Then, I remembered that I had closed the window before going to bed.</t6291><t6292>I wanted to get up to make sure of it, but a leaden lethargy seemed to hold my limbs and my will.</t6292><t6293>I remained motionless; that was all.</t6293><t6294>I closed my eyes, but I could still see clearly through my eyelids (it's wonderful to see what tricks dreams have, and how logically our imagination sometimes works).</t6294><t6295>The mist grew thicker and I could already see how it entered the room, as I saw it as if it were smoke... or like the white vapor of boiling water... entering, not through the window, but from under the door.</t6295><t6296>It kept getting thicker until it seemed to concentrate into a column of vapor over which I could see the little light of the gas lamp shining like a reddish eye.</t6296><t6297>Ideas crowded into my brain as the column of vapor began to dance in the room, and among all my thoughts came the phrases from the scriptures: "A column of vapor by night and of fire by day."</t6297><t6298>Was it some spiritual guide coming to me through the dream?</t6298><t6299>But the column was composed of both the day guide and the night guide, for the fire was in the red eye which, thinking about it, fascinated me in a way, for as I watched it, the fire seemed to split and I saw it as if it were two red eyes, through the mist, just as Lucy had told me she had seen them in her mental wanderings, on the cliff, when the setting sun reflected in the windows of St. Mary's Church.</t6299><t6300>Suddenly, I remembered in horror that this was how Jonathan had seen those horrible women of the mist materialize, spinning under the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for I found myself in the deepest darkness.</t6300>
<t6301>The last conscious effort my imagination made was to make me see a livid face leaning over me, emerging from the mist.</t6301> <t6302>I must be careful with those dreams, as they can make a person's reason waver if they occur too frequently.</t6302> <t6303>I'm going to see Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe me something that will make me sleep deeply; the only bad thing is that I fear alarming them.</t6303>
<t6304>A similar dream would mix at this moment with her fears for me.</t6304> <t6305>Tonight I must strive to sleep naturally.</t6305> <t6306>If I don't succeed, I must ensure that I get a dose of chloral for tomorrow night; that won't harm me for once and a good night's sleep will do me well.</t6306> <t6307>Today I woke up more fatigued than if I hadn't slept at all.</t6307>
<t6308>October 2nd, at ten o'clock at night.</t6308> <t6309>Last night I slept, but I did not dream.</t6309> <t6310>I must have slept deeply, since I did not wake up when Jonathan went to bed, but the sleep did not do me as much good as I would have wished, since today I have felt weak and discouraged.</t6310> <t6311>I spent all of yesterday trying to sleep or lying down, dozing.</t6311>
<t6312>In the afternoon, Mr. Renfield asked if he could see me.</t6312> <t6313>Poor man!</t6313> <t6314>He was very kind, and as he left, he kissed my hand and prayed to God to bless me.</t6314> <t6315>In a way, that affected me a lot, and tears come to my eyes when I think of him.</t6315> <t6316>This is a new weakness that I have to worry about and take care of.</t6316> <t6317>Jonathan would be very sad if he knew that I had been crying.</t6317> <t6318>He and the others were out until dinner time, and they returned very tired.</t6318> <t6319>I did my best to cheer them up, and I think the effort did me good, since I forgot how tired I was myself.</t6319> <t6320>After dinner, they sent me to bed and all went out to smoke together, as they said, but I knew perfectly well that what they wanted was to tell each other what had happened to each of them during the day; I understood from Jonathan's attitude that he had something very important to communicate to them.</t6320>
<t6321>I wasn't as sleepy as I should have been; therefore, before they left, I asked Dr. Seward to give me some kind of sleeping pill, as I hadn't slept well the night before.</t6321> <t6322>With great skill, he prepared a sedative drug for me and gave it to me, telling me that it wouldn't cause any harm, as it was very mild...</t6322> <t6323>I have taken it and am waiting for sleep to overcome me, which still seems somewhat distant.</t6323> <t6324>I hope I haven't done anything wrong, as when sleep begins to take hold of me, a new fear assails me; it is possible that I have made a mistake by depriving myself of the power to wake up.</t6324> <t6325>It is possible that I might need it.</t6325> <t6326>I am already sleepy.</t6326> <t6327>Good night!</t6327>
<t6328>XX.– FROM THE JOURNAL OF JONATHAN HARKER</t6328>
<t6329>October 1st, at night.</t6329> <t6330>I found Thomas Snelling at his house in Bethnal Green; but, unfortunately, he was not in a condition to remember anything.</t6330> <t6331>The very lure of the beer that my anticipated visit had opened before him proved too strong, and he began to drink too soon, before my arrival.</t6331> <t6332>However, I learned from his wife, a decent and timid person, that he was only Smollet’s assistant, who was the responsible one of the two.</t6332> <t6333>So I headed towards Walworth and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at his house, in his shirtsleeves, having a late cup of tea, which he was lifting from a saucer.</t6333> <t6334>He is an honest and intelligent man, a trustworthy worker with an intelligence and personality of his own.</t6334> <t6335>He remembered everything about the incident with the boxes, and, pulling from a mysterious place at the back of his trousers a notebook with dog-eared pages covered in hieroglyphics drawn with a thick-tipped pencil and very heavy writing, he informed me of the destination of the boxes.</t6335> <t6336>There were six he had taken from Carfax and deposited at number one hundred and ninety-seven Chicksand Street, in Mile End New Town, and another six he had deposited in Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey.</t6336> <t6337>In the event that the Count wished to distribute his ghostly refuges throughout London, those places would have been chosen as starting points, so that he could then completely distribute the boxes.</t6337>
<t6338>The systematic way in which all that was being carried out made me think that this could not mean that the monster wished to confine itself to two places in London.</t6338> <t6339>It was already situated in the eastern part of the north bank, to the east of the south coast, and to the south of the city.</t6339> <t6340>It was certain that it did not intend to leave out of its diabolical plans the north and the west... not to mention the City itself, and the very heart of elegant London, to the southwest and the west.</t6340> <t6341>I went back to see Smollet and asked him if he could tell us if any other box had been taken from Carfax.</t6341>
<t6342>Then he replied:</t6342>
<t6343>"Well, sir, you have treated me very well," he had given him half a sovereign, "and I am going to tell you everything I know."</t6343> <t6344>"I heard a man named Bloxam saying four nights ago at the 'Are and Ounds' in Pincer's Alley that he and his partner had a dirty and strange job in an old house in Purfleet."</t6344> <t6345>"Jobs of that kind are not frequent here, and I think Sam Bloxam might be able to tell you more about it."</t6345>
<t6346>I asked him if it was possible for him to tell me where I could find him.</t6346> <t6347>I told him that if he could get me the address, I would be very happy to give him another half-sovereign.</t6347>
<t6348>So he took the rest of his tea in one gulp and stood up, saying he was going to start his inquiries.</t6348> <t6349>He stopped at the door and said:</t6349>
<t6350>–Listen, sir, it doesn't make sense for you to wait here.</t6350> <t6351>It's possible that you'll find Sam soon, or maybe you won't, but either way, I don't think he'll be in a condition to tell you much tonight.</t6351> <t6352>Sam is a strange guy when he gets upset.</t6352> <t6353>If you can give me an envelope with a postage stamp and your address, I'll see where I can find Sam and send you the information by mail tonight.</t6353> <t6354>But you'll need to go see him very early in the morning if you want to find him, since Sam gets up early, no matter how long the previous night's party lasted.</t6354>
<t6355>That turned out to be practical, so one of the children went out with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and I gave him the change.</t6355> <t6356>When he returned, I addressed the envelope and put the stamp on it, and when Smollet promised me again that he would send me the address by mail as soon as he discovered it, I headed home.</t6356> <t6357>Anyway, we are on the trail.</t6357> <t6358>Tonight I feel tired and wish to sleep.</t6358> <t6359>Mina is deeply asleep and looks too pale; her eyes give the impression that she has been crying.</t6359> <t6360>Poor woman, I am sure it is very hard for her to remain in ignorance and that it may make her feel doubly anxious for me and for everyone else.</t6360> <t6361>But it is better this way.</t6361> <t6362>It is better to feel disappointed and anxious than to have shattered nerves.</t6362> <t6363>The doctors were right to insist that she should stay out of this whole terrible matter.</t6363> <t6364>I must remain firm, since the burden of silence must weigh mainly on me.</t6364> <t6365>I cannot even mention the subject to her, under any circumstances.</t6365> <t6366>In fact, I don't think it will be a difficult and hard task after all, since she herself has become reticent on that subject and has not spoken of the count or his actions since we informed her of our decision.</t6366>
<t6367>October 2nd, at night.</t6367> <t6368>It was a long, exciting day, and one that proved to be a real test.</t6368> <t6369>In the first mail, I received the letter intended for me, which contained a dirty sheet of paper, on which had been written with a carpenter's pencil and a very heavy hand: "Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth.</t6369> <t6370>Ask for the bailiff.</t6370><t6371>"</t6371>
<t6372>I received the letter in bed and got up, without waking Mina.</t6372> <t6373>She was pale and seemed to be sleeping heavily and deeply.</t6373> <t6374>I thought not to wake her, but as soon as I returned from that investigation, I would make the necessary arrangements for her to return to Exeter.</t6374> <t6375>I believe she will be happier in our own home, engaging in her daily tasks, than being here, among us, in ignorance of everything that is happening.</t6375> <t6376>I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment and told him where I was going, promising to return to explain everything else as soon as I could discover something.</t6376> <t6377>I headed to Walworth and found Potter's Court with some difficulty.</t6377> <t6378>Mr. Smollet's spelling misled me, as I first asked for Poter's Court instead of Potter's Court.</t6378> <t6379>However, when I found the address, I had no difficulty finding the Corcoran boarding house.</t6379> <t6380>When I asked the man who came to the door about the "bailiff," he shook his head and said:</t6380>
<t6381>–I don't know him.</t6381> <t6382>There is no such person here; I have never heard of him in my entire life.</t6382> <t6383>I don't think there is anyone like that living here or nearby.</t6383>
<t6384>I took out Smollet's letter and upon reading it, it seemed to me that the lesson on spelling with which the address was written might help me.</t6384>
<t6385>–Who are you? – I asked him.</t6385>
<t6386>–I am the sheriff -he replied.</t6386>
<t6387>I immediately understood that I was on safe ground.</t6387>
<t6388>The spelling with which the letter was written deceived me again.</t6388>
<t6389>A half-crown tip made the constable's knowledge available to me, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam had slept at the Corcaran house to dispel the fumes of the beer he had drunk the night before, but had gone to his work in Poplar at five in the morning.</t6389> <t6390>He could not tell me the exact place where he worked, but he had a vague idea that it was some new warehouse, and with that extremely slight clue, I set off for Poplar.</t6390> <t6391>It was already twelve before I managed to get directions to a similar building, and it was in a café where I got the information.</t6391> <t6392>There were several women eating in the lounge.</t6392> <t6393>One of them told me that they were constructing a new "refrigerated warehouse" building on Cross Angel Street, and since it matched the constable's description, I headed there immediately.</t6393> <t6394>An interview with a rather surly guard and an even more ill-tempered foreman, whose mood I improved slightly with the help of some coins, put me on Bloxam's trail; they sent for him when I suggested that I was willing to pay the foreman his full day's wages for the privilege of asking him a few questions about a private matter.</t6394> <t6395>He was a fairly intelligent fellow, though somewhat rough in manner and speech.</t6395>
<t6396>When I promised to pay him for his reports and gave him an advance, he told me that he had made two trips between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly and that he had taken nine large boxes, "very heavy," from the first address to the last with a cart and horse he had rented for the job.</t6396> <t6397>I asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to which he replied:</t6397>
<t6398>–Well, sir, I have forgotten the number, but it was a few doors away from a large white church, or something similar, that was built not long ago.</t6398> <t6399>It was an old, dusty house, though not as dusty as the house from which I took the boxes.</t6399>
<t6400>–How did you manage to get in, if both houses were unoccupied?</t6400>
<t6401>–The old man who hired me was waiting for me at the house in Purfleet.</t6401> <t6402>He helped me lift the boxes and place them on the cart.</t6402> <t6403>He insulted me, but he was the strongest guy I've ever seen.</t6403> <t6404>He was an old man, with white mustaches so fine that they were almost unnoticeable.</t6404>
<t6405>That phrase made me jump!</t6405>
<t6406>–He took one end of the box as if it were a tea set, while I took the other, sweating and panting like a bear.</t6406> <t6407>It took me a great effort to lift my part, but I managed it and… I'm not a weakling either.</t6407>
<t6408>–How did you manage to get into the house on Piccadilly?</t6408>
<t6409>–He was waiting for me there as well.</t6409> <t6410>He must have left immediately and arrived there before me, because when I knocked on the door, he himself came out to open it and helped me unload the boxes in the vestibule.</t6410>
<t6411>– Nine o'clock? – I asked him.</t6411>
<t6412>–Yes; I took five on the first trip and four on the second.</t6412> <t6413>It was very hard work, and I don't quite remember how I got back home.</t6413>
<t6414>I interrupted him:</t6414>
<t6415>–Did the boxes stay in the lobby?</t6415>
<t6416>–Yes; it was a very spacious room, and there was nothing else in it.</t6416>
<t6417>I made another attempt to learn more about it.</t6417>
<t6418>–Didn't he give you any key?</t6418>
<t6419>–I didn't need any key.</t6419> <t6420>The old man opened the door for me and closed it again when I left.</t6420> <t6421>I don't remember anything from the second time, but that's because of the beer.</t6421>
<t6422>–And you don't remember the house number?</t6422>
<t6423>–No, sir.</t6423> <t6424>But you will have no difficulty finding it.</t6424> <t6425>It is a tall building, with a stone facade and a coat of arms, and quite high stairs that lead up to the entrance door.</t6425> <t6426>I remember those stairs because I had to climb them with the boxes, along with three boys who came over to earn a few pennies.</t6426> <t6427>The old man gave them shillings and, seeing that he had given them a lot, they wanted even more, but the old man grabbed one of them by the shoulder and almost threw him down the stairs; then, they all left, insulting him.</t6427>
<t6428>I thought that with those reports I would have no trouble finding the house, so after paying my informant, I headed towards Piccadilly.</t6428> <t6429>I had acquired a new and painful experience.</t6429> <t6430>The count could apparently handle the boxes alone.</t6430> <t6431>If so, time was precious, since having carried out certain distributions, he could carry out the rest of his work, choosing the opportune time for it, going completely unnoticed.</t6431> <t6432>At Piccadilly Circus I got off and walked west; after passing the Junior Constitutional, I arrived at the house that had been described to me and was satisfied with the idea that this was the next refuge Dracula had chosen.</t6432> <t6433>The house seemed to have been unoccupied for a long time.</t6433> <t6434>The windows were full of dust and the shutters were raised.</t6434> <t6435>The entire structure was blackened by time, and the paint had disappeared from the metal parts.</t6435> <t6436>It was evident that there had been an advertisement on the upper balcony for some time, which had been abruptly removed, so that the vertical supports still remained.</t6436> <t6437>Behind the balcony railing, I saw several loose boards protruding, whose edges appeared white.</t6437> <t6438>I would have given much to see the advertisement intact, as it might have given me some indication as to the identity of its owner.</t6438> <t6439>I remembered my experience investigating and purchasing the Carfax house and couldn't help but think that if I could find the former owner, I might discover some means of entering the house.</t6439>
<t6440>For the moment, there was nothing to discover on the Piccadilly side and nothing could be done, so I headed to the back to see if anything could be seen from that side.</t6440> <t6441>The stables were full of activity, as most of the houses were occupied.</t6441> <t6442>I asked a couple of servants and stable hands, whom I could find, if they could tell me anything about the unoccupied house.</t6442> <t6443>One of them told me he had heard that someone had bought it recently, but he did not know who the new owner was.</t6443> <t6444>One of them, however, told me that until very recently there had been a sign that said "for sale" and that it was possible that Mitchell, Sons Candy, the moving agents, could provide more details, as he believed he remembered that this was the name on the sign for all inquiries.</t6444> <t6445>I did not want to seem too eager to my informant, nor let him guess too much, so after giving him my most sincere thanks, I walked away.</t6445> <t6446>It was getting dark and the autumn night was setting in, so I did not want to waste time.</t6446> <t6447>After finding the address of Mitchell, Sons Candy in a Berkeley telephone directory, I headed immediately to their offices, which were located on Sackville Street.</t6447>
<t6448>The gentleman who received me had particularly gentle manners, but he was not very communicative.</t6448> <t6449>After telling me that the house in Piccadilly, which he referred to as a "mansion" during our conversation, had been sold, he considered that my interest should end there.</t6449> <t6450>When I asked him who had bought it, he opened his eyes too wide and remained silent for a moment before responding:</t6450>
<t6451>–It's sold, sir.</t6451>
<t6452>–Excuse me -I said, with the same courtesy-, but I have special reasons to wish to know who acquired that building.</t6452>
<t6453>He paused again for quite a while and raised his eyebrows even higher.</t6453>
<t6454>–It is sold, sir -he said again, laconically.</t6454>
<t6455>–I suppose you wouldn't mind giving me that information -I insisted.</t6455>
<t6456>–But, of course I care! – he replied-.</t6456> <t6457>The affairs of our clients are absolutely confidential in the hands of Mitchell, Sons Candy.</t6457>
<t6458>It was clear that he was a pedant of the worst kind and that it wasn't worth arguing with him.</t6458> <t6459>I thought it would be better to confront him on his own ground and said to him:</t6459>
<t6460>–Your clients, sir, are lucky to have such a resolute guardian of their confidences.</t6460> <t6461>I myself am a professional -saying this, I handed him my card-.</t6461> <t6462>In this case, I am not interested in this matter out of curiosity: I am acting on behalf of Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something about the property that he believed, until recently, was for sale.</t6462>
<t6463>Those words made things take on a different hue.</t6463>
<t6464>"I would like to give you those reports if I had them, Mr. Harker, and especially I would like to serve your client."</t6464> <t6465>"On one occasion we carried out some transactions for him regarding the rental of some rooms when he was the Honorable Arthur Holmwood."</t6465> <t6466>"If you can give me his lordship's address, I would be very pleased to consult the house about the subject and, in any case, I would communicate with his lordship by tonight's mail."</t6466> <t6467>"It will be a pleasure to provide those reports to his lordship, if we can deviate from the rules of conduct of this house in this case."</t6467>
<t6468>I wanted to make a friend, not an enemy, so I thanked him, gave him the address of Dr. Seward's house, and left.</t6468> <t6469>It was already night and I felt tired and hungry.</t6469> <t6470>I had a cup of tea at the Aerated Bread Company and returned to Purfleet by train.</t6470>
<t6471>I found all the others in the house.</t6471> <t6472>Mina looked pale and tired, but she made a valiant effort to appear kind and cheerful: it hurt me to think that I had to hide something from her and that it had thus worried her.</t6472> <t6473>Thank God, it would be the last night she would have to be nearby without attending our meetings, believing in some way that she was not worthy of our trust.</t6473> <t6474>I needed all my courage to keep her truly away from everything related to our horrible work.</t6474> <t6475>She seems to be somewhat more accustomed to the idea, or the subject has become repugnant to her, since every time there is an accidental allusion to that topic, she truly shudders.</t6475> <t6476>I'm glad we made our decision in time, because with such feelings, our ever-growing knowledge would be a true torture for her.</t6476>
<t6477>I couldn't talk to the others about the discoveries I had made during the day until we were alone.</t6477> <t6478>So, after dinner, and a small musical interlude that served to keep up appearances, even for ourselves, I led Mina to her room and let her go to bed.</t6478> <t6479>My adorable wife was more affectionate with me than ever and hugged me as if she wanted to hold on to me, but there was much to talk about and I had to leave her alone.</t6479> <t6480>Thank God, not telling each other everything hadn't changed things between us.</t6480>
<t6481>When I went down again, I found everyone sitting around the fire in the study.</t6481>
<t6482>On the train, I had written in my diary everything related to my discoveries of the day, and I limited myself to reading to them what I had written, as the best possible way for them to learn about the reports I had obtained.</t6482> <t6483>When I finished, Van Helsing said:</t6483>
<t6484>–You have had a magnificent day of work, friend Jonathan.</t6484> <t6485>Undoubtedly, we are on the trail of the missing boxes.</t6485> <t6486>If we find all of them in that house, then our work is nearing its end.</t6486> <t6487>But, if any of them are still missing, we will have to search for it until we find it.</t6487> <t6488>Then we will deliver the final blow and make the monster truly die.</t6488>
<t6489>We all remained seated in silence and, suddenly, Mr. Morris said:</t6489>
<t6490>–Say!</t6490> <t6491>How are we going to be able to enter that house?</t6491>
<t6492>–The same way we did it in the other one -said Lord Godalming quickly.</t6492>
<t6493>–But, Art, we broke into Carfax; but it was night and we had the park that hid us from prying eyes.</t6493> <t6494>It would be very different to commit that crime in Piccadilly, both at night and during the day.</t6494> <t6495>I confess that I don't see how we are going to be able to get in, unless that pedantic real estate agent gets us a key.</t6495>
<t6496>Lord Godalming frowned, stood up, and paced around the room.</t6496> <t6497>Suddenly, he stopped and said, turning to us and looking at us one by one:</t6497>
<t6498>–Quincey is right.</t6498> <t6499>This matter of breaking and entering is getting very serious; it went very well for us once, but the job we have now is very different... unless we find the count's keychain.</t6499>
<t6500>Since we couldn't do anything before morning and since it was advisable for Lord Godalming to wait until receiving communication from Mitchell's, we decided not to take any steps until breakfast time.</t6500> <t6501>For quite a while, we remained seated, smoking, discussing all facets of the matter from different angles; I took the opportunity to complete this journal and update it to this very moment.</t6501> <t6502>I am very sleepy and must go to bed...</t6502>
<t6503>Just one more line.</t6503> <t6504>Mina sleeps deeply and her breathing is regular.</t6504> <t6505>Her forehead is furrowed with small wrinkles, as if she were thinking even in her sleep.</t6505> <t6506>She is still very pale, but not as gaunt as this morning.</t6506> <t6507>Tomorrow I hope we can put an end to all this; she will go to our house in Exeter.</t6507> <t6508>Oh! How sleepy I am!</t6508>
<t6509>From the journal of Dr. Seward</t6509>
<t6510>October 1st.</t6510> <t6511>I am absolutely astonished by Renfield.</t6511> <t6512>His mood swings are so sudden that I have difficulty recording and adapting to them, and since they always have a meaning that goes beyond his own well-being, they form a more than interesting study.</t6512> <t6513>This morning, when I went to see him, after he had rejected van Helsing, his manners were those of a man who was directing destiny.</t6513> <t6514>Indeed, he was giving orders to destiny, subjectively.</t6514> <t6515>He was not concerned at all with any earthly matters; he was in the clouds and looked from his watchtower at all the weaknesses and desires of us poor mortals.</t6515>
<t6516>I decided to take advantage of the occasion and learn something, so I asked him:</t6516>
<t6517>–What can you tell me about the flies lately?</t6517>
<t6518>He smiled at me with a very superior air..., with a smile that could have appeared on Malvolio's face, before responding to me:</t6518>
<t6519>–The fly, my dear sir, has a surprising characteristic: its wings are typical of the airy nature of psychic faculties.</t6519> <t6520>The ancients were right when they represented the soul in the form of a butterfly!</t6520>
<t6521>I thought I had exhausted his analogy, and I quickly said:</t6521>
<t6522>–Oh! Are you looking for a soul now?</t6522>
<t6523>His madness enveloped reason, and an expression of astonishment spread across his face as, shaking his head with an energy I had never seen before, he said:</t6523>
<t6524>–Oh, no, no!</t6524> <t6525>I don't want souls.</t6525> <t6526>All I want is life -his face lit up at that moment-.</t6526> <t6527>I feel a great indifference about that nowadays.</t6527> <t6528>Life is very well: I have all that I need.</t6528> <t6529>You have to find yourself another patient, doctor, if you wish to study zoophagy.</t6529>
<t6530>That remark surprised me a little, so I said to him:</t6530>
<t6531>–So, you direct life; you must be a god, isn't that right?</t6531>
<t6532>He smiled with a kind of benign and ineffable superiority.</t6532>
<t6533>–Oh, no!</t6533> <t6534>It is in no way within my calculations to arrogate to myself the attributes of divinity.</t6534> <t6535>I am not even particularly interested in its spiritual acts.</t6535> <t6536>If it is possible for me to establish my intellectual position, I would say that, regarding purely earthly matters, I am somewhat in the position that Enoch occupied spiritually!</t6536>
<t6537>That represented a difficult problem for me; I couldn't remember at that moment what Enoch's position had been.</t6537> <t6538>Therefore, I had to ask him a simple question, although I understood that by doing so, I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic...</t6538>
<t6539>–And why do you compare yourself to Enoch?</t6539>
<t6540>–Because he walked with God.</t6540>
<t6541>I didn't understand the analogy, but I didn't like to admit it, so I returned to the topic I had already denied:</t6541>
<t6542>–So you are not concerned about life and do not want souls, why?</t6542>
<t6543>I asked him the question quickly and quite dryly, in order to see if it was possible to unsettle him.</t6543>
<t6544>The effort paid off and for a moment he calmed down and returned to his old servile manners, he bowed to me and flattered me servilely, while responding:</t6544>
<t6545>–I don't want souls.</t6545> <t6546>It's true!</t6546> <t6547>It's true!</t6547> <t6548>I don't want them.</t6548> <t6549>They would be useless to me if I had them; I would have no way to use them.</t6549> <t6550>I couldn't eat them or...</t6550>
<t6551>He suddenly fell silent, and the old expression of cunning spread over his face again, like when a strong wind ripples the surface of the waters.</t6551>
<t6552>–Listen, doctor, regarding life, what is it after all?</t6552> <t6553>When you have obtained everything necessary and know that you will never desire anything else, that is all.</t6553> <t6554>I have friends, good friends, like you, Dr. Seward -he said this with an expression of indescribable cunning-.</t6554> <t6555>I know that I will never lack the means to live!</t6555>
<t6556>I believe that amidst the mists of his madness, he saw in me a certain antagonism, since, finally, he retreated to the shelter of his kind..., to the deepest and most stubborn silence.</t6556>
<t6557>After a short time, I realized that for the moment it was useless to try to talk to him.</t6557> <t6558>He was sulking.</t6558> <t6559>So I left him alone and went away.</t6559>
<t6560>Later, in the course of the day, he sent for me.</t6560> <t6561>Ordinarily, I would not have gone to visit him without special reasons, but at this moment I am so interested in him that I am happy to make that small effort.</t6561> <t6562>Besides, I was glad to have something to help me pass the time.</t6562> <t6563>Harker is out, following leads; and so are Quincey and Lord Godalming.</t6563> <t6564>Van Helsing is in my study, carefully examining the records prepared by the Harkers; he seems to believe that through an exact knowledge of all the details, it is possible he may find some important clue.</t6564> <t6565>He does not wish to be disturbed while he works, unless for some special reason.</t6565> <t6566>I could have made him accompany me to see the patient, but I thought that after being rejected as he had been, he would no longer like to go see him.</t6566> <t6567>Besides, there was another reason: Renfield would not speak as freely in front of a third person as he would when he and I are alone.</t6567>
<t6568>I found him sitting in the chair, in the center of his room, in a posture that generally indicates a certain mental energy on his part.</t6568> <t6569>When I entered, he immediately said, as if the question had been burning his lips:</t6569>
<t6570>–What do you tell me about the souls?</t6570>
<t6571>It was evident that my postponement had been correct.</t6571> <t6572>Unconscious thoughts carried out their work, even in the case of lunatics.</t6572> <t6573>I decided to put an end to that matter.</t6573>
<t6574>–What do you say about them yourself? – I inquired.</t6574>
<t6575>Renfield did not respond for the moment and looked around, up and down, as if he were expecting to get some inspiration to answer.</t6575>
<t6576>–I don't want souls! – he said in a weak tone, almost as an excuse.</t6576>
<t6577>The matter seemed to occupy his mind, and I decided to take advantage of it... to be "cruel only to be kind."</t6577> <t6578>So I told him:</t6578>
<t6579>–Do you like life, do you want life?</t6579>
<t6580>–Oh, yes!</t6580> <t6581>But, that's already fine.</t6581> <t6582>You don't need to worry about that!</t6582>
<t6583>–But I asked, how are we going to obtain life without obtaining the soul at the same time?</t6583>
<t6584>That seemed to surprise him, so I elaborated on the idea:</t6584>
<t6585>–You will have a very amusing time when you leave here, with the souls of all the flies, spiders, birds, and cats buzzing, writhing, and meowing around you.</t6585> <t6586>You have taken their lives and must know what to do with their souls.</t6586>
<t6587>Something seemed to affect his imagination, as he covered his ears with his fingers and closed his eyes, squeezing them tightly, like a child does when their face is being washed with soap.</t6587> <t6588>There was something pathetic about him that moved me; likewise, I received a lesson, as it seemed to me that there was a child in front of me... only a child, although his facial features reflected fatigue and the beard appearing on his cheeks was white.</t6588> <t6589>It was evident that he was suffering some kind of mental disturbance, and knowing how his previous moods seemed to have interpreted things that were apparently strange to him, I thought it appropriate to delve into his thoughts as much as possible, to accompany him.</t6589> <t6590>The first step was to regain his trust, so I asked him, speaking very loudly, so he could hear me despite having his ears covered:</t6590>
<t6591>–Do you want some sugar to attract your flies again?</t6591>
<t6592>He seemed to wake up suddenly and moved his head.</t6592> <t6593>With a laugh, he said:</t6593>
<t6594>–No! Flies are of little importance, after all! – He paused slightly and added –: But, anyway, I don't want their souls buzzing in my ears.</t6594>
<t6595>–Or the spiders? – I continued saying.</t6595>
<t6596>–I don't want spiders!</t6596> <t6597>What are spiders good for?</t6597> <t6598>They have nothing to eat or… -he suddenly fell silent, as if he remembered some forbidden topic.</t6598>
<t6599>"Well, well!" I said to myself.</t6599> <t6600>"This is the second time he suddenly stops at the word, what does this mean?"</t6600>
<t6601>Renfield realized that he had made a mistake, as he hurried to continue, as if to distract my attention and prevent me from noticing it.</t6601>
<t6602>–I have absolutely no interest in those animals.</t6602> <t6603>"Rats, mice, and other such animals," as Shakespeare says.</t6603> <t6604>It can be said that they are of no importance.</t6604> <t6605>I have already surpassed all that nonsense.</t6605> <t6606>It would be the same as asking a man to eat molecules with chopsticks, to try to interest me in carnivores, when I know what awaits me.</t6606>
<t6607>–I understand now -I said-.</t6607> <t6608>You want large animals in which you can sink your teeth, isn't that right?</t6608> <t6609>How would an elephant for your breakfast sound?</t6609>
<t6610>–You are saying absolutely ridiculous nonsense!</t6610>
<t6611>He was waking up a lot, so I set out to delve a little deeper into the matter.</t6611>
<t6612>–I wonder -I said thoughtfully- what an elephant's soul is like.</t6612>
<t6613>I achieved the effect I desired, as he came down from the heights and turned back into a child.</t6613>
<t6614>–I don't want the soul of an elephant, nor any soul at all! – he said.</t6614>
<t6615>For a few moments, he remained seated, as if dejected.</t6615> <t6616>Suddenly, he stood up, with his eyes shining and all the signs of great cerebral excitement.</t6616>
<t6617>–Go to hell with your souls! – he shouted.</t6617> <t6618>Why do you bother me with your souls?</t6618> <t6619>Do you think I don't already have enough to worry about, suffer from, and distract myself with, without thinking about souls?</t6619>
<t6620>He had such a hostile look that I thought he was about to carry out another homicidal attack, so I blew my whistle.</t6620> <t6621>However, the moment I did, he calmed down and said, in an apologetic tone:</t6621>
<t6622>–Forgive me, doctor; I lost control.</t6622> <t6623>You do not need any kind of help.</t6623> <t6624>I am so worried that I get irritated easily.</t6624> <t6625>If you knew the problem I have to face and find a solution for, you would pity me, tolerate me, and excuse me.</t6625> <t6626>I beg you not to put me in a straitjacket.</t6626> <t6627>I wish to reflect and I cannot do so when my body is tied up.</t6627> <t6628>I am sure you will understand!</t6628>
<t6629>It was evident that he had self-control, so when the attendants arrived, I told them they could leave.</t6629> <t6630>Renfield watched them as they walked away; when they closed the door, he said, with considerable dignity and gentleness:</t6630>
<t6631>–Doctor Seward, you have been very considerate with me.</t6631> <t6632>Believe me, I am very grateful to you!</t6632>
<t6633>I thought it would be convenient to leave at that moment, so I left.</t6633> <t6634>There is certainly something to think about regarding that man's condition.</t6634> <t6635>Several points seem to form what American journalists call "a story"; it is only necessary to put them in order.</t6635> <t6636>Let's try it.</t6636>
<t6637>He does not wish to mention the word "drink".</t6637>
<t6638>He fears feeling burdened with the "soul" of something.</t6638>
<t6639>He is not afraid to think about "life" in the future.</t6639>
<t6640>He despises all lower forms of life, although he fears being tormented by their souls.</t6640>
<t6641>Logically, all those points indicate something!</t6641> <t6642>He has the certainty, in a way, that he will come to acquire a certain form of superior life.</t6642> <t6643>He fears the consequence... the burden of a soul.</t6643> <t6644>Therefore, it is a human life that he is seeking!</t6644> <t6645>As for the certainty...? Good God!</t6645> <t6646>The count has been with him and some other tremendous horror is being prepared!</t6646>
<t6647>Later.</t6647> <t6648>I went to see Van Helsing after finishing my rounds and told him my suspicions.</t6648> <t6649>He became very serious and, after reflecting on it for a moment, asked me to take him to see Renfield.</t6649> <t6650>So I did.</t6650>
<t6651>When we arrived at the door of the madman's room, we heard him singing inside with great joy, as he used to do in a time that seemed to be far behind.</t6651> <t6652>Upon entering, we saw that he had spread out the sugar, as he used to do before, and that the flies, immersed in the lethargy of autumn, were already beginning to buzz in the room.</t6652> <t6653>We tried to make him talk about the subject of our previous conversation, but he refused to pay us any attention.</t6653> <t6654>He continued singing, as if we were not there with him at all.</t6654> <t6655>He had obtained a piece of paper and was folding it inside a notebook.</t6655> <t6656>We had to leave, without having learned anything new.</t6656>
<t6657>It is really a curious case.</t6657> <t6658>We will have to watch it tonight.</t6658>
<t6659>Letter from Mitchell, Sons Candy to Lord Godalming</t6659>
<t6660>October 1</t6660>
<t6661>"Your Honor:"</t6661>
<t6662>"We are always very willing to satisfy your desires.</t6662> <t6663>We are in a position, with respect to Your Lordship's wishes, expressed by Mr. Harker on your behalf, to provide the required information about number three hundred and forty-seven Piccadilly.</t6663> <t6664>The original sellers are the heirs of the late Mr. Archibald Winter Suffield.</t6664> <t6665>The buyer is a foreign nobleman, Count de Ville, who personally made the purchase, paying the stipulated price in cash, if Your Lordship excuses the use of such an exceedingly vulgar expression.</t6665> <t6666>Apart from this, we know absolutely nothing more about the mentioned count.</t6666>
<t6667>"We are, sir, the most humble servants of Your Lordship,</t6667>
<t6668>"MITCHEL, SONS CANDY "</t6668>
<t6669>From the journal of Dr. Seward</t6669>
<t6670>October 2nd.</t6670> <t6671>I placed a man in the hallway during the last night to provide an exact report of all the noises he might hear in Renfield's room, giving him instructions to call me immediately if anything unusual occurred.</t6671> <t6672>After dinner, when we were all gathered around the fire in the study, and after Mrs. Harker had retired to her rooms, we discussed the attempts and discoveries we had made during that day.</t6672> <t6673>Harker was the only one of us who had obtained results, and we have great hopes that the clues he has found may be of great importance.</t6673>
<t6674>Before going to bed, I took a walk through the patients' rooms and looked through the peephole in the door.</t6674> <t6675>Renfield was sleeping deeply, and his chest rose and fell regularly.</t6675>
<t6676>This morning, the man who remained on duty informed me that after midnight he was restless and reciting his prayers in a somewhat loud voice.</t6676> <t6677>I asked him if that was all, and he replied that that was all he had heard.</t6677> <t6678>There was something in his manner that seemed so suspicious that I frankly asked him if he had fallen asleep.</t6678> <t6679>He denied it but admitted to having dozed off for a while.</t6679> <t6680>It is unfortunate that one cannot trust men unless they are being watched.</t6680>
<t6681>Today, Harker has gone out to follow his trail and Art and Quincey have gone to get horses.</t6681> <t6682>Godalming thinks it would be convenient to always have the horses ready, as when we get the reports we are looking for, there may be no time to lose.</t6682> <t6683>We must sterilize all the imported soil between sunrise and sunset.</t6683> <t6684>That way we can take the count at his weakest point, and without a place where he can take refuge.</t6684> <t6685>Van Helsing has gone to the British Museum looking for certain authorities on ancient medicine.</t6685> <t6686>The ancient doctors took certain things into account that their followers did not accept and the professor is looking for cures against demons and spells, which may be useful to us later.</t6686>
<t6687>Sometimes I think that we must all be completely crazy and that we will regain our sanity by seeing ourselves locked in straitjackets.</t6687>
<t6688>Later.</t6688> <t6689>We have gathered again.</t6689> <t6690>It seems that we are finally on the right track and that tomorrow's work may very well be the beginning of the end.</t6690> <t6691>I wonder if Renfield's calmness has anything to do with it.</t6691> <t6692>His mood swings have been so closely aligned with the count's movements that the imminent destruction of the monster may have been revealed to him in some subtle way.</t6692> <t6693>If we could have some idea of what is going on in his mind, especially between the moment I was talking to him and the moment he returned to his fly-catching, I could consider it a valuable clue.</t6693> <t6694>Apparently, he was going to be calm for a while... Could it be true...?</t6694> <t6695>That horrible scream seems to come from his room...</t6695> <t6696>The attendant rushed into my room and told me that somehow, Renfield had had an accident.</t6696> <t6697>He had heard his scream and when he went to his room, he found him collapsed on the floor, face down and all covered in blood.</t6697>
<t6698>I must go see him immediately...</t6698>
<t6699>XXI.–</t6699> <t6700>FROM THE DIARY OF DR. SEWARD</t6700>
<t6701>October 3rd.</t6701> <t6702>Let me express exactly everything that happened, just as I remember it since the last time I wrote in the diary.</t6702> <t6703>I must do it calmly, as I must not overlook a single detail that I remember.</t6703>
<t6704>When I arrived at Renfield's room, I found him lying on his side on the floor, in the middle of a pool of blood.</t6704> <t6705>When I set about moving him, I realized that he had received several terrible wounds; there did not seem to be that unity of purpose among the parts of the body, which seem to mark even lethargic sanity.</t6705> <t6706>Upon observing his face, I could see that it was horribly bruised, as if it had been smashed against the floor... in fact, it was from the wounds on his face that the pool of blood had emerged.</t6706> <t6707>The assistant who was kneeling beside the body said to me, as we turned the body over:</t6707>
<t6708>–I believe, sir, that his back is broken.</t6708> <t6709>Look, both his arm and his right leg, as well as the right side of his face, are paralyzed.</t6709>
<t6710>The assistant was absolutely stunned, as he couldn't explain how something like that could have happened.</t6710> <t6711>He seemed absolutely bewildered and his eyebrows were very furrowed when he said:</t6711>
<t6712>–I cannot understand either of the two things.</t6712> <t6713>One can mark their face like this, by hitting their head against the floor.</t6713> <t6714>On one occasion I saw a young woman who did this at the Eversfield Asylum, before anyone could stop her.</t6714> <t6715>And I suppose she could have broken her back by falling from the bed, if she did so in a bad position.</t6715> <t6716>But I assure you that it is impossible for me to imagine how both things could have happened at the same time.</t6716> <t6717>If her back was broken, she couldn't have hit her head, and if her face was already like that before falling from the bed, then there would be a trace of blood.</t6717>
<t6718>Then, I said to him:</t6718>
<t6719>–Go find Dr. Van Helsing and beg him to be so kind as to come here as soon as possible.</t6719> <t6720>I want to see him immediately.</t6720>
<t6721>The man ran away and a few minutes later the professor appeared, in pajamas and wearing his slippers.</t6721> <t6722>When he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked at him sharply and turned towards me.</t6722> <t6723>I think he recognized what I was thinking, as if it were clearly reflected in my eyes, since he said calmly, manifestly for the assistant to hear:</t6723>
<t6724>–What a sad accident!</t6724> <t6725>He will need very attentive supervision and a lot of care.</t6725> <t6726>I am going to stay with you; but first, I am going to get dressed.</t6726> <t6727>If you want to stay here, I will join you in a few moments.</t6727>
<t6728>The patient was now breathing stertorously, and it was easy to understand that he had suffered some terrible injury.</t6728> <t6729>Van Helsing returned with extraordinary speed, bringing with him a case of surgical instruments.</t6729> <t6730>It was evident that he had been thinking and had made up his mind, since, even before taking a look at the patient, he whispered to me:</t6730>
<t6731>–Send the assistant out.</t6731> <t6732>We need to be alone with him for when he recovers from the operation.</t6732>
<t6733>Therefore, I said:</t6733>
<t6734>I think that's all, Simmons.</t6734> <t6735>We've already done everything we could do.</t6735> <t6736>You'd better go take care of your rounds; Dr. Van Helsing is going to operate on the patient.</t6736> <t6737>If there's anything strange anywhere, let me know immediately.</t6737>
<t6738>The man withdrew, and we carefully examined the patient.</t6738> <t6739>The wounds on his face were superficial; the real injury was a skull fracture that extended over the motor region.</t6739> <t6740>The professor reflected for a moment and said:</t6740>
<t6741>–We must reduce the pressure and return to normal conditions as much as possible; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of the damage.</t6741> <t6742>The entire motor region seems to be affected.</t6742> <t6743>The suffusion of the brain will increase rapidly, we must perform trepanation immediately if we do not want it to be too late.</t6743>
<t6744>While he was speaking, there were some soft taps on the door; I went to it, opened it, and found Quincey and Arthur standing in the hallway, in pajamas and slippers; the latter spoke:</t6744>
<t6745>–I heard his assistant calling Dr. Van Helsing and talking about an accident.</t6745> <t6746>Consequently, I woke Quincey or, rather, I called him, since he was already awake.</t6746> <t6747>Things are happening too quickly and in too strange a manner for us to sleep deeply these days.</t6747> <t6748>I've been thinking that tomorrow night we won't see things as they have happened.</t6748> <t6749>We will have to look back and forward a bit more than we have been doing.</t6749> <t6750>Can we come in?</t6750>
<t6751>I nodded, and held the door open until they were inside; then, I closed it again.</t6751> <t6752>When Quincey saw the patient's condition and attitude and noticed the horrible pool of blood on the floor, he said softly:</t6752>
<t6753>–Good heavens!</t6753> <t6754>What has happened to him?</t6754> <t6755>Poor devil!</t6755>
<t6756>I explained it to him briefly and added that we hoped he would regain consciousness after the operation… at least for a short time.</t6756> <t6757>He immediately went to sit at the edge of the bed, with Godalming by his side, and we all waited patiently.</t6757>
<t6758>–We must wait -said Van Helsing- to determine the best possible site to perform the trepanation, so we can remove the blood clot as quickly and efficiently as possible, since it is evident that the hemorrhage is increasing.</t6758>
<t6759>The minutes during which we were waiting passed with dreadful slowness.</t6759> <t6760>I had a terrible thought, and from van Helsing's expression, I understood that he felt a certain fear or apprehension about what was going to happen.</t6760> <t6761>I feared the words that Renfield was going to utter.</t6761>
<t6762>I truly feared thinking, but I was aware of what was happening, since I had heard of men who had heard the death clock.</t6762> <t6763>The poor man's breathing became labored and irregular.</t6763> <t6764>It seemed at every moment that he was going to open his eyes and speak, but then, there would be a prolonged and stertorous breath, and he would calm down, becoming even more insensible.</t6764> <t6765>Although I was accustomed to the beds of the sick and the dead, that expectation became increasingly intolerable for me.</t6765> <t6766>I could almost clearly hear the beats of my own heart, and the blood flowing in my temples resounded as if they were hammer blows.</t6766>
<t6767>Finally, the silence became unbearable.</t6767> <t6768>I looked at my companions and saw in their flushed faces and the way they furrowed their brows that they were enduring the same torture as I was.</t6768> <t6769>A nervous suspense floated over all of us, as if a powerful bell were about to ring over our heads when we least expected it.</t6769>
<t6770>Finally, there came a moment when it was evident that the patient was weakening rapidly; he could die at any moment.</t6770> <t6771>I looked at the professor and saw that his eyes were fixed on me.</t6771> <t6772>His face was firm when he spoke:</t6772>
<t6773>–There is no time to lose.</t6773> <t6774>Your words can help save many lives; I have been thinking about it while we were waiting.</t6774> <t6775>It is possible that there is a soul in great danger!</t6775> <t6776>We must operate immediately above the ear.</t6776>
<t6777>Without adding another word, the operation began.</t6777> <t6778>For a few more minutes, the breathing continued to be stertorous.</t6778> <t6779>Then, he inhaled the air so deeply that it seemed his chest would tear apart.</t6779> <t6780>Suddenly, he opened his eyes, and they remained fixed, with a wild and helpless look.</t6780> <t6781>He stayed like that for a few moments, and then his gaze softened, showing a joyful surprise.</t6781> <t6782>A sigh of relief escaped his lips.</t6782> <t6783>He moved convulsively, and as he did, he said:</t6783>
<t6784>–I will be calm, doctor.</t6784> <t6785>Tell them to take off the straitjacket.</t6785> <t6786>I had a terrible dream and I am so weak that I can't even move.</t6786> <t6787>What is happening to my face?</t6787> <t6788>I feel it all swollen and it hurts horribly.</t6788>
<t6789>He tried to turn his head, but, due to the effort, his eyes seemed to become glassy again, and gently, I made him desist from his endeavor.</t6789> <t6790>Then, Van Helsing said in a grave and calm tone:</t6790>
<t6791>–Tell us about your dream, Mr. Renfield.</t6791>
<t6792>When she heard the professor's voice, her face lit up, despite her bruises, and she said:</t6792>
<t6793>–You are Dr. Van Helsing.</t6793> <t6794>I am very glad that you are here!</t6794> <t6795>Give me a sip of water; my lips are dry.</t6795> <t6796>Then I will tell you everything.</t6796> <t6797>I have dreamed.</t6797>
<t6798>He paused, and seemed to fade away.</t6798>
<t6799>I quietly called Quincey.</t6799>
<t6800>–The brandy!</t6800> <t6801>It's in my study... hurry up!</t6801>
<t6802>He left quickly and returned with a glass, a bottle of brandy, and a jug of water.</t6802> <t6803>We moistened the injured man's bruised lips, and he quickly regained consciousness.</t6803> <t6804>However, it seemed that his poor injured brain had been working in the meantime, because when he fully regained consciousness, he looked at me fixedly, with a terrible expression of bewilderment that I will never forget, and said to me:</t6804>
<t6805>–I must not deceive myself; it was not a dream, but a terrible reality.</t6805>
<t6806>His eyes scanned the room, and when he saw the two figures patiently sitting at the edge of the bed, he continued saying:</t6806>
<t6807>–If I weren't already sure of it, I would know it from them.</t6807>
<t6808>He closed his eyes for a moment..., not because of pain or sleep, but voluntarily, as if he were gathering all his strength; when he opened them again, he said hurriedly and with more energy than he had shown until then:</t6808>
<t6809>–Quick, doctor, quick!</t6809> <t6810>I'm dying!</t6810> <t6811>I feel like I only have a few minutes left and then I will fall dead or something worse.</t6811> <t6812>Moisten my lips with brandy again.</t6812> <t6813>I have to tell you something before I die, or before my shattered brain dies.</t6813> <t6814>Thank you!</t6814> <t6815>It happened that night, after you left here, when I begged you to let me out of the asylum.</t6815> <t6816>I couldn't speak, as I felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except for the fact that I couldn't speak, as I am now.</t6816> <t6817>I was desperate for a long time after you left my room; several hours must have passed.</t6817> <t6818>Then, I felt a sudden peace.</t6818> <t6819>My brain seemed to start working coldly again and I understood where I was.</t6819> <t6820>I heard the dogs barking behind the house, but, not where he was!</t6820>
<t6821>While the patient was speaking, Van Helsing watched him without blinking, but he reached out, took my hand, and squeezed it tightly.</t6821> <t6822>However, he did not betray himself; he nodded slightly and said in a very low voice:</t6822>
<t6823>–Continue.</t6823>
<t6824>Renfield continued saying:</t6824>
<t6825>–He came up to the window in the midst of the fog, as I had seen him before, often; but then he was something solid, not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce, like those of an enraged man.</t6825> <t6826>His red mouth was laughing and his white, sharp teeth shone under the moonlight, as he looked towards the trees, where the dogs were barking.</t6826> <t6827>I didn't ask him to come in at first, although I knew he wanted to... as he had always wanted to.</t6827> <t6828>Then, he began to promise me things... not with words but by truly making them happen.</t6828>
<t6829>He was interrupted by a word from the professor.</t6829>
<t6830>–How?</t6830>
<t6831>–Making things happen; just as he used to send me flies when the sun was shining.</t6831> <t6832>Big, fat flies, with steel and sapphires on their wings; and huge moths, at night, with skulls and crossed bones.</t6832>
<t6833>Van Helsing nodded towards the ear, at the same time whispering to me, unconsciously:</t6833>
<t6834>–The Acherontia Atropos of the Sphingidae, what you call the "death's-head hawkmoth", isn't that right?</t6834>
<t6835>The patient continued talking, without making any pause:</t6835>
<t6836>–Then he began to whisper: "Rats, rats, rats!</t6836> <t6837>Hundreds, thousands, millions of them and each one of them is a life; and dogs to eat them and also cats.</t6837> <t6838>All are life!</t6838> <t6839>All have red blood with many years of life in them; not just buzzing flies!"</t6839> <t6840>I laughed at him because I wanted to see what he could do.</t6840> <t6841>Then, the dogs howled, in the distance, beyond the dark trees, in his house.</t6841> <t6842>He made me come closer to the window.</t6842> <t6843>I stood up, looked outside, and he raised his arms and seemed to be calling someone, without uttering a single word.</t6843> <t6844>A dark mass spread over the grass and advanced like flames in a fire.</t6844> <t6845>It parted the fog to the right and left, and I could see that there were thousands and thousands of rats, with red eyes like his, only smaller.</t6845> <t6846>He kept his hand raised, and all the rats stopped; and I thought he seemed to be saying to me: "I will give you all those lives and many more and more important ones, through endless times, if you agree to bow down and worship me!"</t6846> <t6847>And then, a reddish cloud, the color of blood, seemed to place itself before my eyes and, before I knew what I was doing, I was opening the small window of that window and saying to him: "Enter, Master and Lord!"</t6847> <t6848>All the rats were gone, but he entered the room through the window, even though it was only slightly open a few centimeters..., like the moon has appeared many times through a small crack and presented itself before me in all its size and splendor.</t6848>
<t6849>His voice grew weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again and he continued speaking, but it seemed as if his memory had continued working in the interval, since his story had already advanced quite a bit when he resumed speaking.</t6849> <t6850>I was about to make him return to the point where he had left off when Van Helsing whispered to me:</t6850>
<t6851>–Let him continue.</t6851> <t6852>Do not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and he might not be able to continue at all once he loses the thread of his thoughts.</t6852>
<t6853>Renfield added:</t6853>
<t6854>–I waited all day to hear from him, but he didn't send me anything; not even a fly, and when the moon came out, I was very angry with him.</t6854> <t6855>When he came in through the window, even though it was closed, without even bothering to knock, I became very furious.</t6855> <t6856>He mocked me and his white face emerged from the mist, while his reddish eyes shone, and he walked around the room as if it all belonged to him and as if I didn't exist.</t6856> <t6857>He didn't even have the same smell when he passed by me.</t6857> <t6858>I couldn't stop him.</t6858> <t6859>I think that, somehow, Mrs. Harker had entered the room.</t6859>
<t6860>The two men who were sitting by the bed stood up and approached, staying behind the injured man, in such a way that he could not see them, but where they could hear better what he was saying.</t6860> <t6861>The two were silent, but the professor was startled and shuddered; however, his face took on a firmer and graver expression.</t6861> <t6862>Renfield continued on, unaware of anything:</t6862>
<t6863>–When Mrs. Harker came to see me that afternoon, she was not the same; she was like tea after water has been added to the teapot.</t6863>
<t6864>At that moment, all of us moved, but none of us uttered a word; Renfield continued:</t6864>
<t6865>–I didn't know she was here until she spoke to me, and she didn't seem the same.</t6865> <t6866>I'm not interested in pale people; I like them when they have a lot of blood, and it seemed like she had lost it all.</t6866> <t6867>I didn't think about it at the moment, but when she left here, I started to reflect on it and became enormously furious upon realizing that he was stealing her life.</t6867>
<t6868>I noticed that everyone present shuddered, just like I did; but, apart from that, we all remained motionless.</t6868>
<t6869>–So, when he came tonight, I was waiting for him.</t6869> <t6870>I saw the fog seeping through the window and grabbed him forcefully.</t6870> <t6871>I've heard it said that madmen have supernatural strength, and knowing that I was mad, at least sometimes, I resolved to use my power.</t6871> <t6872>He felt it too, as he had to step out of the fog to fight me.</t6872>
<t6873>I held him tightly and thought I was going to defeat him, because I didn't want him to continue stealing her life away.</t6873> <t6874>Then I saw his eyes.</t6874> <t6875>His gaze pierced through me, and my strength abandoned me.</t6875> <t6876>He broke free, and when I tried to grab him again, he lifted me into the air and let me fall.</t6876> <t6877>There was a red cloud in front of me and I heard a noise like thunder.</t6877> <t6878>The mist seemed to escape under the door.</t6878>
<t6879>Her voice was growing weaker and her breathing more labored.</t6879> <t6880>Van Helsing instinctively stood up.</t6880>
<t6881>–Now we know the worst -he said-.</t6881> <t6882>It is here, and we know its purposes.</t6882> <t6883>It may not be too late.</t6883> <t6884>We have to arm ourselves, just like the other night; but let's not waste time.</t6884> <t6885>There isn't a moment to lose.</t6885>
<t6886>There was no need to express our fears or our conviction in words…, since they were common to all of us.</t6886> <t6887>We hurried to take in our rooms the same things we had when we entered the count's house.</t6887> <t6888>The professor had his things ready, and when we gathered in the hallway, he pointed to them significantly and said:</t6888>
<t6889>–I never leave them, and I must not do so, until this unfortunate matter is concluded.</t6889> <t6890>Be prudent as well, my friends.</t6890> <t6891>We are not facing a common enemy.</t6891> <t6892>Our dear lady Mina must suffer! Alas! What a pity!</t6892>
<t6893>Outside the Harkers' door, we paused.</t6893> <t6894>Art and Quincey stayed back, and the latter asked:</t6894>
<t6895>–Should we bother her?</t6895>
<t6896>–It is necessary -said Van Helsing sadly-.</t6896> <t6897>If the door is locked, we will force it open to enter.</t6897>
<t6898>–Won't we frighten her terribly?</t6898> <t6899>It's not natural to break into a lady's room!</t6899>
<t6900>Van Helsing said solemnly:</t6900>
<t6901>–You are absolutely right, but this is a matter of life and death.</t6901> <t6902>All rooms are the same to a doctor, and even if they weren't, tonight they are all as one.</t6902> <t6903>Friend John, when you turn the knob, if the door doesn't open, would you please put your shoulder into it and force it open?</t6903> <t6904>And you too, my friends?</t6904> <t6905>Now!</t6905>
<t6906>He turned the doorknob as he spoke, but the door did not open.</t6906> <t6907>We all threw ourselves against it and, with a sharp noise, it swung wide open.</t6907>
<t6908>We fell into the room and were about to lose our balance.</t6908> <t6909>Indeed, the professor fell flat on his face, and I could see over him as he got up on his hands and knees.</t6909> <t6910>What I saw left me stunned.</t6910> <t6911>I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up like bristles; my heart seemed to stop.</t6911>
<t6912>The moonlight was so strong that, through the thick yellowish curtains, the room could be seen clearly.</t6912><t6913>On the bed, next to the window, lay Jonathan Harker, with a flushed face and breathing heavily, as if in a stupor.</t6913><t6914>Kneeling on the nearest edge of the bed that faced outside, the white figure of his wife could be distinguished.</t6914><t6915>Beside her was a tall, thin man, dressed in black.</t6915><t6916>His face was turned to the other side, but as soon as we saw him, we all recognized the count..., with all the details, including the scar on his forehead.</t6916><t6917>With his left hand, he held Mrs. Harker's two hands, pulling them along with her arms; his right hand grasped the back of her neck, forcing her to tilt her head towards his chest.</t6917><t6918>Her white nightgown was stained with blood, and a slight trickle of the same precious liquid ran down the man's bare chest, which appeared through a tear in his clothes. The posture of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten to dip its nose into a saucer of milk, to make it drink.</t6918><t6919>When we rushed into the room, the count turned his head, and on his face appeared the infernal expression I had heard described so many times.</t6919><t6920>His eyes shone, reddish, with a demonic passion; the large windows of his white, aquiline nose were distended and trembled slightly; and his sharp, white teeth, behind the thick lips of his blood-sucking mouth, were clenched, like those of a wild animal.</t6920><t6921>Turning abruptly, so that his victim fell onto the bed as if she had a weight, he lunged at us.</t6921><t6922>But by then, the professor had already stood up and was holding out the envelope that contained the Sacred Host towards him.</t6922><t6923>The count stopped suddenly, just as poor Lucy had done outside her tomb, and retreated.</t6923><t6924>He retreated as we, with crucifixes held high, advanced towards him.</t6924><t6925>The moonlight suddenly disappeared when a large black cloud moved across the sky, and when Quincey lit the gas lamp with a match, we saw nothing but a slight vapor that disappeared under the door, which, with the natural recoil after being abruptly opened, was back in its original position.</t6925><t6926>Van Helsing, Art, and I hurried towards Mrs. Harker, who by then had caught her breath and let out a scream so sharp, so piercing, and so full of despair that it seemed to me I would be able to hear it until the last moments of my own life.</t6926><t6927>For a few seconds, she remained in her posture full of helplessness and despair.</t6927><t6928>Her face was ghostly, with a pallor that was accentuated by the blood that stained her lips, her cheeks, and her chin; a thin stream of blood flowed from her neck; her eyes were wide with terror.</t6928><t6929>Then, she covered her face with her poor injured hands, which bore the red mark of the terrible pressure exerted by the count on them, and from behind her hands came a moan of desolation that made the terrible scream of a few moments earlier seem only the expression of endless pain.</t6929><t6930>Van Helsing stepped forward and gently covered the lady's body with the sheets, while Art, looking at her pale face for a moment, with despair reflected in his countenance, left the room.</t6930>
<t6931>Van Helsing whispered to me:</t6931>
<t6932>–Jonathan is a victim of a stupor as we know only the vampire can cause.</t6932> <t6933>We cannot do anything for poor Mrs. Mina for a few moments, until she recovers.</t6933> <t6934>I must wake her husband!</t6934>
<t6935>He dipped the corner of a towel in cold water and began to rub Jonathan's face.</t6935> <t6936>Meanwhile, his wife covered her pale face with both hands and sobbed in such a way that it was heartbreaking to hear her.</t6936> <t6937>I lifted the curtains and looked out the window, and at that moment I saw Quincey Morris running across the lawn and hiding behind a yew tree.</t6937> <t6938>I couldn't imagine what he was doing there; but, at that moment, I heard Harker's quick exclamation as he partially regained consciousness and turned towards the bed.</t6938> <t6939>On his face, as was very natural, there was an expression of total astonishment.</t6939> <t6940>He seemed dazed for a few moments and then it seemed that full consciousness returned to him, and he began to sit up.</t6940> <t6941>His wife sat up due to the sudden movement and turned towards him, with her arms extended as if to embrace him; however, she immediately drew them back, brought her elbows together, and covered her face again, trembling so violently that the bed shook under her body.</t6941>
<t6942>–In the name of heaven!</t6942> <t6943>What does this mean? – exclaimed Harker-.</t6943> <t6944>Doctor Seward, Doctor Van Helsing, what does this mean?</t6944> <t6945>What has happened?</t6945> <t6946>Mina, dear, what is happening?</t6946> <t6947>What does that blood mean?</t6947> <t6948>My God, my God!</t6948> <t6949>He has been here! – and getting up, he knelt and clasped his hands-.</t6949> <t6950>My God, help us! Help her! Oh, my God, help her!</t6950>
<t6951>With a quick movement, he jumped out of bed and began to get dressed.</t6951> <t6952>All his manly resolve awoke suddenly, feeling the need to spring into action immediately.</t6952>
<t6953>–What has happened?</t6953> <t6954>Explain everything to me! – he said, without pausing at all-.</t6954> <t6955>Doctor van Helsing, I know you love Mina.</t6955> <t6956>Do something to save her!</t6956> <t6957>It can't be too late.</t6957> <t6958>Take care of her, while I go to find him! – his wife, in the midst of her terror, horror, and despair, saw some certain danger for him, because, immediately, forgetting her own pain, she clung to him and screamed:</t6958>
<t6959>–No, no! Jonathan!</t6959> <t6960>You must not leave me alone!</t6960> <t6961>I have already suffered enough tonight, God knows well, without fearing that he might harm you.</t6961> <t6962>You have to stay with me!</t6962> <t6963>Stay with our friends, who will take care of you!</t6963>
<t6964>His expression became frantic as he spoke; and, while he leaned towards her, Mina made him sit on the edge of the bed, holding onto him with all her strength.</t6964>
<t6965>Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both.</t6965> <t6966>The professor held his gold crucifix in his hand and said with wonderful calmness:</t6966>
<t6967>–Do not worry, dear lady.</t6967> <t6968>We are here with you, and as long as this crucifix is by your side, no monster like those can come near you.</t6968> <t6969>You are safe tonight, and we must calm down and console each other.</t6969>
<t6970>Mrs. Harker shuddered and fell silent, keeping her head resting on her husband's chest.</t6970> <t6971>When she raised her face, her husband's white shirt was stained with blood where her lips had touched and where the small open wound on her neck had let out a few drops.</t6971>
<t6972>As soon as Mrs. Harker saw him, she recoiled with a low moan and a whisper, amidst tremendous sobs:</t6972>
<t6973>–Dirty, dirty!</t6973> <t6974>I must not touch or kiss him again.</t6974> <t6975>Oh!</t6975> <t6976>It is possible that I am now his worst enemy and that it is me whom he should fear the most.</t6976>
<t6977>Upon hearing that, Jonathan spoke with resolve.</t6977>
<t6978>–Nothing of the sort, Mina!</t6978> <t6979>I am ashamed to hear those words; I don't want you to say anything like that about yourself, nor do I want you to even think such a thing.</t6979> <t6980>May God judge me harshly and punish me with suffering even greater than that of these moments, if by any act or word of mine there is a separation between us!</t6980>
<t6981>He extended his arms and drew her to his chest.</t6981> <t6982>For a few moments, his wife remained embraced by him, sobbing.</t6982> <t6983>Jonathan looked at us over his wife's bowed head, with bright eyes that blinked incessantly, while the windows of his nose trembled convulsively and his mouth took on the hardness of steel.</t6983> <t6984>After a few moments, Mrs. Harker's sobs became less frequent and softer, and then Jonathan said to me, speaking with a studied calm that must have been putting his nerves to a severe test:</t6984>
<t6985>–And now, Dr. Seward, tell me everything that happened.</t6985> <t6986>I already know all too well what occurred, but please recount all the details.</t6986>
<t6987>I explained to him exactly what had happened and he listened to me with forced impassibility, but his nostrils trembled and his eyes shone when I explained how the count's hands held his wife in that terrible and horrendous position, with his mouth pressed against the open wound on her throat.</t6987> <t6988>It interested me, even at that moment, to see that, although the face white with passion was convulsively contorted over Mrs. Harker's bowed head, the hands gently and lovingly caressed his wife's curly hair.</t6988>
<t6989>When I finished speaking, Quincey and Godalming knocked on the door.</t6989> <t6990>They entered after we gave them permission to do so.</t6990> <t6991>Van Helsing looked at me questioningly.</t6991> <t6992>I understood that he wanted to indicate to me that it might be convenient to take advantage of the arrival of our two friends to distract the attention of the troubled spouses, so that they would not focus on each other for the moment; thus, when I gave him a nod of agreement, the professor asked the newcomers what they had seen or done.</t6992> <t6993>Lord Godalming responded:</t6993>
<t6994>–I didn't find him in the hallway or in any of our rooms.</t6994> <t6995>I looked in the study; but, even if he had been there, he was already gone.</t6995> <t6996>However…</t6996>
<t6997>He remained silent for a moment, looking at the poor figure lying on the bed.</t6997> <t6998>Van Helsing said to him gravely:</t6998>
<t6999>–Continue, friend Arthur.</t6999> <t7000>We must not hide anything else.</t7000> <t7001>Our hope now rests on knowing everything.</t7001> <t7002>Speak freely!</t7002>
<t7003>Therefore, Art continued:</t7003>
<t7004>–He had been there and, although he could only stay for a few seconds, he put the entire study in disarray.</t7004> <t7005>All the manuscripts have been burned and the blue flames were still licking the white ashes -he paused-.</t7005> <t7006>Thank God the other copy is in the safe!</t7006>
<t7007>His face lit up for a moment, but then he grew sad again as he added:</t7007>
<t7008>–I then ran downstairs, but I found no sign of him.</t7008> <t7009>I looked in Renfield's room, but... there was no trace of him, except... -he fell silent again.</t7009>
<t7010>–Continue -Harker said, with a hoarse voice.</t7010>
<t7011>Lord Godalming nodded, licked his lips, and continued:</t7011>
<t7012>–Except that the poor guy is dead.</t7012>
<t7013>Mrs. Harker raised her head, looked at each of us one by one, and said solemnly:</t7013>
<t7014>–Let God's will be done!</t7014>
<t7015>I couldn't stop thinking that Art was hiding something from us, but since I assumed he was doing it for a specific purpose, I didn't say anything.</t7015> <t7016>Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked him:</t7016>
<t7017>–And you, friend Quincey, don't you have anything to tell us?</t7017>
<t7018>–A little -said Morris-.</t7018> <t7019>It might be something important, but, for the moment, I can't be sure.</t7019> <t7020>I thought it would be convenient to know where the count was going when he left the house.</t7020> <t7021>I didn't see him, but I noticed a bat flying up from Renfield's window and heading west.</t7021> <t7022>I expected to see him return to Carfax in one of his forms, but evidently, he went to some other refuge.</t7022> <t7023>He won't return tonight, as the sky is beginning to redden in the east and dawn is approaching.</t7023> <t7024>We must work tomorrow!</t7024>
<t7025>He pronounced the last words through clenched teeth.</t7025> <t7026>For about two minutes, silence reigned, and I imagined that we could hear the sound produced by the beating of our hearts.</t7026> <t7027>Then, Van Helsing, gently placing his hand on Mrs. Harker's head, said:</t7027>
<t7028>–Now, dear Mrs. Harker, tell us exactly what has happened.</t7028> <t7029>God knows I do not want to cause you any pain, but we must know everything, as now, more than ever, we have to carry out all the work with speed and efficiency and with deadly urgency.</t7029> <t7030>The day is approaching when everything must be finished, if possible, and if we have the chance to live and learn.</t7030>
<t7031>The poor lady shuddered violently, and I could notice the tension in her nerves as she clung to her husband more tightly, causing her head to lower even further onto his chest.</t7031> <t7032>Then, she raised her head proudly and extended a hand which Van Helsing took, and, bowing, he kissed it respectfully and held it between his own hands.</t7032> <t7033>Mrs. Harker's other hand was held by one of her husband's, who, with his other arm, encircled her waist protectively.</t7033> <t7034>After a pause during which she was obviously organizing her thoughts, she began:</t7034>
<t7035>–I took the drug that you so kindly gave me, but for quite some time it had no effect.</t7035> <t7036>I seemed to be more and more awake, and countless phantoms began to fill my imagination...</t7036> <t7037>All of them related to death and vampires, to blood, pain, and despair -her husband involuntarily grunted, while she turned to Jonathan and lovingly said-: Don't get upset, darling.</t7037> <t7038>You must be brave and strong to help me through this terrible ordeal.</t7038> <t7039>If you knew what a great effort it takes for me to simply talk about this horrible matter, you would understand how much I need your help.</t7039> <t7040>Well, I realized that I had to try to help the medicine take effect through my own willpower if I wanted it to be of any use to me.</t7040> <t7041>Therefore, resolutely, I tried to sleep.</t7041> <t7042>I'm sure I must have fallen asleep immediately, as I don't remember anything else.</t7042> <t7043>Jonathan, upon entering, did not wake me, as my next memory is that he was beside me.</t7043> <t7044>There was the same light mist in the room that I had seen before.</t7044> <t7045>But I don't remember if you are aware of it; you will find everything about it in my diary, which I will show you later.</t7045> <t7046>The same vague terror as before seized me, and I had the same feeling that there was someone in the room.</t7046> <t7047>I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he was sleeping so deeply that it seemed it was he, not I, who had taken the drug.</t7047>
<t7048>I tried as hard as I could, but I couldn't get him to wake up.</t7048> <t7049>That made me very scared and I looked around, terrified.</t7049> <t7050>Then, my heart skipped a beat: beside the bed, as if he had emerged from the mist or rather, as if the mist had transformed into him, since it had completely disappeared, there was a tall and thin man, dressed in black.</t7050> <t7051>I recognized him immediately from the description given to me by the others.</t7051> <t7052>By his wax-like white face; the long, aquiline nose, over which the light formed a thin white line; the slightly parted lips, between which appeared sharp, white teeth and the red eyes that I seemed to have seen at sunset in St. Mary's Church, in Whitby.</t7052> <t7053>I also knew the red scar he had on his forehead, where Jonathan had struck him.</t7053> <t7054>For a moment, my heart stopped and I wanted to scream, but I was paralyzed.</t7054> <t7055>Meanwhile, the monster spoke, with a dry and sharp whisper, pointing at Jonathan with his finger:</t7055>
<t7056>"-Silence!</t7056> <t7057>If you utter a single sound, I will catch him and crush his head."</t7057>
<t7058>"I was terrified and too stunned to be able to do or say anything.</t7058> <t7059>With a mocking smile, he put a hand on my shoulder and, holding me firmly, bared my throat with the other, saying at the same time:</t7059>
<t7060>"-First, a small refreshment, as payment for my efforts.</t7060> <t7061>It would be best if you remain still; it is neither the first nor the second time that your veins have quenched my thirst.</t7061>
<t7062>"I was bewildered and, strange as it may seem, I did not wish to disturb him.</t7062> <t7063>I suppose it is part of his terrible power when he is preying on one of his victims.</t7063> <t7064>And, oh my God, oh my God, have mercy on me!</t7064> <t7065>He pressed his disgusting lips to my throat!</t7065>
<t7066>"I felt my strength leaving me and I was half-fainting.</t7066> <t7067>I don't know how long that terrible scene lasted, but it seemed to me that a good while passed before he withdrew his disgusting, foul-smelling, and dirty mouth.</t7067> <t7068>I saw that it was full of fresh blood!"</t7068>
<t7069>The memory seemed to be more than she could bear, and she would have collapsed if not for her husband's arm supporting her.</t7069> <t7070>With great effort, she composed herself and continued speaking:</t7070>
<t7071>–Then, he spoke to me mockingly: "So, you, like the others, wanted to pit your intelligence against mine!</t7071> <t7072>You wanted to help those men annihilate me and thwart my plans!</t7072> <t7073>Now you know, and they all know in part and will fully know before long, what it means to cross my path.</t7073> <t7074>They should have saved their energies to use them closer to their homes.</t7074> <t7075>While they were making plans to confront me…</t7075> <t7076>Me, who has directed nations, intrigued for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were born, I was sabotaging them.</t7076> <t7077>And you, the beloved of all of them, are now mine; you are flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood, kin of my kin; my wine press for a certain time; and later, you will be my companion and helper.</t7077> <t7078>You will be avenged in turn, for none of them will be able to meet your needs.</t7078> <t7079>But now I must punish you for what you have done by allying with the others to fight me.</t7079> <t7080>From now on, you will come at my call.</t7080> <t7081>When my mind commands, thinking of you, you will cross lands and seas if necessary to come to my side and do my will, and to ensure it, look at what I do!"</t7081> <t7082>Then, he opened his shirt, and with his long and sharp nails, he opened a vein in his chest.</t7082> <t7083>When the blood began to flow, he took my hands in one of his, squeezed them firmly, and with his free hand, grabbed me by the neck and forced my mouth against his wound, so that I either choked or was forced to swallow… Oh, my God!</t7083> <t7084>My God!</t7084> <t7085>What have I done?</t7085> <t7086>What have I done to deserve such a fate, I, who have tried to stay on the straight path all the days of my life?</t7086> <t7087>Have mercy on me, my God!</t7087> <t7088>Look down upon my poor soul that is subject to a danger more than mortal!</t7088> <t7089>Have compassion on me!</t7089>
<t7090>Then, he began to rub his lips, as if to avoid contamination.</t7090>
<t7091>While narrating his terrible story, the sky to the east began to brighten, and all the details of the room started to appear more clearly.</t7091> <t7092>Harker remained motionless and silent, but on his face, as the terrible tale progressed, a grayish expression appeared that deepened as the daylight became clearer; when the reddish glow of dawn intensified, his skin stood out, very dark, against his hair, which was turning white.</t7092>
<t7093>We have made arrangements for one of us to always be attentive to the call of the unhappy couple, until we can all gather and prepare everything necessary to take action.</t7093> <t7094>I am sure that the sun will not rise today over any house more steeped in sadness than this one.</t7094>
<t7095>XXII.–</t7095> <t7096>FROM THE JOURNAL OF JONATHAN HARKER</t7096>
<t7097>October 3rd.</t7097> <t7098>I have to do something, if I don't want to go crazy; that's why I am writing in this diary.</t7098> <t7099>It is now six in the morning, and we have to meet in the study in half an hour to eat something, since Dr. Seward and Professor Van Helsing agree that if we don't eat anything, we won't be in a condition to do our best work.</t7099> <t7100>God knows that today we will need to give our best.</t7100> <t7101>I have to keep writing, no matter what, as I cannot stop to think.</t7101> <t7102>Everything, the small details as well as the big ones, must be recorded; perhaps the insignificant details will be the ones that help us the most later on.</t7102> <t7103>The teachings, good or bad, could not have harmed Mina and me more than what we are suffering today.</t7103> <t7104>However, we must have hope and trust.</t7104> <t7105>Poor Mina just told me a moment ago, with tears running down her beloved cheeks, that it is in adversity and misfortune that we must show our faith...</t7105> <t7106>That we must continue to have trust, and that God will help us to the end.</t7106> <t7107>The end! Oh, my God!</t7107> <t7108>What end...?</t7108> <t7109>To work!</t7109> <t7110>To work!</t7110>
<t7111>When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward returned from their visit to poor Renfield, we gravely discussed what needed to be done.</t7111> <t7112>First, Dr. Seward told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had descended to the room on the lower floor, they had found Renfield lying on the ground.</t7112> <t7113>His face was all bruised and crushed, and the bones of his nose were broken.</t7113>
<t7114>Dr. Seward asked the assistant who was on duty in the hallway if he had heard anything.</t7114> <t7115>The assistant told him that he had been sitting and was half-asleep when he heard loud voices in the patient's room and Renfield shouting loudly several times: "God! God! God!"</t7115> <t7116>After that, he heard the noise of a fall, and when he entered the room, he found him lying on the floor, face down, just as the doctor had seen him.</t7116> <t7117>Van Helsing asked him if he had heard "voices" or "a single voice" and the assistant said he was not sure; at first, it seemed to him that there were two, but since there was only one person in the room, it had to be just one.</t7117> <t7118>He could swear, if necessary, that the word uttered by the patient had been "God!".</t7118> <t7119>Dr. Seward told us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into details about this matter; it was necessary to consider the possibility of an inquest, and it would not contribute anything to proving the truth, since no one would be able to believe it.</t7119> <t7120>Under such circumstances, he thought that, based on the assistant's statements, he could issue a death certificate for an accident, due to a fall from his bed.</t7120> <t7121>If the coroner required it, there would be an inquest that would lead to exactly the same result.</t7121>
<t7122>When we began to discuss what our next step should be, the first thing we decided was that Mina should be fully trusted and kept informed of everything; that nothing, absolutely nothing, no matter how horrible or painful it might be, should be hidden from her.</t7122> <t7123>She herself agreed on the advisability of such a measure, and it was truly a pity to see her so brave and, at the same time, so full of pain and despair.</t7123>
<t7124>–You must not hide anything from me -he said-.</t7124> <t7125>Unfortunately, too many things have already been hidden from me.</t7125> <t7126>Besides, there is nothing in the world that can cause me greater pain than what I have had to endure… that I am still suffering!</t7126> <t7127>Whatever happens, it will mean comfort and a renewal of my hopes for me!</t7127>
<t7128>Van Helsing was staring at her intently while he spoke, and said suddenly, though gently:</t7128>
<t7129>–But, dear Mrs. Mina, aren't you afraid, if not for yourself, at least for others, after what has happened?</t7129>
<t7130>Mina's face hardened, but her eyes shone with the same devotion as a martyr's when she replied:</t7130>
<t7131>–No! My mind has already gotten used to the idea!</t7131>
<t7132>–To what idea? – asked the professor softly, while we all remained motionless, as each of us, in our own way, had a slight idea of what he wanted to say.</t7132>
<t7133>His response was given with complete simplicity, as if he were merely stating a certain fact:</t7133>
<t7134>–Because if I find in myself (and I will watch myself very carefully) any sign that I might be the cause of harm to someone I love, I must die!</t7134>
<t7135>–Will you kill yourself? – asked Van Helsing, with a hoarse voice.</t7135>
<t7136>–I will do it, if there is no friend who wishes to save me, sparing me that pain and that desperate effort.</t7136>
<t7137>Mina looked at the professor gravely as she spoke.</t7137> <t7138>Van Helsing was seated, but suddenly stood up, approached her, and, gently placing his hand on her head, solemnly declared:</t7138>
<t7139>–My friend, there is someone who would be willing to do it if it were for your own good.</t7139> <t7140>Since I myself would be willing to answer for such an act before God, if euthanasia for you, even at this very moment, were the best, if it were necessary.</t7140> <t7141>But, dear lady…</t7141>
<t7142>For a moment, he seemed to be a victim of an emotional shock, and a huge sob was stifled in his throat; he swallowed hard and continued:</t7142>
<t7143>–There are several people here who would stand between you and death.</t7143> <t7144>You must not die in any way, and even less so by your own hand.</t7144> <t7145>As long as the other, who has poisoned the sweetness of your life, has not died, you must not die either; because if he still exists among the living dead, your death would turn you into exactly the same as he is.</t7145> <t7146>No! You must live!</t7146> <t7147>You must fight and strive to live, as death would be an unspeakable horror.</t7147> <t7148>You must fight against death, whether it comes to you in the midst of sadness or joy; by day or by night; safe or in danger.</t7148> <t7149>For the salvation of your soul, I beg you not to die and not even to think of death, as long as that monster has not ceased to exist!</t7149>
<t7150>My poor and beloved wife turned pale as a corpse and shuddered violently, just as I had seen the quicksand shudder when someone fell into it.</t7150> <t7151>We all remained silent; there was nothing we could do.</t7151> <t7152>Finally, Mina calmed down a bit, turned to the professor, and said sweetly, though with infinite sadness, while Dr. Van Helsing took her hand:</t7152>
<t7153>–I promise you, my friend, that if God allows me to continue living, I will strive to do so, until, if it is His will, this horror has ended for me.</t7153>
<t7154>In the face of such a good and courageous attitude, we all felt our hearts strengthen, preparing us to work and endure everything for her.</t7154> <t7155>And we began to deliberate on what we should do.</t7155> <t7156>I told Mina that she had to store all the documents in the safe and all the papers, journals, or phonograph cylinders that we might use later, and that she should take charge of keeping everything in order, as she had done before. I saw that she liked the prospect of having something to do... if the verb "like" can be used in relation to such a horrendous matter.</t7156>
<t7157>As usual, Van Helsing had gotten ahead of us all and was prepared with an exact plan for our work.</t7157>
<t7158>–It is perhaps very convenient that when we visited Carfax we decided not to touch the boxes of earth that were there -he said-.</t7158> <t7159>If we had done so, the count could have guessed our intentions and, without a doubt, would have taken the pertinent measures in advance to thwart a similar effort regarding the other boxes, but now, he does not know our intentions.</t7159>
<t7160>Moreover, in all likelihood, he does not know that we have the power to sterilize his refuges, so that he cannot use them again.</t7160> <t7161>We have advanced so much in our knowledge about the arrangement of those boxes that when we have visited the house in Piccadilly, we will be able to trace the last of the boxes.</t7161> <t7162>Therefore, today is ours, and in it rest our hopes.</t7162> <t7163>The sun that rises over us, amidst our sorrow, guides us in its course.</t7163> <t7164>Until the sun sets tonight, the monster must retain the form it now has.</t7164> <t7165>He is confined within the limitations of his earthly shell.</t7165> <t7166>He cannot turn into air, nor disappear through holes, openings, cracks, or crevices.</t7166> <t7167>To pass through a door, he has to open it, like all mortals.</t7167> <t7168>Therefore, we must find all his refuges today, to sterilize them.</t7168> <t7169>Then, if we have not yet caught and destroyed him, we will have to trap him in some place where his capture and annihilation will be certain, at the appropriate time.</t7169>
<t7170>At that moment I stood up, because it was impossible for me to contain myself thinking that the seconds and minutes that were charged with the precious life of my beloved Mina and her happiness were passing, since while we were talking, it was impossible for us to take any action.</t7170> <t7171>But Van Helsing raised a hand, restraining me.</t7171>
<t7172>–No, friend Jonathan -he told me-.</t7172> <t7173>In this case, the quickest way to get home is the longest, as you say.</t7173> <t7174>We will all have to act with desperate speed when the time comes to do so.</t7174> <t7175>But I believe that the key to this whole matter is, in all probability, in his house in Piccadilly.</t7175> <t7176>The count must have acquired several houses, and we must have the purchase receipts, the keys, and various other things for all of them.</t7176> <t7177>He will have paper to write on and his checkbook.</t7177> <t7178>There are many things he must have somewhere and, why not in that central, quiet place, where he can enter or leave, from the front or the back, at any time, in such a way that in the midst of the intense traffic, no one even notices him?</t7178> <t7179>We must go there and search that house and, when we know what it contains, we will do what our friend Arthur would say, referring to the hunt: "close the grounds," to chase our old fox.</t7179> <t7180>Does that sound good to you?</t7180>
<t7181>–"Then, let's go immediately!" – I shouted-.</t7181> <t7182>"We are losing precious time!"</t7182>
<t7183>The professor did not move, but simply said:</t7183>
<t7184>–And how are we going to be able to enter that house on Piccadilly?</t7184>
<t7185>–In any case! – I exclaimed-.</t7185> <t7186>By breaking in, if necessary.</t7186>
<t7187>–And your police, where will they be and what will they say?</t7187>
<t7188>I was desperate, but I knew that if I waited, I had a good reason to do so.</t7188> <t7189>Consequently, I said, with all the calm I could muster:</t7189>
<t7190>–Do not wait longer than strictly necessary.</t7190> <t7191>I am sure you are perfectly aware of the torture I am being subjected to.</t7191>
<t7192>–You can be sure of that, my friend!</t7192> <t7193>And believe me, I have no desire to add even more suffering to what you are already enduring.</t7193> <t7194>But we have to think before we act, until the moment when everyone is in motion.</t7194> <t7195>Then the right moment will come to take action.</t7195> <t7196>I have thought a lot, and it seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all.</t7196> <t7197>We want to enter the house, but we don't have a key.</t7197> <t7198>Isn't that so?</t7198>
<t7199>I nodded.</t7199>
<t7200>–Suppose now that you were really the owner of the house, that you had lost the key and that you had no criminal intent, since you would be within your rights…</t7200> <t7201>What would you do?</t7201>
<t7202>–I would look for a respectable locksmith and put him to work to grant me entry.</t7202>
<t7203>–But the police would intervene, wouldn't they?</t7203>
<t7204>–No!</t7204> <t7205>I wouldn't intervene, knowing that the locksmith was working for the owner of the house.</t7205>
<t7206>–Then -he looked at me intently, while continuing -, all that will be in doubt is the conscience and opinion of the police as to whether it is the owner who called the locksmith and the opinion of the police as to whether the craftsman is working in accordance with the laws or not.</t7206> <t7207>Your police must be composed of careful and intelligent men, extraordinarily intelligent to read the human heart, if they are to be sure of what they should do.</t7207> <t7208>No, no, my friend Jonathan, you can go and open the locks of a hundred empty houses in your London or any city in the world, and if you do it in such a way that it seems correct, no one will intervene at all.</t7208> <t7209>I have read something about a gentleman who had a beautiful house in London and when he went to spend the summer months in Switzerland, leaving his house closed, a criminal broke one of the back windows and entered.</t7209> <t7210>Then he went to the front, opened the windows, raised the shutters, and walked out the front door, right in front of the police.</t7210> <t7211>Next, he held a public auction in the house, advertised it in all the newspapers, and when the appointed day came, he sold all the possessions of the gentleman who was away.</t7211> <t7212>Then, he went to see a builder and sold him the house, establishing the agreement that it should be demolished and all the debris removed before a certain date.</t7212> <t7213>Both the police and the rest of the English authorities helped him as much as they could.</t7213> <t7214>When the real owner returned from Switzerland, he found only an empty lot where his house had been.</t7214> <t7215>That crime was carried out in régle, and our work must also be carried out in régle.</t7215> <t7216>We must not go so early that the police suspect our actions; on the contrary, we must go after ten in the morning, when there are many officers around us, and we will behave as if we were really the owners of the house.</t7216>
<t7217>I couldn't help but understand that he was absolutely right, and even the terrible despair reflected on Mina's face softened a bit, due to the hopes that could be harbored in such a good advisor.</t7217> <t7218>Van Helsing continued:</t7218>
<t7219>–Once inside the house, we can find more clues and, in any case, one of us can stay there while the others go to visit the other places where the other boxes of earth are located... in Bermondsey and in Mile End.</t7219>
<t7220>Lord Godalming stood up.</t7220>
<t7221>–I can be of some use to you in this case -he said-.</t7221> <t7222>I can get in touch with my people to obtain horses and carts as soon as necessary.</t7222>
<t7223>–Listen, my friend -Morris intervened-, it's a good idea to have everything ready in case we need to retreat hastily on horseback, but don't you think that any of your vehicles, with their heraldic decorations, would attract too much attention for our purposes on any side road in Walworth or Mile End?</t7223> <t7224>It seems to me that it would be better to take rental cars when we go south or west; and even leave them somewhere near the point we are heading to.</t7224>
<t7225>–Our friend Quincey is right! – said the professor -.</t7225> <t7226>His head is, as they say, level with the horizon.</t7226> <t7227>We are about to undertake delicate work, and it is not convenient for people to observe us, if it can be avoided.</t7227>
<t7228>Mina was becoming increasingly interested in all the details, and I was glad that the demands of these matters were helping her forget the terrible experience she had had that night.</t7228> <t7229>She was extremely pale... almost spectral and so thin that her lips were drawn back, making her teeth stand out in a certain way.</t7229> <t7230>I didn't mention anything, to avoid causing her deep pain, but I felt my blood freeze in my veins at the thought of what had happened to poor Lucy when the Count had sucked the blood from her veins.</t7230> <t7231>There were still no signs that her teeth were beginning to sharpen, but not much time had passed yet and there was reason to fear.</t7231>
<t7232>When we arrived at the discussion about the sequence of our efforts and the arrangement of our forces, new doubts arose.</t7232> <t7233>Finally, we agreed that before going to Piccadilly, we had to destroy the refuge that the count had nearby.</t7233> <t7234>In the event that he realized too soon what we were doing, we should already be ahead in our work of destruction, and his presence, in his natural form and at the moment of greatest weakness, could still provide us with more useful indications.</t7234>
<t7235>Regarding the disposition of our forces, the professor suggested that, after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly; that the two doctors and I should remain there, while Quincey and Lord Godalming went to find and destroy the refuges in Walworth and Mile End.</t7235> <t7236>It was possible, though not probable, that the Count would appear in Piccadilly during the day and, in that case, we would be in a position to finish him off right there.</t7236> <t7237>In any case, we would be in a position to follow him together.</t7237> <t7238>I objected to this plan, regarding my movements, since I intended to stay and take care of Mina; I thought I was firmly decided on this; but she would not even listen to that objection.</t7238> <t7239>She said that it was possible that some legal matter might arise in which I could be useful; that among the Count's papers there might be some clue that I could interpret due to my stay in Transylvania and that, in any case, we should employ all the forces at our disposal to confront the tremendous power of the monster.</t7239> <t7240>I had to give in, as Mina had made up her mind about it; she said that her last hope was that we could all work together.</t7240>
<t7241>–As for me -he said-, I am not afraid.</t7241> <t7242>Things have already been so extremely bad that they cannot get worse, and whatever happens must contain some element of hope or consolation.</t7242> <t7243>Go, my husband!</t7243> <t7244>God, if He wills it, can help and defend me just as well if I am alone as if I am accompanied by all of you.</t7244>
<t7245>Therefore, I began to shout again:</t7245>
<t7246>–Then, in the name of heaven, let's go immediately!</t7246> <t7247>We are wasting time!</t7247> <t7248>The count may reach Piccadilly sooner than we think.</t7248>
<t7249>–Absolutely not! – said van Helsing, raising a hand.</t7249>
<t7250>“Why not?” I inquired.</t7250>
<t7251>"Do you forget that last night there was a great banquet and that, consequently, he will sleep until a very late hour?" he said with a smile.</t7251>
<t7252>I did not forget it!</t7252> <t7253>Will I ever forget it... will I be able to forget it?</t7253> <t7254>Will any of us ever be able to forget that terrible scene?</t7254> <t7255>Mina made a powerful effort not to lose control, but the pain overcame her and she covered her face with both hands, trembling and moaning.</t7255> <t7256>Van Helsing had not intended to recall that terrible experience.</t7256> <t7257>He had simply forgotten about it and the part he had played, due to his mental effort.</t7257> <t7258>When he realized what he had just said, he was horrified by his lack of tact and tried to console my wife.</t7258>
<t7259>–Oh, Mrs. Mina! – he said.</t7259> <t7260>You don't know how sorry I am that I, who respect you so much, could have said something so unpleasant!</t7260> <t7261>My stupid old lips and my useless head do not deserve your forgiveness; but you will forget it, won't you?</t7261>
<t7262>The professor leaned deeply beside her as he spoke.</t7262> <t7263>Mina took his hand and, looking at him through a veil of tears, said to him in a hoarse voice:</t7263>
<t7264>–No, I must not forget it, since it is only right that I remember; besides, amidst all of it, there are many things about you that are very sweet, I must remember everything.</t7264> <t7265>Now, all of you must leave soon.</t7265> <t7266>Breakfast is ready and we all need to eat something to stay strong.</t7266>
<t7267>Breakfast was a strange meal for all of us.</t7267> <t7268>We tried to appear cheerful and encourage each other, and Mina was the most cheerful and courageous of all.</t7268> <t7269>When we finished, Van Helsing stood up and said:</t7269>
<t7270>–Now, my friends, let us set out to undertake our terrible task.</t7270> <t7271>Are we all armed, as we were the day we first went together to visit the Carfax refuge, armed against both spiritual and physical attacks?</t7271>
<t7272>We all nodded.</t7272>
<t7273>–Very well.</t7273> <t7274>Now, Mrs. Mina, you are completely safe here until sunset and I will return before that time... yes... We will all return!</t7274> <t7275>But, before we leave, I want you to be armed against personal attacks.</t7275> <t7276>I myself, while you were away, have prepared your room, placing things that we know prevent the monster from entering.</t7276> <t7277>Now, let me protect you personally.</t7277> <t7278>On your forehead, I place this fragment of the Sacred Host, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the...</t7278>
<t7279>A scream of terror occurred that almost froze the blood in our veins.</t7279> <t7280>When the professor placed the Host on Mina's forehead, it had pierced her... it had burned my wife's forehead, as if it were red-hot metal.</t7280> <t7281>My poor Mina immediately understood the meaning of that act, at the same time that her nervous system received the physical pain, and the two feelings overwhelmed her so much that they were expressed in that terrible scream.</t7281> <t7282>But the words that accompanied her thought came quickly.</t7282> <t7283>The echo of her scream had not yet completely ceased when the reaction occurred, and she collapsed to her knees on the ground, humbling herself.</t7283>
<t7284>She threw her beautiful hair over her face, as if to cover the wound, and exclaimed:</t7284>
<t7285>–Dirty! Dirty!</t7285> <t7286>Even the Almighty punishes my corrupted flesh!</t7286> <t7287>I will have to bear this mark of shame on my forehead until Judgment Day!</t7287>
<t7288>Everyone fell silent.</t7288> <t7289>I myself had thrown myself beside her, in the midst of true agony, feeling powerless, and, surrounding her with my arms, I held her tightly embraced to me.</t7289> <t7290>For a few minutes, our anguished hearts beat in unison, while the friends who were near us turned their tear-filled eyes away.</t7290> <t7291>Then, van Helsing turned and said gravely, in such a serious tone that I couldn't help but think he was being inspired in some way, and was declaring something that did not come from himself:</t7291>
<t7292>–It is possible that you may have to bear that mark until God Himself wills it or for you to see it during the Final Judgment, when He rectifies all the wrongs of the earth and of His children whom He has placed upon it.</t7292> <t7293>And my dear Mrs. Mina, I wish that all of us who love you could be present when that reddish scar disappears, leaving your forehead as clean and pure as the heart that we all know!</t7293> <t7294>For I am as sure as I am alive that this scar will vanish as soon as God decides that the burden that overwhelms us should be lifted.</t7294> <t7295>Until then, we will bear our cross as His Son did, obeying His will.</t7295> <t7296>It is possible that we are chosen instruments of His good will and that we obey His command amidst stigmas and shames; amidst tears and blood; amidst doubts and fears, and through all that makes God and men different.</t7296>
<t7297>There was hope in his words and also comfort.</t7297> <t7298>Moreover, they invited us to resign ourselves.</t7298> <t7299>Mina and I understood it that way and, simultaneously, each of us took one of the old man's hands and kissed it humbly.</t7299> <t7300>Then, without uttering a single word, we all knelt together and, holding hands, swore to be sincere with one another and asked for help and guidance in the terrible task that awaited us.</t7300> <t7301>All the men strove to lift from Mina the veil of deep sadness that enveloped her, because we all, each in our own way, loved her.</t7301>
<t7302>It was time to leave.</t7302> <t7303>So, I bid farewell to Mina in such a way that neither of us will be able to forget it until the day we die, and we left.</t7303> <t7304>There was something I was already prepared for: if we finally discovered that Mina had become a vampire, then she should not go alone to that terrible and unknown land.</t7304> <t7305>I suppose that was how, in ancient times, a vampire turned into many; only because their horrible bodies had to rest in holy ground, likewise the most sacred love was the best sergeant for recruiting their spectral army.</t7305>
<t7306>We entered Carfax without difficulty and found everything exactly the same as the first time we were in the mansion.</t7306> <t7307>It was hard to believe that amidst that prosaic atmosphere of neglect, dust, and decay, there could be a basis for a horror like the one we already knew.</t7307> <t7308>If our minds were not already prepared and if we were not spurred by terrible memories, I don't think we could have carried out our task.</t7308> <t7309>We found no papers or any signs of use in the house, and in the old chapel, the large boxes seemed to be exactly the same as we had seen them the last time.</t7309> <t7310>Dr. Van Helsing told us solemnly, as we stood before them:</t7310>
<t7311>–Now, my friends, we have a duty to fulfill here.</t7311> <t7312>We must sterilize this land, so full of sacred relics, which have been brought from distant lands to be used.</t7312> <t7313>He has chosen this land because it has been blessed.</t7313> <t7314>Therefore, we are going to defeat him with his own weapons, sanctifying it even more.</t7314> <t7315>It was sanctified for the use of man, and now we are going to sanctify it for God.</t7315>
<t7316>While he was speaking, he took a screwdriver and a key out of his pocket, and very soon, the lid of one of the boxes was lifted.</t7316> <t7317>The soil had an unpleasant smell, due to the time it had been enclosed, but that did not seem to matter to any of us, as all our attention was focused on the professor.</t7317> <t7318>Taking a piece of the Sacred Host out of his pocket, he placed it reverently on the soil and then, putting the lid back in its place, began to screw it back on.</t7318>
<t7319>We help him with his work.</t7319>
<t7320>One after another, we did the same with all the large boxes and, apparently, left them exactly as we had found them, but inside each one of them was a piece of Host.</t7320> <t7321>When we closed the door behind us, the professor said solemnly:</t7321>
<t7322>–This work is finished.</t7322> <t7323>It is possible that we will achieve the same success in other places, and thus, perhaps by the time the sun sets today, Mrs. Mina's forehead will be white as ivory and without the stigma.</t7323>
<t7324>As we walked over the grass, on our way to the station to catch the train, we saw the facade of the asylum.</t7324> <t7325>I looked anxiously, and in the window of our room, I saw Mina.</t7325>
<t7326>I waved at her and gave her a nod to let her know that our work there had been satisfactorily completed.</t7326> <t7327>She made a gesture in response to indicate that she had understood.</t7327> <t7328>The last thing I saw of her was that she was waving at me.</t7328> <t7329>We searched for the station with hearts full of sadness and hurriedly boarded the train, as by the time we arrived, it was already by the station platform, preparing to set off again.</t7329> <t7330>I have written all this on the train.</t7330>
<t7331>Piccadilly, twelve thirty sharp.</t7331> <t7332>Shortly before we arrived at Fenchurch Street, Lord Godalming said to me:</t7332>
<t7333>–Quincey and I are going to find a locksmith.</t7333> <t7334>It would be better if you didn't come with us, in case any difficulty arises, since, under the current circumstances, it wouldn't be too bad for us to break into an unoccupied house.</t7334> <t7335>But you are a lawyer, and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you should have known better.</t7335>
<t7336>I protested, because I did not wish to stop sharing any danger with them, but he continued saying:</t7336>
<t7337>–Besides, we will attract much less attention if there are not too many of us.</t7337> <t7338>My title will help me a lot in hiring the locksmith and dealing with any police that might be in the vicinity.</t7338> <t7339>It would be better if you go with Jack and the professor and stay in Green Park, somewhere you can see the house, and when you see that the door has been opened and the locksmith has left, come over.</t7339> <t7340>We will be waiting for you and will open the door as soon as you arrive.</t7340>
<t7341>–The advice is good! – said Van Helsing.</t7341>
<t7342>Therefore, we did not discuss the matter any further.</t7342> <t7343>Godalming and Morris went ahead in a hired carriage, and the rest of us followed in another.</t7343> <t7344>At the corner of Arlington Street, our group got out of the vehicle and we entered Green Park.</t7344>
<t7345>My heart pounded when I saw the house where our hopes were centered, standing out, sinister and silent, in a state of abandonment, among the more cheerful and lively buildings of the neighborhood.</t7345> <t7346>We sat on a bench, in view of the house, and began to smoke some cigars, in order to attract as little attention as possible.</t7346> <t7347>The minutes felt eternal as we waited for the others to arrive.</t7347>
<t7348>Finally, we saw a four-wheeled car stopping nearby.</t7348> <t7349>From it, lord Godalming and Morris calmly disembarked, and from the driver's seat descended a stout man dressed in work clothes, carrying a box with the necessary tools for his task.</t7349> <t7350>Morris paid the coachman, who touched the brim of his cap and left.</t7350> <t7351>They ascended the steps together, and lord Godalming told the worker exactly what he wanted him to do.</t7351> <t7352>The worker took off his jacket, placed it calmly over the porch railing, and said something to a police officer who happened to be passing by at that precise moment.</t7352> <t7353>The police officer nodded, and the man knelt down, placing the toolbox beside him.</t7353> <t7354>After searching through his work tools, he took out several tools which he placed in order beside him.</t7354>
<t7355>Then, he stood up, looked through the keyhole, blew, and, turning to our friends, made some remarks to them.</t7355> <t7356>Lord Godalming smiled, and the man raised a bunch of keys; he chose one of them, inserted it into the lock, and began to try it, as if blindly finding his way.</t7356> <t7357>After some time, he tried a second and a third key.</t7357> <t7358>Suddenly, as the employee pushed the door a little, both he and our two friends entered the vestibule.</t7358> <t7359>We remained motionless, while my cigar burned furiously and van Helsing's, on the contrary, went out.</t7359> <t7360>We waited patiently until we saw the locksmith come out with his toolbox.</t7360> <t7361>Then, he kept the door ajar, holding it with his knees, while he fitted a key to the lock.</t7361> <t7362>Finally, he handed the key to Lord Godalming, who took out his wallet and gave him something.</t7362> <t7363>The man touched the brim of his hat, gathered his tools, put his jacket back on, and left.</t7363> <t7364>Nobody observed the development of that maneuver.</t7364>
<t7365>When the man was completely out of sight, the three of us crossed the street and knocked on the door.</t7365> <t7366>It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, next to whom stood Lord Godalming, lighting a cigar.</t7366>
<t7367>–This place has an extremely unpleasant smell -commented the latter, when we entered.</t7367>
<t7368>Indeed, the atmosphere was very unpleasant and foul-smelling, like the old chapel of Carfax, and, with our previous experience, we had no difficulty in understanding that the count had been using that place with complete freedom.</t7368>
<t7369>Next, we set about exploring the house, and we all stayed together, anticipating some attack, as we knew we were facing a strong, cruel, and ruthless enemy and still did not know whether the count was in the house or not.</t7369> <t7370>In the dining room, which was located behind the vestibule, we found eight boxes of earth.</t7370>
<t7371>Eight out of the nine we were looking for!</t7371> <t7372>Our work was not yet finished and would not be until we found the missing box.</t7372> <t7373>First, we opened the shutters that faced a courtyard enclosed by stone walls, at the back of which there were whitewashed stables that looked like a small house.</t7373>
<t7374>There were no windows, so we were not afraid of being seen.</t7374> <t7375>We did not waste time examining the drawers.</t7375> <t7376>With the tools we had brought with us, we opened the boxes, one by one, and did exactly the same as we had done with those in the old chapel.</t7376> <t7377>It was evident that the count was not in the house at that moment, and we searched the entire building, looking for any of his belongings.</t7377> <t7378>After quickly examining all the rooms, from the ground floor to the attic, we concluded that all the count's belongings must be in the dining room and, consequently, we proceeded to examine everything with extreme care.</t7378> <t7379>They were all in a kind of orderly disorder in the center of the large dining table.</t7379> <t7380>There were property titles for the house in Piccadilly in a small pile; bills for the purchase of the houses in Mile End and Bermondsey; writing paper, envelopes, pens, and ink.</t7380> <t7381>Everything was wrapped in fine paper to protect it from dust.</t7381> <t7382>There was also a clothes brush, a brush and a comb, and a washbasin...</t7382> <t7383>The latter contained dirty water, reddened, as if it had blood in it.</t7383> <t7384>Last of all was a keyring with keys of all sizes and shapes, probably those belonging to the other houses.</t7384> <t7385>When we examined that last discovery, Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris took notes on the addresses of the houses to the east and south, took the keys with them, and set off to destroy the boxes in those places.</t7385> <t7386>The rest of us are, with all the patience possible, waiting for their return..., or the arrival of the count.</t7386>
<t7387>XXIII.–</t7387> <t7388>FROM THE DIARY OF DOCTOR SEWARD</t7388>
<t7389>October 3rd.</t7389> <t7390>The time seemed extremely long to us as we waited for Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris.</t7390> <t7391>The professor tried to keep us distracted, using our minds without rest.</t7391> <t7392>I perfectly understood the beneficial objective he was pursuing with this, from the glances he occasionally cast at Harker.</t7392> <t7393>The poor man is overwhelmed by a sorrow that causes pain.</t7393> <t7394>Last night he was a frank man, with a cheerful appearance, a young and strong face, full of energy and with dark brown hair.</t7394> <t7395>Today, he looks like a withered and gaunt old man, whose white hair fits well with his bright eyes deeply sunken in their sockets and his facial features marked by pain.</t7395> <t7396>His energy remains intact, in fact, it is like a living flame.</t7396> <t7397>That may still be his salvation, because if all goes well, it will help him overcome the period of despair; then, in a way, he will reawaken to the realities of life.</t7397> <t7398>Poor guy!</t7398> <t7399>I thought my own despair and problems were severe enough; but this...!</t7399> <t7400>The professor understands it perfectly and is doing everything he can to keep him active.</t7400> <t7401>What he was saying was, under the circumstances, of extraordinary interest.</t7401> <t7402>These were more or less his words:</t7402>
<t7403>–I have been studying, systematically and repeatedly, ever since they came into my hands, all the documents related to that monster, and the more I have examined them, the greater seems the need to erase him from the face of the earth.</t7403> <t7404>In all the papers, there are signs of his progress; not only of his power but also of his awareness of it.</t7404> <t7405>As I learned from the investigations of my friend Arminius of Budapest, he was, in life, an extraordinary man.</t7405> <t7406>A soldier, statesman, and alchemist... whose knowledge was among the most advanced of his time.</t7406> <t7407>He possessed a powerful mind, incomparable knowledge, and a heart that knew neither fear nor remorse.</t7407> <t7408>He even allowed himself to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he had not tried.</t7408> <t7409>Well, in him, the mental powers survived physical death, although it seems that memory is not absolutely complete.</t7409> <t7410>Regarding some mental faculties, he has been and is like a child, but he is growing, and certain things that were childish at first are now of manly stature.</t7410> <t7411>He is experimenting and doing very well, and if it weren't for us crossing his path, he could still be, or will be if we fail, the father or the continuer of beings of a new order, whose paths lead through death, not life.</t7411>
<t7412>Harker grunted, and said:</t7412>
<t7413>–And all of that is directed against my beloved wife!</t7413> <t7414>But, how is he experimenting?</t7414> <t7415>The knowledge of that can help us destroy him!</t7415>
<t7416>–Since his arrival, he has been tirelessly practicing his powers, slowly and surely; his great childish brain is working, because if he had been able to practice certain things from the beginning, they would have been within his powers a long time ago.</t7416> <t7417>However, he wishes to succeed, and a man who has several centuries of existence ahead of him can afford to wait and act slowly.</t7417> <t7418>Festina lente could very well be his motto.</t7418>
<t7419>–I don't understand it -said Harker wearily-.</t7419> <t7420>Be more explicit, please.</t7420> <t7421>It is possible that suffering and worries are clouding my understanding.</t7421>
<t7422>The professor put a hand on his shoulder and said to him:</t7422>
<t7423>–Very well, my friend, I will be more explicit.</t7423> <t7424>Don't you see how, lately, that monster has acquired knowledge experimentally?</t7424> <t7425>He has been using the zoophagous patient to gain entry into friend John's house.</t7425> <t7426>The vampire, although he can enter as many times as he wishes afterward, can only enter a building initially if one of the inhabitants invites him in.</t7426> <t7427>But those are not his most important experiments.</t7427> <t7428>Didn't we see that at first all those heavy boxes of earth were moved by others?</t7428> <t7429>I didn't know what to make of it then, but afterward, everything changed.</t7429> <t7430>During all this time, his infantile brain has been developing, and he began to think about whether he could move the boxes himself.</t7430> <t7431>Consequently, later, when he discovered that it wasn't difficult for him to do so, he tried to move them alone, without anyone's help.</t7431> <t7432>Thus, he progressed and managed to distribute his tombs in such a way that only he now knows where they are located.</t7432> <t7433>It is possible that he thought of burying the boxes deeply in the ground so that he only uses them at night or at times when he can change form; it is equally convenient for him, and no one can know where his hiding places are!</t7433> <t7434>But do not despair, my friends, he acquired that knowledge too late!</t7434> <t7435>All the hiding places, except one, must have already been sterilized, and before sunset, they all will be.</t7435> <t7436>Then, he will have no place left to hide.</t7436> <t7437>I delayed this morning to be sure of it.</t7437> <t7438>Aren't we risking something much more precious than he is?</t7438> <t7439>Then, why aren't we more careful than he is?</t7439> <t7440>From my watch, I see that it is already one o'clock, and if all goes well, our friends Arthur and Quincey should already be on their way to join us.</t7440> <t7441>Today is our day, and we must proceed with confidence, albeit slowly, taking advantage of every opportunity that presents itself.</t7441> <t7442>Look!</t7442> <t7443>We will be five when our two absent friends return.</t7443>
<t7444>While we were talking, we were very surprised to hear a call at the main door of the mansion: the double call of the telegraph message delivery person.</t7444>
<t7445>We all went out into the lobby at the same time, and Van Helsing, raising his hand towards us to keep silent, walked towards the door and opened it.</t7445> <t7446>A young man handed him a telegram.</t7446> <t7447>The professor closed the door again and, after examining the address, opened it and read aloud: "Beware of D. He has just hurriedly left Carfax at this moment, at twelve forty-five, and has headed quickly towards the south.</t7447> <t7448>It seems he is making a round and may want to see you.</t7448> <t7449>Mina."</t7449>
<t7450>A pause occurred, which was broken by the voice of Jonathan Harker.</t7450>
<t7451>–Now, thank God, we will soon meet!</t7451> <t7452>Van Helsing quickly turned to him and said:</t7452>
<t7453>–God will act in His own way and at the time He deems appropriate.</t7453> <t7454>Do not fear nor rejoice yet, for what we desire at this moment may signify our destruction.</t7454>
<t7455>–Now I am not worried about anything -he said warmly-, except erasing that beast from the face of the earth.</t7455> <t7456>I would be capable of selling my soul to achieve it!</t7456>
<t7457>–"Don't say that, my friend!" – said Van Helsing.</t7457> <t7458>"God in His wisdom does not buy souls, and the devil, although he can buy them, does not keep his word.</t7458> <t7459>But God is merciful and just, and He knows your pain and your devotion to the wonderful lady Mina, your wife.</t7459> <t7460>Let none of us be afraid; we are all dedicated to this cause, and today will see its happy conclusion.</t7460> <t7461>The time has come to take action; today, that vampire is limited by human powers and, until sunset, he cannot change.</t7461> <t7462>It will take some time for him to arrive…</t7462> <t7463>It is one twenty…, and it will be a while before he gets here.</t7463> <t7464>What we must hope for now is that Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive before he does."</t7464>
<t7465>Approximately half an hour after we received Mrs. Harker's telegram, we heard a loud and resolute knock on the front door, similar to the one hundreds of gentlemen would give on any door.</t7465> <t7466>We looked at each other and headed towards the hall; we were all prepared to use all the weapons at our disposal... the spiritual ones in the left hand and the material ones in the right.</t7466> <t7467>Van Helsing removed the latch and, keeping the door ajar, took a step back, with both hands ready for action.</t7467> <t7468>The joy in our hearts must have been clearly reflected on our faces when we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris near the door.</t7468> <t7469>They entered quickly, and closed the door behind them, and the last of them said, as we all advanced through the hall:</t7469>
<t7470>–Everything is settled.</t7470> <t7471>We have found both houses.</t7471> <t7472>There were six boxes in each of them, and we have destroyed them all!</t7472>
<t7473>"Have they destroyed them?" inquired the professor.</t7473>
<t7474>–For him!</t7474>
<t7475>We remained silent for a few moments and then Quincey said:</t7475>
<t7476>–We have no choice but to wait here.</t7476> <t7477>However, if he does not arrive before five in the afternoon, we will have to leave, since we cannot leave Mrs. Harker alone after sunset.</t7477>
<t7478>–He won't take long to get here now -said Van Helsing, who had been consulting his little notebook-.</t7478> <t7479>Nota bene.</t7479> <t7480>In Mrs. Harker's telegram, it said that he had left Carfax heading south, which means he had to cross the river and could only do so at low tide, that is, shortly before one o'clock.</t7480> <t7481>The fact that he headed south has some significance for us.</t7481> <t7482>He still only suspects, and he went from Carfax to the place where he least suspects he might encounter any obstacle.</t7482> <t7483>You must have been in Bermondsey very shortly before him.</t7483> <t7484>The fact that he hasn't arrived here yet shows that he went to Mile End first.</t7484> <t7485>That will take some time, since he will have to cross the river again somehow.</t7485> <t7486>Believe me, my friends, we won't have to wait much longer now.</t7486> <t7487>We need to have some plan of attack ready, so we don't miss any opportunity.</t7487> <t7488>We don't have time anymore.</t7488> <t7489>Everyone, have your weapons ready! Stay alert!</t7489>
<t7490>He raised a hand, as a warning, while he spoke, since we could all clearly hear a key being gently inserted into the lock.</t7490>
<t7491>I could not help but admire, even at that moment, the way a dominant spirit asserts itself.</t7491> <t7492>In all our hunting trips and adventures of various kinds, in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always been the one to arrange the plans of action and Arthur and I had gotten used to obeying him implicitly.</t7492> <t7493>Now, the old habit seemed to instinctively renew itself.</t7493> <t7494>With a quick glance around the room, he immediately established our plan of action and, without uttering a single word, with a gesture, placed us all in our respective positions.</t7494> <t7495>Van Helsing, Harker, and I were positioned immediately behind the door, in such a way that, as soon as it opened, the professor could guard it, while Harker and I would place ourselves between the newcomer and the door.</t7495> <t7496>Godalming behind and Quincey in front, were ready to head to the windows, hidden for the moment where they could not be seen.</t7496> <t7497>We waited with such impatience that the seconds passed with a slowness of a true nightmare.</t7497> <t7498>The slow and cautious steps crossed the hall...</t7498> <t7499>The count was evidently prepared for a surprise or, at least, feared one.</t7499>
<t7500>Suddenly, with a huge leap, he entered the room, passing between us before any of us could even raise a hand to try to stop him.</t7500> <t7501>There was something so feline in the movement, something so inhuman, that it seemed to wake us all from the shock his arrival had caused.</t7501> <t7502>The first to take action was Harker, who, with a quick movement, positioned himself in front of the door leading to the front room of the house.</t7502> <t7503>When the count saw us, a kind of sinister mocking gesture appeared on his face, revealing his long and pointed fangs; but his malignant smile quickly vanished, replaced by a cold expression of deep disdain.</t7503> <t7504>His expression changed again when, all together, we advanced towards him.</t7504> <t7505>It was a pity that we hadn't had time to prepare some good attack plan, as at that very moment I wondered what we were going to do.</t7505> <t7506>I was not at all convinced that our lethal weapons would protect us.</t7506> <t7507>Evidently, Harker was willing to try, as he prepared his large kukri knife and delivered a terrible slash at the count.</t7507> <t7508>The blow was powerful; only the count's diabolical speed of movement allowed him to escape unharmed.</t7508>
<t7509>One more second and the sharp blade would have pierced his heart.</t7509> <t7510>In reality, the tip only cut through the fabric of his jacket, creating a huge hole from which a bunch of banknotes and a stream of gold coins spilled out.</t7510> <t7511>The expression on the count's face was so infernal that for a moment I feared for Harker, even though he was already prepared to deliver another slash.</t7511> <t7512>Instinctively, I stepped forward with a protective impulse, holding the crucifix and the Sacred Host in my left hand.</t7512> <t7513>I felt a great power coursing through my arm and was not surprised to see the monster retreating at the similar movement made by each and every one of my friends.</t7513> <t7514>It would be impossible to describe the expression of hatred and terrible malignancy, of infernal rage and fury, that appeared on the count's face.</t7514> <t7515>His waxy skin turned yellowish-green, contrasting with his red, burning eyes, and the red scar on his forehead stood out sharply, like an open, throbbing wound.</t7515> <t7516>An instant later, with a sinuous movement, he slipped under Harker's armed arm before he could deliver his blow, grabbed a handful of the money on the floor, crossed the room, and hurled himself at one of the windows.</t7516> <t7517>Amid the tinkling of broken glass, he fell into the courtyard below the window.</t7517> <t7518>Amid the noise of the shattered glass, I managed to hear the sound of several sovereigns hitting the ground, on the asphalt.</t7518>
<t7519>We rushed to the window and saw him get up from the ground unscathed.</t7519>
<t7520>He ascended the steps at full speed, crossed the courtyard, and opened the door to the stables.</t7520> <t7521>Once there, he turned and spoke to us:</t7521>
<t7522>–You think you can confuse me... with your pale faces, like sheep at the slaughterhouse.</t7522> <t7523>Now you're all going to feel it!</t7523> <t7524>You think you've left me without a place to rest, but I have others.</t7524> <t7525>My revenge begins now!</t7525> <t7526>I have walked the earth for centuries and time is on my side.</t7526> <t7527>The women you all love are already mine, and through them, you and many others will belong to me as well...</t7527> <t7528>You will be my creatures, to do as I command and to be my jackals when I wish to feed.</t7528> <t7529>Bah!</t7529>
<t7530>With a laugh full of contempt, he quickly passed through the door and we heard the rusty bolt being drawn when he closed the door behind him.</t7530> <t7531>A door, further away, opened and closed again.</t7531> <t7532>The first of us who spoke was the professor, when, realizing how difficult it would be to chase him through the stables, we headed towards the hall.</t7532>
<t7533>–We have learned something… A lot!</t7533> <t7534>Despite his boasting, he fears us; he fears time and he fears needs.</t7534> <t7535>If it weren't so, why would he be in such a hurry?</t7535> <t7536>The very tone of his words betrayed him, or my ears deceived me. Why did he take that money?</t7536> <t7537>They will understand me quickly!</t7537> <t7538>You are hunters of a wild beast and you understand.</t7538> <t7539>In my opinion, we need to make sure he can't use anything here, if he returns.</t7539>
<t7540>As he spoke, he put the rest of the money into his pocket; he took the property titles from the little pile where Harker had left them and threw the rest into the fireplace, setting it on fire with a match.</t7540>
<t7541>Godalming and Morris had gone out to the courtyard, and Harker had climbed out the window to follow the count.</t7541> <t7542>However, Dracula had securely locked the stable door, and by the time they managed to open it, there was no trace of the vampire.</t7542> <t7543>Van Helsing and I tried to investigate a bit at the back of the house, but the stables were deserted and no one had seen him leave.</t7543>
<t7544>The afternoon was already quite advanced and there wasn't much time left until sunset.</t7544> <t7545>We had to acknowledge that the work was finished and, with sadness, we agreed with the professor when he said:</t7545>
<t7546>–Let's return to Mrs. Mina…</t7546> <t7547>To poor Mrs. Harker.</t7547> <t7548>We have done everything we could for the moment and, at least, we will be able to protect her.</t7548> <t7549>But we must not despair.</t7549> <t7550>The vampire has only one box of earth left and we will try to find it; when we succeed, everything will be fine.</t7550>
<t7551>I understood that he was speaking as bravely as he could to console Harker.</t7551> <t7552>The poor man was completely dejected and, from time to time, groaned, unable to help it...</t7552> <t7553>He was thinking about his wife.</t7553>
<t7554>Full of sadness, we returned to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker waiting for us, with a cheerful appearance that honored her courage and spirit of cooperation.</t7554> <t7555>When she saw our faces, her own became as pale as a corpse's: for one or two seconds, she remained with her eyes closed, as if praying in secret and then said kindly:</t7555>
<t7556>–I will never be able to thank you enough for what you have done.</t7556> <t7557>Oh, my poor husband! – while she spoke, she took her husband's grayish head in her hands and kissed it-.</t7557> <t7558>Rest your poor head here and relax.</t7558> <t7559>Everything will be fine now, dear!</t7559> <t7560>God will protect us, if He so wishes.</t7560>
<t7561>The poor man grunted.</t7561> <t7562>There was no room for words amidst his sublime sadness.</t7562>
<t7563>We dined together without appetite, and I believe that gave us all a certain encouragement.</t7563> <t7564>It was perhaps the simple animal warmth that food provides to hungry people, since none of us had eaten anything since breakfast time, or it is likely that feeling the camaraderie that reigned among us consoled us a bit, but, be that as it may, the fact is that we felt less sad afterward and were able to think about the future with some hope.</t7564> <t7565>Keeping our promise, we recounted to Mrs. Harker everything that had happened, and although she turned intensely pale at times, when her husband was in danger, and blushed at other times, when the devotion he felt for her was evident, she listened to the entire story bravely and remained calm.</t7565> <t7566>When we reached the moment when Harker had lunged at the count with such determination, she grasped her husband's arm tightly and remained that way, as if by holding his arm she could protect him from any danger he might have faced.</t7566> <t7567>However, she said nothing until the narration was finished and when she was fully aware of everything that had happened up to that precise moment, then, without letting go of her husband's hand, she stood up and spoke to us.</t7567> <t7568>I have no words to convey the scene.</t7568> <t7569>That extraordinary woman, sweet and good, with all the radiant beauty of her youth and her animation, with the reddish scar on her forehead, of which she was conscious and which we saw while clenching our teeth… remembering where, when, and how everything had happened; her adorable kindness rising against our sinister hatred; her tender faith against all our fears and doubts.</t7569> <t7570>And we knew that, as far as the symbols went, with all her goodness, purity, and faith, she was separated from God.</t7570>
<t7571>–Jonathan -he said, and the word seemed to be music, because of the great love and tenderness he put into it-, my dear Jonathan and all of you, my wonderful friends, I want you to keep something in mind during all this terrible time.</t7571> <t7572>I know you have to fight..., that you must even destroy, as you destroyed the false Lucy, so that the true one could live afterwards; but it is not a work of hatred.</t7572> <t7573>That poor soul who has caused us so much harm is the saddest case of all.</t7573> <t7574>Imagine what his joy will be when he too is destroyed in his worst part, so that the best part can enjoy spiritual immortality.</t7574> <t7575>You must also have pity on him, even though that pity should not prevent your hands from carrying out his destruction.</t7575>
<t7576>While she was speaking, I could see that her husband's face darkened and grew tense, as if the passion consuming him was destroying his entire being.</t7576>
<t7577>Instinctively, his wife squeezed his hand even tighter, until her knuckles turned white.</t7577> <t7578>She didn't even blink from the pain that, I'm sure, she must have been suffering, but looked at him with more pleading eyes than ever.</t7578> <t7579>When she stopped speaking, her husband stood up abruptly, almost tearing his hand from hers, and said:</t7579>
<t7580>–May God put him in my hands long enough to destroy his earthly life, which is what we are trying to do!</t7580> <t7581>If in addition to that I can send his soul to the burning hell for all eternity, I will gladly do it!</t7581>
<t7582>–Oh, enough, enough!</t7582> <t7583>In the name of God, do not say such things!, Jonathan, my husband, or you will make me collapse, a victim of fear and horror.</t7583> <t7584>Just think, dear...; I have been thinking about it all this long day..., that maybe... someday... I too might need that mercy, and that someone like you, with the same reasons to hate me, might deny it to me.</t7584> <t7585>Oh, my husband!</t7585> <t7586>My dear Jonathan!</t7586> <t7587>I would have wanted to spare you that thought if there had been another way, but I beg God not to take your words into account and to consider them as the lament of a man who loves and has a broken heart.</t7587> <t7588>Oh, my God!</t7588> <t7589>Let his poor white hairs be a testament to all he has suffered, he who in his whole life has harmed no one, and upon whom so many sorrows have accumulated!</t7589>
<t7590>All the men present already had our eyes filled with tears.</t7590> <t7591>We couldn't resist, and we cried openly.</t7591> <t7592>She also cried upon seeing that her sweet advice had prevailed.</t7592> <t7593>Her husband knelt by her side and, wrapping her in his arms, hid his face in the folds of her dress.</t7593> <t7594>Van Helsing made a sign to us, and we all left the room, leaving those two loving hearts alone with their God.</t7594>
<t7595>Before they retired to their rooms, the professor prepared the room to protect it from any vampire incursions, and assured Mrs. Harker that she could rest in peace.</t7595> <t7596>She tried to convince herself of this and, to calm her husband, pretended to be content.</t7596> <t7597>It was a valiant struggle and I want to believe it was not without reward.</t7597> <t7598>Van Helsing had placed a bell near them that any of them should ring in case any eventuality occurred.</t7598> <t7599>When they retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I agreed that we should stay awake, dividing the night among the three of us, to watch over the poor lady and ensure her safety.</t7599> <t7600>The first watch fell to Quincey, so the rest of us should go to bed as soon as possible.</t7600> <t7601>Godalming has already gone to bed, as he has the second watch.</t7601> <t7602>Now that I have finished my work, I too must go to bed.</t7602>
<t7603>From the journal of Jonathan Harker</t7603>
<t7604>October 3-4, near midnight.</t7604> <t7605>I thought yesterday would never end.</t7605> <t7606>I had the desire to fall asleep, hoping that upon waking I would discover that things had changed and that all changes would henceforth be for the better.</t7606> <t7607>Before we parted ways, we discussed what our next step should be, but we couldn't reach any conclusion.</t7607> <t7608>The only thing we knew was that there was still one box of earth left and that only the count knew where it was.</t7608> <t7609>If he wishes to remain hidden, he can confuse us for years on end and, in the meantime, the thought is too horrible; I cannot allow myself to think about it at this moment.</t7609> <t7610>What I do know is that if there has ever been an absolutely perfect woman, it is my beloved and wounded wife.</t7610> <t7611>I love her a thousand times more for her sweet compassion last night; a compassion that made even the hatred I have for the monster seem despicable.</t7611> <t7612>I am sure that God will not allow the world to be impoverished by the loss of such a creature.</t7612> <t7613>That is a hope for me.</t7613> <t7614>We are all heading towards the rocks, and hope is the only anchor I have left.</t7614> <t7615>Thank God, Mina is asleep and not having nightmares.</t7615> <t7616>I dread to think what her nightmares could be, with such terrible memories that could provoke them.</t7616> <t7617>She hasn't been this calm, as far as I could see, since sunset.</t7617> <t7618>Then, for a moment, a calm spread over her face, like spring after the storms of March.</t7618>
<t7619>I thought at that moment that it must be the reflection of the sunset on her face, but, in some way, I now know that it was something much deeper.</t7619> <t7620>I am not sleepy myself, although I am tired...</t7620> <t7621>Terribly tired.</t7621> <t7622>However, I must try to fall asleep, as I have to think about tomorrow, and that there will be no rest for me until...</t7622>
<t7623>Later.</t7623> <t7624>I must have fallen asleep, as I was awakened by Mina, who was sitting on the bed with an expression full of astonishment on her face.</t7624> <t7625>I could see clearly, because we had not left the room in darkness; Mina had placed her hand over my mouth and whispered in my ear:</t7625>
<t7626>–Shh! There's someone in the hallway!</t7626>
<t7627>I cautiously got up and, crossing the room, opened the door without making a sound.</t7627>
<t7628>Crossed at the threshold, lying on a mattress, was Mr. Morris, completely awake.</t7628> <t7629>He raised a hand to impose silence on me, and whispered:</t7629>
<t7630>–Silence!</t7630> <t7631>Go back to bed; nothing is happening.</t7631> <t7632>One of us will stay here all night.</t7632> <t7633>We don't want to take any risks!</t7633>
<t7634>His expression and gesture prevented any discussion, so I lay back down and told Mina what was happening.</t7634> <t7635>She sighed and the shadow of a smile appeared on her pale face, as she wrapped her arms around me and said softly:</t7635>
<t7636>–Oh, I give thanks to God for all the good men!</t7636>
<t7637>He sighed and lay back down on his back, trying to fall asleep again.</t7637>
<t7638>I am writing this now because I am not sleepy, although I will also try to fall asleep.</t7638>
<t7639>October 4th, in the morning.</t7639> <t7640>Mina woke me up again during the night.</t7640> <t7641>This time, we had both slept well, as the dawn light was already faintly illuminating the windows, and the gas lamp was more like a point than a disc of light.</t7641>
<t7642>"Go find the professor," he told me hastily.</t7642> <t7643>"I want to see him immediately."</t7643>
<t7644>–Why? – I asked him.</t7644>
<t7645>–I have an idea.</t7645> <t7646>I suppose it must have come to me during the night, and it has matured without me realizing it.</t7646> <t7647>You must hypnotize me before dawn, and then I will be able to speak.</t7647> <t7648>Hurry, dear; there isn't much time left.</t7648>
<t7649>I went to the door and saw Dr. Seward lying on the mattress, and when he saw me, he jumped to his feet.</t7649>
<t7650>–Is something wrong? – he asked me, alarmed.</t7650>
<t7651>–No -I replied-, but Mina wishes to see Dr. Van Helsing immediately.</t7651>
<t7652>Two or three minutes later, Van Helsing was in the room, in his nightclothes, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were at the door, with Dr. Seward, asking questions.</t7652> <t7653>When the professor saw Mina, a smile, a genuine smile, caused the anxiety to leave his face; he rubbed his hands, and said:</t7653>
<t7654>–My dear Mrs. Mina!</t7654> <t7655>What a change!</t7655> <t7656>Look! Friend Jonathan, we have recovered our dear Mrs. Mina again, as before! – then, he turned to her and said kindly-: And what can I do for you?</t7656> <t7657>I suppose you haven't called me at this hour for nothing.</t7657>
<t7658>–I want you to hypnotize me! – said Mina -.</t7658> <t7659>Do it before dawn, as I believe that then I will be able to speak freely.</t7659> <t7660>Hurry; we don't have much time left!</t7660>
<t7661>Without saying a word, the professor indicated for him to take a seat on the bed.</t7661>
<t7662>He stared at her intently and began making magnetic passes in front of her, from the top of my wife's head, downwards, with both hands, repeating the movements several times.</t7662> <t7663>Mina stared at him intently for a few minutes, during which my heart beat like a hammer, because I felt that some crisis was about to occur soon.</t7663> <t7664>Gradually, her eyes began to close and she remained seated, absolutely motionless.</t7664> <t7665>Only by the rise and fall of her chest, in rhythm with her breathing, could it be seen that she was alive.</t7665> <t7666>The professor made a few more passes and stopped; then I saw that his forehead was covered with thick drops of sweat.</t7666> <t7667>Mina opened her eyes, but she did not seem to be the same woman.</t7667> <t7668>There was an expression of emptiness in her eyes, as if her gaze was lost in the distance, and her voice had an infinite sadness that was new to me.</t7668> <t7669>Raising his hand to impose silence, the professor gestured for me to let the others in.</t7669> <t7670>They all entered on tiptoe, closing the door behind them and remained standing near the bed, watching attentively.</t7670> <t7671>Mina did not seem to see them.</t7671> <t7672>The silence was interrupted by Professor Van Helsing, speaking in a very low tone of voice, so as not to interrupt the course of my wife's thoughts:</t7672>
<t7673>–Where are you located?</t7673>
<t7674>The response was given in an absolutely inflectionless tone:</t7674>
<t7675>–I don't know.</t7675> <t7676>The dream has no place that can be considered real.</t7676>
<t7677>For several minutes, silence reigned.</t7677> <t7678>Mina continued to sit rigidly, and the professor stared at her intently; the rest of us barely dared to breathe.</t7678>
<t7679>The room was becoming clearer and clearer.</t7679> <t7680>Without taking his eyes off Mina's face, the professor gestured for me to draw the curtains, and the day seemed to envelop us all.</t7680> <t7681>A reddish streak appeared, and a pink light spread throughout the room.</t7681> <t7682>At that moment, the professor spoke again:</t7682>
<t7683>–Where are you now?</t7683>
<t7684>The response was somnambulant, but with intention; it was as if she were interpreting something.</t7684> <t7685>I have heard her use the same tone of voice when reading her shorthand notes.</t7685>
<t7686>–I don't know.</t7686> <t7687>It's an absolutely unknown place to me!</t7687>
<t7688>–What do you see?</t7688>
<t7689>–I can't see anything; it's all dark.</t7689>
<t7690>–What do you hear?</t7690>
<t7691>I noticed the tension in the patient voice of the professor.</t7691>
<t7692>–The sound of water.</t7692> <t7693>The sound of the surf and small waves crashing can be heard.</t7693>
<t7694>I can hear them outside.</t7694>
<t7695>–So, are you on a boat?</t7695>
<t7696>We all looked at each other, trying to understand something.</t7696> <t7697>We were afraid to think.</t7697> <t7698>The answer came quickly:</t7698>
<t7699>–Oh, yes!</t7699>
<t7700>–What else do you hear?</t7700>
<t7701>–Noise of footsteps of men running from one side to the other.</t7701> <t7702>I also hear the noise of a chain and a great clatter, when the control of the winch falls into the ratchet.</t7702>
<t7703>–What are you doing?</t7703>
<t7704>–I am motionless; absolutely motionless.</t7704> <t7705>It's something like death!</t7705>
<t7706>The voice faded, turning into a deep sigh, like someone who is asleep, and their eyes closed again.</t7706>
<t7707>But this time the sun had already risen and we all found ourselves in broad daylight.</t7707> <t7708>Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina's shoulders and made her head rest gently on the pillows.</t7708> <t7709>She remained for a few moments like a sleeping child and then, with a long sigh, woke up and was very surprised to see us all gathered around her.</t7709>
<t7710>–Did I talk in my sleep? – was all he said.</t7710>
<t7711>However, she seemed to understand the situation without speaking, as she was anxious to know what had been said.</t7711> <t7712>The professor repeated the conversation to her, and Mina said to him:</t7712>
<t7713>–Then, there is no time to lose.</t7713> <t7714>It is possible that it is not too late yet!</t7714>
<t7715>Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming headed towards the door, but the professor's calm voice called them back and made them retrace their steps:</t7715>
<t7716>–Stay, my friends.</t7716> <t7717>That ship, wherever it may be, was weighing anchor while the lady was speaking.</t7717> <t7718>There are many ships weighing anchor at this moment, in the great port of London.</t7718> <t7719>Which one are we looking for?</t7719> <t7720>Thank God we have clues again, even if we don't know where they will lead us.</t7720> <t7721>We have been somewhat blind, in a very human way, since looking back, we see what we could have seen by looking forward, if we had been able to see what was possible to see! Wow! That sentence is a puzzle, isn't it?</t7721> <t7722>We can now understand what the count was thinking when he collected the money, when the knife wielded in anger by Jonathan put him in a danger he still fears.</t7722> <t7723>He wanted to flee.</t7723> <t7724>Listen to me: FLEE!</t7724> <t7725>He realized that with only one box of earth at his disposal and a group of men chasing him like dogs after a fox, London was not a very healthy place for him.</t7725> <t7726>Onward!, as our friend Arthur would say, putting on his red coat for the hunt.</t7726> <t7727>Our old fox is cunning, very cunning, and we must hunt him with wit.</t7727> <t7728>I am also cunning and I will think about him shortly.</t7728> <t7729>Meanwhile, let us rest in peace, since there are waters between us that he does not like to cross and could not do so even if he wanted to...</t7729> <t7730>Unless the ship docked and, in that case, he could only do so during high tide or low tide.</t7730>
<t7731>Furthermore, the sun has risen and the whole day belongs to us, until sunset.</t7731> <t7732>Let's bathe and get dressed.</t7732> <t7733>Then, we will have breakfast, as we all really need it.</t7733>
<t7734>Furthermore, we will be able to eat in peace, since the monster is not on the same land as us.</t7734>
<t7735>Mina looked at him pleadingly, while asking:</t7735>
<t7736>–But why do you need to keep looking for him, if he has distanced himself from us?</t7736>
<t7737>The professor took her hand and patted it while responding:</t7737>
<t7738>–Don't ask me anything about it for the moment.</t7738> <t7739>After breakfast, I will answer your questions.</t7739>
<t7740>He refused to say anything more, and we all parted ways to get dressed.</t7740>
<t7741>After breakfast, Mina repeated her question.</t7741> <t7742>The professor looked at her gravely for a minute, and then responded in a very sad tone:</t7742>
<t7743>–Because, my dear Mrs. Mina, now more than ever we must find him, even if we have to follow him to the very depths of hell!</t7743>
<t7744>Mina became paler as she asked:</t7744>
<t7745>–Why?</t7745>
<t7746>–Because -responded van Helsing solemnly- he can live for several centuries, and you are merely a mortal woman.</t7746> <t7747>We must now fear time…, since it has already left that mark on your throat.</t7747>
<t7748>I barely had time to catch her in my arms when she fell forward, fainting.</t7748>

<t7753>This is for Jonathan Harker.</t7753>
<t7754>You must stay with your dear Mrs. Mina.</t7754> <t7755>We must go to take care of our investigation... if I can call it that, since it is not an investigation, but something we already know, and we are only seeking confirmation.</t7755> <t7756>But you stay and take care of her today.</t7756> <t7757>That is the best and most sacred thing for all of us.</t7757> <t7758>In any case, the monster will not be able to appear today.</t7758> <t7759>Let me bring you up to date on what the four of us already know, because I have communicated it to the others.</t7759> <t7760>The monster, our enemy, has left; he has returned to his castle in Transylvania.</t7760> <t7761>I know this as surely as if a gigantic hand of fire had written it on the wall.</t7761> <t7762>In a way, he had prepared for it, and his last box of earth was ready to be shipped.</t7762> <t7763>That's why he took the money and hurried so much; to avoid being caught by us before sunset.</t7763> <t7764>It was his only hope, unless he could hide in the grave of poor Lucy, whom he thought was like him and therefore open to him.</t7764> <t7765>But he didn't have time.</t7765> <t7766>When that failed him, he went straight to his last resort... to his last earthly work, I might say, if I desired a double entendre.</t7766> <t7767>He is intelligent; very intelligent.</t7767> <t7768>He realized he had lost the game here, and decided to return home.</t7768> <t7769>He found a ship that followed the route he desired, and left on it.</t7769> <t7770>Now we are going to try to discover which ship that was and, without wasting time, as soon as we know, we will return to inform you.</t7770> <t7771>Then we will console you and also poor Mrs. Mina, with new hopes.</t7771> <t7772>Since it is possible to keep hope, thinking that not all is lost.</t7772> <t7773>That same creature we are chasing took several hundred years to reach London and yet, in a single day, as soon as we learned of his doings, we made him flee from here.</t7773> <t7774>He has limitations, for he has the power to do much harm, though he cannot endure it as we can.</t7774> <t7775>But we are strong, each in our own way; and we are even stronger when we are all together.</t7775> <t7776>Cheer up, dear husband of our Mrs. Mina.</t7776> <t7777>This battle has only just begun and, in the end, we will win...</t7777>
<t7778>I am as sure of it as I am that God is watching over His children from above.</t7778> <t7779>Therefore, stay encouraged and comfort your wife until our return.</t7779>

<t7781>From the journal of Jonathan Harker</t7781>
<t7782>October 4th.</t7782> <t7783>When I read Mina the message that van Helsing left me on the phonograph, my poor wife cheered up considerably.</t7783> <t7784>The certainty that the count had left the country already provided her with comfort, and comfort is strength for her.</t7784> <t7785>As for me, now that this terrible danger is no longer face to face with us, it is almost impossible for me to believe in it.</t7785> <t7786>Even my own terrible experiences in Dracula's castle seem like a nightmare that happened a long time ago and is almost completely forgotten, here, in the midst of the fresh autumn air and under the bright sunlight…</t7786>
<t7787>However, alas, how am I going to be able to forget it?</t7787> <t7788>Amid the fogs of my imagination, my thoughts linger on the red scar that my beloved and troubled wife has on her white forehead.</t7788> <t7789>As long as that scar remains on her forehead, it is impossible to stop believing.</t7789> <t7790>Mina and I fear remaining inactive, so we have gone back to reviewing all the journals several times.</t7790> <t7791>In a way, although reality seems to be increasingly overwhelming, the pain and fear seem to have diminished.</t7791> <t7792>In all of this, a guiding intention is manifested, in a way, which is almost comforting.</t7792> <t7793>Mina says that perhaps we are instruments of a good ending.</t7793> <t7794>It could be!</t7794>
<t7795>I must try to think like her.</t7795> <t7796>We still haven't talked about the future yet.</t7796> <t7797>It will be better to wait to see the professor and everyone else after their research.</t7797>
<t7798>The day has passed much more quickly than I would have believed it could ever pass for me again.</t7798> <t7799>It is already three in the afternoon.</t7799>
<t7800>From the journal of Mina Harker</t7800>
<t7801>October 5, at five in the afternoon.</t7801> <t7802>Meeting to hear reports.</t7802> <t7803>Present: Professor van Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan Harker, and Mina Harker.</t7803>
<t7804>Dr. Van Helsing described the steps they had taken during the day to discover on which ship and in which direction Count Dracula had fled.</t7804>
<t7805>–We knew he wanted to return to Transylvania.</t7805> <t7806>I was sure he would go up the mouth of the Danube; or by some route of the Black Sea, since he came following that route.</t7806> <t7807>We had a very difficult task ahead of us.</t7807> <t7808>Omne ignotum pro magnifico; thus, with a great weight in our hearts, we began to search for the ships that left last night for the Black Sea.</t7808> <t7809>He was on a sailing ship, since Mrs. Mina told us about the sails in her vision.</t7809> <t7810>Those ships are not important enough to be listed in the Times and, therefore, we went, accepting a suggestion from Lord Godalming, to Lloyd's, where all ships that set sail are recorded, no matter how small they are.</t7810> <t7811>There we discovered that only one ship bound for the Black Sea had left taking advantage of the tides.</t7811> <t7812>It is the Czarina Catherine and it goes from Doolittle Wharf bound for Varna, to other ports and, then, will go up the Danube River.</t7812>
<t7813>"Then," I said, "that is the ship on which the count sails."</t7813> <t7814>Consequently, we went to Doolittle's Wharf and found a man in an office so tiny that the man seemed larger than it.</t7814> <t7815>We asked him everything related to the whereabouts of the Czarina Catherine.</t7815> <t7816>He cursed a lot, his face turned red, and his voice was very gruff; but he wasn't a bad guy, anyway, and when Quincey took something out of his pocket and handed it to him, producing a rustle when the man took it and put it in a small wallet he carried deep within his clothes, he became an even better guy, and our humble servant.</t7816> <t7817>He accompanied us and asked questions to several sweaty and rough men; they also turned out to be better guys when their thirst was quenched.</t7817>
<t7818>They talked a lot about blood and other things I didn't understand, although I guessed what they meant.</t7818> <t7819>However, they communicated everything we wanted to know.</t7819>
<t7820>"They informed us, among other things, that yesterday, around five in the afternoon, a man arrived in a great hurry.</t7820> <t7821>A tall, thin, and pale man, with an aquiline nose, very white teeth, and eyes that seemed to be burning.</t7821> <t7822>He was dressed all in black, except for a straw hat he wore that did not suit him nor the weather, and he generously distributed his money, asking questions to find out if there was any ship heading towards the Black Sea, and to which point.</t7822> <t7823>They took him to the offices and to the ship, on board of which he did not want to go, but instead stopped at the dock and asked for the captain to come see him.</t7823> <t7824>The captain came when they told him he would be well paid, and although he cursed a lot at first, he struck a deal with him.</t7824> <t7825>Then, the tall and thin man left, but not before someone showed him where he could find a cart and a horse.</t7825> <t7826>Soon he returned, driving the cart himself, on which there was a large box, which he unloaded by himself, although it took several men to carry it to the crane and load it into the ship's hold.</t7826> <t7827>He gave many instructions to the captain regarding how and where that box should be placed, but the captain did not like it, cursed him in several languages, and told him to go see for himself how the damned box was stowed if he wanted.</t7827> <t7828>But he said he could not do it at that moment; that he would board later, as he had many things to attend to.</t7828> <t7829>Then, the captain told him to hurry… with blood… as that ship was going to set sail… with blood… as soon as the tide was favorable… with blood.</t7829> <t7830>Then, the man smiled slightly and said that, of course, he would go in due time, but it would not be too soon.</t7830> <t7831>The captain cursed again like a polyglot, and the tall man bowed to him and thanked him, promising to board before they set sail, so as not to cause any unnecessary trouble.</t7831> <t7832>Finally, the captain, redder than ever, and in many other languages, told him he did not want any damned lousy Frenchmen on his ship.</t7832> <t7833>Then, after asking where he could find a ship not too far away, where he could buy boarding passes, he left.</t7833> <t7834>"No one knew where he had gone, as they said, since it soon seemed that the Czarina Catherine would not set sail as soon as they had thought.</t7834> <t7835>A light mist began to spread over the river and became increasingly thicker, until finally a dense fog covered the ship and all its surroundings.</t7835> <t7836>The captain cursed long and hard in all the languages he knew, but he could do nothing.</t7836> <t7837>The water kept rising and he began to think that he was going to miss the tide anyway.</t7837> <t7838>He was not in a very good mood when exactly at high tide, the tall and thin man reappeared and asked to be shown where his box had been stowed.</t7838> <t7839>Then, the captain told him he wished both he and his box were in hell.</t7839> <t7840>But the man was not offended and went down to the hold with a crew member to see where his box was.</t7840> <t7841>Then, he returned to the deck and stayed there for a while, wrapped in the fog.</t7841> <t7842>He must have come up from the hold alone, as no one saw him.</t7842> <t7843>In fact, they did not think about him anymore, because soon the fog began to lift and the weather cleared completely.</t7843> <t7844>My thirsty and foul-mouthed friends smiled as they explained how the captain cursed in more languages than ever and looked more picturesque than ever when, asking other sailors who were moving up and down the river at that time, he discovered that very few of them had seen any fog at all, except where he was, near the dock.</t7844> <t7845>However, the ship set sail with the ebb tide, and undoubtedly by morning it should be far from the river mouth.</t7845> <t7846>So, while they were explaining all this to us, it should already be far away, at sea.</t7846> <t7847>"And now, Mrs. Mina, we will have to rest for a while, as our enemy is at sea, with the fog at his command, heading towards the mouth of the Danube.</t7847> <t7848>Progress on a sailing ship is never too fast; therefore, we can travel by land much more quickly.</t7848> <t7849>and we will catch up with him there.</t7849> <t7850>Our best hope is to find him when he is in his box between dawn and sunset, as then he cannot fight and we can deal with him as he deserves.</t7850> <t7851>We have several days at our disposal, during which we can make plans.</t7851> <t7852>We know everything about the place we need to go, as we have seen the ship's owner, who has shown us invoices and all kinds of documents.</t7852> <t7853>The box we are interested in must be unloaded in Varna and delivered to an agent, a certain Ristics, who will present his credentials there.</t7853> <t7854>Thus, our seafaring friend will have completed his part.</t7854> <t7855>When he asked us if something was wrong, as if so he could telegraph to Varna to have an inquiry carried out, we told him no, because our work cannot be carried out by the police or customs.</t7855>
<t7856>We must do it ourselves, in our own way."</t7856> <t7857>When Dr. Van Helsing finished his story, I asked him if he had made sure that the Count had stayed on board the ship.</t7857> <t7858>The professor replied:</t7858>
<t7859>–We have the best possible proof of it: your own statements, when you were in a hypnotic trance, this morning.</t7859>
<t7860>I asked him again if it was necessary to pursue the count, because I feared that Jonathan would leave me alone and I knew he would also go if the others did.</t7860>
<t7861>He spoke to me calmly at first and increasingly more passionately.</t7861> <t7862>However, as he continued speaking, he grew angrier each time, until in the end we saw that he still had at least some of that self-control that made him a master among men.</t7862>
<t7863>–Yes, it is necessary... Necessary! Necessary!</t7863> <t7864>For your own good first and foremost, and for the good of all humanity.</t7864> <t7865>That monster has already done too much harm, in the narrow space where it is and in the short time that has passed since it was just a body seeking its measure in darkness and ignorance.</t7865> <t7866>I have already explained all this to the others; you, my dear Mrs. Mina, will hear it on the phonograph of my friend John or on that of your husband.</t7866> <t7867>I have explained to them how the fact of leaving his arid land... arid in inhabitants... to come to this country where people live like grains of corn in a plantation, had been a work of centuries.</t7867> <t7868>If any other undead tried to do the same as he did, it would take all the centuries of the planet and still not be enough.</t7868> <t7869>In the case of the vampire we are dealing with, all the hidden forces of nature, deep and powerful, must have somehow united in a monstrous way.</t7869> <t7870>The very place where he remained as an undead for all those centuries is full of geological and chemical oddities.</t7870> <t7871>There are fissures and deep caverns that no one knows how far they go.</t7871> <t7872>There are also volcanoes, some of which still expel waters with strange properties, and gases that kill or vivify.</t7872> <t7873>Undoubtedly, there is something magnetic or electric in some of those combinations of hidden forces, which act strangely on physical life, and which in themselves were from the beginning great qualities.</t7873> <t7874>In hard times and wars, he was celebrated as the man with the best-tempered nerves, the most alert intelligence, and the best heart.</t7874> <t7875>In him, some strange vital principle found its maximum expression, and while his body strengthened, developed, and fought, his mind also grew.</t7875> <t7876>All this, with the diabolical help he surely has, since all of it must be attributed to the powers that come from good and are symbolic in him.</t7876> <t7877>And now, here is what he represents to us: he has infected you; forgive me for saying this, madam, but I do it for your own good.</t7877> <t7878>He contaminated you in such an intelligent way that even if he does not do it again, you could only live in your old and sweet way, and thus, in time, death, which is common to all men and sanctioned by God Himself, will turn you into a woman like him.</t7878> <t7879>That must not happen!</t7879> <t7880>We have sworn together that we will not allow it.</t7880> <t7881>Thus, we are ministers of God's own will: that the world and the men for whom His Son died, are not handed over to monsters whose very existence is a blasphemy against Him.</t7881> <t7882>He has already allowed us to redeem one soul, and we are ready, like the ancient knights of the Crusades, to redeem many more.</t7882> <t7883>Like them, we must go to the East, and like them, if we must fall, we will do so for a good cause.</t7883>
<t7884>He was silent for a moment and then I said:</t7884>
<t7885>–But, won't the count wisely accept his defeat?</t7885> <t7886>Since he has been expelled from England, won't he avoid this country, just as a tiger avoids the village from which it has been driven away?</t7886>
<t7887>–Aha!</t7887> <t7888>Your image of the tiger is very good and I am going to adopt it.</t7888> <t7889>Your man-eater, as the inhabitants of India call tigers that have tasted human blood, disregards all other prey and stalks man until it can attack him.</t7889> <t7890>The monster we have expelled from our village is a tiger, a man-eater, that will never stop stalking its prey.</t7890> <t7891>No, by nature; it is not someone who retreats and stays away.</t7891> <t7892>During its life, its true life, it crossed the Turkish border and attacked its enemies on their own ground; it was repelled, but, did it give up?</t7892> <t7893>No!</t7893> <t7894>It came back again and again.</t7894> <t7895>Observe its perseverance and resilience.</t7895> <t7896>In its infantile brain, it had long conceived the idea of going to a great city.</t7896> <t7897>What did it do?</t7897> <t7898>It found the most promising place for itself in the whole world.</t7898> <t7899>Then, deliberately, it prepared for the task.</t7899> <t7900>It patiently discovered what its strength and powers are.</t7900> <t7901>It studied other languages.</t7901> <t7902>It learned the new social life; new environments of ancient regions, politics, legislation, finance, sciences, the customs of a new land and new individuals, who had come into existence since it lived.</t7902> <t7903>The glimpse it could take at that world only increased its appetite and sharpened its desire.</t7903> <t7904>That helped it to develop, at the same time as its brain, since it could verify how accurate it had been in its assumptions.</t7904> <t7905>It had done it alone, absolutely alone, emerging from a ruined tomb, located in a forgotten land.</t7905> <t7906>What could it not do when the wide world of thought is opened to it?</t7906> <t7907>It, who can laugh at death, as we have seen, who can grow stronger amidst epidemics and plagues that kill all individuals around it… Oh!</t7907> <t7908>If such a being came from God and not from the Devil, what a force for good it could be in a world like ours!</t7908> <t7909>But we must rid the world of it.</t7909> <t7910>Our work must be carried out in silence, and all our efforts must be carried out in secret.</t7910> <t7911>Since in this enlightened age, when men do not even believe in what they see, the doubts of wise men can constitute its greatest strength.</t7911> <t7912>They will be at the same time its protection and shield, and its weapons to destroy us, we who are its enemies, who are willing to endanger even our own souls to save the one we love… for the good of humanity and for the honor and glory of God.</t7912>
<t7913>After a general discussion, it was agreed that we should not do anything that night; that we should sleep and think about the appropriate conclusions.</t7913> <t7914>Tomorrow, at breakfast time, we must meet again, and after sharing our conclusions with the others, we must decide on a specific course of action...</t7914>
<t7915>I feel a wonderful peace and rest tonight.</t7915> <t7916>It's as if a spectral presence has been lifted from me.</t7916> <t7917>Perhaps...</t7917>
<t7918>My assumption was not concluded, as I saw in the mirror the red scar on my forehead, and I understood that I am still stigmatized.</t7918>
<t7919>From the diary of Dr. Seward</t7919>
<t7920>October 5th.</t7920> <t7921>We all got up early, and I think that having slept did us all a lot of good.</t7921> <t7922>When we gathered for breakfast, there was an excitement among us that we never expected to feel again.</t7922>
<t7923>It is marvelous to see the elasticity in human nature.</t7923> <t7924>It is enough that an obstruction, whatever it may be, is removed in any way, even through death, for us to feel the same hope and joy as before.</t7924> <t7925>More than once, while we remained around the table, I wondered if the horrors of the preceding days had only been a dream.</t7925> <t7926>It was only when I saw the scar on Mrs. Harker's forehead that I returned to reality.</t7926> <t7927>Even now, when I am seriously resolving the matter, it is almost impossible to comprehend that the cause of all our troubles still exists.</t7927> <t7928>Even Mrs. Harker seems to forget her situation for long periods; only occasionally, when something reminds her, does she start thinking about the terrible mark she bears on her forehead.</t7928> <t7929>We must meet here, in my study, in half an hour to decide what we are going to do.</t7929> <t7930>I only see one immediate difficulty; I see it more by instinct than by reasoning: we will have to speak frankly, and yet, I fear that, in some mysterious way, poor Mrs. Harker's tongue is tied.</t7930> <t7931>I know she reaches conclusions that are her own, and from what has happened, I can imagine how brilliant and true they must be; but she does not wish or cannot express them.</t7931> <t7932>I have mentioned this to Van Helsing and he and I must discuss this topic when we are alone.</t7932> <t7933>I suppose part of that horrible poison that has been introduced into her veins is beginning to work.</t7933> <t7934>The Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing calls "the vampire's blood baptism."</t7934> <t7935>Well, there may be a poison distilled from good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery, we should not be surprised by anything!</t7935> <t7936>One thing is certain: if my instinct does not deceive me regarding poor Mrs. Harker's silences, there will be a terrible difficulty, an unknown danger, in the work that awaits us.</t7936> <t7937>The same power that makes her remain silent may make her speak.</t7937> <t7938>I cannot continue thinking about it, because, if I did, I would dishonor a noble woman with my thoughts.</t7938>
<t7939>Later.</t7939> <t7940>When the professor arrived, we discussed the situation.</t7940> <t7941>I understood that he had some idea, that he wanted to present it to us, but he was somewhat afraid to dive fully into the topic.</t7941> <t7942>After many detours, he suddenly said:</t7942>
<t7943>–Friend John, there is something that you and I must discuss alone, in any case, at the beginning.</t7943> <t7944>Later, we will have to trust everyone else.</t7944>
<t7945>He paused.</t7945> <t7946>I waited, and the professor continued after a moment:</t7946>
<t7947>–Mrs. Mina, our poor Mrs. Mina, is changing.</t7947>
<t7948>A shiver ran down my spine upon seeing that my assumptions were confirmed in that manner.</t7948> <t7949>Van Helsing continued:</t7949>
<t7950>–With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must be prepared this time, before things go too far.</t7950> <t7951>Our task is now, in fact, more difficult than ever, and this problem makes every passing hour of the utmost importance.</t7951> <t7952>I see the characteristics of the vampire appearing on her face.</t7952> <t7953>It is still very slight, but it can be seen if observed without prejudice.</t7953> <t7954>Her teeth are a bit sharper and, at times, her eyes are harder.</t7954> <t7955>But that is not all; she often remains silent, as Miss Lucy did.</t7955> <t7956>She does not speak, even when she writes what she wants to be known later.</t7956> <t7957>Now, my fear is the following: since she could, through the hypnotic trance we induced in her, say what the Count saw and heard, it is no less certain that he, who hypnotized her before, who drank her blood and made her drink his own, can, if he wishes, make Mrs. Mina's mind reveal what she knows.</t7957> <t7958>Doesn't that seem a fair assumption?</t7958>
<t7959>I nodded, and the teacher continued saying:</t7959>
<t7960>–Then, what we must do is avoid that; we must keep her in ignorance of our plan, so that she cannot reveal at all what she does not know.</t7960> <t7961>It's something very painful!</t7961> <t7962>So painful, that it hurts me immensely to have to do it, but it is necessary.</t7962> <t7963>When we meet today, I am going to tell her that, for reasons we do not wish to discuss, she will no longer be able to attend our meetings, but that we will continue to watch over her.</t7963>
<t7964>He wiped his forehead, from which quite a bit of sweat had emerged, thinking about the pain he might cause that poor woman who was already being so tortured.</t7964> <t7965>He knew it would serve as some consolation for him if I told him that, for my part, I had reached exactly the same conclusion, since at the very least it would spare him from having doubts.</t7965> <t7966>I told him, and the effect was as I expected.</t7966>
<t7967>There is little time left until the moment of our general meeting arrives.</t7967> <t7968>Van Helsing has gone to prepare for the aforementioned meeting and the painful part he will have to play in it.</t7968> <t7969>I truly believe that what he wants is to be able to pray alone.</t7969>
<t7970>Later.</t7970> <t7971>At the very moment the meeting began, both Van Helsing and I experienced great relief.</t7971> <t7972>Mrs. Harker sent a message through her husband, saying that she would not join us then, as she was convinced it was better for us to feel free to discuss our movements without the inconvenience of her presence.</t7972> <t7973>The professor and I looked at each other for a brief moment and, in a way, we both felt relieved.</t7973> <t7974>For my part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker herself realized the danger, we had thus avoided a serious danger and, no doubt, also a great pain.</t7974> <t7975>Under the circumstances, we agreed, through a question and an answer, with a finger on our lips, to keep our suspicions to ourselves until we were once again in a position to speak alone.</t7975> <t7976>We immediately moved on to our campaign plan.</t7976> <t7977>Van Helsing briefly explained the facts to us:</t7977>
<t7978>–The Czarina Catherine left the Thames yesterday morning.</t7978> <t7979>It will take at least three weeks to reach Varna, even at maximum speed, but we can get there by land in three days.</t7979> <t7980>Now, if we allow two days less for the ship's journey, due to the influence the Count has over the weather, which we are aware of, and if we allow a day and a night as a safety margin for any circumstances that might delay us, then we still have a margin of almost two weeks.</t7980> <t7981>Therefore, to be completely sure, we must leave here by the seventeenth at the latest.</t7981> <t7982>Then, we will arrive in Varna at least a day before the Czarina Catherine, in a position to make all the necessary preparations.</t7982>
<t7983>Of course, we must all go armed...</t7983> <t7984>Armed against all dangers, both spiritual and physical.</t7984>
<t7985>At that, Quincey Morris added:</t7985>
<t7986>I believe I have heard it said that the count comes from a country of wolves, and it is possible that he will get there before us.</t7986> <t7987>Therefore, I advise that we take Winchesters with us.</t7987> <t7988>I have full confidence in Winchester rifles when faced with such a danger.</t7988> <t7989>Do you remember, Art, when the pack was following us in Tobolsk?</t7989> <t7990>What wouldn't we have given then to have a repeating rifle!</t7990>
<t7991>–Good! – said van Helsing.</t7991> <t7992>The Winchesters are very convenient.</t7992> <t7993>Quincey often thinks very accurately, but especially when it comes to hunting.</t7993> <t7994>Metaphors are more dishonorable to science than dangerous wolves are to man.</t7994> <t7995>Meanwhile, we can do absolutely nothing here, and since I believe none of us are familiar with Varna, why don't we go there first?</t7995>
<t7996>Waiting here will be as long as doing it there.</t7996> <t7997>We can prepare ourselves between today and tomorrow, and then, if everything goes well, the four of us can set out.</t7997>
<t7998>–The four of us? – said Harker, questioningly, looking at each of us, one by one.</t7998>
<t7999>–Naturally! – said the professor quickly-.</t7999> <t8000>You must stay to take care of your sweet wife!</t8000>
<t8001>Harker was silent for a moment, and then said in a hollow voice:</t8001>
<t8002>–It would be better if we talk about this tomorrow.</t8002> <t8003>I will consult with Mina about it.</t8003>
<t8004>I thought that was the opportune moment for Van Helsing to warn him that he should not reveal our plans to his wife, but he did not take the hint.</t8004>
<t8005>I looked at him meaningfully and coughed.</t8005> <t8006>In response, he put a finger to his lips and turned away.</t8006>
<t8007>From the journal of Jonathan Harker</t8007>
<t8008>October, in the afternoon.</t8008> <t8009>For a good while, after our meeting this morning, I couldn't reflect.</t8009> <t8010>The new phases of the matters left my mind in such a state that it was impossible for me to think clearly.</t8010> <t8011>Mina's determination not to take an active part in the discussion had me worried, and since I couldn't discuss it with her, I could only try to guess.</t8011> <t8012>I am still as far as ever from having found the solution to that enigma.</t8012> <t8013>Moreover, the way the others received that determination astonished me; the last time we talked about all this, we agreed that we should no longer hide anything at all from each other.</t8013> <t8014>Mina is asleep now, calm and peaceful like a little girl.</t8014> <t8015>Her lips are slightly parted and her face smiles with happiness.</t8015> <t8016>Thank God, even she can still enjoy such moments!</t8016>
<t8017>Later.</t8017> <t8018>How strange everything is!</t8018> <t8019>I was observing Mina's face, which reflected so much happiness, and I was so close to feeling happy myself for a moment, as I never would have believed possible again.</t8019> <t8020>As the afternoon progressed and the earth began to be covered by shadows cast by the objects illuminated by the light of the sun, which was getting lower and lower, the silence of the room began to seem more and more solemn to me.</t8020> <t8021>Suddenly, Mina opened her eyes and, looking at me tenderly, said:</t8021>
<t8022>–Jonathan, I want you to promise me something, giving me your word of honor.</t8022> <t8023>It will be a promise you make to me, but in a sacred manner, having God as a witness, and you must not break it, even if I kneel before you and beg you with tears in my eyes.</t8023> <t8024>Quick; you must make me that promise immediately.</t8024>
<t8025>–Mina -I told her-, I can't make you a promise of that kind immediately.</t8025> <t8026>It's possible that I don't have the right to make it to you.</t8026>
<t8027>–But, dear -she said with such spiritual intensity that her eyes shone as if they were two polar stars-, it is I who desires it, and not for myself.</t8027> <t8028>You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he does not agree, you can do what you think best.</t8028> <t8029>Moreover, if everyone agrees, you will be absolved of your promise.</t8029>
<t8030>–I promise you! – I told him; for a moment, he seemed to feel extraordinarily happy, although in my opinion, all happiness was denied to him because of the scar he had on his forehead.</t8030>
<t8031>–Promise me that you won't tell me anything about the plans they make for their campaign against the count -he said to me-.</t8031> <t8032>Neither by word, nor by means of inferences or implications, as long as I keep this.</t8032>
<t8033>And he solemnly pointed to the scar on his forehead.</t8033> <t8034>I saw that he was serious and I also said solemnly:</t8034>
<t8035>–I promise you!</t8035>
<t8036>And as soon as I uttered those words, I realized that a door had just closed between us.</t8036>
<t8037>Later, at midnight.</t8037> <t8038>Mina has been cheerful and lively all afternoon.</t8038> <t8039>So much so that everyone else seemed to cheer up in turn, as if they were infected by her joy; as a result, I also felt as if the tremendous weight that burdens us all had lightened a bit.</t8039> <t8040>We all retired early to our rooms.</t8040> <t8041>Mina is now sleeping like a baby; it's wonderful that she still has the ability to sleep, amidst her terrible problem.</t8041> <t8042>I thank God for that, as, in this way, at least she can forget her pain.</t8042> <t8043>It is possible that her example will affect me, as her joy did this afternoon.</t8043> <t8044>I will try.</t8044> <t8045>May it be a dream without nightmares!</t8045>
<t8046>October 6th, in the morning.</t8046> <t8047>Another surprise.</t8047> <t8048>Mina woke me up early, almost at the same time as the previous day, and asked me to take her to Dr. Van Helsing.</t8048> <t8049>I thought it was another occasion for hypnotism and, without hesitation, I went to find the professor.</t8049> <t8050>Evidently, he had been expecting such a call, as I found him in his room fully dressed.</t8050> <t8051>He had the door ajar, as if to hear the noise made by the door of our room opening.</t8051> <t8052>He accompanied me immediately; upon entering the room, he asked Mina if she wanted the others to be present as well.</t8052>
<t8053>–No -he said with complete simplicity-; it won't be necessary.</t8053> <t8054>You can tell him later.</t8054> <t8055>I wish to go with you on your journey.</t8055>
<t8056>Dr. Van Helsing was as astonished as I was.</t8056> <t8057>After a moment of silence, he asked:</t8057>
<t8058>–But, why?</t8058>
<t8059>–You must take me with you.</t8059> <t8060>I am safer with you, and you will also be safer with me.</t8060>
<t8061>–But why, dear Mrs. Mina?</t8061> <t8062>You know that your safety is our first and most important duty.</t8062> <t8063>We are approaching a danger to which you are or may be more exposed than any of us, due to the circumstances and events that have occurred.</t8063>
<t8064>He paused, feeling confused.</t8064>
<t8065>When replying, Mina raised a hand and pointed to her forehead.</t8065>
<t8066>–I already know.</t8066> <t8067>That is why I must go.</t8067> <t8068>I can tell you now, when the sun is about to rise; it is possible that I won't be able to do so later.</t8068> <t8069>I know that when the count wants me by his side, I will have to go.</t8069> <t8070>I know that if he tells me to go in secret, I will have to be cunning and no obstacle will stop me…</t8070> <t8071>Not even Jonathan.</t8071>
<t8072>God saw the look she gave me as she spoke, and if one of the recording angels was present, that look must have been noted for her eternal honor.</t8072> <t8073>The only thing I could do was take her hand, unable to speak; my emotion was too great to find solace in tears.</t8073> <t8074>She continued speaking:</t8074>
<t8075>–You men are brave and strong.</t8075> <t8076>You are strong when united, as you can face together what would shatter the human tolerance of someone who had to endure it alone.</t8076> <t8077>Moreover, I can be useful to you, as you can hypnotize me and make me tell you things that even I do not know.</t8077>
<t8078>The professor paused before responding.</t8078>
<t8079>–Mrs. Mina, you are, as always, very wise.</t8079> <t8080>You must accompany us, and together we will do whatever needs to be done.</t8080>
<t8081>The long silence that Mina kept made me look at her.</t8081> <t8082>She had fallen on her back on the pillows, asleep; she didn't even wake up when I raised the blinds of the window and let the sunlight fully illuminate the room.</t8082> <t8083>Van Helsing signaled me to follow him in silence.</t8083> <t8084>We went to his room and, after a minute, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were also by our side.</t8084> <t8085>He explained to them what Mina had told him and continued speaking:</t8085>
<t8086>–In the morning, we must leave for Varna.</t8086> <t8087>We must now consider a new factor: Mrs. Mina.</t8087> <t8088>But her soul is pure.</t8088> <t8089>It is a true agony for her to tell us what she has told us, but it is very accurate, and thus we will be warned in time.</t8089> <t8090>We must not miss any opportunity, and in Varna, we must be ready to act the moment that ship arrives.</t8090>
<t8091>– What exactly should we do? – asked Mr. Morris, with his usual laconic manner.</t8091>
<t8092>The professor paused before responding.</t8092>
<t8093>–First, we must take that ship; then, when we have identified the box, we must place a wild rose branch on it.</t8093> <t8094>We must secure it, because when the branch is on the box, no one can leave it.</t8094> <t8095>At least that's what the superstition says.</t8095> <t8096>And superstition must be trusted in principle; it was the faith of man in antiquity, and it still has its roots in faith.</t8096> <t8097>Then, when we have the opportunity we are looking for…</t8097> <t8098>When there is no one around to see us, we will open the box and..., and everything will be over.</t8098>
<t8099>–I don't intend to wait for any opportunity to present itself -said Morris-.</t8099> <t8100>As soon as I see the box, I will open it and destroy the monster, even if a thousand men are watching me, and even if they lynch me a moment later.</t8100>
<t8101>I grabbed his hand instinctively and discovered that it was as firm as a piece of steel.</t8101> <t8102>I think he understood my look; I hope he did.</t8102>
<t8103>–Magnificent! – said Professor Van Helsing.</t8103> <t8104>Magnificent!</t8104> <t8105>Our friend Quincey is a true man!</t8105> <t8106>God bless him for it!</t8106> <t8107>My friend, none of us will be left behind or stopped by any fear.</t8107> <t8108>I am only saying what we can do... What we must do.</t8108> <t8109>But in reality, none of us can say what we will do.</t8109> <t8110>There are many things that can happen, and their methods and ends are so diverse that, until the precise moment arrives, we cannot say.</t8110> <t8111>In any case, we must be armed, and when the final moment comes, our effort must not be in vain.</t8111> <t8112>Now, let us dedicate today to putting all our things in order.</t8112> <t8113>Let us prepare all the things related to other people who are dear to us or who depend on us, since none of us can say what, when, or how the end may be.</t8113> <t8114>As for me, all my affairs are in order and, as I have nothing else to do, I am going to prepare certain things and make certain arrangements for the journey.</t8114> <t8115>I am going to get all our tickets, etcetera.</t8115>
<t8116>There was nothing more to talk about, and we parted ways.</t8116>
<t8117>Now I must put all my affairs on earth in order and be prepared for anything that might happen...</t8117>
<t8118>Later.</t8118> <t8119>Everything is already arranged.</t8119> <t8120>I have made my will and everything is complete.</t8120> <t8121>Mina, if she survives, is my sole heir.</t8121> <t8122>If not, then our friends, who have been so good to us, will be my heirs.</t8122>
<t8123>The moment of sunset is approaching; Mina's unease makes me realize this.</t8123> <t8124>I am sure there is something in her mind that awakens at the moment of sunset.</t8124> <t8125>Those moments are becoming very unpleasant for all of us, as each time the sun sets or rises, it represents the possibility of a new danger... of some new pain that, however, may be a means of the Lord for a good end.</t8125> <t8126>I write all these things in my diary because my beloved wife should not know about them for now, but if it is possible for her to read them later, she will be prepared to do so.</t8126>
<t8127>He/She is calling me right now.</t8127>
<t8128>XXV.– FROM THE DIARY OF DOCTOR SEWARD</t8128>
<t8129>October 11, at night.</t8129> <t8130>Jonathan Harker has asked me to take note of all this, as he says he is not in a condition to handle this task, and he wishes for us to keep an accurate record of events.</t8130>
<t8131>I believe none of us were surprised when we were asked to go see Mrs. Harker, shortly before sunset.</t8131> <t8132>We had all long since come to understand that the moments of sunrise and sunset were times when she enjoyed greater freedom; when her former personality could manifest without any external force subjugating, limiting, or inciting her to action.</t8132> <t8133>This condition or mood always begins about half an hour before sunset and sunrise, and lasts until the sun is high, or until the clouds, with the sun hidden, still shine from the rays of light that spring from the horizon.</t8133> <t8134>At first, it is a kind of negative condition, as if some grip were broken, and then absolute freedom quickly presents itself; however, when the freedom ceases, the regression happens very quickly, preceded only by a period of silence, which serves as a warning.</t8134>
<t8135>Tonight, when we gathered, she seemed to be holding back and showed all the signs of an internal struggle.</t8135> <t8136>However, I saw that she made a violent effort as soon as she could.</t8136>
<t8137>However, a few minutes gave her complete control of herself; then, signaling her husband to sit next to her on the divan where she was half-reclined, she made all of us draw our chairs closer.</t8137>
<t8138>Then, taking one of her husband's hands between hers, she began to say:</t8138>
<t8139>–We are all together here, freely, perhaps for the last time!</t8139> <t8140>I know, dear; I know that you will always be with me, until the end -she said this addressing her husband, whose hand, as we could see, she had tightly held-.</t8140> <t8141>Tomorrow we are going to leave, to carry out our task, and only God can know what awaits each one of us.</t8141> <t8142>You are being very kind to me by agreeing to take me.</t8142> <t8143>I know what all of you, sincere and good men, can do for a poor and weak woman, whose soul is perhaps lost… No, no, no!</t8143> <t8144>Not yet!</t8144> <t8145>But it is something that may happen sooner or later.</t8145> <t8146>And I know you will do it.</t8146> <t8147>And you must remember that I am not like you.</t8147> <t8148>There is a poison in my blood and in my soul, that can destroy me; that must destroy me, unless we obtain some relief.</t8148> <t8149>My friends, you know as well as I do that my soul is at stake, and even though I know there is a way I can get out of this situation, neither you nor I should accept it.</t8149>
<t8150>She looked at us pleadingly, one by one, starting and ending with her husband.</t8150>
<t8151>–What is that way? – inquired van Helsing, with a hoarse voice.</t8151> <t8152>What is that solution that we must not and cannot accept?</t8152>
<t8153>–Let me die right now, whether by my own hand or by the hand of one of you, before the evil is consummated.</t8153> <t8154>Both you and I know that once dead, you could release my spirit and you would do so, as you did in the case of poor dear Lucy.</t8154> <t8155>If it were death or the fear of death the only obstacle in our way, I would have no objection to dying here, right now, among friends who love me.</t8155> <t8156>But death is not everything.</t8156> <t8157>I do not believe it is God's will for me to die in this case, when there is still hope and a difficult task awaits us all.</t8157> <t8158>Therefore, for my part, I reject at this moment what could be eternal rest and step outside, into the darkness, where the worst things that the world or the beyond hold may be found.</t8158>
<t8159>We all remained silent, as we instinctively understood that it was merely a prelude.</t8159> <t8160>The faces of everyone else were serious, and Harker's had turned as pale as a corpse's; perhaps he guessed, better than any of us, what was to follow.</t8160>
<t8161>Mrs. Harker continued:</t8161>
<t8162>–That is my contribution -I couldn't help but notice the use of those words in such circumstances and spoken with such seriousness-.</t8162> <t8163>What will each of your contributions be?</t8163> <t8164>Life, I know -he continued quickly-; that is easy for brave men.</t8164> <t8165>Your lives belong to God and you can return to Him what is His, but what are you going to give me?</t8165>
<t8166>She looked at us inquisitively again, but this time she avoided resting her gaze on her husband's face.</t8166>
<t8167>Quincey seemed to understand, nodded, and Mrs. Harker's face lit up.</t8167>
<t8168>–Then, I must clearly tell you what I desire, since there should be no doubts about this among all of us.</t8168> <t8169>You must promise me, all together and one by one, including you, my beloved husband, that if it becomes necessary, you will kill me.</t8169>
<t8170>"When will that be?" – the voice was Quincey's, but it was low and full of tension.</t8170>
<t8171>–When you are convinced that I have changed so much that it is better for me to die than to continue living.</t8171> <t8172>Then, when my flesh is dead, without a moment's delay, you will pierce me with a stake, cut off my head, or do anything that can make me rest in peace.</t8172>
<t8173>Quincey was the first to get up after the pause.</t8173> <t8174>He knelt before her and, taking her hand, said solemnly:</t8174>
<t8175>–I am an ordinary guy who, perhaps, has not lived as a man should to deserve such a distinction; but I swear to you, by all that is sacred and dear to me, that if that moment ever comes, I will not hesitate nor try to evade the duty you have imposed on us.</t8175> <t8176>And I also promise you that I will make sure, because if I have doubts, I will consider that the moment has arrived!</t8176>
<t8177>–My dear friend! – was all he could say in the midst of the tears that quickly ran down his cheeks, before leaning down and kissing Morris's hand.</t8177>
<t8178>–I swear the same to you, Mrs. Mina! – said van Helsing.</t8178>
<t8179>–And I! – said Lord Godalming, both kneeling, in turn, before her to make their promise.</t8179>
<t8180>I followed them myself.</t8180>
<t8181>Then, her husband turned to her, with a discomposed face and a greenish pallor that blended with the whiteness of his hair, and asked:</t8181>
<t8182>–Should I make that promise to you as well, my wife?</t8182>
<t8183>–You too, my love -she replied, with infinite pity reflected in her eyes and voice-.</t8183> <t8184>You must not hesitate.</t8184> <t8185>You are the closest and dearest in the world to me; our souls are fused into one for all life and all time.</t8185>
<t8186>Think, dear, that there have been times when valiant men have killed their wives and daughters to prevent them from falling into the hands of their enemies.</t8186> <t8187>Their hands did not tremble at all, because those they loved asked them to end their lives.</t8187> <t8188>It is the duty of men for those they love, in such times of harsh trials!</t8188> <t8189>And, my love, if someone's hand must give me death, let it be the hand of the one who loves me most.</t8189> <t8190>Doctor Van Helsing, I have not forgotten the grace you showed to the person you loved most, in the case of poor Lucy - she paused, blushing slightly, and changed her phrase -, to the one who had the most right to give her peace.</t8190> <t8191>If a similar occasion arises again, I count on you to establish that memory in my husband's life, that it be his loving hand that frees me from this terrible curse that weighs upon me.</t8191>
<t8192>–I swear it again! – said the professor, with a resonant voice.</t8192>
<t8193>Mrs. Harker smiled, truly smiled, as she leaned back with a genuine sigh and said:</t8193>
<t8194>–Now, I want to give you a warning; a warning that you can never forget: this time, if it appears, it may do so quickly and unexpectedly, and in that case, you must not waste time taking advantage of that opportunity.</t8194> <t8195>At that moment, I might be myself... better said, if that moment comes, I will be...</t8195> <t8196>Allied with our enemy, against you.</t8196>
<t8197>"One more request -he became very solemn as he said it-.</t8197> <t8198>It is not as vital or necessary as the other request, but I wish for you to do something for me, if you so desire.</t8198><t8199>"</t8199>
<t8200>We all nodded, but no one said anything; there was no need to speak.</t8200>
<t8201>–I want you all to read the Office of the Dead.</t8201>
<t8202>A strong groan from her husband interrupted her; she took his hand in hers, brought it to her heart, and continued:</t8202>
<t8203>–Someday you will have to read it about me, whatever the end of this terrible state of affairs may be.</t8203> <t8204>It will be a sweet thought for all or for some of us.</t8204> <t8205>You, my love, I hope you will be the one to read it, because that way it will be your voice that is remembered forever, no matter what happens.</t8205>
<t8206>–Should I read that, my dear? – asked Jonathan.</t8206>
<t8207>–That will console me, my husband! – was all she said.</t8207>
<t8208>And Jonathan began to read, after preparing the book.</t8208>
<t8209>How am I going to be able, how could anyone, to describe that strange scene, its solemnity, its gloominess, its sadness, its horror and, yet, also its sweetness?</t8209>
<t8210>Even a skeptic, who could only see a farce of the bitter truth in anything sacred or emotional, would have been deeply impressed to see that small group of devoted and loving friends, kneeling around that sad and unfortunate lady; or to feel the tender passion in the voice of her husband, whose tone was so emotional that he frequently had to pause, reading the simple and beautiful Office of the Dead.</t8210> <t8211>No... I cannot continue, the words and the voice... fail me.</t8211>
<t8212>Her instinct did not deceive her.</t8212> <t8213>As strange as it seemed and was, and above all, as it may seem to us even now, we who could feel its powerful influence at that moment, it consoled us greatly; and the silence that preceded Mrs. Harker's loss of spiritual freedom did not seem as full of despair as we had all feared.</t8213>
<t8214>From the journal of Jonathan Harker</t8214>
<t8215>October 15th, in Varna.</t8215> <t8216>We left Charing Cross in the morning of the twelfth, arrived in Paris that same night, and took the seats we had reserved on the Orient Express.</t8216> <t8217>We traveled day and night and arrived here at approximately five o'clock.</t8217> <t8218>Lord Godalming went to the consulate to see if any telegrams had arrived for him, while the rest of us came to this hotel... "the Odessus".</t8218> <t8219>The journey could have been enjoyable; however, I was too anxious to care about it.</t8219>
<t8220>Until the moment when the Czarina Catherine arrives at the port, there will be nothing in the whole world that interests me at all.</t8220> <t8221>Thank God! Mina is well and seems to be regaining her strength; she is getting her color back again.</t8221> <t8222>She sleeps a lot.</t8222> <t8223>During the day, she sleeps almost all the time.</t8223> <t8224>However, before sunrise and sunset, she is very awake and alert, and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to hypnotize her at those times.</t8224> <t8225>At first, it required some effort and he needed to make many passes, but now, she seems to respond immediately, as if by habit, and hardly any action is needed.</t8225> <t8226>The professor seems to have power at those particular moments; he only needs to will it, and my wife's thoughts obey him.</t8226>
<t8227>He always asks her what she can see and hear.</t8227> <t8228>To the first question, Mina responds:</t8228>
<t8229>–Nothing; everything is dark.</t8229> <t8230>And on the second:</t8230>
<t8231>I hear the waves crashing against the sides of the ship and the characteristic sound of the water.</t8231> <t8232>The sails and ropes are taut, and the masts and planks creak.</t8232> <t8233>The wind is strong...</t8233> <t8234>I hear it above the deck, and the foam raised by the stern falls over the bridge.</t8234>
<t8235>It is evident that the Czarina Catherine is still at sea, hurrying to cover the distance that separates it from Varna.</t8235> <t8236>Lord Godalming has just returned.</t8236> <t8237>He has four telegrams, one for each of the past four days, all with the same purpose: to ensure that the Czarina Catherine had not been reported to Lloyd's from anywhere.</t8237> <t8238>He had made arrangements for the agent to send him a daily telegram, indicating whether the ship had been reported.</t8238> <t8239>He had to receive a message each day, even if there was no news of the ship, so that he could be sure that they were truly keeping watch on the other side of the telegraph line.</t8239>
<t8240>We had dinner and went to bed early.</t8240> <t8241>Tomorrow we will go to see the vice-consul, to reach an agreement, if possible, in order to board the ship as soon as it arrives at the dock.</t8241> <t8242>Van Helsing says our best chance is to reach the ship between dawn and sunset.</t8242> <t8243>The count, even if he takes the form of a bat, cannot cross the water by his own will and, therefore, cannot leave the ship.</t8243> <t8244>Since he cannot take human form without arousing suspicion, which must not align well with his desires, he will remain locked in the box.</t8244> <t8245>If we can then board after sunrise, he will be completely at our mercy, as we can open the box and secure him, as we did with poor Lucy, before he wakes up.</t8245> <t8246>The pity that may arise in some or all of us should not be taken into account.</t8246> <t8247>We do not believe we will have many difficulties with public officials or sailors.</t8247> <t8248>Thank God!</t8248> <t8249>This is a country where bribery is possible and all of us have plenty of money.</t8249> <t8250>We just need to ensure that the ship cannot enter the port between sunset and dawn without us being warned, and thus, we will be safe.</t8250> <t8251>Judge Moneybag will resolve this case, I believe.</t8251>
<t8252>October 16.</t8252> <t8253>Mina's report remains the same: the crashing of waves and sounds of water, darkness, and favorable winds.</t8253> <t8254>Evidently, we are on time, and by the time the Czarina Catherine arrives, we will be prepared.</t8254> <t8255>As it must pass through the Dardanelles Strait, we are sure to receive some report then.</t8255>
<t8256>October 17th.</t8256> <t8257>Everything is already arranged, I believe, to receive the count upon his return from his trip.</t8257> <t8258>Godalming told the dockworkers that he believed the box probably contained something that had been stolen from a friend of his and obtained consent to open it, under his own responsibility.</t8258> <t8259>The shipowner gave him a paper indicating to the captain to give him all the facilities to do whatever he wanted on board the ship, and, likewise, a similar authorization intended for his agent in Varna.</t8259> <t8260>We have visited the agent, who was very impressed by Lord Godalming's manners towards him, and we are sure that he will do everything he can to satisfy our wishes.</t8260> <t8261>We have already resolved what we should do in the event that we receive the box opened.</t8261> <t8262>If the count is inside, Van Helsing and Dr. Seward must immediately cut off his head and pierce his heart with a stake.</t8262>
<t8263>Morris, Lord Godalming, and I must avoid any intrusions, even if it means using weapons, which we will have ready.</t8263> <t8264>The professor says that if we can treat the Count's body in this way, it will turn to dust immediately.</t8264> <t8265>In that case, there will be no evidence against us, in the event that there are suspicions of murder.</t8265> <t8266>But, even if it does not happen that way, we must face the consequences of our act, whether good or bad, and it is possible that someday in the future, these writings may serve to stand between some of us and the gallows.</t8266> <t8267>As for me, I will take the risk feeling very grateful, if necessary.</t8267> <t8268>We do not intend to leave anything to chance in carrying out our plan.</t8268> <t8269>We have made arrangements with several officials to be informed by a special messenger as soon as the Czarina Catherine is sighted.</t8269>
<t8270>October 24.</t8270> <t8271>We have been waiting for a whole week.</t8271> <t8272>Lord Godalming receives his telegrams daily, but they always say the same thing: "Not yet reported."</t8272> <t8273>Mina's response in the mornings and evenings, always in a hypnotic trance, has not changed: the clash of waves, sounds of water, and creaking of masts.</t8273>
<t8274>Telegram, October 24</t8274>
<t8275>Rufus Smith, Lloyd's, London, to Lord Godalming,</t8275>
<t8276>in charge of the Hon. English Vice-Consul in Varna</t8276>
<t8277>"Czarina Catherine reported this morning in the Dardanelles."</t8277>
<t8278>From the journal of Dr. Seward</t8278>
<t8279>October 25.</t8279> <t8280>How I miss my phonograph!</t8280> <t8281>Writing a diary with a pen is exasperating for me.</t8281> <t8282>But Van Helsing says I must do it.</t8282> <t8283>We were all very nervous yesterday when Godalming received his telegram from Lloyd's.</t8283> <t8284>Now I completely understand what men feel in battles when they are ordered into action.</t8284> <t8285>The only one in our group who showed no sign of emotion was Mrs. Harker.</t8285> <t8286>After all, it is not surprising that she did not get emotional, as we took special care not to let her know anything about it and all tried not to appear disturbed in her presence.</t8286> <t8287>In the past, I am sure she would have noticed immediately, no matter how much we tried to hide it from her, but, in reality, she has changed a lot over the last three weeks.</t8287> <t8288>The lethargy is becoming more pronounced in her and she is regaining some of her color.</t8288> <t8289>Van Helsing and I are not satisfied.</t8289> <t8290>We talk about her frequently; however, we have not said a word to the others.</t8290> <t8291>It would break poor Harker's heart, or at least his nervous system, if he knew that we had even the slightest suspicions about it.</t8291> <t8292>Van Helsing tells me that he examines her teeth very carefully while she is in a hypnotic trance, as he assures that as long as they do not begin to sharpen, there is no active danger of a change in her.</t8292> <t8293>If that change occurs... it will happen in several stages...!</t8293> <t8294>We both know what these stages will necessarily be, although we do not confide our thoughts to each other.</t8294> <t8295>None of us must shrink from the task... no matter how tremendous it may seem to us.</t8295> <t8296>"Euthanasia" is an excellent and consoling word!</t8296> <t8297>I am grateful to whoever invented it.</t8297>
<t8298>There are only about twenty-four hours of sailing from the Dardanelles to this place, at the speed that the Czarina Catherine has been traveling from London.</t8298> <t8299>Therefore, it should arrive during the morning, but since it is not possible for it to arrive before noon, we all prepare to retire to our rooms early.</t8299>
<t8300>We must get up at one o'clock to be prepared.</t8300>
<t8301>October 25, at noon.</t8301> <t8302>We still haven't received any news of the ship's arrival.</t8302> <t8303>Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report this morning was the same as always; therefore, it is possible that we will receive news about it at any moment.</t8303> <t8304>All the men are feverish with excitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are as cold as ice and, an hour ago, I found him moistening the edge of the large Gurkha knife he always carries with him now.</t8304> <t8305>It will be a bad moment for the count if the edge of that "kukri" touches his throat, wielded by such cold and steady hands!</t8305>
<t8306>Van Helsing and I are somewhat alarmed today regarding Mrs. Harker.</t8306> <t8307>Near midday, she fell into a kind of lethargy that we do not like at all, although we kept it a secret and did not tell the others, we do not feel happy about it at all.</t8307> <t8308>She was restless all morning, so at first, we were glad to know that she had fallen asleep.</t8308> <t8309>However, when her husband mentioned that she was so deeply asleep that he had not been able to wake her, we went to her room to see for ourselves.</t8309> <t8310>She was breathing naturally and looked so pleasant and full of peace that we agreed that sleep was better for her than anything else.</t8310> <t8311>Poor woman!</t8311> <t8312>She has so many things to forget that it is not surprising that sleep, if it allows her to forget, does her a lot of good.</t8312>
<t8313>Later.</t8313> <t8314>Our opinion was justified, since, after a good sleep of several hours, he woke up; he seemed brighter and better than he had been for several days.</t8314> <t8315>At sunset, he gave the same report as usual.</t8315>
<t8316>Wherever he may be, in the Black Sea, the count is hastening to reach his destination.</t8316> <t8317>I trust it will be to his destruction!</t8317>
<t8318>October 26.</t8318> <t8319>Another day has passed, and there are no signs of the Czarina Catherine.</t8319> <t8320>It should have arrived by now.</t8320> <t8321>It is evident that it is still sailing somewhere, as Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report before sunrise was exactly the same.</t8321> <t8322>It is possible that the ship sometimes remains stationary due to the fog; several steamers that arrived last night reported encountering fog banks both to the north and south of the port.</t8322> <t8323>We must continue our watch, as the ship may be signaled to us at any moment now.</t8323>
<t8324>October 27, at noon.</t8324> <t8325>It is very strange that we have not yet received news of the ship we are expecting.</t8325> <t8326>Mrs. Harker gave her report last night and this morning as usual: "Crashes of waves and sounds of water," although she added that "the waves were very gentle."</t8326> <t8327>The telegrams from London had been exactly the same as always: "No further reports."</t8327> <t8328>Van Helsing is terribly anxious and told me a few moments ago that he fears the count is fleeing from us.</t8328> <t8329>He added significantly:</t8329>
<t8330>–I don't like that lethargy of Mrs. Mina.</t8330> <t8331>Souls and memories can do very strange things during trances.</t8331>
<t8332>I was about to ask him something more about it, but Harker entered at that moment and the professor raised a hand to warn me of it.</t8332> <t8333>We must try this afternoon, at sunset, to make her talk a bit more when she is in her hypnotic state.</t8333>
<t8334>October 28.</t8334> <t8335>Telegram.</t8335>
<t8336>Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming,</t8336>
<t8337>under the responsibility of the Honorable English Vice-Consul in Varna</t8337>
<t8338>"They report that Czarina Catherine entered Galatz today at one o'clock sharp.</t8338><t8339>"</t8339>
<t8340>From the diary of Dr. Seward</t8340>
<t8341>October 28.</t8341> <t8342>When the telegram announcing the ship's arrival in Galatz came, I don't think it shocked any of us as much as one might have expected under the circumstances.</t8342> <t8343>It's true that none of us knew where, how, or when the difficulty would arise, but I believe we all expected something strange to happen.</t8343> <t8344>The day it was supposed to arrive in Varna, we all individually convinced ourselves that things were not going to happen as we had imagined; we were just waiting to know where the change would occur.</t8344> <t8345>Nevertheless, it was still a surprise.</t8345> <t8346>I suppose that nature works on such hopeful bases that we believe, against our better judgment, that things have to be as they should be, not as we should know they will be.</t8346> <t8347>Transcendentalism is a guide for angels, but a will-o'-the-wisp for men.</t8347> <t8348>Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment, as if arguing with the Almighty, but he didn't say a word and, after a few seconds, he stood up with a hard expression on his face.</t8348> <t8349>Lord Godalming turned very pale and sat down, breathing heavily.</t8349> <t8350>I myself was absolutely stunned and looked at the others in astonishment.</t8350> <t8351>Quincey Morris tightened his belt with a quick movement that I knew very well: in our adventurous times, it meant "action."</t8351> <t8352>Mrs. Harker turned intensely pale, so much so that the scar on her forehead seemed to be burning, but she clasped her hands piously and looked up, praying.</t8352> <t8353>Harker smiled, with the dark and bitter smile of someone who has lost all hope, but at the same time, his action belied that impression, as his hands instinctively went to the handle of his large kukri knife and remained resting on it.</t8353>
<t8354>–When does the next train to Galatz leave? – van Helsing asked us, addressing everyone in general.</t8354>
<t8355>–Tomorrow morning, at half past six! – we all started, because the answer had been given by Mrs. Harker.</t8355>
<t8356>–How is it possible that you know that? – said Art.</t8356>
<t8357>–You forget..., or perhaps you don't know, although my husband and Dr. Van Helsing know very well, that I am a train enthusiast.</t8357> <t8358>At home, in Exeter, I always used to adjust the timetables to be helpful to my husband.</t8358> <t8359>I knew that if something forced us to head towards Dracula's castle, we would have to go through Galatz or, at the very least, through Bucharest; therefore, I learned the schedules carefully.</t8359> <t8360>Unfortunately, there weren't many schedules to learn, as the only train leaves tomorrow at the time I told you.</t8360>
<t8361>–Wonderful woman! – said the professor.</t8361>
<t8362>"Can't we get a special one?" asked Lord Godalming.</t8362> <t8363>Van Helsing shook his head.</t8363>
<t8364>–I'm afraid not.</t8364> <t8365>This country is very different from yours or mine; even if we managed to get a special train, we wouldn't arrive before the regular train.</t8365> <t8366>Besides, we have something to prepare.</t8366> <t8367>We must reflect.</t8367> <t8368>We have to organize ourselves.</t8368> <t8369>You, friend Arthur, go to the station, purchase the tickets, and make all the necessary arrangements so that we can set off tomorrow.</t8369> <t8370>You, friend Jonathan, go see the shipping agent to get orders for the agent in Galatz, so that we can inspect the ship just as we did here.</t8370> <t8371>Quincey Morris, see the vice-consul and obtain his help to get in touch with his colleague in Galatz and do everything possible to smooth our way, so that we don't have to waste time when we are on the Danube.</t8371> <t8372>John should stay with Mrs. Mina and me, and we will talk.</t8372> <t8373>Thus, if time passes and you are delayed, it won't matter if sunset comes, since I will be here with Mrs. Mina, so she can give us her report.</t8373>
<t8374>–And I -said Mrs. Harker vividly, with an expression more similar to the old one from her happy days than we had seen in many days-, I am going to try to be useful to you in every possible way and I must think and write for you, as I did before.</t8374> <t8375>Something is changing in me in a very strange way, and I feel freer than I have been in recent times!</t8375>
<t8376>The three youngest seemed to feel happier the moment they thought they understood the meaning of his words, but Van Helsing and I looked at each other with seriousness and great concern.</t8376> <t8377>However, we said nothing at that moment.</t8377> <t8378>When the three men left to take care of the tasks that had been entrusted to them, Van Helsing asked Mrs. Harker to fetch the copies of the journals and bring him the part of Harker's journal related to the castle.</t8378> <t8379>The lady went to get what the professor had asked for.</t8379> <t8380>As soon as the door closed behind her, he said to me:</t8380>
<t8381>–We think the same!</t8381> <t8382>Speak!</t8382>
<t8383>–There has been a change.</t8383> <t8384>It is a hope that makes me sick, because we might suffer a disappointment.</t8384>
<t8385>–Exactly.</t8385> <t8386>Do you know why I asked her to go get the manuscript for me?</t8386>
<t8387>–No! – I told him –, unless it was to have a chance to talk to me alone.</t8387>
<t8388>–You are partly right, my friend, but only partly.</t8388> <t8389>I want to tell you something and, truly, my friend John, I am taking a terrible risk, but I think it is fair.</t8389> <t8390>At the moment when Mrs. Mina said those words that surprised us both so much.</t8390> <t8391>I had an inspiration.</t8391> <t8392>During the trance three days ago, the count sent his spirit to read her mind; or it is more likely that he took her to see him in his box of earth on the ship, in the middle of the sea; that is why she was freed shortly before sunrise and sunset.</t8392> <t8393>Thus, he knew we were here, since she had more to say in her life outdoors, with eyes to see and ears to hear, than he, locked as he is, in his coffin.</t8393> <t8394>So now he must be making a supreme effort to flee from us.</t8394> <t8395>He does not need her currently.</t8395> <t8396>"He is sure, with the great knowledge he has, that she will come to his call, but he removed his power over her, as he can do, so that she does not go to meet him.</t8396> <t8397>Ah!</t8397> <t8398>Now I have hope that our human brains, which have been human for so long and have not lost the grace of God, will go further than his childish brain that remained in his tomb for several centuries, that has not yet reached our stature and that only does selfish and, consequently, mediocre work.</t8398> <t8399>Here comes Mrs. Mina.</t8399> <t8400>Do not say a single word to her about her trance!</t8400> <t8401>She does not know, and it would be as much as overwhelming and despairing her just when we want all her hope, all her courage; when we must use the brain she has and that has been trained like a man's, but is that of a sweet woman and has received the power given to her by the count and that he cannot completely withdraw..., although he does not think so.</t8401> <t8402>Oh, John, my friend, we are among terrible reefs!</t8402> <t8403>I have a greater fear than ever before.</t8403> <t8404>We can only trust in God.</t8404> <t8405>Silence! Here she comes!"</t8405>
<t8406>I thought the professor was going to have a nervous breakdown and collapse, like when Lucy died, but with great effort he controlled himself and did not seem nervous at all when Mrs. Harker made her entrance into the room, lively and with a happy expression, and, being occupied with something, apparently forgotten about her tragedy.</t8406> <t8407>Upon entering, she handed van Helsing a bundle of typewritten papers.</t8407> <t8408>The professor leafed through them gravely, and his face began to light up as he read.</t8408> <t8409>Then, holding the pages between his index finger and thumb, he said:</t8409>
<t8410>–Friend John, for you, who already have some experience..., and also for you who are young, Mrs. Mina, here is a good lesson: never be afraid to think.</t8410> <t8411>A half-formed thought has frequently been fluttering in my imagination, but I fear letting it lose its wings...</t8411> <t8412>Now, with more knowledge, I return to the place where that embryonic thought originated and discover that it is not embryonic at all, but a complete thought; although still so young that it cannot yet use its tiny wings well.</t8412> <t8413>No; like the "Ugly Duckling" of my friend Hans Andersen, it was not a duck thought at all, but a swan thought, large, that flies with very powerful wings, when the time comes for it to try them out.</t8413> <t8414>Look, I read here what Jonathan wrote:</t8414>
<t8415>–"That other one of his race who, in a later era, repeatedly made his troops cross The Great River and penetrate Turkish territory; who, when he was repelled, returned again and again, even when he had to return alone from the bloodied battlefield where his troops were being torn apart, because he knew that he alone could triumph…"</t8415>
<t8416>"What does this suggest to us?</t8416> <t8417>Not much? No!</t8417> <t8418>The childish thought of the count hides nothing, that's why he spoke so freely.</t8418> <t8419>His human thoughts saw nothing, nor did my human thought, until now.</t8419> <t8420>No!</t8420> <t8421>But another word comes from a person who speaks without thinking, because she also does not know what it means... what it could mean.</t8421> <t8422>It is like the elements at rest that, nevertheless, in their natural course, follow their path, touch each other... and, poof!, a flash of light is produced that covers the entire sky, that blinds, kills, and destroys something or someone, but that illuminates the earth below, kilometers and more kilometers around.</t8422> <t8423>Isn't that so?</t8423> <t8424>Well, I better explain myself.</t8424> <t8425>To begin with, have you ever studied the philosophy of crime? "Yes" and "no".</t8425> <t8426>You, friend John, yes, since you are a student of madness.</t8426> <t8427>You, Mrs. Mina, no; because crime does not touch you... except once.</t8427> <t8428>However, your mind really works and does not argue from the particular to the universal.</t8428>
<t8429>"In criminals, there exists that peculiarity.</t8429> <t8430>It is so constant in all countries and times, that even the police, who do not know much about philosophy, come to know it empirically, that it exists.</t8430> <t8431>The criminal always works on a crime... that is the true criminal, who seems to be predestined for that crime and who does not wish to commit any other.</t8431> <t8432>That criminal does not have a complete human brain.</t8432> <t8433>He is intelligent, skillful, and full of resources, but he does not have an adult brain.</t8433> <t8434>At most, he has a child's brain.</t8434> <t8435>Now, this criminal we are dealing with is also predestined for crime; he, too, has a child's brain and it is childish to do what he has done.</t8435> <t8436>Little birds, small fish, little animals, do not learn by principle but empirically, and when they learn how to do something, that knowledge serves as a basis to do something else, starting from it.</t8436> <t8437>Dos pousto, said Archimedes, give me a point of support and I will move the world!</t8437> <t8438>Doing something once is the point of support from which the child's brain develops into a man's brain, and as long as it does not have the desire to do more, it will continue doing the same thing repeatedly, exactly as it has done before!</t8438> <t8439>Oh, my dear lady, I see that your eyes are opening and that for you, the lightning's light illuminates the whole terrain."</t8439> <t8440>Mrs. Harker began to clasp her hands and her eyes sparkled.</t8440> <t8441>The professor continued saying:</t8441>
<t8442>–Now you must speak.</t8442> <t8443>Tell us, two men thirsty for knowledge, what you see with those bright eyes.</t8443>
<t8444>He took her hand and held it between his own while he spoke.</t8444> <t8445>His index finger and thumb rested on her pulse, I thought instinctively and unconsciously, as she spoke:</t8445>
<t8446>–The count is a criminal and of the criminal type.</t8446> <t8447>Nordau and Lombroso would classify him as such and, as a criminal, he has an imperfectly formed brain.</t8447> <t8448>Thus, when he finds himself in difficulties, he must take refuge in habits.</t8448> <t8449>His past is an indication, and the only page of it that we know, from his own lips, tells us that on one occasion, before, when he found himself in what Mr. Morris would call "a difficult situation," he returned to his own country from the land he had gone to invade and, then, without losing sight of his goals, he prepared for a new effort.</t8449> <t8450>He came back again, better equipped to carry out that work, and he succeeded.</t8450> <t8451>Thus, he went to London, to invade a new land.</t8451> <t8452>He was defeated, and when he lost all hope of triumph and saw that his existence was in danger, he returned by sea to his home; just as before he had fled over the Danube, coming from Turkish lands.</t8452>
<t8453>–Magnificent! Magnificent!</t8453> <t8454>You are an extraordinarily intelligent woman! – said Van Helsing enthusiastically, as he bowed and kissed her hand.</t8454> <t8455>A moment later, he said to me with the same calmness as if we had been conducting a medical examination:</t8455>
<t8456>–Only seventy-two and with all this excitement.</t8456> <t8457>I have hopes -he turned to her again and said, with great expectation-: Continue.</t8457> <t8458>Continue!</t8458> <t8459>You can tell us more if you wish; John and I know it.</t8459> <t8460>At least, I know it, and I will tell you if you are right or not.</t8460> <t8461>Speak without fear!</t8461>
<t8462>–I will try; but I hope you will excuse me if I seem selfish to you.</t8462>
<t8463>–No!</t8463> <t8464>Do not fear.</t8464> <t8465>You must be selfish, since it is you we are thinking of.</t8465>
<t8466>–Then, since he is a criminal, he is selfish; and since his intellect is small and his actions are based on selfishness, he is limited to one end.</t8466> <t8467>That purpose lacks remorse.</t8467> <t8468>Just as he crossed the Danube, letting his troops be destroyed, so now he thinks of saving himself, without caring about anything else.</t8468> <t8469>Thus, his own selfishness frees my soul, to some extent, from the terrible power he acquired over me that dreadful night.</t8469> <t8470>I am sorry!</t8470> <t8471>Oh, I am sorry!</t8471> <t8472>Thank God for His enormous mercy!</t8472> <t8473>My soul is freer than it has ever been since that terrible hour, and the only thing I fear is that in some of my trances or dreams, I may have used my knowledge for his purposes.</t8473>
<t8474>The professor stood up and said:</t8474>
<t8475>–He has used his mind; that is why he left us here in Varna, while the ship that carried him quickly advanced, shrouded in fog, towards Galatz, where, without a doubt, he had prepared everything to flee from us.</t8475> <t8476>But his childish mind did not go further, and it is possible that, as always happens according to Divine Providence, what the criminal believed was good for his selfish well-being turns out to be the greatest harm he receives.</t8476> <t8477>The hunter is caught in his own trap, as the great psalmist says.</t8477> <t8478>Since now he believes he is free from us and has left no trace and has managed to flee from us, having so many hours of advantage to do so, his childish brain will make him sleep.</t8478> <t8479>He also believes that by ceasing to know your mind, you cannot have any knowledge of him; that is his mistake!</t8479> <t8480>That terrible baptism of blood that he inflicted on you makes you free to go to him in spirit, as you have always been able to do until now, in your moments of freedom, when the sun rises or sets.</t8480> <t8481>In those moments, you go by my will, not by his.</t8481> <t8482>And that power, for the good of both you and so many others, you have acquired through your sufferings at his hands.</t8482> <t8483>That is all the more precious to us, as he himself has no knowledge of it, and to protect himself, he avoids being able to have knowledge of our doings.</t8483> <t8484>However, we are not selfish, and we believe that God is with us during all this darkness and all these terrible hours.</t8484> <t8485>We must follow him, and we will not fail; even if we put ourselves in danger of becoming like him.</t8485> <t8486>Friend John, this has been a magnificent hour; and we have gained much ground in our case.</t8486> <t8487>You must become a scribe and put everything in writing, so that when the others arrive, they can read it and know what we know.</t8487>
<t8488>Therefore, I have written all this while we await the return of our friends, and Mrs. Harker has typed it all up with her machine, ever since she brought us the manuscripts.</t8488>
<t8489>XXVI.–</t8489> <t8490>FROM THE JOURNAL OF DR. SEWARD</t8490>
<t8491>October 29.</t8491> <t8492>I am writing this on the train, from Varna to Galatz.</t8492> <t8493>Yesterday evening, we all gathered shortly before sunset.</t8493> <t8494>Each of us had done our work as well as we could; in terms of thought, dedication, and opportunity, we are prepared for our entire journey and for our work when we arrive in Galatz.</t8494> <t8495>When the usual time came, Mrs. Harker prepared for her hypnotic effort, and after a more prolonged and serious effort from Van Helsing than was usually necessary, the lady entered a trance.</t8495> <t8496>Ordinarily, the lady spoke with just a hint, but this time, the professor had to ask her questions and ask them very firmly before we could learn anything; finally, her response came:</t8496>
<t8497>–I can't see anything; we are motionless; there are no waves, only a gentle sound of water running against the mooring line.</t8497> <t8498>I hear men's voices shouting, near and far, and the sound of oars in their placements.</t8498> <t8499>Someone fires a pistol somewhere; the echo of the shot seems very distant.</t8499> <t8500>I hear the noise of footsteps above and they place chains and ropes nearby.</t8500> <t8501>What is this?</t8501> <t8502>There is a ray of light; I feel the air hitting me directly.</t8502>
<t8503>Here she stopped.</t8503> <t8504>She had impulsively risen from where she had been lying, on the divan, and raised both hands, palms up, as if she were bearing a great weight.</t8504> <t8505>Van Helsing and I looked at each other, fully understanding.</t8505> <t8506>Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and stared at her, while Harker instinctively closed his hand over the hilt of his kukri.</t8506> <t8507>There was a prolonged pause.</t8507> <t8508>We all knew that the moment when she could speak was passing, but we thought it was useless to say anything.</t8508> <t8509>Suddenly, she sat up and, as she opened her eyes, said softly:</t8509>
<t8510>–Would any of you like a cup of tea?</t8510> <t8511>You all must be very tired.</t8511>
<t8512>We wished to please her and, consequently, we nodded.</t8512> <t8513>She left the room to fetch the tea.</t8513> <t8514>When we were alone, Van Helsing said:</t8514>
<t8515>–Do you see, my friends?</t8515> <t8516>He is near the land: he has come out of his box of earth.</t8516> <t8517>But he still has to reach the shore.</t8517> <t8518>During the night he may remain hidden somewhere, but if he is not taken to the shore or if the ship does not dock next to it, he cannot reach the land.</t8518> <t8519>In that case, if it is night, he can change form and jump or fly to the land, as he did in Whitby.</t8519> <t8520>But if day comes before he is on the shore, then, unless he is taken to land, he cannot disembark.</t8520> <t8521>And if he is unloaded, then the customs officers may discover what the box contains.</t8521> <t8522>Thus, in summary, if he does not escape to land tonight or before sunrise, he will lose the entire day.</t8522> <t8523>Then, we will be able to arrive in time, since if he does not escape during the night, we will reach him during the day and find him inside the box and at our mercy, since he cannot be his own self, awake and visible, for fear of being discovered.</t8523>
<t8524>There was nothing more to say, so we waited patiently for dawn to arrive, as at that time we could learn something more through Mrs. Harker.</t8524>
<t8525>This early morning, we listened, holding our breath, to the answers she might give us during her trance.</t8525> <t8526>The hypnotic stage took even longer to arrive than the previous time, and when it did, the time remaining until sunrise was so short that we began to despair.</t8526> <t8527>Van Helsing seemed to put his entire soul into the effort; finally, obeying the professor's will, Mrs. Harker said:</t8527>
<t8528>–Everything is dark.</t8528> <t8529>I hear the water at the same level as me, and certain scrapes, like wood on wood.</t8529>
<t8530>He paused and the reddish sun made its appearance.</t8530> <t8531>We will have to wait until tonight.</t8531>
<t8532>Therefore, we are traveling towards Galatz very excited and full of anticipation.</t8532> <t8533>We should arrive between two and three in the morning, but in Bucharest we are already three hours late, so it is impossible for us to arrive before the sun is already very high in the sky.</t8533> <t8534>Thus, we will still have two more hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker!</t8534> <t8535>Either of them or both may shed more light on what is happening.</t8535>
<t8536>Later.</t8536> <t8537>The sun has already set.</t8537> <t8538>Fortunately, its setting occurred at a time when there was no distraction, because if it had taken place during our stay at a station, we would not have had enough calm and isolation.</t8538> <t8539>Mrs. Harker responded to the hypnotic influence even more slowly than this morning.</t8539> <t8540>I fear that her power to read the Count's sensations is fading, and at the moment when we need it the most.</t8540> <t8541>It seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work.</t8541> <t8542>While she has been in a trance until now, she has always limited herself to simple facts.</t8542> <t8543>If this continues, it is possible that it may lead us astray.</t8543> <t8544>If I thought that the Count's power over her would disappear at the same time as her power to know him, I would feel happy, but I fear that won't happen.</t8544> <t8545>When she spoke, her words were enigmatic:</t8545>
<t8546>–Something is coming out; I feel it passing by me like a cold wind.</t8546> <t8547>I can hear, in the distance, confused sounds…</t8547> <t8548>Like men speaking in unknown tongues; water falling forcefully and wolves howling.</t8548>
<t8549>She paused, and a shiver ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds until, finally, she was trembling as if in a fit.</t8549> <t8550>She said nothing more; not even in response to the professor's imperious questioning.</t8550> <t8551>When she came out of the trance, she was cold, exhausted, and languid, but her mind was wide awake.</t8551> <t8552>She couldn't remember anything; she asked what she had said and pondered it for a long time, in silence.</t8552>
<t8553>October 30, at seven in the morning.</t8553> <t8554>We are near Galatz already and it is possible that I won't have time to write later.</t8554> <t8555>We are all anxiously awaiting the sunrise this morning.</t8555> <t8556>Knowing the increasing difficulty of inducing the hypnotic trance, Van Helsing began his passes earlier than ever.</t8556> <t8557>However, they produced no effect until the regular time, when she responded with increasing difficulty, just a minute before sunrise.</t8557> <t8558>The professor wasted no time in questioning her.</t8558> <t8559>Her response was given with the same quickness:</t8559>
<t8560>–Everything is dark.</t8560> <t8561>I feel the water passing close to my ears, at the same level, and the scraping of wood against wood.</t8561> <t8562>I hear cattle in the distance.</t8562> <t8563>There is another sound, a very strange one, like...</t8563>
<t8564>She fell silent and turned pale, intensely pale.</t8564>
<t8565>–Continue, continue!</t8565> <t8566>I order you!</t8566> <t8567>Speak! – said van Helsing, in a firm tone.</t8567> <t8568>At the same time, desperation appeared in his eyes, because the sun, upon rising, was reddening even the pale face of Mrs. Harker.</t8568> <t8569>She opened her eyes and we all started when she said sweetly and, apparently, with the utmost lack of interest:</t8569>
<t8570>–Oh, professor!</t8570> <t8571>Why do you ask me to do what you know I can't?</t8571> <t8572>I don't remember anything! – then, seeing the expression of astonishment in our eyes, she said, turning from one to another with a confused look-: What did I say to you?</t8572> <t8573>What have I done?</t8573> <t8574>I don't know anything; only that I was lying here, half asleep, when I heard you say: "Continue!</t8574> <t8575>Continue! I order you! Speak!"</t8575> <t8576>It seemed very funny to hear you giving me orders, as if I were a naughty child!</t8576>
<t8577>–Oh, Mrs. Mina! – said Van Helsing sadly-.</t8577> <t8578>That is proof, if needed, of how much I love and honor you, since a word for your sake, spoken with greater sincerity than ever, may seem strange because it is directed to the one whom I am proud to obey!</t8578>
<t8579>Whistles are heard; we are approaching Galatz.</t8579> <t8580>We are filled with anxiety.</t8580>
<t8581>From the journal of Mina Harker</t8581>
<t8582>October 30.</t8582> <t8583>Mr. Morris led me to the hotel where rooms had been reserved for us by telegraph, since he did not speak any foreign language and, therefore, was the least useful.</t8583> <t8584>The forces were distributed largely as they had been in Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to see the vice-consul, since his title could serve as an immediate guarantee in some way, before the official, because we were in extraordinary haste.</t8584> <t8585>Jonathan and the two doctors went to see the shipping agent to learn all the details about the arrival of the Czarina Catherine.</t8585>
<t8586>Later.</t8586> <t8587>Lord Godalming has returned.</t8587> <t8588>The consul is out and the vice-consul is sick; so the routine work is being handled by a secretary.</t8588> <t8589>He was very kind and offered to do everything in his power.</t8589>
<t8590>From the journal of Jonathan Harker</t8590>
<t8591>October 30.</t8591> <t8592>At nine o'clock, Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I visited Mr. Mackenzie and Mr. Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of Hapgood.</t8592> <t8593>They had received a telegram from London in response to Lord Godalming's telegraphic request, asking them to show us every possible courtesy and to assist us as much as they could.</t8593> <t8594>They were more than kind and courteous, and immediately took us aboard the Czarina Catherine, which was anchored outside, at the mouth of the river.</t8594> <t8595>There we met the captain, named Donelson, who told us about his voyage.</t8595> <t8596>He said that in all his life he had never had such a favorable wind.</t8596>
<t8597>–Wow! – he said.</t8597> <t8598>But we were fearful, because we were afraid that we would have to pay with some accident or something similar for the extraordinary luck that favored us throughout the entire journey.</t8598> <t8599>It is not common to sail from London to the Black Sea with a tailwind that seemed like the devil himself was blowing on the sails for his own purposes.</t8599> <t8600>At the same time, we couldn't see anything.</t8600> <t8601>As soon as we approached a ship or land, a fog descended upon us, covered us, and traveled with us, until when it lifted, we looked around and couldn't see anything.</t8601> <t8602>We passed through Gibraltar without being able to signal our passage, and we couldn't communicate until we were in the Dardanelles, waiting for the corresponding permission.</t8602> <t8603>At first, I felt inclined to lower the sails and wait for the fog to lift, but, in the meantime, I thought that if the devil was interested in getting us quickly to the Black Sea, he would probably do so, whether we stopped or not.</t8603> <t8604>If we made a quick journey, it wouldn't discredit us with the shipowners and wouldn't harm our traffic, and the devil, having achieved his goals, would be grateful for not having put obstacles in his way.</t8604>
<t8605>This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition and commercial reasoning, excited van Helsing, who said:</t8605>
<t8606>–My friend, that devil is much smarter than many think and knows when he meets his match!</t8606>
<t8607>The captain did not appear displeased by the compliment, and continued speaking:</t8607>
<t8608>–When we crossed the Bosphorus, the men began to grumble; some of them, the Romanians, came to see me and asked me to throw overboard a large box that had been loaded by a sinister-looking old man, shortly before we left London.</t8608> <t8609>I had seen them spying on that fellow and raising their two index fingers when they saw him, to ward off the evil eye.</t8609> <t8610>Well!</t8610> <t8611>The superstitions of these foreigners are absolutely ridiculous!</t8611> <t8612>I quickly sent them to mind their own business, but as the fog closed in on us again shortly after, I somewhat felt that they might have a bit of a point, though I couldn't be sure it was about the large box again.</t8612> <t8613>Well, we continued sailing and, although the fog didn't leave us for five days, I let the wind guide us, since if the devil wanted to go somewhere...</t8613> <t8614>Well, I wouldn't stop him.</t8614> <t8615>And if he didn't guide us, well, we would take a look anyway.</t8615> <t8616>In any case, we had deep waters and a good voyage all the time, and two days ago, when the morning sun broke through the fog, we discovered that we were on the river, right in front of Galatz.</t8616> <t8617>The Romanians were furious and wanted, with or without my consent, to throw the large box overboard, into the river.</t8617> <t8618>I had to argue a bit with them, with a bar in hand, and when the last of them left the bridge with his head in his hands, I had managed to convince them that, evil eye or not, my employers' property was much better off on my ship than at the bottom of the Danube.</t8618> <t8619>They had brought the box up to the deck, ready to throw it into the water, and since it was marked Galatz via Varna, I thought it best to leave it there until we unloaded it at the port and got rid of it anyway.</t8619> <t8620>We didn't do much work that day, but in the morning, an hour before sunrise, a man came on board with an order written in English and sent from London, to receive a box marked for a certain Count Dracula.</t8620>
<t8621>Naturally, everything was prepared for her to take it away.</t8621> <t8622>The paperwork was in order, and I was glad to get rid of that damned box, as I myself was starting to feel uneasy because of it.</t8622> <t8623>If the devil had any luggage on board, I was convinced it could only be that box.</t8623>
<t8624>–What was the name of the man who took that box? – asked Dr. Van Helsing, controlling his anxiety.</t8624>
<t8625>–I'm going to tell him right away! – he replied and, going down to his cabin, showed us a receipt signed by "Immanuel Hildesheim".</t8625> <t8626>The address was Burgenstrasse 16.</t8626>
<t8627>We discovered that this was all the captain knew, so we thanked him and left.</t8627>
<t8628>We found Hildesheim in his offices; he was a Hebrew of the Adelphi Theatre type, with a ram-like nose and a fez.</t8628> <t8629>His arguments were marked by money, we made the offer and after some haggling, he ended up telling us everything he knew.</t8629> <t8630>That turned out to be simple, but very important.</t8630> <t8631>He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville, from London, telling him to receive, if possible before dawn, to avoid customs, a box that would arrive in Galatz on the Czarina Catherine.</t8631> <t8632>He was to deliver the said box to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who traded with the Slovaks who trade downstream, to the port.</t8632> <t8633>He had received payment for his work in the form of an English banknote, which had been conveniently exchanged for gold at the International Bank of the Danube.</t8633> <t8634>When Skinsky presented himself to him, he had delivered the box to him, after taking him to the ship, to avoid the costs of unloading and transport.</t8634> <t8635>That was all he knew.</t8635>
<t8636>Then, we looked for Skinsky, but we couldn't find him.</t8636>
<t8637>One of his neighbors, who did not seem to hold him in high regard, said that he had left two days ago and that no one knew where.</t8637> <t8638>This was corroborated by his landlord, who had received the house key through a special messenger, along with the rent he owed, in English money.</t8638> <t8639>This had happened between ten and eleven o'clock the previous night.</t8639> <t8640>We were once again at a dead end.</t8640>
<t8641>While we were talking, a man came running up and, almost out of breath, said that they had found Skinsky's body inside the San Pedro cemetery and that his throat was torn apart, as if he had been killed by some wild animal.</t8641> <t8642>The men and women we had been talking to ran out to see it, while the women screamed:</t8642>
<t8643>–That's the work of a Slovak!</t8643>
<t8644>We hurriedly moved away from there, so as not to get involved in the matter and be questioned.</t8644>
<t8645>When we arrived at the house, we couldn't come to any definite solution.</t8645>
<t8646>We were convinced that the box was being carried by the water to some place, but we would have to find out where.</t8646> <t8647>With great sadness, we returned to the hotel to meet with Mina.</t8647>
<t8648>When we all gathered, the first thing we discussed was whether we should once again place our trust in Mina, revealing all the secrets of our meetings to her.</t8648> <t8649>The situation is quite critical, and that is at least an opportunity, albeit a somewhat risky one.</t8649> <t8650>As a preliminary step, I was released from the promise I had made to her.</t8650>

<t8652>October 30, at night.</t8652> <t8653>They were all so tired, discouraged, and sad that it was impossible to do anything without them resting first; therefore, I asked everyone to lie down for half an hour while I wrote everything down, updating the diaries to the current moment.</t8653> <t8654>I feel very grateful to the inventor of the portable typewriter and to Mr. Morris, who got this one for me.</t8654> <t8655>The work would have been a bit tedious if I had had to write everything with a pen...</t8655>
<t8656>Everything is done; poor and dear Jonathan, how much he has suffered and how much he must still be suffering!</t8656> <t8657>He is lying on the divan and it is barely noticeable that he is breathing; his entire body seems to be a victim of a collapse.</t8657> <t8658>He has a furrowed brow and his face clearly reflects his suffering.</t8658> <t8659>Poor man, perhaps he is thinking and I can see his wrinkled face, due to his reflections.</t8659> <t8660>If only I could be of some use to them…!</t8660> <t8661>I will do everything possible.</t8661>
<t8662>I have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has given me all the papers that I have not seen yet...</t8662> <t8663>While they rest, I will carefully examine all the documents, and it is possible that I may come to some conclusion.</t8663> <t8664>I must try to follow the professor's example and think without prejudice about the facts that are before me...</t8664>
<t8665>I believe that, thanks to Divine Providence, I have made a discovery.</t8665> <t8666>I need to get a map to verify it...</t8666>
<t8667>I am more certain than ever that I am right.</t8667> <t8668>My new conclusion is ready, so I need to gather all our friends to read it to them.</t8668> <t8669>They will be able to judge it.</t8669> <t8670>It is good to be precise, and every minute counts.</t8670>
<t8671>Memorandum from Mina Harker (Included in her diary)</t8671>
<t8672>Survey base.</t8672> <t8673>The problem of Count Dracula is to return to his home.</t8673>
<t8674>a)</t8674> <t8675>He must be taken there by someone.</t8675> <t8676>This is evident, since if he had the power to move as he wished, he would do so in the form of a man, a wolf, a bat, or any other animal.</t8676> <t8677>Evidently, he fears being discovered or hindered, in the state of helplessness in which he must find himself..., confined as he is, between dawn and sunset, in his wooden box.</t8677>
<t8678>b) How can it be transported?</t8678> <t8679>In this case, the process of reasoning by elimination can be useful to us.</t8679> <t8680>By train, by road, by water?</t8680>
<t8681>1.</t8681> <t8682>By road.</t8682> <t8683>There are too many difficulties, especially when leaving the city.</t8683>
<t8684>x)</t8684> <t8685>There are people; people are curious and investigate.</t8685> <t8686>An idea, a doubt, or a supposition about what is in the box can mean its destruction.</t8686>
<t8687>y) There are, or there may be, customs or checkpoints that one must pass through.</t8687>
<t8688>z)</t8688> <t8689>His pursuers can follow him.</t8689> <t8690>That is his greatest fear, and in order not to be betrayed, he has repelled, as far as he can, even his victim... Me!</t8690>
<t8691>2.</t8691> <t8692>By train.</t8692> <t8693>There is no one to take care of the cash register.</t8693> <t8694>He would have to risk being delayed, and a delay would be fatal for him, since his enemies are pursuing him.</t8694> <t8695>It's true that he could flee at night, but what would become of him if he found himself in a strange place, unable to go to any refuge?</t8695> <t8696>That's not what he wants, and he is not willing to risk that.</t8696>
<t8697>3.</t8697> <t8698>By water.</t8698> <t8699>This is the safest way in a certain sense, but the one that holds the greatest danger in other aspects.</t8699> <t8700>On the water, he lacks power, except at night; even then, he can only summon fog, storm, snow, and his wolves.</t8700> <t8701>But in case of an accident, the living waters would engulf him and he would be truly lost.</t8701> <t8702>He could make his boat reach the shore, but if he found himself in enemy lands, where he would not be free to move, his situation would still be desperate.</t8702>
<t8703>We know from what has happened so far that it was in the water; therefore, we still need to find out in which waters.</t8703>
<t8704>The first thing is to understand what has been done so far; then we will have an idea about what their task should be.</t8704>
<t8705>First of all.</t8705> <t8706>We must differentiate between what he did in London, as part of his general plan, when he was sometimes in a hurry and had to manage as best as he could.</t8706>
<t8707>Secondly, we must do our best to judge by the facts we know, what has been done here.</t8707>
<t8708>Regarding the first point, he evidently planned to reach Galatz, and sent the box to Varna to deceive us, in case we discovered his means of fleeing England; thus, his immediate and sole purpose was to escape.</t8708> <t8709>To prove all this, we have the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel Hildesheim, stating that he should collect the box and disembark it before sunrise.</t8709> <t8710>Likewise, the instructions to Petrof Skinsky.</t8710> <t8711>In this case, we can only guess, but there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky went to see Hildesheim.</t8711>
<t8712>Thus, so far, we know that their plans have been successful.</t8712> <t8713>The Czarina Catherine made an extraordinarily fast trip...</t8713> <t8714>To such an extent that Captain Donelson's suspicions were aroused, but his superstition, combined with his inertia, served the count, and he sailed with favorable wind through the fog and everything else, arriving blindly at Galatz.</t8714> <t8715>It has been proven that the count's arrangements have been well made.</t8715> <t8716>Hildesheim received the box, took it off the ship, and handed it over to Skinsky.</t8716> <t8717>He took it... and this is where the trail is lost.</t8717> <t8718>We only know that the box is somewhere, on the water, moving.</t8718> <t8719>The customs and excise office, if it exists, have been avoided.</t8719>
<t8720>Now we come to what the count must have done after his arrival on land, in Galatz.</t8720>
<t8721>The box was delivered to Skinsky before sunrise.</t8721> <t8722>At sunrise, the count could appear in his true form.</t8722> <t8723>Here we ask: why was Skinsky chosen to carry out this task?</t8723> <t8724>In my husband's diary, the said Skinsky is indicated as an individual who trafficked with the Slovaks who traded by the river, up to the port; and the cry of the women, that the crime had been committed by Slovaks, showed the general sentiment against those of his kind.</t8724> <t8725>The count desired isolation.</t8725>
<t8726>I suppose that, in London, the count decided to return to his castle by water, since this was the safest and most secret way.</t8726> <t8727>He was taken from the castle by the gypsies, and they probably handed over their cargo to Slovaks, who took it to Varna, where it was shipped to London.</t8727> <t8728>Thus, the count knew the people who could perform this service.</t8728> <t8729>When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out of his box, met with Skinsky, and gave him instructions on what he had to do regarding finding someone who could transport the box by river.</t8729> <t8730>When Skinsky did so, and the count knew that everything was in order, he set about erasing the tracks by killing his agent.</t8730>
<t8731>I have examined the maps and discovered that the most suitable river for the Slovaks to have ascended is the Pruth or the Sereth.</t8731> <t8732>I have read in the manuscript that in my moments of trance I heard cows in the distance and the sound of water at the level of my ears, as well as the sound of wood rubbing against wood.</t8732> <t8733>So, that means that the count, in his box, traveled on the river, in an open boat... probably propelled by means of oars or floats, since the banks are close and it sails against the current.</t8733> <t8734>Those noises would not occur if it were moving with the current.</t8734>
<t8735>Naturally, it must be either the Sereth or the Pruth; but, at this point, we can investigate further.</t8735> <t8736>The Pruth is the easiest for navigation, but the Sereth, in Fundu, receives the Bistritza, which runs around the Borgo Pass.</t8736> <t8737>The curve it describes is manifestly as close to Dracula's castle as one can get by water.</t8737>
<t8738>From the Diary of Mina Harke (continued)</t8738>
<t8739>When I finished reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and hugged me; the others took me by both hands, shook me, and Dr. Van Helsing said:</t8739>
<t8740>–Our dear lady Mina is, once again, our teacher.</t8740> <t8741>Her eyes have settled where we had seen nothing.</t8741> <t8742>Now, we are back on track and, this time, we can triumph.</t8742> <t8743>Our enemy is at his weakest point and, if we can reach him during the day, over the water, our task will be concluded.</t8743> <t8744>He has some advantage, but he cannot hurry, as he cannot leave his box in order not to arouse suspicion among those who transport him; if they suspected anything, their first reaction would be to immediately throw him overboard, and he would perish in the water.</t8744> <t8745>Naturally, he knows that and cannot expose himself.</t8745> <t8746>Now, friends, let us hold our war council, since it is necessary that we plan right here, at this very moment, what each of us must do.</t8746>
<t8747>–I will get a steam launch to follow him -said Lord Godalming.</t8747>
<t8748>–And I have horses to pursue him by land, in case he disembarks by chance -said Morris.</t8748>
<t8749>–Good! – said the professor-.</t8749> <t8750>Both of you are right, but neither should go alone.</t8750>
<t8751>We must have the strength to overcome other forces, if necessary; the Slovaks are strong and tough, and they are well-armed.</t8751>
<t8752>All the men smiled, as they carried a small arsenal on them.</t8752>
<t8753>–I have brought several Winchesters -said Mr. Morris-.</t8753> <t8754>They can be used very well in the middle of a crowd and, besides, there are wolves. The Count, if you remember, took other precautions; he gave certain instructions that Mrs. Harker could neither hear nor understand.</t8754> <t8755>We must be prepared for anything.</t8755>
<t8756>–I think it would be best if I go with Quincey -said Dr. Seward-.</t8756> <t8757>We are used to hunting together, and both of us, well-armed, can be formidable foes for anyone who stands in our way.</t8757> <t8758>You shouldn't go alone either, Art.</t8758> <t8759>It might be necessary to fight against the Slovaks, and a stroke of luck, since I don't think they carry firearms, could ruin all our plans.</t8759> <t8760>We mustn't take risks this time; we won't rest until the count's head and body have been separated and we are sure that he won't be able to reincarnate.</t8760>
<t8761>He looked at Jonathan while he spoke, and my husband looked at me.</t8761> <t8762>I understood that the poor man was desperate.</t8762> <t8763>Naturally, he wanted to be with me; but, in any case, the group that would leave in the boat would be the one most likely to destroy the..., the... vampire (why do I hesitate to write the word?).</t8763> <t8764>He remained silent for a moment and Dr. Van Helsing intervened, saying:</t8764>
<t8765>–Friend Jonathan, that is your responsibility for two reasons: firstly, because you are young, brave, and can fight.</t8765> <t8766>All forces may be necessary at the final moment; moreover, you have the right to destroy him, since he has caused so much suffering to you and yours.</t8766> <t8767>Do not worry about Mrs. Mina; I will take care of her, if I can.</t8767> <t8768>I am old and my legs no longer allow me to run as before; besides, I am not accustomed to riding such a long distance to chase the count, as may be necessary, nor to fighting with deadly weapons.</t8768> <t8769>And I can die, if necessary, as well as younger men.</t8769> <t8770>Let me tell you what I desire: while you, Lord Godalming, and our friend Jonathan, advance so quickly in your beautiful steam launch, and while John and Quincey guard the shore, where Dracula may have disembarked by chance, I will take Mrs. Mina directly to the enemy's territory.</t8770> <t8771>While the old fox is locked in his box, floating in the middle of the river current, where he cannot escape to land, and where he cannot afford to lift the cover of his box, because those transporting him would throw him into the water and let him perish in it, we must follow the trail taken by Jonathan.</t8771> <t8772>From Bistritz, over the Borgo, and we must find the way to Count Dracula's castle.</t8772> <t8773>There, Mrs. Mina's hypnotic power can surely help us, and we will set out on the path, which is dark and unknown, after the first dawn immediately following our arrival in the vicinity of that grim place.</t8773> <t8774>There is much to do, and other places to sanctify, so that this nest of vipers is destroyed.</t8774>
<t8775>At that moment, Jonathan interrupted him, saying passionately:</t8775>
<t8776>"Do you mean to say, professor, that you are going to lead Mina, in her sad state and stigmatized as she is with that diabolical disease, to the wolf's den so that she falls into a deadly trap?"</t8776> <t8777>"By no means!"</t8777> <t8778>"Not for anything in the world!"</t8778>
<t8779>For a minute, he lost his voice and then continued:</t8779>
<t8780>–Do you know what that place is like?</t8780> <t8781>Have you seen that terrible den of infernal infamies... where the very light of the moon is alive and takes on all kinds of forms, and where every particle of dust is an embryo of a monster?</t8781> <t8782>Have you felt the lips of the vampire on your neck?</t8782>
<t8783>He turned towards me, fixed his eyes on my forehead, and raised his arms, shouting:</t8783>
<t8784>–My God! What have we done for you to send this horror upon us? – and he collapsed onto the divan, feeling shattered.</t8784>
<t8785>The professor's voice, with its sweet and clear tone, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed us all.</t8785>
<t8786>–My friend, it is because I want to save Mrs. Mina from that horror that I want to take her there.</t8786> <t8787>God forbid that I bring her into that place.</t8787> <t8788>There is certain work; a terrible work that must be done there, and her eyes must not see it.</t8788> <t8789>All the men present, except Jonathan, have seen what we will have to do before that place is purified.</t8789> <t8790>Remember that we are in the midst of a terrible danger.</t8790> <t8791>If the count escapes us this time, and we must consider that he is strong, intelligent, and skillful, he may wish to sleep for a century, and in due time, our dear lady - he took my hand - will go to his side to accompany him, and she will be like the others you saw, Jonathan.</t8791> <t8792>You have described to us everything about their gluttonous lips and horrible laughs when they took the moving sack that the count had thrown to them.</t8792> <t8793>You shudder, but it is something that can happen.</t8793> <t8794>Forgive me for causing you so much pain, but it is necessary.</t8794> <t8795>My friend, is this not an undertaking in which I will probably have to lose my life?</t8795> <t8796>In the event that any of us must go to that place to stay, it will have to be me, to keep them company.</t8796>
<t8797>"Do as you please," said Jonathan, with a sob that made his whole body tremble.</t8797> <t8798>We are in the hands of God!</t8798>
<t8799>Later.</t8799> <t8800>It did me a lot of good to see the way those brave men work.</t8800> <t8801>How is it possible that women do not love men who are so sincere, frank, and brave?</t8801> <t8802>Likewise, I thought about the extraordinary power of money.</t8802> <t8803>What can't it do when applied correctly? What can't it achieve when used in a low manner?</t8803> <t8804>I am very happy that Lord Godalming is so rich and that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has a lot of money, are willing to spend it so liberally.</t8804> <t8805>Because, if it were not so, our expedition would not have been able to set off, neither so quickly nor with such good equipment, as it will do within another hour.</t8805> <t8806>Not even three hours have passed since it was decided what role each of us would play, and now, Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a beautiful steam launch, and are ready to depart at any moment.</t8806>
<t8807>Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a dozen excellent horses, all prepared.</t8807> <t8808>We possess all the maps and enlargements of all kinds that it is possible to obtain.</t8808> <t8809>Professor Van Helsing and I must leave tonight, at eleven forty, by train, bound for Veresti, where we will get a carriage to take us to the Borgo Pass.</t8809> <t8810>We carry a good amount of money with us, as we will have to buy the carriage and the horses.</t8810> <t8811>We must drive it ourselves, as there is no one we can trust in this case.</t8811> <t8812>The professor knows many languages, so we will be able to get by without too much difficulty.</t8812> <t8813>We all have weapons, and they even got me a long-barreled revolver; Jonathan did not feel at ease unless I was armed like the rest of them.</t8813> <t8814>But I cannot carry a weapon that the others carry; the stigma on my forehead forbids it.</t8814> <t8815>Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me, telling me that I am well-armed, as it is possible we may encounter wolves.</t8815> <t8816>The weather is getting colder with each passing hour, and there are snowflakes floating in the air, like bad omens.</t8816>
<t8817>Later.</t8817> <t8818>I gathered the courage to say goodbye to my dear husband.</t8818> <t8819>It is possible that we may never see each other again.</t8819> <t8820>Courage, Mina!</t8820> <t8821>The professor is staring at you intently, and that look is a warning.</t8821> <t8822>You must not shed tears now… unless God allows them to be of joy.</t8822>
<t8823>From the journal of Jonathan Harker</t8823>
<t8824>October 30, at night.</t8824> <t8825>I am writing this by the light given off by the boiler of the steam launch; Lord Godalming is acting as stoker.</t8825> <t8826>He has experience in the work, as he had his own boat on the Thames and another on the Norfolk Broads for many years.</t8826> <t8827>Regarding our plans, we have finally decided that Mina's assumptions were relevant and that if the Count had chosen a waterway to return to his castle, it must necessarily be the Sereth and Bistritza rivers.</t8827> <t8828>We assumed that somewhere near the forty-seventh degree of north latitude would be the chosen place to cross the country between the river and the Carpathians.</t8828> <t8829>We were not afraid to move at a good speed on the river, in the middle of the night; the water is deep and the banks are far enough apart from us so that we can navigate calmly and without difficulties, even in the dark.</t8829> <t8830>Lord Godalming tells me to sleep for a while; that it is enough for the moment that one of us stays on guard.</t8830> <t8831>But I cannot sleep… How could I, with the terrible danger hanging over my dear wife and thinking that she is heading towards that accursed place…?</t8831> <t8832>My only consolation is that we are in God's hands.</t8832> <t8833>The bad thing is that, with that faith, it would be easier to die than to continue living, to put an end to all these worries once and for all.</t8833> <t8834>Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward set out to make their enormous journey on horseback before we set off; they must stay on the riverbank, at a considerable distance, on the highlands, so that they can see a good stretch of the river without needing to follow its meanders.</t8834> <t8835>For the first stages, they have two men with them, to lead their spare horses…</t8835> <t8836>Four in total, in order not to arouse curiosity.</t8836> <t8837>When they dismiss the men, which will happen quite soon, they will have to take care of the horses themselves.</t8837> <t8838>It is possible that we will need to join forces, and in that case, we can all ride the horses…</t8838> <t8839>One of the saddles has a movable pommel, which can be adapted for Mina, if necessary.</t8839>
<t8840>We have embarked on a terrible adventure.</t8840> <t8841>Here, as we move forward in the midst of darkness, feeling the coldness of the river that seems to rise to strike us, surrounded by all the mysterious voices of the night, we see everything clearly.</t8841> <t8842>We seem to be heading towards unknown places, by unknown routes, and entering a new world of dark and terrible objects.</t8842> <t8843>Godalming is closing the boiler door…</t8843>
<t8844>October 31.</t8844> <t8845>We continue advancing at good speed.</t8845> <t8846>The day has arrived and Godalming is sleeping.</t8846> <t8847>I am on guard.</t8847> <t8848>The morning is very cold and the warmth from the boiler is very pleasant, despite us wearing thick fur jackets.</t8848> <t8849>So far, we have only passed a few open boats, but none of them had any kind of equipment box on board, approximately the size we are looking for.</t8849> <t8850>The men always got scared whenever we turned our electric lamp towards them, they knelt and prayed.</t8850>
<t8851>November 1st, at night.</t8851> <t8852>We haven't had any news all day nor have we found anything of the type we're looking for.</t8852> <t8853>We have already passed Bistritza, and if we are wrong in our assumptions, we will have missed the opportunity.</t8853> <t8854>We have observed all the boats, large and small.</t8854> <t8855>This morning, early, the crew of one of them thought we were a government vessel, and treated us very well.</t8855> <t8856>We saw in this, in a way, an improvement in our situation; thus, in Fundu, where the Bistritza converges into the Sereth.</t8856> <t8857>We obtained a Romanian flag which we now carry on the bow.</t8857> <t8858>This trick has been successful with all the boats we have encountered since; everyone has shown us great deference and no one has objected to anything we wanted to inspect or ask about.</t8858> <t8859>In Fundu we did not get any news about any similar boat, so it must have passed through there at night.</t8859> <t8860>I feel very sleepy; the cold is perhaps affecting me, and nature needs to rest from time to time.</t8860> <t8861>Godalming insists that he will take the first watch.</t8861> <t8862>God bless him for all his kindness to Mina and me.</t8862>
<t8863>November 2, in the morning.</t8863> <t8864>The day is very clear.</t8864> <t8865>My good friend did not want to wake me up.</t8865> <t8866>He said he would have considered it a sin, as I was sleeping peacefully and, for the moment, forgetting my sorrows.</t8866> <t8867>It seemed somewhat inconsiderate to have slept so long and left him watching over me all night, but he was right.</t8867> <t8868>I am a new man this morning and, while I sit watching him sleep, I can take care of the engine, the helm, and the watch.</t8868> <t8869>I feel my strength and energy returning to me.</t8869> <t8870>I wonder where Mina and Van Helsing are now.</t8870> <t8871>They should have arrived in Veresti around noon on Wednesday.</t8871> <t8872>They would need some time to get the carriage and horses, so if they had set off quickly, they would already be near the Borgo Pass.</t8872> <t8873>May God help and protect them!</t8873> <t8874>I fear to think of what might happen.</t8874> <t8875>If only we could move faster!</t8875> <t8876>But it is not possible.</t8876> <t8877>The engines are working at full capacity, and it is not possible to ask more of them.</t8877> <t8878>I also wonder how Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward are doing.</t8878> <t8879>There seem to be endless torrents coming down from the mountains to the river, but since none of them are too wide... at least at this moment, although they are undoubtedly terrible in winter and when the snow melts, the riders will not find great difficulties in crossing them.</t8879> <t8880>I hope to see them before reaching Strasba, because if we have not caught the count by then, it may be necessary for us to meet to decide what to do next.</t8880>
<t8881>From the journal of Dr. Seward</t8881>
<t8882>November 2nd.</t8882> <t8883>We have been galloping for three days.</t8883> <t8884>There is nothing new and, in any case, I wouldn't have had time to write anything, even if there had been something.</t8884>
<t8885>We only take the necessary breaks for the horses, but we are both enduring it very well.</t8885> <t8886>The days when we had so many adventures are proving to be very useful.</t8886> <t8887>We must keep going; we will never feel content until we see the boat again.</t8887>
<t8888>November 3rd.</t8888> <t8889>In Fundu, we learned that the boat had gone by the Bistritza.</t8889> <t8890>I wished it wasn't so cold.</t8890> <t8891>There were signs that it would snow, and if the snow fell heavily, it would stop us.</t8891> <t8892>In that case, we will have to get a sled to continue, Russian style.</t8892>
<t8893>November 4th.</t8893> <t8894>Today we learned that the boat was stopped by an accident while trying to ascend the rapids.</t8894> <t8895>The Slovak boats ascend well, with the help of a rope and proper steering.</t8895> <t8896>Some of them ascended just a few hours earlier.</t8896> <t8897>Godalming was an amateur adjuster and, evidently, it was he who got the boat running again.</t8897> <t8898>Finally, they managed to cross the rapids with the help of the locals and have just set off, rested.</t8898> <t8899>I fear the boat did not improve much from the accident; the villagers informed us that after it returned to calm waters, it continued to stop from time to time while it remained in sight.</t8899> <t8900>We must advance with more vigor than ever; it is possible they will soon need our help.</t8900>
<t8901>From the diary of Mina Harker</t8901>
<t8902>October 31.</t8902> <t8903>We arrived in Veresti in the afternoon.</t8903> <t8904>The professor tells me that this morning, at dawn, he could barely hypnotize me, and all I could say was: "dark and quiet".</t8904> <t8905>He is now out, buying a carriage and horses; he says that later he will try to buy more horses, so that we can change them along the way.</t8905> <t8906>We still have one hundred and ten kilometers to go.</t8906> <t8907>The landscape is beautiful and very interesting; if we were in different circumstances, how delightful it would be to contemplate all this!</t8907> <t8908>If Jonathan and I were traveling alone through these lands, what a pleasure it would be!</t8908> <t8909>We could stop, see the people, learn something about them, and fill our minds with all the picturesque and colorful aspects of the wild and beautiful countryside and the unique people.</t8909> <t8910>But, alas…!</t8910>
<t8911>Later.</t8911> <t8912>Dr. Van Helsing has returned.</t8912> <t8913>He got the carriage and the horses; we are going to have dinner, and we will set off within an hour.</t8913> <t8914>The landlady is preparing a huge basket of provisions for us; it seems to be enough for an entire company of soldiers.</t8914> <t8915>The professor encourages her and whispers to me that it might be a week before we can get more food.</t8915> <t8916>He has also been shopping, and has sent a wonderful set of coats and furs and all kinds of warm clothing to his house.</t8916> <t8917>We will have no danger of feeling cold.</t8917>
<t8918>Soon we will set out.</t8918> <t8919>I dread to think of what may happen to us; truly, we are in God's hands; only He knows what may happen and I pray to Him, with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, to take care of my beloved husband; that, whatever happens, Jonathan may know that I love him and that I have honored him more than I can express, and that my last and most sincere affectionate thought will always be for him.</t8919>
<t8920>XXVII.–</t8920> <t8921>MINA HARKER'S DIARY</t8921>
<t8922>November 1st.</t8922> <t8923>We have traveled all day at a good speed.</t8923> <t8924>The horses seem to know that we are treating them kindly, as they show a willingness to move at the best pace.</t8924> <t8925>We have had some changes and found the same thing so consistently that we feel encouraged to think the journey will be easy.</t8925> <t8926>Dr. Van Helsing is laconic; he tells the farmers that he is in a hurry to get to Bistritz and pays them well for changing horses.</t8926> <t8927>They give us hot soup, coffee, or tea, and we leave immediately.</t8927> <t8928>It is a charming landscape, full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, strong, and simple; they seem to have many beautiful qualities.</t8928> <t8929>They are very, very superstitious.</t8929> <t8930>At the first house we stopped at, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and held two fingers in front of me to ward off the evil eye.</t8930> <t8931>I think they even went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic in our food, and I can't stand it.</t8931> <t8932>Since then, I have been careful not to remove my veil, and in this way, I have managed to escape their suspicions.</t8932> <t8933>We are traveling at great speed, and since we have no coachman who can gossip, we continue on our way without any scandal; but I dare say that the fear of the evil eye will follow us constantly everywhere.</t8933> <t8934>The professor seems tireless; he did not want to rest all day, even though he made me sleep for a while.</t8934> <t8935>At dusk, he hypnotized me, and he says I answered as always: "Darkness, sound of water, and rustling of wood."</t8935> <t8936>So our enemy continues on the river.</t8936> <t8937>I am afraid to think about Jonathan, but somehow I no longer feel fear for him or for myself.</t8937> <t8938>I write this while we wait at a farm for the horses to be prepared.</t8938> <t8939>Dr. Van Helsing is sleeping.</t8939> <t8940>Poor man!</t8940> <t8941>He seems very tired and has aged and turned gray.</t8941> <t8942>But his mouth has the firmness of a conqueror.</t8942> <t8943>Even in dreams, he has the instinct of resolution.</t8943> <t8944>When we have set off, I must make him rest while I drive the carriage myself; I will tell him that we still have several days ahead, and that he must not weaken when all his strength is needed...</t8944> <t8945>Everything is ready.</t8945> <t8946>We will leave shortly.</t8946>
<t8947>November 2nd, in the morning.</t8947> <t8948>I was successful and we took turns driving throughout the night; now it is already daytime and the weather is clear despite being cold.</t8948>
<t8949>There is a strange heaviness in the air...; I say heaviness because I can't find a better word; I mean it oppresses us both.</t8949> <t8950>It is very cold and only our warm skins allow us to feel comfortable.</t8950> <t8951>At dawn, Van Helsing hypnotized me, he says I answered: "Darkness, the rubbing of wood, and roaring water," so the river is changing as they ascend.</t8951> <t8952>My great desire is that my beloved is not in any danger; no more than necessary, but we are in God's hands.</t8952>
<t8953>November 2, at night.</t8953> <t8954>We have been traveling all day.</t8954> <t8955>The countryside becomes wilder as we advance, and the great elevations of the Carpathians, which in Veresti seemed so distant and low on the horizon, now appear to surround us and rise before us.</t8955> <t8956>We both seem to be in good spirits; I think we strive to cheer each other up and thus find comfort.</t8956> <t8957>Dr. Van Helsing says that in the morning we will reach the Borgo Pass.</t8957> <t8958>The houses are now very scarce, and the professor says that the last horse we obtained will have to continue with us, as it is very likely that we will not be able to change it again.</t8958> <t8959>We have two, in addition to the other two we exchanged, so now we have a good team.</t8959>
<t8960>The horses are patient and good and do not cause us any problems.</t8960> <t8961>We do not worry about other travelers, so even I can drive.</t8961> <t8962>We will reach the pass by day; we do not want to arrive earlier, so we go calmly and both take a long rest, taking turns.</t8962> <t8963>What will tomorrow bring us?</t8963> <t8964>We are heading to the place where my poor husband suffered so much.</t8964> <t8965>May God allow us to reach there safely and may He deign to take care of my husband and those dear to us, who are in such mortal danger.</t8965> <t8966>As for me, I am not worthy of Him. Alas! I am not clean in His eyes, and so I will remain until He deigns to allow me to be in His presence, like one of those who have not provoked His wrath!</t8966>
<t8967>Memorandum of Abraham van Helsing</t8967>
<t8968>November 4th.</t8968> <t8969>This is for my old and sincere friend, Doctor John Seward, of Purefleet, London, in case I cannot see him again.</t8969> <t8970>It may clarify.</t8970> <t8971>It is morning, and I write by the fire that has kept us alive throughout the night.</t8971>
<t8972>Mrs. Mina has helped me.</t8972> <t8973>It's cold; very cold.</t8973> <t8974>So much so that the gray and heavy sky is full of snow which, when it falls, will remain throughout the winter, as the ground is hardening to receive it.</t8974> <t8975>It seems to have affected Mrs. Mina.</t8975> <t8976>Her head has been so heavy all day that she doesn't seem to be the same.</t8976> <t8977>She sleeps, sleeps, and keeps on sleeping!</t8977> <t8978>She, who is always so lively, has done almost absolutely nothing all day; she has even lost her appetite.</t8978> <t8979>She didn't make any entries in her journal, she who had so faithfully written at each of our stops.</t8979> <t8980>Something tells me that not everything is going well.</t8980> <t8981>However, tonight she is more lively.</t8981> <t8982>Her long sleep during the day has refreshed and restored her, and now she is as sweet and awake as ever.</t8982> <t8983>I tried to hypnotize her at dawn, but without any positive result.</t8983> <t8984>The power has been continuously diminishing, day by day, and tonight it failed me completely.</t8984> <t8985>Well, let God's will be done…!</t8985> <t8986>Whatever it may be and wherever it may lead us!</t8986> <t8987>Now, let's move on to the historical; since Mrs. Mina didn't write in her journal, I must, in my laborious old language, do it, so that no day we spent goes unrecorded.</t8987>
<t8988>We arrived at the Borgo Pass a little before dawn, yesterday morning; when I observed the signs heralding the dawn, I prepared to hypnotize her.</t8988> <t8989>We stopped the carriage and got out, so that nothing would disturb us.</t8989> <t8990>I made a sort of couch with furs, and Mrs. Mina, after lying down, submitted to the hypnosis, as always, but more slowly and briefly than ever.</t8990> <t8991>As before, her response was: "Darkness and troubled waters."</t8991> <t8992>Then she awoke, lively and radiant, and we continued our journey, to soon reach the Pass.</t8992> <t8993>At this hour and place, she was filled with a new enthusiasm; a new guiding power manifested in her, as she pointed out a path and said:</t8993>
<t8994>–This is the way.</t8994>
<t8995>–How do you know? – I inquired.</t8995>
<t8996>–Of course I know -she replied, and after a pause she added-: Didn't my Jonathan travel because of him and write everything about his journey?</t8996>
<t8997>At first, I thought it was something strange, but soon I saw that there could only be such a path.</t8997> <t8998>It is very little used, and extremely different from the main road that leads from Bucovina to Bistritz, which is wider, harder, and more frequently used.</t8998>
<t8999>So we took that path.</t8999> <t9000>We found other paths (we were not always sure they were real paths, as they were neglected and covered with a light layer of snow).</t9000> <t9001>The horses knew, and only they did.</t9001> <t9002>I left the reins loose, and the animals continued patiently.</t9002> <t9003>One after another, we found all the things that Jonathan noted in the wonderful diary he wrote.</t9003>
<t9004>Then, we continued for long and extended hours.</t9004> <t9005>At first, I told Mrs. Mina to sleep; she tried and managed to do so.</t9005> <t9006>She slept the whole time until, finally, I felt my suspicions growing and tried to wake her, but she kept sleeping and I couldn't wake her despite my attempts.</t9006> <t9007>I didn't want to do it too forcefully for fear of harming her, as I know she has suffered a lot and that sleep, at times, can be very beneficial for her.</t9007> <t9008>I think I dozed off, because suddenly, I felt guilty, as if I had done something wrong.</t9008> <t9009>I found myself upright, with the reins in hand and the beautiful horses trotting as usual.</t9009> <t9010>I looked down and saw that Mrs. Mina was still asleep.</t9010> <t9011>It's not long until sunset and, over the snow, the sunlight glistens like a huge yellow stream, so that we cast a long shadow where the mountain rises vertically.</t9011> <t9012>We are climbing and climbing continuously and everything is, oh, very rugged and rocky.</t9012> <t9013>As if it were the end of the world.</t9013>
<t9014>Then, I woke up Mrs. Mina.</t9014> <t9015>This time she woke up without much difficulty and, then, I tried to make her sleep hypnotically, but I couldn't; it was as if I wasn't there.</t9015> <t9016>However, I keep trying repeatedly, until suddenly, we find ourselves in the dark, so I look around and discover that the sun has gone.</t9016> <t9017>Mrs. Mina laughs and I turn towards her.</t9017> <t9018>Now she is wide awake and looks as good as I have ever seen her since that night in Carfax, when we first entered the Count's house.</t9018> <t9019>I feel astonished and uneasy, but she is so lively, tender, and solicitous with me, that I forget all fear.</t9019> <t9020>I light a fire, as we brought a supply of wood with us, and she prepares food while I untie the horses and settle them in the shade to feed them.</t9020> <t9021>Then, when I returned to the campfire, she had my dinner ready.</t9021> <t9022>I went to help her, but she smiled at me and said she had already eaten, that she was so hungry she couldn't wait.</t9022> <t9023>I didn't like that, and I have terrible doubts, but I fear scaring her and don't mention anything about it.</t9023> <t9024>Mrs. Mina helped me, I ate, and then, we wrapped ourselves in the furs and lay down beside the fire.</t9024> <t9025>I told her to sleep and that I would keep watch, but suddenly I forget to keep watch and, when I suddenly remember that I must do so, I find her lying still; but awake, looking at me with very bright eyes.</t9025> <t9026>This happened once or twice and I was able to sleep until morning.</t9026> <t9027>When I woke up, I tried to hypnotize her, but, although she obediently closed her eyes, she couldn't fall asleep.</t9027> <t9028>The sun rose higher and higher and, then, sleep came to her, too late; it was so strong, that she did not wake up.</t9028>
<t9029>I had to lift her and place her, asleep, in the carriage, once I had harnessed the horses and prepared everything.</t9029> <t9030>The lady continues to sleep, and her face looks healthier and rosier than before, and I don't like that.</t9030> <t9031>I'm scared, very scared!</t9031>
<t9032>I am afraid of all things.</t9032> <t9033>Even of thinking; but I must continue my path.</t9033> <t9034>What we are risking is something of life or death, or even more than that, and we must not hesitate for a moment.</t9034>
<t9035>November 5, in the morning.</t9035> <t9036>Allow me to be precise in everything, since, although you and I have seen strange things together, you may begin to think that I, Van Helsing, am crazy; that the many horrors and the prolonged tensions on my nervous system have finally managed to derange my brain.</t9036> <t9037>We traveled all day yesterday, getting closer and closer to the mountains and traversing increasingly rugged and deserted terrain.</t9037> <t9038>There are gigantic and threatening cliffs, many waterfalls, and nature seems to have once held its carnival here.</t9038> <t9039>Mrs. Mina continues to sleep constantly, and although I felt hungry and satisfied it, I could not wake her, not even to eat.</t9039> <t9040>I began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was taking hold of her, as she is stained with that baptism of the vampire's blood.</t9040>
<t9041>–Well -I said to myself-, if he sleeps all day, it is also certain that I will not sleep during the night.</t9041>
<t9042>While we were traveling along the rough road, since it was an old and deteriorated road, I fell asleep.</t9042> <t9043>I woke up again with a feeling of guilt and the passage of time, and discovered that Mrs. Mina was still asleep and that the sun was very low, but indeed, everything had changed.</t9043> <t9044>The threatening mountains seemed farther away and we were near the top of a very steep hill, and at its summit was the castle, just as Jonathan indicated in his diary.</t9044> <t9045>Immediately I felt uneasy and fearful, because now, for better or worse, the end was near.</t9045> <t9046>I woke Mrs. Mina and tried to hypnotize her again, but to no avail.</t9046> <t9047>Then, deep darkness descended upon us, because even after sunset, the skies reflected the hidden sun over the snow and everything was plunged, for some time, into a gigantic twilight.</t9047> <t9048>I unhitched the horses and fed them at the inn I managed to find.</t9048> <t9049>Then, I lit a fire and, near it, I made Mrs. Mina, who was now more awake and charming than ever, sit comfortably among her furs.</t9049> <t9050>I prepared dinner, but she did not want to eat.</t9050> <t9051>She simply said she was not hungry.</t9051> <t9052>I did not press her, knowing she did not wish to, but I had dinner, because I needed to stay strong for everyone.</t9052> <t9053>Then, still gripped by fear of what might happen, I drew a large circle around Mrs. Mina and placed part of the sacred Host on it, finely crumbling it, so that everything would be protected.</t9053> <t9054>She remained sitting quietly the whole time; as calm as if she were dead, and she began to grow paler and paler, until she was almost the same color as the snow; she did not utter a word, but when I approached her, she clung to me, and I noticed that the poor thing was trembling from head to toe, with a shiver that was painful to see.</t9054> <t9055>Then, when she calmed down a bit, I said to her:</t9055>
<t9056>–Don't you want to come closer to the fire?</t9056>
<t9057>He wanted to do a test to see if it was possible for him to do it.</t9057>
<t9058>She stood up obediently, but as soon as she took a step, she stopped and remained motionless, as if petrified.</t9058>
<t9059>–Why don't you continue? – I asked him.</t9059>
<t9060>She shook her head and, stepping back, sat down in her place again.</t9060>
<t9061>Then, looking at me with wide-open eyes, like those of a person who has just woken up from a dream, he said to me simply:</t9061>
<t9062>–I can't! – and he fell silent.</t9062>
<t9063>I was glad knowing that if she couldn't pass, none of the vampires, whom we feared, could do it either.</t9063> <t9064>Although there might be dangers to her body, at least her soul was safe!</t9064>
<t9065>At that moment, the horses began to get restless and pull at their reins, until I approached them and calmed them down.</t9065> <t9066>When they felt my hands on them, they neighed softly, as if in joy, rubbed their muzzles against my hands, and remained calm for a moment.</t9066> <t9067>Many times, throughout the night, I got up and approached them until the cold moment came when all of nature is at its lowest point of vitality, and, every time, my presence calmed them.</t9067> <t9068>As the coldest hour approached, the fire began to die out, and I got up to add more wood, because the snow was falling more heavily, and with it, a light and very cold mist was approaching.</t9068> <t9069>Even in the darkness, there is a certain kind of glow, as always happens over the snow, and it seemed that the snowflakes and the wisps of mist took the form of women, dressed in clothes that trailed on the ground.</t9069> <t9070>Everything seemed dead, and a deep silence reigned, interrupted only by the agitation of the horses, who seemed to fear the worst would happen.</t9070> <t9071>I began to feel a tremendous fear, but then a feeling of security came over me, due to the circle within which I found myself.</t9071> <t9072>I also began to think that it was all due to my imagination in the middle of the night, because of the glow, the restlessness, the fatigue, and the terrible anxiety.</t9072> <t9073>It was as if my memories of Jonathan's terrible experiences were deceiving me, because the snowflakes and the mist began to swirl around me until I could make out a blurry image of those women who had kissed him.</t9073> <t9074>Then, the horses crouched down more and more and lamented in terror, as men do in the midst of pain.</t9074> <t9075>Even the madness of fear was denied to them, so that they could move away.</t9075> <t9076>I felt fear for my dear lady Mina, when those strange figures approached and surrounded me.</t9076> <t9077>I looked at her, but she remained seated calmly, smiling at me; when I approached the fire to add more wood, she took one of my hands and held me back; then, she whispered, in a voice one hears in dreams, extremely low:</t9077>
<t9078>–No! No!</t9078> <t9079>Don't go out.</t9079> <t9080>You're safe here!</t9080>
<t9081>I turned towards her and said, looking into her eyes:</t9081>
<t9082>–But, what about you?</t9082> <t9083>It is for you that I fear!</t9083> <t9084>Upon hearing that, he burst out laughing... with a hoarse, unreal laugh, and said:</t9084>
<t9085>–Do you fear for me?</t9085> <t9086>Why do you fear for me?</t9086> <t9087>No one in the whole world is better protected against them than I am.</t9087>
<t9088>And while I wondered about the meaning of his words, a gust of wind made the flame rise, and I saw the red scar on his forehead.</t9088> <t9089>Then I understood.</t9089> <t9090>And if I hadn't understood then, I would have soon, thanks to the figures of mist and snow that swirled and approached, but kept away from the sacred circle.</t9090> <t9091>Then, they began to materialize, until, if God hadn't taken my sanity, because I saw it with my own eyes, the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when they kissed his throat, were before me, in flesh and blood.</t9091>
<t9092>I knew the spinning images, the bright and hard eyes, the white teeth, the rosy color, and the voluptuous lips.</t9092> <t9093>They continuously smiled at poor Mrs. Mina, and as their laughter echoed in the silence of the night, they waved their arms and pointed at her, speaking with the resonant and sweet voices that Jonathan had said were unbearably sweet, like crystalline.</t9093>
<t9094>–Come, sister! Come with us! Come! Come! – they said to her.</t9094>
<t9095>Filled with fear, I turned to my poor lady Mina and my heart rose like a flame, full of joy, because, oh!, the terror reflected in her sweet eyes and the repulsion and horror made my heart understand that there was still hope, thanks be to God that she was not yet one of them!</t9095> <t9096>I grabbed one of the logs from the campfire, which was near me, and, holding part of the Host, I advanced towards them.</t9096> <t9097>They moved away from me and laughed out loud, in a hoarse and horrible manner.</t9097> <t9098>I fed the fire and was not afraid of them, because I knew we were safe within our protective circle.</t9098> <t9099>They could not approach me, as long as I was armed in that way, nor could they approach lady Mina, as long as she remained within the circle, which she could not leave, and into which the others could not enter.</t9099> <t9100>The horses had stopped moaning and lay motionless on the ground.</t9100> <t9101>The snow fell gently on them, until they turned white.</t9101> <t9102>I knew that, for the poor animals, there was no greater terror.</t9102>
<t9103>We remained like that until the red color of dawn began to appear amidst the somber snow.</t9103> <t9104>I felt desolate and fearful, full of forebodings and terrors, but when the beautiful sun began to rise over the horizon, life returned to me.</t9104> <t9105>As the dawn appeared, the horrible figures melted away amidst the swirling mist and snow; the layers of transparent fog drifted towards the castle and vanished.</t9105> <t9106>Instinctively, at the arrival of dawn, I turned towards Mrs. Mina to try to hypnotize her, but I saw that she had suddenly and deeply fallen asleep, and I could not wake her.</t9106> <t9107>I tried to hypnotize her while she slept, but she gave me no response at all, and the sun rose.</t9107> <t9108>I am still afraid to move.</t9108> <t9109>I have made a fire and gone to check on the horses.</t9109> <t9110>They are all dead.</t9110> <t9111>I have much to do here today and I will wait until the sun is very high, because there may be places I need to go where that sun, though dimmed by snow and mist, will be a safety for me.</t9111>
<t9112>I am going to strengthen myself with breakfast, and afterwards, I am going to take care of my terrible work.</t9112> <t9113>Mrs. Mina is still sleeping and, thank God, she is peaceful in her slumber.</t9113>

<t9126>November 5.</t9126> <t9127>At dawn, we see the tribe of gypsies ahead of us, moving away from the river in their wagons.</t9127> <t9128>They gather around them and move hastily, as if they were being harassed.</t9128> <t9129>The snow is falling slowly and there is a huge tension in the atmosphere.</t9129> <t9130>It may be just our feelings, but the impression is strange.</t9130> <t9131>In the distance, I hear the howling of the wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains and the danger for everyone is great and comes from all sides.</t9131> <t9132>The horses are almost ready, and we set off immediately.</t9132> <t9133>We are heading towards someone's death.</t9133> <t9134>Only God knows whose or where, or what or when or how it may happen…</t9134>
<t9135>Memorandum, by Dr. van Helsing</t9135>
<t9136>November 5, in the afternoon.</t9136> <t9137>At least, I am sane.</t9137> <t9138>Thank God for His mercy amidst so many events, even though they have been a terrible trial.</t9138>
<t9139>When I left Mrs. Mina asleep inside the sacred circle, I headed towards the castle.</t9139> <t9140>The blacksmith's hammer that I had carried in the carriage from Veresti has been useful; although the doors were open, I removed them from their rusty hinges to prevent any malicious attempt or bad luck from closing them in such a way that once inside I could not get out again.</t9140> <t9141>The bitter experiences of Jonathan serve me well.</t9141>
<t9142>Remembering his diary, I find the way to the old chapel, as I know that it is there where I will have to work.</t9142> <t9143>The atmosphere was stifling; it seemed that there was some sulfurous acid in it that, at times, made me a bit dizzy.</t9143> <t9144>Either I heard a roar, or the howls of the wolves reached me distorted.</t9144> <t9145>Then, I remembered my dear lady Mina and found myself in the midst of a terrible dilemma.</t9145>
<t9146>I have not allowed myself to bring her to this horrendous place, but I have left her safe from the vampires in the sacred circle; however, there were wolves that put her in danger!</t9146> <t9147>I resolved that I had to do the main work in the castle, and that regarding the wolves we should submit to the will of God.</t9147> <t9148>Anyway, that would only mean death and freedom.</t9148> <t9149>So I decided for her.</t9149> <t9150>If the choice had been for me, it would not have been difficult to decide; it was a thousand times better to be in the midst of a pack of wolves than in the vampire's tomb!</t9150> <t9151>Therefore, I decided to continue my work.</t9151>
<t9152>I knew there were at least three graves to find, which were inhabited.</t9152> <t9153>So I searched tirelessly, and I found one of them.</t9153> <t9154>She was lying in her vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shuddered, as if I were about to commit a crime.</t9154> <t9155>I do not doubt that, in ancient times, many men who were about to undertake a task like mine had their hearts and nerves fail them.</t9155> <t9156>Consequently, it was delayed until the very beauty of the undead woman hypnotized him; and he stayed there until sunset came and the vampire's sleep ceased.</t9156> <t9157>Then, the beautiful eyes of the vampire woman opened and looked at him full of love, and the voluptuous lips parted to kiss...</t9157> <t9158>Man is weak.</t9158> <t9159>Thus, there was one more victim in the vampire's lair; one more that swelled the terrible ranks of the undead...!</t9159>
<t9160>Of course, there is a certain fascination, for I am moved by the mere presence of such a beautiful woman, even when she is lying in a tomb dilapidated by the years and filled with the dust of several centuries, though there was that horrible smell that floated in the count's lair.</t9160> <t9161>Yes; I felt disturbed... I, Van Helsing, despite my purposes and my motives of hatred..., felt the need for a delay that seemed to paralyze my faculties and grip my very soul.</t9161> <t9162>It was possible that the need for natural sleep and the strange oppression of the air were overwhelming me.</t9162> <t9163>I was sure that I was being dominated by sleep; the sleep with open eyes of a person who surrenders to a sweet fascination, when through the silent, snow-filled air came a very prolonged moan, so full of sorrow and regret, that it woke me as if it had been a trumpet, for it was the voice of Mrs. Mina that I was hearing.</t9163>
<t9164>Then, I dedicated myself to my horrible task and discovered, by lifting the slabs of the graves, another of the sisters, the other brunette.</t9164> <t9165>I did not stop to look at her, as I had done with her sister, for fear of being fascinated again; I continued searching until, suddenly, I discovered in a large tomb that must have been built for a very beloved woman, the other sister, the one whom, like my friend Jonathan, I had seen materialize from the mist.</t9165> <t9166>She was so pleasant to behold, of such radiant beauty and so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which demanded part of my sex to love and protect one of them, made my head spin with a new emotion.</t9166> <t9167>But, thank God, that prolonged lament of my dear lady Mina had not yet ceased in my ears and, before the spell could affect me again, I had already decided to carry out my terrible work.</t9167> <t9168>I had searched all the tombs in the chapel, I believe, and since there had only been near us, during the night, three of those ghosts of the undead, I assumed there were no more active undead than them.</t9168> <t9169>There was a great tomb, more majestic than all the others, enormous and of noble proportions.</t9169> <t9170>On it was written a single word: DRACULA</t9170>
<t9171>Thus, that was the tomb of the Vampire King, to whom so many others owed their existence.</t9171> <t9172>The fact that it was empty was eloquent enough to confirm what I already knew.</t9172> <t9173>Before beginning to restore those women to their true dead state through my horrible work, I left a part of the sacred host in Dracula's tomb, thereby prohibiting his entry and ensuring he would remain eternally as the undead.</t9173>
<t9174>Then my terrible task began, and I was horrified by it.</t9174> <t9175>If it had only been one, it wouldn't be relatively difficult.</t9175> <t9176>But, there were three!</t9176> <t9177>I had to start over twice after reaching the height of horror.</t9177> <t9178>Since if it was terrible with sweet Lucy, how could it not be with those strangers, who had survived for several centuries and had been strengthened by the passage of years?</t9178> <t9179>If they could, would they fight for their horrendous lives…?</t9179>
<t9180>Oh, friend John, it was a butcher's job!</t9180> <t9181>If the thought of other dead and the living upon whom a similar mistake weighed had not given me courage, I would not have been able to do it.</t9181> <t9182>I still tremble, even though the work has long been finished.</t9182> <t9183>Thank God, my nerves did not betray me.</t9183> <t9184>If I had not seen the peace first and the joy that spread over the face of the corpse a moment before the dissolution began, as a demonstration that a soul had been freed, I would not have been able to conclude my butchery.</t9184> <t9185>I would not have been able to endure the terrible noise of the stake penetrating, the lips covered with bloody foam, nor the writhing of the body.</t9185> <t9186>I should have left my work unfinished, fleeing from there in terror, but, it is now concluded!</t9186> <t9187>And as for the poor souls, I can now feel pity for them and shed tears, since I saw the peace that spread over their faces before disappearing.</t9187> <t9188>Since, friend John, I had barely cut off their heads with my knife when the bodies began to disintegrate into natural dust, as if the death that should have occurred several centuries before had finally firmly established itself, proclaiming: "Here I am!"</t9188>
<t9189>Before leaving the castle, I closed the doors in such a way that the count could never enter again as an undead.</t9189>
<t9190>When I entered the sacred circle, inside which Mrs. Mina was sleeping, she woke up and, upon seeing me, told me tearfully that I had already endured too much.</t9190>
<t9191>–Let's go! – he said-.</t9191> <t9192>Let's get away from this horrible place!</t9192> <t9193>We are going to meet my husband, who is already on his way to us; I know it.</t9193>
<t9194>He had a fragile, pale, and weak appearance, but his eyes were pure and shone with fervor.</t9194> <t9195>I was glad to see his paleness and sickly appearance, as my mind was still filled with the horror produced by seeing that dream of the vampire women.</t9195>
<t9196>Thus, with confidence and hope and, nevertheless, full of fear, we head east to meet our friends and him, since Mrs. Mina says she knows they are coming to meet us.</t9196>
<t9197>From the diary of Mina Harker</t9197>
<t9198>November 6.</t9198> <t9199>It was already quite late in the afternoon when the professor and I set off towards the east, where I knew Jonathan was approaching from.</t9199> <t9200>We did not advance quickly, due to the steep terrain and the heavy furs and coats we had to carry with us, as we did not want to risk being without warm clothing in the midst of the cold and snow.</t9200> <t9201>Moreover, we had to bring some of our provisions, as we were in an utterly desolate area and, as far as our eyes could see over the snow, there was no inhabited place in sight.</t9201> <t9202>After we had covered approximately a kilometer and a half, I felt tired from the heavy walk and sat down for a moment to rest.</t9202> <t9203>Then, we looked back and saw the place where Dracula's proud castle stood out against the sky, as we were in such a low place compared to the hill on which it stood, that the Carpathians were far behind it.</t9203>
<t9204>We saw it in all its grandeur, almost hanging over a huge precipice, and it seemed that there was a great separation between the summit and the other mountains that surrounded it on all sides.</t9204> <t9205>We could hear the distant howl of the wolves.</t9205> <t9206>They were very far away, but the sound, although muffled by the snow, was horrifying.</t9206> <t9207>I understood from the way Professor Van Helsing was looking around us that he was searching for a strategic point where we would be less exposed in case of an attack.</t9207> <t9208>The main road continued downward and we could see it despite the snow that covered it.</t9208>
<t9209>After a moment, the professor signaled to me and, standing up, I walked towards him.</t9209> <t9210>He had found a magnificent spot; a sort of natural hollow in a rock, with an entrance resembling a door, between two boulders.</t9210> <t9211>He took me by the hand and led me inside.</t9211>
<t9212>–Look! – he said to me-.</t9212> <t9213>Here you will be safe, and if the wolves come near, you can deal with them one by one.</t9213>
<t9214>He brought all our furs inside and prepared a comfortable bed for me; then, he took out some provisions and forced me to consume them.</t9214> <t9215>But I couldn't eat, and even trying to do so was repulsive to me; although I would have liked very much to please him, I couldn't do it.</t9215> <t9216>He seemed very saddened.</t9216> <t9217>However, he did not reproach me.</t9217> <t9218>He took his glasses out of their case and remained at the highest part of the rock, carefully examining the horizon.</t9218> <t9219>Suddenly, he shouted:</t9219>
<t9220>–Look, Mrs. Mina! Look! Look!</t9220>
<t9221>I jumped to my feet and climbed onto the rock, stopping beside him; he handed me the binoculars and pointed with his finger.</t9221> <t9222>The snow was falling more heavily and swirling around us furiously, as a strong wind had picked up.</t9222> <t9223>However, there were times when the blizzard would calm down a bit, and I could see a vast expanse of land.</t9223> <t9224>From the height where we were, it was possible to see a great distance, and in the distance, beyond the white layer of snow, the river winding like a black ribbon, right in front of us and not very far away... in fact, so close that I was surprised we hadn't seen them before, a group of men on horseback was advancing as quickly as they could.</t9224> <t9225>In the middle of them, they were carrying a cart, a long vehicle that swayed from side to side like a dog's tail when it passed over some uneven ground.</t9225> <t9226>In contrast with the snow, as they appeared, I understood from their clothes that they must be peasants or guanos.</t9226>
<t9227>On the cart, there was a large square box, and I felt my heart begin to beat strongly because I sensed that the end was near.</t9227> <t9228>The night was already approaching, and I knew perfectly well that, at sunset, the thing that was locked in that box could come out and, taking one of the forms that were in its power, evade the pursuit.</t9228> <t9229>Terrified, I turned to the professor and saw, dismayed, that he was no longer by my side.</t9229> <t9230>A moment later, I saw him below me.</t9230> <t9231>Around the rock, he had drawn a circle, similar to the one that had served the previous night to protect us.</t9231> <t9232>When he finished, he stood by my side again, saying:</t9232>
<t9233>–At least you will be safe from him here!</t9233>
<t9234>He took the glasses from my hands, and in the next moment of calm, he scanned the entire terrain that stretched out at our feet with his gaze.</t9234>
<t9235>–Look -he said-: they are approaching quickly, spurring the horses and advancing as fast as the road allows -he paused and, a moment later, continued, with a hollow voice-:</t9235> <t9236>They are hurrying because the sun is about to set.</t9236> <t9237>It is possible that we may arrive too late.</t9237> <t9238>May the Lord's will be done!</t9238>
<t9239>The snow fell heavily once again, and the entire landscape disappeared.</t9239> <t9240>However, it soon calmed down, and once more, the professor scrutinized the plain with the help of his glasses.</t9240> <t9241>Then, he suddenly shouted:</t9241>
<t9242>–Look! Look! Look!</t9242> <t9243>See: two riders are following them quickly, coming from the south.</t9243> <t9244>They must be Quincey and John.</t9244> <t9245>Take the binoculars.</t9245> <t9246>Look before the snow prevents us from seeing again!</t9246>
<t9247>I took the glasses and looked.</t9247> <t9248>The two men could be Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward.</t9248> <t9249>In any case, I was sure that neither of them was Jonathan.</t9249> <t9250>At the same time, I knew that Jonathan was not far away; looking around me, I saw to the north of the group that two other men were approaching, galloping at full speed on their mounts.</t9250> <t9251>I realized that one of them was Jonathan and, of course, I assumed that the other must be Lord Godalming.</t9251> <t9252>They were also chasing the cart group.</t9252> <t9253>When I told the professor, he jumped for joy like a schoolboy and, after looking intently until another snowstorm made all vision impossible, he prepared his Winchester, placing it on one of the rocks, ready to shoot.</t9253>
<t9254>–They are all converging -he said-.</t9254> <t9255>When the time comes, we will have gypsies everywhere.</t9255>
<t9256>I drew my revolver and kept it ready to fire, as, while we were talking, the howling of the wolves sounded much closer.</t9256> <t9257>When the snowstorm calmed down a bit, we looked again.</t9257> <t9258>It was strange to see the snow falling so heavily in the place where we were, and a little further on, to see the sun shining, with increasing intensity, approaching ever closer to the line of mountains.</t9258> <t9259>Looking around us, I could see spots moving over the snow, alone, in pairs or trios, and in large numbers...</t9259> <t9260>The wolves were gathering to attack their prey.</t9260>
<t9261>Each passing moment felt like an eternity as we waited.</t9261> <t9262>The wind suddenly grew stronger, and the snow fell furiously, swirling around us without rest.</t9262> <t9263>Sometimes we couldn't see even as far as our outstretched arms; but at other times, the air cleared, and our gaze encompassed the entire landscape.</t9263> <t9264>In recent times, we had become so accustomed to waiting for the sunrise and sunset that we knew exactly when it would happen.</t9264> <t9265>It wasn't long until dusk.</t9265> <t9266>It was hard to believe that, according to our watches, we had been on that rock for less than an hour, waiting, while the three groups of riders converged on us.</t9266> <t9267>The wind kept getting stronger and blew more steadily from the north.</t9267> <t9268>It seemed that the snow-laden clouds had moved away from us, as it had stopped, except for occasional flakes.</t9268> <t9269>It was quite strange that the pursued did not realize they were being pursued, or that they did not care at all.</t9269> <t9270>However, they seemed to hurry more and more as the sun descended over the mountain peaks.</t9270>
<t9271>They were getting closer…</t9271> <t9272>The professor and I crouched behind a rock and kept our weapons ready to fire.</t9272> <t9273>I realized that he was firmly determined not to let them pass.</t9273> <t9274>None of them had noticed our presence.</t9274>
<t9275>Suddenly, two voices shouted loudly:</t9275>
<t9276>–Stop!</t9276>
<t9277>One of them was that of my Jonathan, which rose in a tone of passion; the other was the resolute and commanding voice of Mr. Morris.</t9277> <t9278>It was possible that the gypsies did not understand the language, but the tone in which that word was spoken left no room for doubt, regardless of the language in which it was said.</t9278>
<t9279>Instinctively, they pulled on the reins and, suddenly, Lord Godalming and Jonathan rushed to one side while Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward went to the other.</t9279> <t9280>The leader of the gypsies, an impressive-looking man who rode a horse like a centaur, gestured to them, ordering them to retreat and, with an angry voice, commanded his companions to take action.</t9280> <t9281>They spurred their horses forward, but the four riders raised their Winchester rifles and, in an unequivocal manner, ordered them to stop.</t9281> <t9282>At that very moment, Dr. Van Helsing and I stood up behind the rocks and aimed our weapons at the gypsies.</t9282> <t9283>Seeing that they were surrounded, the men pulled on the reins and stopped.</t9283> <t9284>The leader turned to them, gave an order, and upon hearing it, all the gypsies reached for the weapons they had, knives or pistols, and prepared to attack.</t9284> <t9285>The result was not long in coming.</t9285>
<t9286>The leader, with a quick movement of his reins, launched his horse forward, heading first towards the sun, which was already very close to the mountain peaks, and then towards the castle, saying something I could not understand.</t9286> <t9287>In response, the four men in our group dismounted from their horses and quickly rushed towards the carriage.</t9287> <t9288>I should have felt terribly terrified to see Jonathan in such great danger, but the fervor of the battle had taken hold of me, just like everyone else; I was not afraid, but had a wild and pressing desire to do something.</t9288> <t9289>Seeing the quick movement of our friends, the leader of the gypsies gave an order and his men instantly formed around the carriage, in a somewhat disorganized formation, pushing and hindering each other in their eagerness to execute the order quickly.</t9289>
<t9290>In the midst of them, I managed to see Jonathan making his way towards the cart from one side, while Mr. Morris did so from the other.</t9290> <t9291>It was evident that they were in a hurry to carry out their task before the sun set.</t9291> <t9292>Nothing seemed able to stop them or block their way: neither the weapons aimed at them, nor the knives of the gypsies standing in front of them, nor even the howls of the wolves behind them seemed to attract their attention.</t9292> <t9293>Jonathan's impetuosity and the apparent firmness of his intentions seemed to overwhelm the men in front of him, as they instinctively stepped back and let him pass.</t9293> <t9294>A moment later, he climbed onto the cart and, with an incredible strength, lifted the box and threw it to the ground, onto the wheels.</t9294> <t9295>Meanwhile, Mr. Morris had to use force to break through the circle of gypsies.</t9295> <t9296>All the while I had been anxiously watching Jonathan, I saw out of the corner of my eye Quincey advancing, desperately fighting among the gypsies' knives that gleamed in the sun and pierced his flesh.</t9296> <t9297>He had defended himself with his dagger and, finally, I thought he had managed to pass without being wounded, but when he leapt to Jonathan's side, who had already gotten down from the cart, I could see that he was holding his side with his left hand and blood was oozing between his fingers.</t9297> <t9298>However, he did not let this discourage him, as Jonathan, with a desperate energy, was attacking the wood of the box with his large kukri knife to remove the lid, and Quincey frantically attacked the other side with his dagger.</t9298> <t9299>Under the effort of the two men, the lid began to give way and the nails came out with a dry screech.</t9299> <t9300>Finally, the lid of the box fell to one side.</t9300>
<t9301>By then, the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had yielded and no longer offered any resistance.</t9301> <t9302>The sun was almost hidden among the mountain peaks, and the shadows of the entire group were cast upon the ground.</t9302> <t9303>I saw the Count lying in the box, on the ground, part of which had been spilled over him due to the violence with which the box had fallen from the cart.</t9303> <t9304>He was deeply pale, like a wax figure, and his red eyes shone with the vengeful and horrible look that I knew so well.</t9304>
<t9305>While I was watching him, his eyes saw the sun sinking on the horizon and his expression of hatred turned into one of triumph.</t9305>
<t9306>But, at that precise moment, Jonathan's terrible knife sliced through the air.</t9306> <t9307>I screamed as I saw it cut the vampire's throat, while Mr. Morris's dagger plunged into its heart.</t9307>
<t9308>It was like a miracle, but right before our very eyes and almost in the blink of an eye, the entire body turned to dust and disappeared.</t9308>
<t9309>I will rejoice throughout my entire life that, a moment before the dissolution of the body, a peace spread over the vampire's face that I never would have expected could be expressed.</t9309>
<t9310>Dracula's castle stood out at that moment against the reddish sky, and each of the rocks of its various buildings was outlined against the light of the setting sun.</t9310>
<t9311>The gypsies, considering us responsible for the disappearance of the corpse, turned their horses around and sped away, as if fearing for their lives.</t9311> <t9312>Those who were on foot jumped onto the cart and shouted to the riders not to abandon them.</t9312> <t9313>The wolves, who kept a respectable distance, followed them and left us alone.</t9313>
<t9314>Mr. Morris, who had collapsed to the ground with his hand pressed against his side, saw the blood flowing between his fingers.</t9314> <t9315>I ran towards him, as the sacred circle no longer blocked my way; the two doctors did the same.</t9315> <t9316>Jonathan knelt beside him, and the wounded man rested his head on Jonathan's shoulder.</t9316> <t9317>With a sigh, he took one of my hands, the one not stained with blood.</t9317> <t9318>He must have seen the anguish in my heart reflected on my face, as he smiled at me and said:</t9318>
<t9319>–I am happy to have been useful! Oh, God! – he suddenly shouted, struggling to sit up and pointing at me-.</t9319> <t9320>Is it worth dying for that? Look! Look!</t9320>
<t9321>The sun was already over the mountain peaks and the reddish rays fell upon my face, so that I was bathed in a rosy glow.</t9321> <t9322>With a single impulse, the men fell to their knees and said, "Amen," with deep emotion, as they followed with their gaze what Quincey was pointing at.</t9322> <t9323>The dying man spoke again:</t9323>
<t9324>–Thank you, my God, because all of this has not been in vain!</t9324> <t9325>Look!</t9325> <t9326>Not even the snow is cleaner than his forehead!</t9326> <t9327>The curse has ended!</t9327>
<t9328>And, amidst our profound sorrow, with a smile and in silence, an extraordinary gentleman passed away.</t9328>
<t9329>NOTE</t9329>
<t9330>Seven years ago, all of us went through the flames; and for the happiness that some of us have enjoyed since then, I believe it was well worth the suffering.</t9330> <t9331>For Mina and me, it is an additional joy that our son's birthday is on the same day that Quincey Morris died.</t9331> <t9332>His mother secretly believes, though I know it, that part of the spirit of our dear friend has passed into the child.</t9332> <t9333>His set of names links those of our entire group of men, but we call him Quincey.</t9333>
<t9334>During the summer of this year, we took a trip to Transylvania, traversing the terrain that for us was and is so full of terrible memories.</t9334> <t9335>We found it almost impossible to believe that the things we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our ears could have existed.</t9335> <t9336>Every trace of that has completely disappeared.</t9336> <t9337>The castle remains as before, rising before a landscape full of desolation.</t9337>
<t9338>When we returned home, we talked about the old times... which we could remember without feeling despair, since both Godalming and Seward are happy in their marriages.</t9338> <t9339>I took the papers out of the safe where they have been kept since our return, so long ago.</t9339>
<t9340>We were surprised to see that the entire set of papers that make up the entirety of the records cannot be said to constitute an authentic document; they are merely a pile of typewritten papers, with the exception of the last notes taken by Mina, by Dr. Seward, and by myself, as well as the memorandum from Dr. Van Helsing.</t9340> <t9341>We cannot ask anyone, even if we wish to, to accept that pile of papers as proof of such a terrible story.</t9341> <t9342>Van Helsing summed it all up when he said, having our little son on his knees:</t9342>
<t9343>–We don't need proof.</t9343> <t9344>We don't ask anyone to believe us!</t9344> <t9345>This boy will someday know how brave and extraordinary his mother is.</t9345> <t9346>Now, he already knows her sweetness and affection; later on, he will understand how some men loved her, who risked so much for her well-being.</t9346>
