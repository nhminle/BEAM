<t0>First Book</t0>
<t1>Chapter I</t1>
<t2>It is a universally acknowledged truth that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.</t2>
<t3>No one knows what a man like this feels or thinks when he takes his first step into a new environment, but this fact is so ingrained in the minds of the families in the vicinity that they consider him the rightful property of one of their daughters.</t3>
<t4>"Have you heard, Mr. Bennet, my dear," his wife said one day, "Netherfield Park is finally let.</t4><t5>"</t5>
<t6>Mr. Bennet said he did not hear.</t6>
<t7>"But he is smitten," continued his wife; "Mrs. Long was here just now, she told me everything.</t7><t8>"</t8>
<t9>Mr. Bennet did not reply.</t9>
<t10>"Aren't you curious who took it?" his wife shouted impatiently.</t10>
<t11>"If you want to say it, I won't object.</t11><t12>"</t12>
<t13>This many invitations were enough for him.</t13>
<t14>"Well, darling, you must listen to this, Mrs. Long says that a young man from northern England, who is very wealthy, has bought Netherfield; he came on Sunday with a four-horse carriage to see the place and liked it so much that he immediately made an agreement with Mr. Morris; he will take over the property before Michaelmas, and some of his servants will be in the house by the end of next week."</t14><t15>"</t15>
<t16>"What is his/her name?"</t16><t17>"</t17>
<t18>"Bingley."</t18><t19>"</t19>
<t20>"Is he married or single?"</t20><t21>"</t21>
<t22>"Ah! Single, my dear, of course single!</t22> <t23>A very rich bachelor, earning four or five thousand a year.</t23> <t24>What a delightful thing for our daughters!</t24><t25>"</t25>
<t26>"What do you mean?</t26> <t27>What does it have to do with our daughters?</t27><t28>"</t28>
<t29>"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome!</t29> <t30>You must have realized that I was thinking of marrying one of the girls to him.</t30><t31>"</t31>
<t32>"Did he come here for this purpose?"</t32><t33>"</t33>
<t34>"How can you talk like that!</t34> <t35>It's very likely that he has fallen in love with one of the girls; that's why you should visit him as soon as you arrive.</t35><t36>"</t36>
<t37>"There is no reason for this.</t37> <t38>You can go with the girls, or you can send them on their own, in fact, this might be better because since you are not inferior to them in beauty, Mr. Bingley might choose you instead.</t38><t39>"</t39>
<t40>"You flatter me, darling.</t40> <t41>Of course, I've had my share of beauty, but I can no longer think highly of myself.</t41> <t42>A woman who has raised five daughters should stop thinking about her own beauty.</t42><t43>"</t43>
<t44>"In that case, there wouldn't be any beauty to think about anyway."</t44><t45>"</t45>
<t46>"Sweetheart, when he moves in, you really must go and see Mr. Bingley.</t46><t47>"</t47>
<t48>"I can't promise that much, be sure of it.</t48><t49>"</t49>
<t50>"But think of your daughters.</t50> <t51>Look, what a great match for the girls.</t51> <t52>Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, and just because of this, because you know they usually don't visit newcomers.</t52> <t53>You really must go, because if you don't go, it will be impossible for us to go.</t53><t54>"</t54>
<t55>"You are calculating things very precisely.</t55> <t56>I'm sure Mr. Bingley will be very happy to see you; I will also write a few lines and send them with you, saying that I am fine with whichever of the girls he chooses; but of course, I need to add something nice for my little Lizzy.</t56><t57>"</t57>
<t58>"I hope you don't do such a thing.</t58> <t59>Lizzy is not even a bit superior to the others; she is neither half as beautiful as Jane, nor half as good-natured as Lydia.</t59> <t60>But you always side with her.</t60><t61>"</t61>
<t62>"None of them have any remarkable qualities," replied Mr. Bennet; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy is smarter than her sisters.</t62><t63>"</t63>
<t64>"Mr. Bennet, how can you belittle your own children like this?</t64> <t65>You take pleasure in vexing me.</t65> <t66>You have no compassion for my poor nerves.</t66><t67>"</t67>
<t68>"You misunderstood me, my dear.</t68> <t69>I have great respect for your nerves.</t69> <t70>Your nerves are my old friend.</t70> <t71>For at least twenty years, I have been persistently listening to you talk about your nerves.</t71><t72>"</t72>
<t73>"How would you know what I've been through."</t73><t74>"</t74>
<t75>"You will get through it, live many more years, and see many young people who earn four thousand a year come here."</t75><t76>"</t76>
<t77>"Even if twenty come, it won't be of any use to us if you don't visit."</t77><t78>"</t78>
<t79>"Rest assured, my dear, if there are twenty, I will visit them all."</t79><t80>"</t80>
<t81>Mr. Bennet was such a mixture of odd quick-wittedness, subtle sarcasm, coldness, and selfishness that twenty-three years of experience had not been enough for his wife to understand his character.</t81> <t82>Understanding his wife's temperament was less difficult.</t82> <t83>She was a woman of limited understanding, low education, and unpredictable reactions.</t83> <t84>When she was unhappy, she thought her nerves were disturbed.</t84> <t85>Her whole concern in life was to marry off her daughters; her solace was visits and news.</t85>
<t86>Chapter II</t86>
<t87>Mr. Bennet was one of the first to visit Mr. Bingley.</t87> <t88>Although he convinced his wife until the last moment that he would not go, he had intended to go from the beginning; he did not tell his wife about the visit until the evening.</t88> <t89>In the evening, he explained it in the following manner.</t89> <t90>While watching his second daughter decorate a hat, he suddenly said,</t90>
<t91>"I hope Mr. Bingley likes it, Lizzy," she said.</t91>
<t92>"We have no way of knowing what Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother sorrowfully, "since we are not going to visit him.</t92><t93>"</t93>
<t94>"But you are forgetting, mother," said Elizabeth, "we will meet him at the ball; Mrs. Long promised to introduce us."</t94><t95>"</t95>
<t96>"I don't think Mrs. Long will introduce him.</t96> <t97>She has her own two nieces.</t97> <t98>She's a selfish, hypocritical woman, I don't respect her.</t98><t99>"</t99>
<t100>"Nor will I," said Mr. Bennet; "besides, I can gladly say that you do not need his help.</t100><t101>"</t101>
<t102>Mrs. Bennet did not deign to respond, but she couldn't help starting to scold one of her daughters.</t102>
<t103>"For God's sake, Kitty, stop coughing like that! Have some pity on my nerves.</t103> <t104>You've shredded my nerves to pieces.</t104><t105>"</t105>
<t106>"Kitty is not careful about coughing at all," said her father; "she coughs at the wrong time.</t106><t107>"</t107>
<t108>"I'm not coughing for fun," Kitty replied irritably.</t108>
<t109>"When is the first ball, Lizzy?"</t109>
<t110>"Next week is tomorrow."</t110><t111>"</t111>
<t112>"There you go," cried his mother, "Mrs. Long will only return a day before, and then she won't be able to introduce the man, because she herself wouldn't have met him yet.</t112><t113>"</t113>
<t114>"Then, my dear, take your friend's place and introduce Mr. Bingley to her."</t114><t115>"</t115>
<t116>"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, I haven't even met the man yet; how can you be so exasperating?</t116><t117>"</t117>
<t118>"I agree with your meticulousness.</t118> <t119>Fifteen days of acquaintance is certainly very little.</t119> <t120>A person cannot be known in fifteen days.</t120> <t121>But if we don't take action, someone else will; besides, Mrs. Long and her nieces will also try their luck; so, isn't the point courtesy? If you refuse the help, I can take on this task.</t121><t122>"</t122>
<t123>The girls looked at their father.</t123> <t124>Mrs. Bennet simply said, "You are being ridiculous!"</t124>
<t125>"What could be the meaning of this harsh word?" cried Mr. Bennet.</t125> <t126>"Do you see the customs of acquaintance and the importance given to them as nonsense?</t126> <t127>I do not agree with you on that matter.</t127> <t128>What do you say, Mary, as a girl with deep thoughts, who reads big books and takes notes?</t128><t129>"</t129>
<t130>Mary wanted to say something very meaningful, but she couldn't manage it.</t130>
<t131>"While Mary gathers her thoughts," continued Mr. Bennet, "let us return to Mr. Bingley.</t131><t132>"</t132>
<t133>"I'm tired of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife.</t133>
<t134>"I'm sorry to hear that; but why didn't you tell me earlier?</t134> <t135>If I had known this in the morning, I wouldn't have visited the man.</t135> <t136>It's a great misfortune; but since I went, we can't pretend we haven't met anymore.</t136><t137>"</t137>
<t138>The ladies' astonishment was just as he wanted; in fact, Mrs. Bennet's surpassed the others; yet, as the first wave of joy subsided, Mrs. Bennet began to say that she had expected this all along.</t138>
<t139>"How good you are, dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I would eventually convince you.</t139> <t140>I was sure you loved your daughters too much to neglect such an acquaintance.</t140> <t141>Oh, how pleased I am!</t141> <t142>Also, it's such a good joke, you go this morning, but don't say a word until this hour.</t142><t143>"</t143>
<t144>"Come now, Kitty, you can cough as much as you want," said Mr. Bennet; saying this, he left the room, exhausted from his wife's enthusiasm.</t144>
<t145>"You have a wonderful father, girls," said Mrs. Bennet, as the door closed.</t145> <t146>"I don't know how you will repay his efforts, or even mine.</t146> <t147>At our age, meeting someone new every day is not very pleasant; but we do everything for your sake.</t147> <t148>Lydia, my dear, you are the youngest, but I think Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the first ball.</t148><t149>"</t149>
<t150>"Yo!" said Lydia, boldly, "I'm not afraid; I may be the youngest, but I'm the tallest.</t150><t151>"</t151>
<t152>The later hours of the evening were spent guessing when Mr. Bingley would return the visit and deciding when they could invite him to dinner.</t152>
<t153>Chapter III</t153>
<t154>Despite Mrs. Bennet's persistent efforts with her five daughters, she couldn't manage to get a satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley from her husband.</t154> <t155>They attacked the poor man from all sides, with impudent questions, cunning guesses, and distant hints, but he deflected all these attempts; in the end, they had to settle for the second-hand information obtained by their neighbor Lady Lucas.</t155> <t156>Lady Lucas's report was quite positive.</t156> <t157>Sir William liked the man.</t157> <t158>He was very young, wonderfully handsome, extremely charming, and, to crown it all, he intended to attend the first ball with a large group of friends.</t158> <t159>Nothing could be more delightful!</t159> <t160>Loving to dance was an important step towards falling in love; pleasant hopes were entertained for Mr. Bingley's heart.</t160>
<t161>"If I could see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and the others making such good marriages, I would not want anything else in the world.</t161><t162>"</t162>
<t163>Within a few days, Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit and sat with him in the library for about ten minutes.</t163> <t164>He had hoped to be admitted to the presence of the young ladies whose beauty he had heard of, but he could only see the father.</t164> <t165>The ladies were a bit luckier; they had the opportunity to see from the upstairs window that he was wearing a blue coat and riding a black horse.</t165>
<t166>The dinner invitation was conveyed to him immediately; Mrs. Bennet had just started planning meals that would bring prestige to her hosting when a reply came postponing everything.</t166> <t167>Mr. Bingley had to go to town the next day, so he regrettably could not accept their invitation, etc.</t167> <t168>Mrs. Bennet was very upset.</t168> <t169>She couldn't understand what business he could have in town right after arriving in Hertfordshire; she began to fear that he might be someone who constantly flits from place to place and would not properly settle in Netherfield.</t169> <t170>Lady Lucas somewhat eased her fears by suggesting that he had gone to London just to bring a large group of friends for the ball; soon, news arrived that Mr. Bingley would bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen to the ball.</t170> <t171>The girls were worried at the thought of so many ladies; but they were relieved when they heard the day before the ball that he had brought only six ladies from London instead of twelve, five of whom were his sisters and one his cousin.</t171> <t172>Finally, when they entered the ballroom, the group consisted of only five people; Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the elder sister's husband, and another young man.</t172>
<t173>Mr. Bingley was handsome and kind; he had a pleasant face and easy, unpretentious manners.</t173> <t174>His sisters were elegant women and had a fashionable air about them.</t174> <t175>His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looked like a gentleman, and that was all; but his friend Mr. Darcy, with his fine, tall figure, handsome face, noble demeanor, and the rumor of his ten thousand a year income circulating within five minutes of his entrance, quickly drew the room's attention.</t175> <t176>The gentlemen declared him to be a fine man, and the ladies proclaimed him much more handsome than Mr. Bingley, and he attracted admiring glances until halfway through the evening, when his manners caused displeasure and reversed his popularity; for it was understood that he was proud, saw himself as superior to those around him, and was generally discontented; at that point, even his vast estate in Derbyshire could not save him from being found disagreeable, unattractive, and unworthy of comparison to his friend.</t176>
<t177>Mr. Bingley had introduced himself to all the prominent people in the drawing room in a short time; he was lively and sincere, participated in every dance, was upset that the ball ended so early, and talked about hosting a ball at Netherfield himself.</t177> <t178>Such friendly actions give an idea about him.</t178> <t179>How opposite he was to his friend!</t179> <t180>Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley; he refused to be introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening walking around the room, occasionally chatting with someone from his own group.</t180> <t181>A decision was made about his character.</t181> <t182>He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world; everyone wished he would never come there again.</t182> <t183>One of the most vehement in her reaction was Mrs. Bennet; her general displeasure with the man turned to anger when he slighted one of her daughters.</t183>
<t184>Elizabeth Bennet had to sit out for two dances due to a shortage of men; at one point, Mr. Darcy was standing so close to Elizabeth that she overheard a conversation between Mr. Bingley and her friend, who was trying to persuade him to join the dance for a few minutes.</t184>
<t185>"Come on Darcy," said Mr. Bingley, "you need to dance.</t185> <t186>I hate seeing you standing there all alone.</t186> <t187>Come on, dance.</t187><t188>"</t188>
<t189>"Never.</t189> <t190>You know I don't like it, I don't dance without knowing my partner well.</t190> <t191>In such a gathering, it's impossible.</t191> <t192>Your sisters are occupied, and there is no other woman in the hall whom I can ask to dance without it being a torment for me.</t192><t193>"</t193>
<t194>"If they gave me the world," cried Bingley, "I wouldn't be as fastidious as you!</t194> <t195>Honestly, I've never seen so many beautiful girls together in my life; there are a few who are extraordinarily charming.</t195><t196>"</t196>
<t197>"Of course you are dancing with the most beautiful girl in the room," said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.</t197>
<t198>"The most beautiful creature I have ever seen!</t198> <t199>But there is a sibling sitting right behind you, who is also very beautiful and very cute.</t199> <t200>Let me tell my spouse to introduce you.</t200><t201>"</t201>
<t202>"Which one do you mean?" and turned around to look at Elizabeth for a moment, when he caught her eyes, he averted his own and said coldly: "Well, she's not beautiful enough to tempt me; besides, I'm not in a position to care about girls who are scorned by other men right now.</t202> <t203>I think you should turn to your wife and enjoy her smiles, because you are wasting your time with me.</t203><t204>"</t204>
<t205>Mr. Bingley followed his friend's advice.</t205> <t206>Mr. Darcy walked away, and Elizabeth was left with feelings that were not at all pleasant towards him.</t206> <t207>Nevertheless, she recounted the story to her friends with all its cheerfulness; for she had a lively, playful spirit that took delight in everything ridiculous.</t207>
<t208>The evening was enjoyable for the whole family.</t208> <t209>Mrs. Bennet had seen that her eldest daughter had won the deep admiration of the Netherfield group.</t209> <t210>Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and his sisters had treated her with special attention.</t210> <t211>Jane received this with as much pleasure as her mother, but more calmly.</t211> <t212>Elizabeth felt Jane's satisfaction.</t212> <t213>Mary had heard herself referred to as the most skillful girl in the neighborhood by Miss Bingley; and Catherine and Lydia were lucky enough never to be without partners, which was all they could think of when it came to the ball for now.</t213> <t214>Thus, they returned to Longbourn in high spirits; their home was in the village of Longbourn, and they were the landowners of the village.</t214> <t215>They found Mr. Bennet still awake.</t215> <t216>Mr. Bennet would lose track of time when he picked up a book, but now he was very curious about the news of the evening that had created such tremendous expectations.</t216> <t217>He had thought that all his wife's hopes regarding the stranger would come to nothing, but soon realized he was about to hear a different story.</t217>
<t218>"Ah dear Mr. Bennet," said his wife as she entered the room, "what a delightful evening we had, what a magnificent ball it was!</t218> <t219>If only you had come too.</t219> <t220>They absolutely adored Jane.</t220> <t221>Everyone said how wonderful she looked; Mr. Bingley also adored her, he danced with her twice.</t221> <t222>Imagine, my dear, he really danced with her twice; moreover, she was the only girl in the whole room he asked to dance a second time.</t222> <t223>First, he asked Miss Lucas.</t223> <t224>Though I was very upset to see them together, fortunately, he didn't like her: after all, who would; but once the dance started, he seemed completely smitten with Jane.</t224> <t225>Then he inquired who she was, introduced himself, and then asked her for the second dance.</t225> <t226>Then, the third dance was with Miss King, the fourth with Maria Lucas, the fifth again with Jane, and the sixth with Lizzy-"</t226>
<t227>"If she had a bit of compassion for me," her husband cried impatiently, "she wouldn't dance even half as much!</t227> <t228>For God's sake, stop talking about their wives.</t228> <t229>I wish she had twisted her ankle in the first dance!</t229><t230>"</t230>
<t231>"But my dear," continued Mrs. Bennet, "I liked the man very much.</t231> <t232>Incredibly handsome!</t232> <t233>His sisters are also very charming women.</t233> <t234>I have never seen more elegant dresses in my life.</t234> <t235>I think the lace on Mrs. Hurst's gown-"</t235>
<t236>Here, again, the speech was interrupted.</t236> <t237>Mr. Bennet objected to the description of the attire.</t237> <t238>Mrs. Bennet, therefore, had to seek another aspect of the topic and, with a heavy heart and a bit of exaggeration, recounted Mr. Darcy's incredible rudeness.</t238>
<t239>"But I assure you," he added, "Lizzy hasn't lost much by not pleasing him; because he is an extremely unpleasant, terrible man, not worth bothering with.</t239> <t240>So self-conceited, so arrogant that it's impossible to tolerate him!</t240> <t241>He wandered around as if he were something special!</t241> <t242>Not even handsome enough to dance!</t242> <t243>I wish you had been there, dear, to put him in his place.</t243> <t244>I truly hated the man.</t244><t245>"</t245>
<t246>Chapter IV</t246>
<t247>When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, Jane, who had previously been cautious about praising Mr. Bingley, told her sister how much she admired him.</t247>
<t248>"A man should be exactly like this," she said, "smart, well-behaved, good-natured, lively; I have never seen such pleasant manners before!</t248> <t249>So relaxed, so polite!</t249><t250>"</t250>
<t251>"Handsome, as well," replied Elizabeth, "well, a man should also be handsome, if possible.</t251> <t252>So, he has everything perfectly.</t252><t253>"</t253>
<t254>"Him asking me to dance a second time really flattered my pride.</t254> <t255>I wasn't expecting such a compliment.</t255><t256>"</t256>
<t257>"Is that so?</t257> <t258>I was waiting on your behalf.</t258> <t259>But this is another big difference between us.</t259> <t260>Compliments always surprise you, they never surprise me.</t260> <t261>What could be more natural than him proposing to you again?</t261> <t262>It was impossible for him not to see that you are five times more beautiful than every woman in the room.</t262> <t263>We don't owe this to his kindness.</t263> <t264>Yes, he is indeed very nice; I allow you to like him.</t264> <t265>You have liked much more foolish ones.</t265><t266>"</t266>
<t267>"Peace Lizzy!</t267><t268>"</t268>
<t269>"Well, you are generally very ready to like people.</t269> <t270>You don't see anyone's faults.</t270> <t271>According to you, the whole world is good and charming.</t271> <t272>I've never heard you speak ill of anyone in your life.</t272><t273>"</t273>
<t274>"I don't want to be quick to judge anyone; but I always say what I think."</t274><t275>"</t275>
<t276>"I know you will say it; that's the strange part.</t276> <t277>To have your sense and be so sincerely blind to the foolishness and absurdities of others!</t277> <t278>Pretending to be sincere is common enough –you see it everywhere.</t278> <t279>But to be genuinely sincere without show or plan –to take the good side of everyone's character and make it better, and not to speak of the bad side –is unique to you.</t279> <t280>You must have liked this man's sisters too, right?</t280> <t281>Their demeanor is not like his.</t281><t282>"</t282>
<t283>"Of course not, at first.</t283> <t284>But when you talk to them, they are very pleasant women.</t284> <t285>Miss Bingley will stay with her brother and manage the house; if she doesn't turn out to be a very sweet neighbor for us, I would be quite mistaken.</t285><t286>"</t286>
<t287>Elizabeth listened in silence, but she was not convinced; the ladies' behavior at the ball was not exactly pleasing to everyone; with a quicker observation skill than her sister, a less flexible nature, and a judgment unaffected by personal interest, Elizabeth was not inclined to approve of their behavior.</t287> <t288>In fact, they were quite elegant women; when they were in a good mood, they did not refrain from being polite, and when they wished, they could be charming; but they were proud and self-conceited.</t288> <t289>They could be considered beautiful, they had been educated at one of the best private schools in the city, they had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, they had habits of spending more money than necessary and associating with people of high status, therefore, they had every right to see themselves as superior and to look down on others.</t289> <t290>They belonged to a respectable family from Northern England, and this fact was more deeply ingrained in their memories than the fact that both their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired through trade.</t290>
<t291>Mr. Bingley had inherited an estate worth about one hundred thousand pounds from his father; his father had always wanted to buy a manor but had not lived long enough.</t291> <t292>–Mr. Bingley had intended the same and had chosen his region several times; but now that he had found a good house and hunting grounds, many who knew his easygoing nature well doubted that he would spend the rest of his life at Netherfield and leave the purchasing to the next generation.</t292>
<t293>His sisters were very eager for him to have his own estate; although he had only settled as a tenant now, Miss Bingley was not at all reluctant to manage his house; and Mrs. Hurst, who was married to a man of position rather than wealth, did not dislike seeing his house as her own whenever she pleased.</t293> <t294>Mr. Bingley had not yet been of age for two years when he was advised by chance to look at Netherfield Park.</t294> <t295>He spent half an hour looking inside and outside the house, liked its location and main rooms, was satisfied with the owner's praises, and immediately took the house.</t295>
<t296>Despite the significant difference in character between Bingley and Darcy, there was a stable friendship.</t296> <t297>–Bingley had endeared himself to Darcy with his ease, openness, and gentleness, although no personality could be more opposite to his own, and he did not seem to be dissatisfied with his own personality.</t297> <t298>Bingley had immense confidence in the solidity of Darcy's opinions and held great respect for his judgment.</t298> <t299>Darcy's understanding was more profound.</t299> <t300>Not because Bingley was inadequate, but because Darcy was intelligent.</t300> <t301>At the same time, he was proud, distant, and meticulous, and his manners, though polite, were not inviting.</t301> <t302>In this respect, his friend was much more privileged.</t302> <t303>Bingley was confident that he would endear himself wherever he went, whereas Darcy constantly offended people.</t303>
<t304>The conversations about the Meryton ball also sufficiently revealed their personalities.</t304> <t305>Bingley had never encountered such pleasant people and such beautiful girls before; everyone had treated him with utmost kindness and care, there had been no formality or stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with the entire room; as for Miss Bennet, he couldn't imagine a more beautiful angel.</t305> <t306>In contrast, Darcy had seen a crowd with little beauty and no manners; he hadn't felt the slightest closeness to anyone, nor had he received any attention or interest from anyone.</t306> <t307>Miss Bennet, he admitted, was beautiful, but she laughed too much.</t307>
<t308>Although Mrs. Hurst and her sister shared the same opinion, they admired and liked her; they said she was a sweet girl and they would not object to getting to know her better.</t308> <t309>Thus, Miss Bennet was accepted as a sweet girl, and their brother felt permitted to consider her if he wished.</t309>
<t310>Chapter V</t310>
<t311>A family with whom the Bennets were very close lived a short walking distance from Longbourn.</t311> <t312>Sir William Lucas had once been a tradesman in Meryton; he had made a considerable fortune and had been knighted during his mayoralty by presenting his gratitude to the King.</t312> <t313>This privilege may have been felt too strongly.</t313> <t314>It had caused the man to become disenchanted with his business and home in a small market town; he then left both and moved with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, which had since been called Lucas Lodge; here, free from the worries of business, he could contemplate his own importance with pleasure and occupy himself solely with being courteous to the world.</t314> <t315>If his title filled him with pride, it did not make him arrogant; on the contrary, he became a model of politeness to everyone.</t315> <t316>By nature, he was mild-mannered, friendly, and considerate; St.</t316> <t317>His presentation at St. James's had also made him a courtier.</t317>
<t318>Lady Lucas was a very kind-hearted woman, but not clever enough to be a good neighbor to Mrs. Bennet.</t318> <t319>–She had several children.</t319> <t320>The eldest, a sensible and intelligent young woman of twenty-seven, was a close friend of Elizabeth.</t320>
<t321>It was essential for the daughters of the Lucases and the Bennets to meet and discuss every ball; the morning after the ball, the Lucas daughters came to Longbourn to listen and share.</t321>
<t322>"You have started the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet to Miss Lucas, with polite solemnity.</t322> <t323>"You were Mr. Bingley's first choice.</t323><t324>"</t324>
<t325>"Yes, but I think he liked his second choice more."</t325><t326>"</t326>
<t327>"Ah! I suppose you mean Jane – because he danced with her twice.</t327> <t328>Of course, this makes one think he likes her – in fact, I believe he does – I've heard something about it – but exactly what, I don't know – something related to Mr. Robinson.</t328><t329>"</t329>
<t330>"Maybe you mean the things I heard while talking to Mr. Robinson; didn't I tell you?</t330> <t331>Mr. Robinson asked him how he found our Meryton balls, whether he thought there were many beautiful women in the room, and which one he liked the most, to which he immediately replied to the last question – Oh! Miss Bennet undoubtedly, no one can say otherwise.</t331><t332>"</t332>
<t333>"Wow! –Yes, this is indeed quite clear –it seems like –but still, all of this might not lead anywhere.</t333><t334>"</t334>
<t335>"What I have heard is more meaningful than what you have heard, Eliza," said Charlotte.</t335> <t336>"Mr. Darcy is not as worthy of attention as his friend, is he?</t336> <t337>–Poor Eliza! –he is hard to endure.</t337><t338>"</t338>
<t339>"Please do not get into Lizzy's head, she shouldn't dwell on that man's rudeness; he is such an unpleasant man that being liked by him would be a complete misfortune.</t339> <t340>Mrs. Long told me last night that she sat next to him for half an hour and he didn't open his mouth even once.</t340><t341>"</t341>
<t342>"Are you sure, ma'am? –isn't there a small mistake?" said Jane.</t342> <t343>"I clearly saw Mr. Darcy talking to her.</t343><t344>"</t344>
<t345>"So – because in the end, he asked her how she found Netherfield, and she had to answer; but she said he seemed very angry about being spoken to.</t345><t346>"</t346>
<t347>"Miss Bingley told me that she does not speak if one is not among her close acquaintances," said Jane.</t347> <t348>"When she is with her acquaintances, she is quite friendly.</t348><t349>"</t349>
<t350>"I don't believe a single word, my dear.</t350> <t351>If he were that friendly, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.</t351> <t352>I can imagine how it is; everyone says he is a pride maniac; I suppose he heard that Mrs. Long didn't have a carriage and came to the ball in a rented cab.</t352><t353>"</t353>
<t354>"I don't care if he doesn't talk to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza."</t354><t355>"</t355>
<t356>"Next time, Lizzy," said her mother, "if I were you, I wouldn't dance with him either.</t356><t357>"</t357>
<t358>"I believe, madam, that I can comfortably promise never to dance with him."</t358><t359>"</t359>
<t360>"The man's pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not bother me so much, because it has an explanation.</t360> <t361>There is nothing surprising in a young man who has family and wealth, who is so handsome, and who has everything complete, valuing himself.</t361> <t362>I can say he has the right to be proud.</t362><t363>"</t363>
<t364>"This is very true," replied Elizabeth, "I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not wounded mine."</t364><t365></t365>
<t366>"Pride," Mary observed, taking pride as usual in the firmness of her opinions, "I think is a very common fault.</t366> <t367>From all the things I have read, I have come to believe that it is indeed very common; human nature is particularly inclined towards pride; there are very few people who do not feel some satisfaction with themselves for one real or imaginary attribute or another.</t367> <t368>Pride and vanity are different things, but they are often used synonymously.</t368> <t369>One can be proud without being vain.</t369> <t370>Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, while vanity is what we would have others think of us.</t370><t371>"</t371>
<t372>"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," exclaimed one of the sons of the Lucases who came with their sisters, "I wouldn't care how proud I was.</t372> <t373>I would keep a pack of hounds and drink a bottle of wine every day.</t373><t374>"</t374>
<t375>"Then you would drink too much," said Mrs. Bennet; "and I would take the bottle from your hand the moment I saw it."</t375><t376>"</t376>
<t377>The boy objected, saying he couldn't get it; Mrs. Bennet kept insisting that she would, and the argument only ended with the visit.</t377>
<t378>Chapter VI</t378>
<t379>The ladies of Longbourn immediately visited Netherfield.</t379> <t380>The visit was duly returned.</t380> <t381>Miss Bennet's pleasant manners increased the admiration of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; although the mother was found unbearable and the younger sisters not worth talking about, the desire to get to know them better was expressed towards the two eldest daughters.</t381> <t382>This interest was accepted with great pleasure by Jane; but Elizabeth saw how they looked down on almost everyone, including her sister, and was unwilling to like them; yet the kindness shown to Jane, probably stemming from their brother's admiration for her, had some value.</t382> <t383>It was evident at every encounter that the man admired her; according to Elizabeth, it was clear that Jane was allowing herself to be carried away by the feelings she had initially started to harbor for the man, and would eventually be head over heels in love; but she was pleased to think that the world would not notice this, because Jane combined dignity and cheerfulness with great emotional strength, which protected her from the suspicions of indiscreet people.</t383> <t384>She told this to her friend Miss Lucas.</t384>
<t385>"In such a situation," Charlotte replied, "it may be pleasant to be dignified towards others; but being so well-guarded can sometimes be harmful.</t385> <t386>If a woman hides her love from the man she loves with the same skill, she may miss the opportunity to win him, and then believing that the world is unaware would be a weak consolation.</t386> <t387>In almost every relationship, there is so much gratitude or display of emotion that it is not safe to leave things to their own devices.</t387> <t388>We can all start freely – a slight inclination is quite natural, but very few of us have the heart to truly fall in love without encouragement.</t388> <t389>Nine times out of ten, the right thing for a woman is to show more love than she actually feels.</t389> <t390>Bingley undoubtedly likes your sister, but if your sister does not help him along, the man may not go beyond liking her.</t390><t391>"</t391>
<t392>"But she is helping, as much as she can.</t392> <t393>If I can perceive the interest she shows the man, he must be stupid not to understand it.</t393><t394>"</t394>
<t395>"Remember, Eliza, she doesn't know Jane's nature as well as you do.</t395><t396>"</t396>
<t397>"But if a woman likes a man and doesn't try to hide it, the man will notice.</t397><t398>"</t398>
<t399>"It might make a difference, if he sees the woman enough.</t399> <t400>But even though Bingley and Jane see each other often, they don't spend much time alone; they always see each other in large, mixed groups, so it's impossible for them to spend every moment talking to each other.</t400> <t401>Therefore, Jane should make the most of every minute she can capture the man's attention.</t401> <t402>After securing the man, she will have plenty of time to fall in love.</t402><t403>"</t403>
<t404>"Your plan is sound," replied Elizabeth, "of course, if nothing else is at stake other than the desire to make a good marriage; if I were to seek a wealthy husband, or even just a husband, I would certainly follow your plan.</t404> <t405>But Jane's feelings are not like that; she is not acting according to a plan.</t405> <t406>She is not even sure of her own feelings yet, let alone whether it is wise or not.</t406> <t407>She has only known the man for fifteen days.</t407> <t408>She danced with him four times in Meryton; saw him at his house one morning, and since then they have met four times at dinner.</t408> <t409>This is not enough for her to understand the man's character.</t409><t410>"</t410>
<t411>"It's not like you think.</t411> <t412>If he had only had a meal with her, he would have only learned whether she had a good appetite or not; but remember that four evenings were spent together – four evenings can make a big difference.</t412><t413>"</t413>
<t414>"Yes, these four evenings gave them a chance to learn that they loved twenty-one more than conk; but I don't think much has come to light about other fundamental characteristics.</t414><t415>"</t415>
<t416>"Honestly," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane all the success with all my heart; I believe that marrying her tomorrow would give as much chance of happiness as marrying her after examining her character for twelve months.</t416> <t417>Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.</t417> <t418>Even if the parties know each other very well, or are even very similar from the start, this does not contribute the slightest bit to their happiness.</t418> <t419>They always strive to change and get themselves into trouble; the less you know about the faults of the person you are going to spend your life with, the better.</t419><t420>"</t420>
<t421>"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but this is not sensible.</t421> <t422>You yourself wouldn't behave this way.</t422><t423>"</t423>
<t424>Elizabeth, who was busy observing the interest Mr. Bingley showed to her sister, was in no position to suspect that she herself was becoming the center of attention in the eyes of his friend.</t424> <t425>Mr. Darcy had not even admitted that she was beautiful at first; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; in their next encounters, he had looked at her only to criticize.</t425> <t426>But it was almost immediate that, after telling himself and his friend that there was not a single beautiful feature in the girl's face, he began to see that the extraordinary expression in her dark eyes made that face unusually intelligent.</t426> <t427>This discovery was followed by others equally attentive.</t427> <t428>Though he found more than one symmetry flaw in her form when looking with a critical eye, he had to admit that her appearance was bright and refreshing; despite noting that her manners were not those of high society, he was intrigued by their ease.</t428> <t429>Elizabeth was unaware of these; –Darcy was just the man who could not endear himself to anyone anywhere and did not find her beautiful enough to dance with.</t429>
<t430>Darcy wanted to get to know her better, and as a step to converse with her personally, he joined her conversations with others.</t430> <t431>By doing so, he caught Elizabeth's attention.</t431> <t432>This was happening at Sir William Lucas's; a large party was being held.</t432>
<t433>"What does Mr. Darcy mean," said Elizabeth to Charlotte, "by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?</t433><t434>"</t434>
<t435>"This is a question that only Mr. Darcy can answer."</t435><t436>"</t436>
<t437>"But if he keeps this up, I will tell him that I understand what he's after.</t437> <t438>He has very piercing looks; if I don't start being rude first, he will quickly intimidate me.</t438><t439>"</t439>
<t440>When they approached them a little later, although he did not seem inclined to talk, Miss Lucas cautioned her friend not to say such a thing; the admonition, provoking Elizabeth at that moment, made her turn to Darcy and say:</t440>
<t441>"Don't you think I was expressing myself extraordinarily well, Mr. Darcy, while I was just now pestering Colonel Forster in Meryton to give us a ball?"</t441><t442>"</t442>
<t443>"With tremendous energy too; –but this topic always makes a lady energetic.</t443><t444>"</t444>
<t445>"You are cruel to us.</t445><t446>"</t446>
<t447>"Her turn to be vexed will come soon," said Miss Lucas.</t447> <t448>"I'm opening the piano, Eliza; you know what will follow."</t448><t449>"</t449>
<t450>"You need a thousand witnesses to call you a friend! –you always want me to play and sing in front of people!</t450> <t451>If I were interested in showing off with music, you would be very useful; but as I am, I prefer not to perform in front of people who are used to listening to the best performers."</t451> <t452>Still, when Miss Lucas insisted, she added, "Alright, if you say so, let it be so."</t452> <t453>And giving Mr. Darcy a brave look, she said: "There is an old saying, everyone here knows it –'Save your breath to cool your porridge,' they say –so I'd better save my breath to sing my song.</t453><t454>"</t454>
<t455>Although the performance was not spectacular, it was sweet.</t455> <t456>After a few songs, before she could respond to the requests to sing again, her sister Mary eagerly sat down at the piano; Mary, being the most ordinary member of the family, worked very hard to gain knowledge and skills, and was always impatient to showcase what she had acquired.</t456>
<t457>Mary had neither talent nor taste; the sense of show gave her the drive to work, just as it gave her a very knowing air and conceited manners, which would be repulsive even at a higher level of perfection than she had attained.</t457> <t458>Comfortable and unpretentious Elizabeth, although she played not even half as well, was listened to with much more pleasure; Mary received the praise and applause that would satisfy her at the end of a long concerto with the Scottish and Irish tunes she played at the request of her younger sisters; her younger sisters, along with a few of the Lucas girls and one or two officers, began a cheerful dance at the other end of the room.</t458>
<t459>Mr. Darcy, abandoning all conversation in the face of spending the evening in this manner, stood beside them with silent disdain; he was so lost in his thoughts that he did not notice Sir William Lucas approaching him as a neighbor until Sir William began to speak:</t459>
<t460>"What an attractive amusement for young people, Mr. Darcy! There's nothing like dancing, really.</t460> <t461>I consider it one of the first refinements of polite society.</t461><t462>"</t462>
<t463>"Of course, sir; moreover, it also has the feature of being fashionable in the less polite societies of the world.</t463> <t464>Every savage can dance.</t464><t465>"</t465>
<t466>Sir William just smiled.</t466> <t467>Seeing Bingley join the group, he paused for a moment and continued, "Your friend dances wonderfully; I have no doubt that you are also skilled in this art, Mr. Darcy.</t467><t468>"</t468>
<t469>"Sir, you must have seen me dancing in Meryton.</t469><t470>"</t470>
<t471>"Yes, of course; I quite enjoyed what I saw.</t471> <t472>Do</t472> <t473>you often dance at St. James?</t473><t474>"</t474>
<t475>"No, sir."</t475><t476>"</t476>
<t477>"Don't you think that dancing is an appropriate expression of respect for that place?</t477><t478>"</t478>
<t479>"It is a respect that I do not show to any place as long as I can avoid it."</t479><t480>"</t480>
<t481>"You have a house in the city, don't you?</t481><t482>"</t482>
<t483>Mr. Darcy nodded.</t483>
<t484>"Once upon a time, I also considered settling in the city – I am interested in high society; but I was not sure if the air of London would be good for Lady Lucas."</t484><t485>"</t485>
<t486>He paused in the hope of getting a response; but his friend was not inclined to reply; at that moment, seeing Elizabeth approaching them, he was seized with the idea of doing something bold and called out to her–</t486>
<t487>"Dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?</t487> <t488>–Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very suitable partner.</t488> <t489>With such beauty before you, I am sure you cannot refuse to dance." Just as he was about to take Elizabeth's hand and give it to the very surprised but not unwilling Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth quickly withdrew her hand and said to Sir William with some discomfort–</t489>
<t490>"Truly, sir, I have no intention of dancing.</t490> <t491>I kindly ask you not to think that I came here to look for a partner.</t491><t492>"</t492>
<t493>Mr. Darcy, with quite serious politeness, requested the honor of holding her hand, but in vain.</t493> <t494>Elizabeth was determined; Sir William also attempted to persuade her, but she did not change her mind.</t494>
<t495>"You dance wonderfully, Miss Eliza, it is cruelty to deprive us of the pleasure of watching you; although this gentleman does not enjoy entertainment, I am sure he would not object to indulging us for half an hour.</t495><t496>"</t496>
<t497>"Mr. Darcy is very kind," said Elizabeth, smiling.</t497>
<t498>"Of course it is; but when you look at the reason, dear Miss Eliza, you shouldn't be surprised at his kindness –who could object to such a spouse?</t498><t499>"</t499>
<t500>Elizabeth cast a fleeting glance and walked away.</t500> <t501>The resistance she showed had not diminished her value in Darcy's eyes; the young man was thinking of her with a certain pleasure when Miss Bingley appeared beside him–</t501>
<t502>"I can guess the subject of your dreams."</t502><t503>"</t503>
<t504>"I don't think so."</t504><t505>"</t505>
<t506>"You think it's impossible to spend so many evenings like this – with these people, I mean; I agree.</t506> <t507>I've never been so bored in my life!</t507> <t508>The soullessness and noise of all these people, their meaninglessness and airs of importance!</t508> <t509>I would give anything to hear your observations about them!</t509><t510>"</t510>
<t511>"You are mistaken in your guess.</t511> <t512>I had sweeter thoughts in mind.</t512> <t513>I was lost in thought about the immense pleasure that a pair of beautiful eyes on a lovely woman's face can bestow.</t513><t514>"</t514>
<t515>Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and asked him to tell her which lady had the honor of inspiring such thoughts.</t515> <t516>Mr. Darcy answered with great courage–</t516>
<t517>"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."</t517><t518>"</t518>
<t519>"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley.</t519> <t520>"I am very surprised.</t520> <t521>Since when has she been your favorite?</t521> <t522>–well, when shall I wish you happiness?</t522><t523>"</t523>
<t524>"This is exactly the question I was expecting you to ask.</t524> <t525>Women's imagination is very quick; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to marriage in an instant.</t525> <t526>I knew you would wish me happiness.</t526><t527>"</t527>
<t528>"Since you are so serious, I consider the matter settled.</t528> <t529>You will have a formidable mother-in-law, by the way; and of course, she will always stay with you at Pemberley.</t529><t530>"</t530>
<t531>While Miss Bingley preferred to amuse herself in this way, Mr. Darcy listened with complete indifference; seeing from his expression that there was no danger, the girl let her sarcastic wit run free.</t531>
<t532>Chapter VII</t532>
<t533>Mr. Bennet's entire estate consisted of a property yielding two thousand a year, and, to the misfortune of the daughters, this estate would go to a distant relative due to the absence of a male heir; their mother's income was more than sufficient for her living situation, but it was not enough to cover the household expenses.</t533> <t534>Mrs. Bennet's father had practiced law in Meryton and had left her four thousand pounds.</t534>
<t535>Mrs. Bennet had a sister who was married to a man named Mr. Philips; the man had been a clerk to their father and had taken over the business after his death. Mrs. Bennet also had a brother who was engaged in trade in a reputable area of London.</t535>
<t536>The village of Longbourn was only a mile away from Meryton; a very convenient distance for the young ladies who felt the urge to visit Meryton three or four times a week to fulfill their duties to their aunts and to stop by a milliner's shop that was right on the way.</t536> <t537>The family's two youngest daughters, Catherine and Lydia, felt this urge particularly often; their minds were more frivolous than their sisters', and when there was no better offer, a walk to Meryton was necessary to brighten the morning hours and provide material for evening conversation; although the region was generally poor in news, they would find a way to learn something from their aunts.</t537> <t538>In those days, the arrival of a new militia regiment in the area had, of course, given them plenty of news and happiness; the regiment would stay throughout the winter, and Meryton would be their headquarters.</t538>
<t539>The visit they paid to Mrs. Philips was now producing the most interesting intelligence.</t539> <t540>Every day, a new piece of information was added to their knowledge about the names and connections of the officers.</t540> <t541>The place where they stayed was no longer a secret; eventually, they even began to recognize the officers themselves.</t541> <t542>Mr. Philips visited all of them, which opened the doors to a source of happiness for his nieces that they had never experienced before.</t542> <t543>Now they talked about nothing but the officers; the great fortune of Mr. Bingley, which used to light up their mother's face whenever mentioned, now seemed worthless to them in the presence of military uniforms.</t543>
<t544>One morning, after listening to their heated discussions on the matter, Mr. Bennet made a cold observation–</t544>
<t545>"Judging by the way you speak, you must be the two dumbest girls in the province.</t545> <t546>I had been suspecting it for a while, but now I am sure.</t546><t547>"</t547>
<t548>Catherine was bored and did not respond; but Lydia, with all her indifference, continued to express her admiration for Captain Carter, even saying that she hoped to see him during the day as he was going to London the next morning.</t548>
<t549>"I am very surprised, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "how can you be so ready to call your own children stupid.</t549> <t550>Even if I were to belittle someone else's children, I would not touch my own.</t550><t551>"</t551>
<t552>"If my children are foolish, I always want to be aware of it.</t552><t553>"</t553>
<t554>"Yes –but you see, they are all very intelligent.</t554><t555>"</t555>
<t556>"I can proudly say that this is the only topic on which we disagree.</t556> <t557>I would have liked our views to align in every detail, but right now I disagree with you on the matter of our two youngest daughters being extraordinarily foolish.</t557><t558>"</t558>
<t559>"Dear Mr. Bennet, you can't expect these girls to think like their parents.</t559> <t560>When they reach our age, I'm sure they won't think about the officers any more than we do.</t560> <t561>I remember that I once liked a man in a red coat – in fact, I still do; if a bright young colonel earning five or six thousand a year wanted one of my daughters, I wouldn't say no; I think Colonel Forster looked very handsome in his uniform at Sir William's the other night.</t561><t562>"</t562>
<t563>"Anne," Lydia shouted, "my aunt said that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter don't visit the Miss Watsons as often as they used to; now she often sees them hanging out at Clarke's bookstore.</t563><t564>"</t564>
<t565>Before Mrs. Bennet could respond, a messenger came in and brought a letter for Miss Bennet; the letter was from Netherfield and the servant was waiting for a reply.</t565> <t566>Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with delight; she eagerly called out while her daughter read the letter–</t566>
<t567>"Come on Jane, who is it from?</t567> <t568>What's it about?</t568> <t569>What does it say?</t569> <t570>Come on Jane, hurry up, tell us, hurry up darling.</t570><t571>"</t571>
<t572>"From Miss Bingley," said Jane, and she read the letter aloud.</t572>
<t573>"Dear Friend, –</t573>
<t574>"If you do not show mercy and join Louisa and me for dinner tonight, we will be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, because when two women gossip all day, it inevitably ends in a fight.</t574> <t575>Come quickly upon receiving this letter.</t575> <t576>My brother and the gentlemen will have dinner with the officers.</t576> <t577>–Yours,</t577>
<t578>Caroline Bingley.</t578><t579>"</t579>
<t580>"With the officers!" Lydia exclaimed.</t580> <t581>"I wonder why my aunt didn't tell us about this.</t581><t582>"</t582>
<t583>"He is dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "this is a great misfortune.</t583><t584>"</t584>
<t585>"Can I take the car?" said Jane.</t585>
<t586>"No, my dear, it would be better if you go by horse, because it looks like it's going to rain; in that case, you would have to stay all night.</t586><t587>"</t587>
<t588>"It would be a good plan," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure they wouldn't try to send him back."</t588><t589>"</t589>
<t590>"Yes, but gentlemen go to Meryton with Mr. Bingley's carriage; the Hursts do not have their own horses.</t590><t591>"</t591>
<t592>"I prefer to go by car."</t592><t593>"</t593>
<t594>"But my dear, your father cannot separate the horses, I am sure.</t594> <t595>They are needed on the farm.</t595> <t596>Aren't they, Mr. Bennet?"</t596>
<t597>"We need them more on the farm."</t597><t598>"</t598>
<t599>"But if they are already there," said Elizabeth, "my mother's wish will have come true."</t599><t600>"</t600>
<t601>In the end, she managed to get confirmation from her father that the carriage horses were occupied; as a result, Jane had to go on horseback, and her mother, making cheerful predictions about the weather turning bad, saw her off to the door.</t601> <t602>Her wish came true; Jane had not been gone long when a heavy rain began.</t602> <t603>Her sisters worried about her, but her mother was pleased.</t603> <t604>The rain continued incessantly all evening; Jane certainly would not be able to return.</t604>
<t605>"I really thought this through, I swear!" said Mrs. Bennet, as if making it rain was her own skill.</t605> <t606>However, she only realized the happy result of her cunning the next morning.</t606> <t607>Just as breakfast was finishing, a servant from Netherfield brought Elizabeth this letter:-</t607>
<t608>"Dear Lizzy, –</t608>
<t609>This morning I feel very sick, probably because I got wet yesterday.</t609> <t610>My kind-hearted friends are not even mentioning going home until I get better.</t610> <t611>They are also insisting that I see Mr. Jones –so if you hear that he is looking after me, don't worry– it's just that my throat is swollen, my head hurts, and I don't have much else.</t611> <t612>– Love.</t612><t613>"</t613>
<t614>"Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth read the letter aloud, "if your daughter catches a dangerous illness and dies, knowing that she died following your orders to pursue Mr. Bingley will bring us all some comfort."</t614><t615>"</t615>
<t616>"Oh! My dear, don't die.</t616> <t617>No one dies from a little chill.</t617> <t618>They will take good care of him.</t618> <t619>As long as he stays there, everything will be fine.</t619> <t620>If I can get the car, I will go and see him.</t620><t621>"</t621>
<t622>Elizabeth, who was genuinely worried, decided to go and see him, but the car was not available; since she didn't know how to ride a horse, her only option was to walk.</t622> <t623>She announced her decision.</t623>
<t624>"How can you be so stupid," shouted his mother, "is this the kind of work you undertake in this mud!</t624> <t625>When you get to where you're going, you won't be fit to be seen in public.</t625><t626>"</t626>
<t627>"I will be in a state to see Jane – that's all I want."</t627><t628>"</t628>
<t629>"Are you trying to make me listen to nonsense, Lizzy," said her father, "so that I can call for the horses?</t629><t630>"</t630>
<t631>"Not at all.</t631> <t632>I don't complain about walking.</t632> <t633>When a person wants something, the distance doesn't matter; it's only three miles.</t633> <t634>I'll be back for dinner.</t634><t635>"</t635>
<t636>"I admire the energy in your kindness," observed Mary, "but every emotional reaction must be subjected to the test of reason; in my opinion, the reaction shown should be proportional to the need felt."</t636><t637>"</t637>
<t638>"We'll come with you as far as Meryton," said Catherine and Lydia.</t638> <t639>Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.</t639>
<t640>"If we hurry," said Lydia, as they walked, "maybe we can see Captain Carter for a little bit before he leaves.</t640><t641>"</t641>
<t642>They parted ways in Meryton; the younger ones headed to the house of one of the officers' wives, while Elizabeth continued to walk alone, crossing fields with quick steps, leaping over wall steps with impatient energy, and jumping over puddles; finally, with tired ankles, dirty socks, and a face burning from the warmth of the exertion, she found herself in front of the house.</t642>
<t643>They took her to the breakfast room; everyone was there except Jane; her arrival caused a great surprise.</t643> <t644>That she had walked three miles so early, in such bad weather, and alone seemed almost unbelievable to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; Elizabeth felt that they looked down on her for it.</t644> <t645>–Yet they greeted her very politely; their brothers' behavior was better than politeness: there was goodwill and kindness.</t645> <t646>–Mr. Darcy spoke very little, Mr. Hurst did not speak at all.</t646> <t647>Mr. Darcy was torn between admiring the brightness the walk had given her face and doubting whether the situation warranted her coming alone from so far away.</t647> <t648>Mr. Hurst was only thinking about his breakfast.</t648>
<t649>The answers she received to her questions about her sister were not encouraging.</t649> <t650>Miss Bennet had not slept well; she was up but had a high fever and was not well enough to leave her room.</t650> <t651>Elizabeth was pleased to be taken to her immediately; Jane, who had not expressed in her letter how much she wanted such a visit because she was afraid of alarming or disturbing her family, was delighted to see her.</t651> <t652>However, she was not in much of a state to talk, and when Miss Bingley left them alone, she could say little more than to express her gratitude for the extraordinary kindness they had shown her.</t652> <t653>Elizabeth listened to her quietly.</t653>
<t654>When breakfast was over, the sisters joined them; seeing how much interest and affection they showed Jane, Elizabeth began to like them.</t654> <t655>The apothecary arrived; after examining his patient, he said, as expected, that she had caught a severe cold and that they needed to make an effort to overcome it. He advised her to return to bed and promised her some syrup.</t655> <t656>The advice was immediately followed, as her fever was rising and her head was aching severely.</t656> <t657>Elizabeth did not leave her side for a moment; the other ladies also did not leave her side much: since the gentlemen were outside, they honestly had nothing else to do elsewhere.</t657>
<t658>When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt she had to leave and reluctantly said so.</t658> <t659>When Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, a little insistence was enough for her to accept, but as Jane was reluctant to part from her at that moment, Miss Bingley had to turn the carriage offer into an invitation to stay at Netherfield for the time being.</t659> <t660>Elizabeth accepted gratefully; a servant was sent to Longbourn to inform the family of her stay and to bring back some spare clothes.</t660>
<t661>Chapter VIII</t661>
<t662>At five o'clock, the two ladies withdrew to dress; at half-past six, Elizabeth was called to dinner.</t662> <t663>To the polite inquiries that then ensued, among which she could discern with pleasure Mr. Bingley's much closer interest, she could not give a satisfactory answer.</t663> <t664>There was no improvement in Jane.</t664> <t665>Upon hearing this, the sisters repeatedly expressed how sorry they were, how distressing a severe cold could be, and how much they personally hated being ill, then they forgot about the matter: their indifference to Jane when she was out of sight led Elizabeth to feel her initial displeasure with them once again.</t665>
<t666>Her brothers, on the other hand, were the only members of the group who could be thought of with any warmth.</t666> <t667>His concern for Jane was evident, his attention to herself was gratifying, and these prevented her from feeling like an unwelcome guest as others seemed to see her.</t667> <t668>No one else paid much attention to her.</t668> <t669>Miss Bingley was captivated by Mr. Darcy, as was her sister; as for Mr. Hurst, who was sitting next to Elizabeth, he was a lazy man who lived only for eating, drinking, and playing cards; upon learning that Elizabeth preferred a plain dish to a French ragout, he never spoke to her again.</t669>
<t670>When the meal was over, he went straight back to Jane, and as soon as he left the room, Miss Bingley started to badmouth him.</t670> <t671>She said his behavior was truly awful, a mix of pride and rudeness, and that his conversation was unbearable, lacking style, taste, and charm.</t671> <t672>Mrs. Hurst agreed and immediately added-</t672>
<t673>"In short, the girl has nothing to her name, except for being an amazing walker.</t673> <t674>I will never forget her state this morning.</t674> <t675>What wildness that was.</t675><t676>"</t676>
<t677>"Exactly, Louisa."</t677> <t678>"I barely held myself back."</t678> <t679>"What do you mean by coming here, for heaven's sake!"</t679> <t680>"What does it mean to run around the mountains and fields just because his brother caught a cold?"</t680> <t681>"And his hair, how messy, how frizzy!"</t681>
<t682>"Yeah, especially her skirt; I hope you've seen her skirt, it's definitely covered in a handspan of mud; and she's let her dress hang down, thinking it will cover the mud."</t682><t683>"</t683>
<t684>"The picture you painted might be accurate, Louisa," said Bingley; "but these details have escaped my notice.</t684> <t685>This morning, when she entered the room, Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked very beautiful.</t685> <t686>I did not notice her dirty skirt at all.</t686><t687>"</t687>
<t688>"But you must have seen it, Darcy, I'm sure," said Miss Bingley; "you wouldn't like to see your own sister in such a spectacle, would you?</t688><t689>"</t689>
<t690>"Of course, he wouldn't go."</t690><t691>"</t691>
<t692>"Walk three miles, four miles, five miles, however many miles it is, sink into the mud up to your ankles, and do it all alone, by yourself! What could he mean by this?</t692> <t693>In my opinion, it’s a lowly kind of self-will, the finest example of peasant uncouthness.</t693><t694>"</t694>
<t695>"It shows his love for his sister; quite a nice thing," said Bingley.</t695>
<t696>"I'm afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half-whisper, "this adventure has altered your admiration for her beautiful eyes.</t696><t697>"</t697>
<t698>"Not at all," replied Darcy; "her eyes were sparkling from the walk.</t698><t699>"</t699> <t700>This conversation was followed by a brief silence, and Mrs. Hurst began again–</t700>
<t701>"I have great respect for Jane Bennet, she is indeed a very sweet girl; I wholeheartedly wish for her to marry well.</t701> <t702>But with such parents, such lowly relatives, I fear she doesn't have much of a chance.</t702><t703>"</t703>
<t704>"You must have heard, their brother-in-law is a lawyer in Meryton."</t704><t705>"</t705>
<t706>"Yes, they also have an uncle who lives somewhere near Cheapside.</t706><t707>"</t707>
<t708>"This is amazing," added his sister; they laughed together.</t708>
<t709>"If they had uncles enough to fill all of Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less charming."</t709><t710>"</t710>
<t711>"But it greatly reduces her chances of marrying men of any consideration," answered Darcy.</t711>
<t712>Bingley did not reply to this remark; but his sisters wholeheartedly approved and continued to amuse themselves for a while longer by making fun of their dear friend's uncouth relatives.</t712>
<t713>Nevertheless, soon they felt a wave of affection and, after leaving the dining room, they went to her room and sat with her until they were called for coffee.</t713> <t714>She was still very ill; Elizabeth did not leave her side until she saw her asleep and felt relieved; although she did not feel like going downstairs, it would be appropriate for her to do so.</t714> <t715>When she entered the sitting room, she found the whole group playing loo[1] and was immediately invited to join them; but when she suspected they were playing for high stakes, she declined the invitation, using her sister as an excuse, and said she would occupy herself with reading a book and could stay downstairs only briefly.</t715> <t716>Mr. Hurst looked at her in astonishment.</t716>
<t717>"Do you prefer reading to gambling?" he said; "very strange.</t717><t718>"</t718>
<t719>"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises gambling.</t719> <t720>She is a great reader and takes pleasure in nothing else.</t720><t721>"</t721>
<t722>"I deserve neither such praise nor such condemnation," cried Elizabeth; "I am not a great reader, and I take pleasure in many things.</t722><t723>"</t723>
<t724>"I am sure you take pleasure in looking after your sister," said Bingley; "I hope you will take even more pleasure when you see that she has recovered soon."</t724><t725>"</t725>
<t726>Elizabeth thanked him sincerely, then went to a table with a few books on it.</t726> <t727>Bingley immediately offered to bring her more books – whatever was in his library.</t727>
<t728>"I wish my collection were broader for your benefit and my own good; but I am an idle man, and although I do not have many books, I have more books than I have read.</t728><t729>"</t729>
<t730>Elizabeth said she could easily make do with what was in the room.</t730>
<t731>"I am surprised," said Miss Bingley, "that my father left so few books."</t731> <t732>"You have such a lovely library at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"</t732>
<t733>"It must be good," Mr. Darcy replied; "the work of many generations.</t733><t734>"</t734>
<t735>"But you yourself have added a lot; you are always buying books."</t735><t736>"</t736>
<t737>"I can't understand neglecting the family library at such a time.</t737><t738>"</t738>
<t739>"Neglect!</t739> <t740>I don't think you would neglect anything that would add to the beauty of that noble place.</t740> <t741>Charles, when you build your own house, I hope it will be half as magnificent as Pemberley.</t741><t742>"</t742>
<t743>"I hope it happens.</t743><t744>"</t744>
<t745>"But I really recommend you to buy your land in that area, let Pemberley be your model.</t745> <t746>There is no place more pleasant than Derbyshire in England.</t746><t747>"</t747>
<t748>"Gladly; if Darcy sells it, I will buy Pemberley."</t748><t749>"</t749>
<t750>"I'm talking about possibilities, Charles.</t750><t751>"</t751>
<t752>"Believe me, Caroline, I think it is more feasible to own Pemberley by purchasing it than by imitating it.</t752><t753>"</t753>
<t754>The conversation intrigued Elizabeth so much that she couldn't focus on her book; soon she put the book aside entirely, moved closer to the table to watch the game, and placed herself between Mr. Bingley and her eldest sister.</t754>
<t755>"Has Miss Darcy grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "Is she as tall as I am?</t755><t756>"</t756>
<t757>"It might work.</t757> <t758>Now, she is about the height of Miss Elizabeth Bennet, or maybe a bit taller.</t758><t759>"</t759>
<t760>"How much I would like to see her again!</t760> <t761>I haven't met anyone who made me so happy.</t761> <t762>Such a face, such grace!</t762> <t763>Extremely skillful for her age, moreover!</t763> <t764>Her piano playing is extraordinary.</t764><t765>"</t765>
<t766>"I don't understand how young ladies find the patience to be so skillful, and all of them at that," said Bingley.</t766>
<t767>"All young ladies are skillful!</t767> <t768>Dear Charles, what do you mean?</t768><t769>"</t769>
<t770>"Yes, all of them, I suppose.</t770> <t771>They paint, embroider, and knit bags.</t771> <t772>I have hardly ever met anyone who cannot do all these things; I am sure I have never heard a young lady mentioned without first being told how skillful she is.</t772><t773>"</t773>
<t774>"The skills you mentioned are indeed common," said Darcy, "very true.</t774> <t775>This word is also used for women who do not deserve it beyond sewing and embroidery.</t775> <t776>But I am far from accepting your general assessment of ladies.</t776> <t777>I cannot boast of having known more than half a dozen truly skilled ladies among all my acquaintances.</t777><t778>"</t778>
<t779>"I am sure I feel the same way," said Miss Bingley.</t779>
<t780>"In that case," observed Elizabeth, "your idea of an accomplished woman must be very comprehensive.</t780><t781>"</t781>
<t782>"Yes, it is really comprehensive."</t782><t783>"</t783>
<t784>"Ah! Of course," cried the loyal supporter, "no one can truly be considered skillful unless they have far surpassed the ordinary things encountered.</t784> <t785>A woman must be well-versed in music, singing, painting, and modern languages to deserve that word; moreover, there must be a certain something in her manner of walking, her air, the tone of her voice, her speech, her expressions, otherwise that word would seem out of place.</t785><t786>"</t786>
<t787>"She must possess all this," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading."</t787><t788>"</t788>
<t789>"I am no longer surprised that you have only known six skillful women.</t789> <t790>I would be surprised if you knew even one.</t790><t791>"</t791>
<t792>"Are you so cruel as to doubt that this is possible for your fellow beings?</t792><t793>"</t793>
<t794>"I have never seen a woman like this.</t794> <t795>I have never seen such a combination of capacity, taste, practice, and elegance as you described.</t795><t796>"</t796>
<t797>Miss Hurst and Miss Bingley reacted strongly to the injustice of the suspicion they harbored; they continued to argue by saying that they knew many women who fit this description, until Mr. Hurst bitterly complained that they were not paying attention to the game in front of them and brought them back in line.</t797> <t798>Since all conversation ended at that moment, Elizabeth immediately left the room afterward.</t798>
<t799>"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door had closed behind her, "is one of those women who disparage their own sex to appeal to the opposite sex; I suppose this works with many men.</t799> <t800>But in my opinion, it is a low method, very vulgar.</t800><t801>"</t801>
<t802>"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, as these words were essentially addressed to him, "there is vulgarity in all the methods that ladies sometimes use to attract attention.</t802> <t803>Everything close to cunning is simplicity.</t803><t804>"</t804>
<t805>Miss Bingley was not satisfied enough with this remark to continue the subject.</t805>
<t806>Elizabeth returned to them only to say that her sister was getting worse and that she couldn't leave her side.</t806> <t807>Bingley insisted on calling Mr. Jones immediately; his sisters, thinking that provincial knowledge would be useless, suggested sending for one of the leading doctors from the city.</t807> <t808>Elizabeth did not entertain this idea; but she did not want to refuse Bingley's offer; it was decided that if there was no noticeable improvement in Miss Bennet, Mr. Jones would be called early in the morning.</t808> <t809>Bingley was quite distressed; his sisters also said they were devastated.</t809> <t810>But they alleviated their sorrow with duets after dinner; Bingley, on the other hand, found the only way to ease his mind was to instruct the steward to show every possible care to the sick lady and her sister.</t810>
<t811>Chapter IX</t811>
<t812>Elizabeth spent most of the night in her sister's room and took delight in giving a comforting answer to the questions Mr. Bingley had asked through his servant early in the morning, and a little later, to the two elegant ladies who visited her sister.</t812> <t813>Despite this improvement, she still requested that a letter be sent to Longbourn, asking her mother to come see Jane and assess her condition with her own eyes.</t813> <t814>The letter was sent immediately and was responded to with the same speed.</t814> <t815>Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest daughters, arrived at Netherfield shortly after the family breakfast.</t815>
<t816>If Mrs. Bennet found Jane's condition dangerous, she would have been devastated; but upon seeing that her illness was not frightening and feeling relieved, she no longer wished for her to recover quickly, as regaining her health would likely take her away from Netherfield.</t816> <t817>Therefore, she paid no attention to her daughter's wish to be taken home; the pharmacist who arrived at the same time also found this unwise.</t817> <t818>After sitting with Jane for a while, upon Miss Bingley's personal invitation, the mother and her three daughters all followed her to the breakfast room.</t818> <t819>Bingley greeted them by saying that he hoped Mrs. Bennet did not find Miss Bennet worse than she had expected.</t819>
<t820>"Actually, I found it, sir," was the woman's reply.</t820> <t821>"He is too sick to move.</t821> <t822>Mr. Jones said don't move him.</t822> <t823>We have to rely on your kindness a little longer.</t823><t824>"</t824>
<t825>"Take her away!" cried Bingley.</t825> <t826>"Don't even think about it.</t826> <t827>My sister, I'm sure, would never agree to her leaving.</t827><t828>"</t828>
<t829>"Rest assured, madam," said Miss Bingley with cold politeness, "Miss Bennet will receive every care while she stays with us."</t829><t830>"</t830>
<t831>Mrs. Bennet thanked profusely.</t831>
<t832>"I'm sure," she added, "if she didn't have such good friends, I don't know what would become of her, because she is really very ill and in great pain, but she is the most patient person in the world, she always is, because, without exception, she is the most good-natured girl I know.</t832> <t833>I often tell my other daughters that she is unique.</t833> <t834>You have a very lovely room, Mr. Bingley, and the view over that gravel path is wonderful.</t834> <t835>I don't know of any place around here that compares to Netherfield.</t835> <t836>I hope you won't leave here quickly, even though you've rented it for a short time.</t836><t837>"</t837>
<t838>"Whatever I do, I do quickly," replied Bingley; "so if I decide to leave Netherfield, I will probably be gone within five minutes.</t838> <t839>But for now, I feel quite settled here."</t839><t840>"</t840>
<t841>"I would have expected this from you," said Elizabeth.</t841>
<t842>"You are beginning to know me, aren't you?" cried Bingley, turning towards her.</t842>
<t843>"Ah yes! –I understand you very well.</t843><t844>"</t844>
<t845>"I wish I could see this as a compliment; but being understood this easily, I'm afraid, is a pitiable thing.</t845><t846>"</t846>
<t847>"There is no rule for this.</t847> <t848>A deep, complex character doesn't necessarily mean it will be more or less respectable than yours.</t848><t849>"</t849>
<t850>"Lizzy," cried her mother, "do not forget where you are; at least do not continue the wild manners we tolerate at home here.</t850><t851>"</t851>
<t852>"I didn't know you studied character," Bingley immediately continued.</t852> <t853>"It must be an amusing study.</t853><t854>"</t854>
<t855>"Yes, but complex characters are the most fun.</t855> <t856>At least they serve this purpose.</t856><t857>"</t857>
<t858>"The countryside," said Darcy, "can offer very few subjects for such an examination.</t858> <t859>In the rural environment, you live within a very limited and monotonous society.</t859><t860>"</t860>
<t861>"But people themselves change so much that there is always something new to observe in them."</t861><t862>"</t862>
<t863>"Yes, of course," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by the way the provincial environment was mentioned.</t863> <t864>"I assure you that there are as many events in the countryside as there are in the city.</t864><t865>"</t865>
<t866>Everyone was surprised; Darcy looked at her for a moment and then silently turned away.</t866> <t867>Believing she had achieved absolute victory over him, Mrs. Bennet continued her triumph.</t867>
<t868>"For my part, I do not think London is superior to the countryside, except for the shops and public places.</t868> <t869>The countryside is much more charming, isn't it, Mr. Bingley?</t869><t870>"</t870>
<t871>"When I am in the countryside," replied Bingley, "I never want to leave; but the same thing happens when I am in the city.</t871> <t872>Both have their advantages; I can be equally happy in both.</t872><t873>"</t873>
<t874>"Yes –because your approach is correct.</t874> <t875>But this gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seems to think that the countryside is insignificant.</t875><t876>"</t876>
<t877>"You are truly mistaken, mother," said Elizabeth, blushing on behalf of her mother.</t877> <t878>"You misunderstood Mr. Darcy.</t878> <t879>He only meant that there isn't as much variety of people in the countryside as there is in the city, which you must admit is true.</t879><t880>"</t880>
<t881>"Naturally, darling, no one said there was anyone here; but if you say you don't encounter many people in this neighborhood, I would say there are few neighborhoods larger than this one.</t881> <t882>I remember having dinner with twenty-four families.</t882><t883>"</t883>
<t884>Bingley would not have been able to control his expression if he were not worried about Elizabeth.</t884> <t885>His sister was less kind and turned her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very meaningful smile.</t885> <t886>Elizabeth asked if Charlotte Lucas had come to Longbourn while she was away to change her mother's thoughts.</t886>
<t887>"Yes, he stopped by with his father yesterday.</t887> <t888>What a charming man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley – isn't he?</t888> <t889>What a cultured man!</t889> <t890>So polite, so at ease!</t890> <t891>–He always has something to say to everyone.</t891> <t892>–This is what I call good upbringing; those who think they are very important and never open their mouths misunderstand the matter.</t892><t893>"</t893>
<t894>"Did Charlotte stay for dinner?"</t894><t895>"</t895>
<t896>"No, she went home.</t896> <t897>Probably needed to make an apple pie.</t897> <t898>For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always employ servants who can do their own work; my daughters were raised differently.</t898> <t899>But of course, everyone knows their own business; the Lucases are very good girls, I assure you.</t899> <t900>It's a pity they're not beautiful!</t900> <t901>Not that I find Charlotte very plain – but well, she is our dear friend.</t901><t902>"</t902>
<t903>"She seems like a very nice young lady," said Bingley.</t903>
<t904>"Yes, indeed; –but it must be admitted that it is very ordinary.</t904> <t905>Lady Lucas herself has often said so and envied me for Jane's beauty.</t905> <t906>I don't want to boast about my own child, but truly Jane –one can hardly see anyone more beautiful.</t906> <t907>Everyone says so.</t907> <t908>I'm not saying this just because she's my daughter.</t908> <t909>She was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in the city who was so in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would propose before we left.</t909> <t910>He didn't, however.</t910> <t911>Maybe he found her too young.</t911> <t912>However, he wrote her poems, and they were indeed beautiful poems.</t912><t913>"</t913>
<t914>"Thus, he exhausted his love," said Elizabeth, impatiently.</t914> <t915>"There have been many who have succumbed in the same way.</t915> <t916>I truly wonder who first discovered the ability of poetry to destroy love!</t916><t917>"</t917>
<t918>"I always thought of poetry as the nourishment of love," said Darcy.</t918>
<t919>"It may be true for a healthy, strong, good love.</t919> <t920>Anything is good for something that is already strong.</t920> <t921>But if it is a weak, feeble inclination, a sweet sonnet will starve it to death.</t921><t922>"</t922>
<t923>Darcy merely smiled; the ensuing general silence made Elizabeth uneasy, fearing her mother would embarrass herself again.</t923> <t924>She wanted to speak but couldn't think of anything; after a brief silence, Mrs. Bennet began thanking Mr. Bingley again for his care of Jane, adding an apology for burdening him with Lizzy as well.</t924> <t925>Mr. Bingley responded with measured politeness, compelling his sister to be courteous and to speak as the situation required.</t925> <t926>His sister did her part without being overly generous, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied and soon ordered her carriage.</t926> <t927>At this signal, the youngest daughter stepped forward.</t927> <t928>Throughout the visit, the two girls had been whispering to each other and had concluded that the youngest would remind Mr. Bingley of his promise to hold a ball at Netherfield upon his first arrival in the countryside.</t928>
<t929>Lydia was fifteen years old, a robust and well-developed girl; she had fair skin and a cheerful face; she was her mother's favorite; her mother's affection had brought her into society at a young age.</t929> <t930>She had an enthusiastic spirit and a natural ability to assert herself, which had turned into confidence by attracting the attention of officers thanks to her uncle's dinners and her own relaxed demeanor.</t930> <t931>Therefore, she was quite convincing when she addressed Mr. Bingley about the ball, reminded him of his promise with frankness, and even added that it would be the most embarrassing thing in the world if he did not keep his word.</t931> <t932>Bingley's response to this sudden attack delighted her mother–</t932>
<t933>"I am ready with everything I have to fulfill my promise; when your sister gets better, you can choose the day of the ball if you wish.</t933> <t934>But you wouldn't want to dance while she is lying sick.</t934><t935>"</t935>
<t936>Lydia said that she got the answer she wanted.</t936> <t937>"Oh yes – it is better to wait until Jane gets better; by then Captain Carter will have returned to Meryton.</t937> <t938>After you give your own ball," she added, "I will insist that they give a ball as well.</t938> <t939>I will say it would be a great shame if they don't give it to Colonel Forster.</t939><t940>"</t940>
<t941>Then Mrs. Bennet and her daughters left; Elizabeth immediately returned to Jane, leaving her own and her family's behavior to be commented on by the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; however, despite all of Miss Bingley's pointed jokes about fine eyes, Mr. Darcy could not be persuaded to join in their disparagement.</t941>
<t942>Chapter X</t942>
<t943>That day passed almost like the previous one.</t943> <t944>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley spent a few hours of the morning beside the patient, who continued to recover slowly; in the evening, Elizabeth joined their gathering in the sitting room.</t944> <t945>This time, the loo table was not brought out.</t945> <t946>Mr. Darcy was writing; Miss Bingley, who was sitting next to him, was observing the progress of his letter and frequently distracted him by sending messages to her sister.</t946> <t947>Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were playing piquet; Mrs. Hurst was watching the game.</t947>
<t948>Elizabeth took up her embroidery; she listened in on what was happening between Darcy and his friend and amused herself quite a bit.</t948> <t949>The girl's constant comments on either the handwriting, the neatness of the lines, or the length of the letter, combined with the absolute indifference with which her praises were met, created a strange dialogue that perfectly matched Elizabeth's opinions of the two.</t949>
<t950>"Receiving such a letter will make Miss Darcy so happy!</t950><t951>"</t951>
<t952>The man did not respond.</t952>
<t953>"You are typing extraordinarily fast."</t953><t954>"</t954>
<t955>"You are mistaken.</t955> <t956>I am writing slowly.</t956><t957>"</t957>
<t958>"You must have to write so many letters throughout the year!</t958> <t959>Of course, there are business letters too!</t959> <t960>Who knows how disgusting they can be!</t960><t961>"</t961>
<t962>"It seems you are lucky that the task of writing a business letter has fallen to me."</t962><t963>"</t963>
<t964>"Please tell your brother, I really want to see him."</t964><t965>"</t965>
<t966>"I already told you once, as per your request.</t966><t967>"</t967>
<t968>"I'm afraid you didn't like your pen.</t968> <t969>Let me sharpen it for you.</t969> <t970>I am very good at sharpening pen tips.</t970><t971>"</t971>
<t972>"Thank you – I always open it myself.</t972><t973>"</t973>
<t974>"How do you manage to write so neatly?"</t974><t975>"</t975>
<t976>No answer.</t976>
<t977>"Tell your brother that I am glad he is progressing with playing the harp; and please also tell him that I admired his beautiful table drawing, I think it is far superior to Miss Grantley's."</t977><t978>"</t978>
<t979>"Would you allow me to postpone expressing my admiration to the next letter?</t979> <t980>I don't have much space left now.</t980><t981>"</t981>
<t982>"Oh, it's not important.</t982> <t983>Anyway, I will see him in January.</t983> <t984>But do you always write such nice long letters to him, Mr. Darcy?"</t984>
<t985>"They are usually long; but whether they are always beautiful or not, it's not for me to decide."</t985><t986>"</t986>
<t987>"I think the rule is, someone who can comfortably write a long letter cannot write poorly.</t987><t988>"</t988>
<t989>"That is not a compliment for Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother – "because he does not write comfortably.</t989> <t990>He searches long and hard for a four-syllable word.</t990> <t991>Isn't that right, Darcy?"</t991>
<t992>"My writing style is very different from yours.</t992><t993>"</t993>
<t994>"Oo!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless manner imaginable.</t994> <t995>He forgets half the words and smudges the rest with ink.</t995><t996>"</t996>
<t997>"My thoughts flow so quickly that I can't find the time to express them – that's why sometimes readers can't make sense of my letters.</t997><t998>"</t998>
<t999>"You are so humble, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "that one cannot even think of finding fault with you.</t999><t1000>"</t1000>
<t1001>"Nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility," said Darcy.</t1001> <t1002>"It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."</t1002><t1003>"</t1003>
<t1004>"So, which one do you think is my latest example of modesty?</t1004><t1005>"</t1005>
<t1006>"Indirect boasting, because you are actually proud of the flaws in your writing, thinking they come from the speed of thought and the carelessness of execution, which, if not admirable, is at least quite interesting to you.</t1006> <t1007>The ability to do something quickly is always greatly appreciated by the person doing it, and the flaws in the work are hardly noticed.</t1007> <t1008>This morning, when you told Mrs. Bennet that if you decided to leave Netherfield, you would do so within five minutes, you said it as a kind of boast, like a compliment – whereas what is there to applaud in a hastiness that will leave many important tasks unfinished and be of no benefit to yourself or anyone else?</t1008><t1009>"</t1009>
<t1010>"Wow," cried Bingley, "this is too much, remembering all the foolish things said in the morning by the evening.</t1010> <t1011>Honestly, I still believed that what I said about myself was true, and I still do.</t1011> <t1012>At least I didn't pretend to be unnecessarily hasty just to show off to the ladies.</t1012><t1013>"</t1013>
<t1014>"You clearly believed in it, but I did not believe it would go that fast.</t1014> <t1015>Your behavior would be as dependent on chance as anyone I know; just as you were about to mount your horse, if a friend came up and said, 'Bingley, it would be good if you stayed until next week,' you would probably stay, you probably wouldn't go – if necessary, you would stay for a month.</t1015><t1016>"</t1016>
<t1017>"With this," cried Elizabeth, "you have proven that Mr. Bingley has not done justice to his own nature.</t1017> <t1018>You have described him more thoroughly than he did himself.</t1018><t1019>"</t1019>
<t1020>"I am grateful," said Bingley, "that you have turned my friend's words into a compliment about my good nature.</t1020> <t1021>But I fear you are giving his words a meaning that this gentleman did not intend; because in such a situation, if I were to say no and ride off on a horse, he would like me even more.</t1021><t1022>"</t1022>
<t1023>"Then does Mr. Darcy think that you balance the thoughtlessness of your initial intention with your stubbornness in sticking to it?</t1023><t1024>"</t1024>
<t1025>"Well, I can't say for sure; let Darcy speak for himself."</t1025><t1026>"</t1026>
<t1027>"You expect me to explain views that you claim are mine but that I have not expressed."</t1027> <t1028>"But if we approach the matter as you have presented it, Miss Bennet, remember that the friend who wished for her to return home and delay the plan merely wished for it, without providing any justification."</t1028><t1029>"</t1029>
<t1030>"Being easily –readily– convinced by a friend is not a virtue according to you.</t1030><t1031>"</t1031>
<t1032>"Being convinced without believing is not considered a compliment to the mind.</t1032><t1033>"</t1033>
<t1034>"It seems to me, Mr. Darcy, that you do not allow for the influence of friendship and affection.</t1034> <t1035>The importance given to the person making the request often makes one accept that request immediately, without waiting for reasons to think it over.</t1035> <t1036>I am not exactly talking about a situation like the one you gave as an example for Mr. Bingley.</t1036> <t1037>Perhaps we should wait until such a situation arises before discussing what his behavior would be in that situation.</t1037> <t1038>But generally and normally, between two friends, if one asks the other to change a decision that is not very crucial, would you look down on that person for complying with the request without thinking it over?</t1038><t1039>"</t1039>
<t1040>"Wouldn't it be better to clarify the importance of this request and the degree of closeness between the parties before continuing with this topic?</t1040><t1041>"</t1041>
<t1042>"Absolutely," cried Bingley, "let's learn all the details, and don't forget their height and weight; because, Miss Bennet, this will play a bigger role in the discussion than you think.</t1042> <t1043>I assure you that if Darcy were not such a tall man compared to me, I would not show him half as much respect.</t1043> <t1044>In certain situations and certain places, especially in his own home, for instance when he has nothing to do on a Sunday evening, I would say there is nothing more dreadful than Darcy.</t1044><t1045>"</t1045>
<t1046>Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth felt as if he was a bit offended and held herself back, not laughing.</t1046> <t1047>Miss Bingley responded affectionately to the slight Darcy had endured by accusing her brother of talking nonsense.</t1047>
<t1048>"I understand your purpose, Bingley," said his friend.</t1048> <t1049>"You don't like arguments and you want to end this one.</t1049><t1050>"</t1050>
<t1051>"Maybe.</t1051> <t1052>There is no difference between an argument and a fight.</t1052> <t1053>I would be grateful if you and Miss Bennet could postpone your argument until I leave the room; then you can say whatever you want about me.</t1053><t1054>"</t1054>
<t1055>"What you want," said Elizabeth, "would not be a great sacrifice on my part; it would be much better if Mr. Darcy finished his letter as well."</t1055><t1056>"</t1056>
<t1057>Mr. Darcy followed this advice and finished his letter.</t1057>
<t1058>When the letter was finished, he turned to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for a bit of musical enjoyment.</t1058> <t1059>Miss Bingley, as if she had been ready since yesterday, went to the piano and, after politely asking Elizabeth to start and Elizabeth declining the request with the same politeness but even greater enthusiasm, sat down at the piano.</t1059>
<t1060>Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; while they were occupied with this, Elizabeth noticed that Mr. Darcy's eyes frequently fell upon her as she was browsing through the music books on the piano.</t1060> <t1061>She found it hard to believe that she could be an object of admiration for such a great man; on the other hand, it made no sense for him to look at her since he did not like her.</t1061> <t1062>Finally, she thought that, in his understanding, she must have something more wrong and reprehensible than the other people present, which caught his attention.</t1062> <t1063>This thought did not upset her.</t1063> <t1064>She cared so little for Darcy that she would not worry about his approval.</t1064>
<t1065>After playing a few Italian songs, Miss Bingley changed the atmosphere with a lively Scottish tune; immediately afterward, Mr. Darcy approached Elizabeth and said-</t1065>
<t1066>"Don't you feel a great desire to take advantage of such an opportunity for a Scottish dance, Miss Bennet?</t1066><t1067>"</t1067>
<t1068>Elizabeth smiled, but did not answer.</t1068> <t1069>Darcy repeated the question, surprised by Elizabeth's silence.</t1069>
<t1070>"I heard," she said, "but I couldn't immediately decide what to say.</t1070> <t1071>I know, you wanted me to say yes to enjoy the pleasure of belittling my taste; but I love to upset such plans and take away the chance of expected belittlement.</t1071> <t1072>Therefore, I decided, I don't want to dance – now, if you dare, belittle me.</t1072><t1073>"</t1073>
<t1074>"It's really not my place.</t1074><t1075>"</t1075>
<t1076>Elizabeth had hoped to upset him, but she admired the maturity he showed; although there was a mixture of sweetness and mischief in Elizabeth's behavior that made it difficult to upset people; and no woman had ever captivated Darcy like she did.</t1076> <t1077>If her relatives were not from the lower class, Darcy felt he would find himself in serious danger.</t1077>
<t1078>The things she saw or suspected were enough to make Miss Bingley jealous; her great concern for her dear friend Jane's health was further intensified by her desire to get rid of Elizabeth.</t1078>
<t1079>By talking about the expected marriage and depicting the happiness such a union would bring to Darcy, he often tried to provoke Darcy to become disinterested in his guest.</t1079>
<t1080>"I hope," he said, as they walked through the heath the next day, "you give your mother-in-law a few hints so that when this long-awaited event happens, she understands the benefit of holding her tongue; and, if you can manage, save the little girls from the obsession of chasing after officers.</t1080> <t1081>–And, if you allow me to speak on such a delicate matter, try to control that little issue, that arrogance and impertinence, which your wife has a bit of.</t1081><t1082>"</t1082>
<t1083>"Do you have any other suggestions for my family happiness?</t1083><t1084>"</t1084>
<t1085>"Ah yes! –Hang the portraits of your Uncle Philips and Aunt in the gallery at Pemberley.</t1085> <t1086>Hang the portrait of your great-uncle the judge next to them.</t1086> <t1087>After all, they are in the same profession, just in different lines.</t1087> <t1088>As for the portrait of your Elizabeth, you shouldn't attempt that because which artist could do justice to those beautiful eyes?</t1088><t1089>"</t1089>
<t1090>"Capturing the expression in those eyes is truly not easy, but the colors, shapes, and eyelashes are so beautiful that they can be copied.</t1090><t1091>"</t1091>
<t1092>At that moment, they encountered Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth coming from another path.</t1092>
<t1093>"I didn't know you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, confused, wondering if their conversation had been overheard.</t1093>
<t1094>"You deceived us badly," replied Mrs. Hurst, "you ran away without saying you were leaving."</t1094><t1095>"</t1095>
<t1096>Then, taking Mr. Darcy's freed arm, he left Elizabeth to walk on her own.</t1096> <t1097>The path only accommodated three people.</t1097> <t1098>Mr. Darcy sensed their rudeness and immediately intervened–</t1098>
<t1099>"This road is narrow.</t1099> <t1100>Let's switch to the wide road.</t1100><t1101>"</t1101>
<t1102>Elizabeth, who did not feel the slightest desire to stay with them, replied with a laugh–</t1102>
<t1103>"No no; stay where you are.</t1103> <t1104>You make a nice group, you look great.</t1104> <t1105>If a fourth person comes, the picture will be ruined.</t1105> <t1106>Goodbye.</t1106><t1107>"</t1107>
<t1108>Then, she ran away joyfully, hopping and skipping with the hope of returning home within a day or two, feeling cheerful.</t1108> <t1109>Jane had already recovered enough that evening to intend to leave her room for a few hours.</t1109>
<t1110>Chapter XI</t1110>
<t1111>After the ladies got up from the meal, Elizabeth ran to her sister, and seeing that she was well-protected from the cold, took her to the sitting room; her two friends greeted her with displays of joy; Elizabeth had never seen them as charming as they were during the hour before the gentlemen arrived.</t1111> <t1112>Their conversational skills were quite advanced.</t1112> <t1113>They could describe an event in detail, tell an anecdote with humor, and laugh joyfully at people they knew.</t1113>
<t1114>But when the gentlemen arrived, Jane ceased to be the main subject; Miss Bingley's eyes turned to Darcy at that moment, and as she prepared to say something to him, Darcy walked away quickly.</t1114> <t1115>He went straight to Miss Bennet, greeted her politely; Mr. Hurst also bowed slightly and said he was "glad"; but the excitement and warmth were left to Bingley's greeting.</t1115> <t1116>Bingley was full of joy and care.</t1116> <t1117>The first half hour was spent tending to the fire, so that Miss Bennet would not be disturbed by the change of room; then, at Bingley's request, she was moved to the other side of the fireplace, away from the door.</t1117> <t1118>Then Bingley sat beside her and did not talk much to anyone else.</t1118> <t1119>Elizabeth, who was occupied with her work in the opposite corner, watched all this with great pleasure.</t1119>
<t1120>When the tea was finished, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card table – but in vain.</t1120> <t1121>His sister-in-law had received secret intelligence and learned that Mr. Darcy did not want to play cards; Mr. Hurst soon saw that even his open invitation was declined.</t1121> <t1122>His sister-in-law assured him that no one wanted to play, and the others in the room, by remaining silent on the matter, proved her right.</t1122> <t1123>With nothing left to do, Mr. Hurst lay down on a sofa and fell asleep.</t1123> <t1124>Darcy picked up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; Mrs. Hurst, who was playing with her bracelets and rings, occasionally joined her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.</t1124>
<t1125>Miss Bingley's attention was as much focused on Mr. Darcy's progress in his book as on her own reading; she kept either asking a question or looking at his page.</t1125> <t1126>Yet she could not draw him into a conversation; Mr. Darcy contented himself with answering her question and continued his reading.</t1126> <t1127>Finally, exhausted from her attempt to occupy herself with her own book, which she had chosen only because it was the second volume of Mr. Darcy's, she gave a huge yawn and said: "How delightful it is to spend an evening in this way!</t1127> <t1128>Indeed, there is nothing as sweet as reading!</t1128> <t1129>Everything else tires one more quickly than a book!</t1129> <t1130>–I shall be miserable if I do not have an excellent library when I have a house of my own.</t1130><t1131>"</t1131>
<t1132>Nobody answered.</t1132> <t1133>Then he yawned again, put his book aside, and let his eyes wander around the room in search of distraction; when he heard his brother mention the ball to Miss Bennet, he suddenly turned to him and said–</t1133>
<t1134>"By the way, Charles, are you serious about organizing a dance at Netherfield?</t1134> <t1135>–My advice to you is to learn the wishes of those here before making a decision; if I'm not mistaken, there are those among us who see the ball as torture rather than pleasure.</t1135><t1136>"</t1136>
<t1137>"If you mean Darcy," said his sister, "he can go to bed and sleep before the ball starts if he wants – but the ball is already confirmed; as soon as Nicholls makes enough almond soup, I will send out my invitations.</t1137><t1138>"</t1138>
<t1139>"If it were done differently," replied Miss Bingley, "I would like balls much more; but there is something oddly boring about the usual course of such a ball.</t1139> <t1140>It would be much more sensible to have a conversation instead of dancing.</t1140><t1141>"</t1141>
<t1142>"Much wiser, dear Caroline, but then it wouldn't be called a ball.</t1142><t1143>"</t1143>
<t1144>Miss Bingley did not reply; she immediately stood up and began to walk around the room.</t1144> <t1145>Her body was graceful, and she walked beautifully; –but all these efforts aimed at Darcy were still in vain as he remained engrossed in his work.</t1145> <t1146>In the hopelessness of her emotions, Miss Bingley made one more attempt and, turning to Elizabeth, said–</t1146>
<t1147>"Miss Eliza Bennet, come, take a turn about the room with me.</t1147> <t1148>–It is so refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.</t1148><t1149>"</t1149>
<t1150>Elizabeth was surprised, but she immediately accepted.</t1150> <t1151>Miss Bingley's courtesy achieved its true purpose; Mr. Darcy looked up.</t1151> <t1152>He was as aware of the striking innovations on the side as Elizabeth herself and closed his book without thinking.</t1152> <t1153>He was immediately invited to join the group but declined, saying that he saw only two reasons behind their walking up and down the room together, and if he joined them, he would interfere with either one or the other of those reasons.</t1153> <t1154>"What could he mean?</t1154> <t1155>She was dying to understand what he meant" –and asked Elizabeth if she could understand him.</t1155>
<t1156>"I don't understand," was Elizabeth's reply; "but believe me, he is trying to be cruel to us; the only way to surprise him is to ask nothing about it.</t1156><t1157>"</t1157>
<t1158>However, Miss Bingley was incapable of surprising Mr. Darcy on any matter, and she stubbornly inquired about what those two reasons were.</t1158>
<t1159>"I have no objection to the explanation," said Mr. Darcy, as soon as he was allowed to speak.</t1159> <t1160>"The reason you prefer to spend the evening this way is either because you have confidential matters to discuss, or you think your figure will be most effective while walking; –if it is the former, I will not hinder you, if it is the latter, I can admire you more from my seat by the fire.</t1160><t1161>"</t1161>
<t1162>"Oh! Surprising!" exclaimed Miss Bingley.</t1162> <t1163>"I have never heard such an impertinent thing.</t1163> <t1164>How shall we punish him for these words?</t1164><t1165>"</t1165>
<t1166>"It's very easy, just ask," said Elizabeth.</t1166> <t1167>"We can all punish each other.</t1167> <t1168>Mock, laugh.</t1168> <t1169>You are the one close to him, you should know how to do it.</t1169><t1170>"</t1170>
<t1171>"But I really am not.</t1171> <t1172>My closeness has not yet taught me this.</t1172> <t1173>To mock someone so calm and sensible!</t1173> <t1174>No, no – there he can outdo us.</t1174> <t1175>When it comes to laughing, if you allow me, let's not make fools of ourselves when there is no one to laugh at.</t1175> <t1176>Mr. Darcy would be quite amused.</t1176><t1177>"</t1177>
<t1178>"Isn't Mr. Darcy laughable!" exclaimed Elizabeth.</t1178> <t1179>"This is a rare trait; I hope it continues, because having many acquaintances like him would be a great loss for me.</t1179> <t1180>I love to laugh.</t1180><t1181>"</t1181>
<t1182>"Miss Bingley," said Mr. Darcy, "you have given me too much credit."</t1182> <t1183>"The wisest and best of men –nay, the wisest and best of their actions– may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke."</t1183><t1184>"</t1184>
<t1185>"Of course," answered Elizabeth, "there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them.</t1185> <t1186>I hope I never make a mockery of something that is wise and good.</t1186> <t1187>Foolishness, nonsense, frivolity, inconsistency, these provoke me, truly, and I laugh at them at every opportunity.</t1187> <t1188>–But these, I believe, are things you will never be seen with.</t1188><t1189>"</t1189>
<t1190>"This may not be possible for anyone.</t1190> <t1191>But avoiding weaknesses that would make one look ridiculous in front of a sound mind has been the endeavor of my life.</t1191><t1192>"</t1192>
<t1193>"Like ostentation and pride.</t1193><t1194>"</t1194>
<t1195>"Yes, ostentation is indeed a weakness.</t1195> <t1196>But pride – if there is true intellectual superiority, pride will always be in safe hands.</t1196><t1197>"</t1197>
<t1198>Elizabeth turned to the other side to hide her smile.</t1198>
<t1199>"I suppose your examination of Mr. Darcy is complete," said Miss Bingley, "tell me, what is the result?</t1199><t1200>"</t1200>
<t1201>"I wholeheartedly believed that Mr. Darcy had no faults.</t1201> <t1202>He himself says so openly anyway.</t1202><t1203>"</t1203>
<t1204>"No" –said Darcy.</t1204> <t1205>"I make no such claim.</t1205> <t1206>I have my faults, but I hope they are not related to intellect.</t1206> <t1207>I will not defend my nature.</t1207> <t1208>–I suppose I am not very charming –not enough to please everyone.</t1208> <t1209>I cannot easily forget people's foolishness, their wickedness, or their rudeness towards me.</t1209> <t1210>No one can easily provoke my feelings.</t1210> <t1211>Perhaps you could call my nature resentful.</t1211> <t1212>–Once I cool towards someone, I cool forever.</t1212><t1213>"</t1213>
<t1214>"This is a flaw indeed!" –cried Elizabeth.</t1214> <t1215>"Rigid vindictiveness is a shadow in the character.</t1215> <t1216>But you have chosen your fault well.</t1216> <t1217>I really cannot laugh at this.</t1217> <t1218>You are safe from me.</t1218><t1219>"</t1219>
<t1220>"I think there is a certain inclination towards evil in every creation – a natural flaw that even the best education cannot overcome.</t1220><t1221>"</t1221>
<t1222>"Your flaw is the tendency to hate everyone.</t1222><t1223>"</t1223>
<t1224>"Yours is," said Darcy, smiling, "willingly misunderstanding everyone.</t1224><t1225>"</t1225>
<t1226>"Let's play some music," cried Miss Bingley, tired of the conversation she wasn't part of.</t1226> <t1227>"Louisa, could you please wake Mr. Hurst?</t1227><t1228>"</t1228>
<t1229>His sister did not object at all; the piano was opened; after thinking about what had happened for a few minutes, Darcy did not regret it.</t1229> <t1230>He had begun to feel the danger of paying too much attention to Elizabeth.</t1230>
<t1231>Chapter XII</t1231>
<t1232>According to the agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote a letter to her mother the next morning, requesting that the carriage be sent during the day.</t1232> <t1233>But Mrs. Bennet, who calculated that her daughters should stay at Netherfield until the next Tuesday, that is, until Jane's week was up, was not willing to accept them before that day.</t1233> <t1234>Therefore, she did not give a positive response, at least according to Elizabeth, because Elizabeth was impatient to return home.</t1234> <t1235>Mrs. Bennet sent them a message saying that she could not arrange the carriage before Tuesday; she did not forget to add this note: if Mr. Bingley and his sister insisted on them staying longer, she had no objection.</t1235> <t1236>On the other hand, Elizabeth was determined not to stay any longer – she did not expect to be asked to stay; on the contrary, thinking that they were imposing themselves as unnecessary guests, she immediately urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage; finally, that morning, plans to leave Netherfield were discussed and the carriage was requested.</t1236>
<t1237>The news caused a commotion; it was insisted that they stay at least until the next day to look after Jane; thus, they postponed their departure to the following day.</t1237> <t1238>Then Miss Bingley regretted suggesting the delay, because the jealousy and hatred she felt for one sister surpassed the love she felt for the other.</t1238>
<t1239>The master of the house was truly saddened to hear that they would leave so soon and often tried to convince Jane that it would not be safe for her to go frequently, that she had not yet recovered enough; but when Jane knew she was right, she was determined.</t1239>
<t1240>Mr. Darcy received the news positively – Elizabeth had stayed at Netherfield long enough.</t1240> <t1241>She had attracted him more than he could accept – and Miss Bingley was treating Elizabeth poorly, which was also greatly annoying Darcy.</t1241> <t1242>Darcy was now determined not to show any signs of closeness that might lead Elizabeth to hope that he could affect her happiness; he was aware that even if such an impression had been made, his behavior throughout that last day would have the weight to either confirm or dispel this impression.</t1242> <t1243>He remained committed to his purpose and did not speak more than ten words to her all Saturday; at one point, they were alone for half an hour, but he did not even lift his head from his book to look at her.</t1243>
<t1244>On Sunday, after the morning prayer, the much-desired departure that almost everyone wanted took place.</t1244> <t1245>Miss Bingley's kindness towards Elizabeth and her affection for Jane suddenly increased; as they were parting, after saying that she would always be delighted to see Jane at Longbourn or Netherfield and embracing her warmly, she even shook hands with Elizabeth.</t1245> <t1246>Elizabeth bid farewell to everyone with great joy.</t1246>
<t1247>Their mother did not welcome them warmly at home.</t1247> <t1248>Mrs. Bennet was surprised by their arrival and was angry with them for causing so much trouble; she was sure that Jane would catch a cold again.</t1248> <t1249>–But their father was genuinely happy to see them, even though his expressions of joy were brief and to the point; he had felt the importance of his daughters within the family.</t1249> <t1250>When they were together, the evening conversation lost most of its cheerfulness and almost all of its meaning without Jane and Elizabeth.</t1250>
<t1251>They found Mary, as usual, immersed in her studies of harmony and human nature; she had gathered admirable new quotes and insightful new observations.</t1251> <t1252>However, Catherine and Lydia had different kinds of news to share with them.</t1252> <t1253>Since the previous Wednesday, much had been done and said in the regiment; a few officers had recently dined with their uncle, a soldier had been whipped, and it was openly talked about that Colonel Forster was going to get married.</t1253>
<t1254>Chapter XIII</t1254>
<t1255>"I hope, my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were having breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner today, for I have reasons to expect an addition to our family circle.</t1255><t1256>"</t1256>
<t1257>"Who do you mean, my dear?</t1257> <t1258>There is no one coming; perhaps Charlotte Lucas might drop by – I hope my table is good enough for her.</t1258> <t1259>She doesn't get to see such things often even in her own home.</t1259><t1260>"</t1260>
<t1261>"The person I mentioned is a man, moreover a foreigner."</t1261><t1262>"</t1262>
<t1263>Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled.</t1263> <t1264>"A man, and a stranger at that!</t1264> <t1265>It must be Mr. Bingley! Oh Jane, why didn't you tell me, you naughty girl!</t1265> <t1266>Honestly, I will be very pleased to see Mr. Bingley.</t1266> <t1267>But –Oh dear! What luck! We have no fish today.</t1267> <t1268>Lydia, darling, ring the bell –I need to speak with Hill immediately.</t1268><t1269>"</t1269>
<t1270>"Not Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "someone I have never seen in my life."</t1270><t1271>"</t1271>
<t1272>This statement caused general astonishment; Mr. Bennet enjoyed the pleasure of being besieged by his wife and five daughters at the same time.</t1272>
<t1273>After amusing himself with their curiosity for a while, he made the explanation–</t1273>
<t1274>"I received this letter about a month ago; I replied about fifteen days ago, because I thought it was a delicate matter that needed to be handled carefully."</t1274> <t1275>"It is from my nephew Mr. Collins, you know, the man who can throw you all out of this house whenever he wants after I die."</t1275><t1276>"</t1276>
<t1277>"Oh my God," cried his wife, "I can't even bear to hear you talk about him.</t1277> <t1278>Please don't mention that disgusting man.</t1278> <t1279>The most unbearable thing in the world is that his inheritance is mortgaged against his own children; if I were in his place, I would have definitely done something by now, one way or another.</t1279><t1280>"</t1280>
<t1281>They tried to explain to Jane and Elizabeth what an entailment was.</t1281> <t1282>They had tried before, but it was a subject that Mrs. Bennet could not grasp, and once again she bitterly lamented the cruelty of taking a house away from a family with five daughters and giving it to a man whom no one knew.</t1282>
<t1283>"Of course, it is an unjust situation," said Mr. Bennet, "and nothing can cover the shame of Mr. Collins inheriting Longbourn.</t1283> <t1284>But if you listen to his letter, perhaps his way of expressing himself might soften you.</t1284><t1285>"</t1285>
<t1286>"No, I don't want to; I think it's inappropriate, even hypocritical, for him to write to you.</t1286> <t1287>I hate such fake friends.</t1287> <t1288>Why doesn't he fight with you like his father does?</t1288><t1289>"</t1289>
<t1290>"There seems to be something like a feeling of being adopted; listen."</t1290><t1291>"</t1291>
<t1292>"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,</t1292>
<t1293>October 15.</t1293>
<t1294>Dear Sir,</t1294>
<t1295>The conflict between you and my late father has always troubled me; since I unfortunately lost my father, I have wanted to mend the disagreement many times; but for a while my doubts held me back, fearing that getting along well with someone he was quarrelsome with might seem disrespectful to his memory.</t1295><t1296>-</t1296> <t1297>[Oh, Mrs. Bennet.]</t1297> <t1298>–However, I have made my decision regarding the matter; when I received my ordination certificate at Easter, I was fortunate to be taken under the patronage of the widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, the Honorable Lady Catherine de Bourgh; thanks to her generosity and benevolence, I was appointed as the vicar of that village; now, with all my gratitude, I will dedicate myself to the service of Her Ladyship and organize the rites and ceremonies prescribed by the Church of England.</t1298> <t1299>Additionally, as a clergyman, I aim to protect and strengthen the peace of all the families within my sphere of influence; therefore, I hope you will see this goodwill initiative as quite positive, overlook the fact that I am the first heir to the mortgage on Longbourn estate, and not reject the olive branch I extend.</t1299> <t1300>It would distress me to be considered a cause of harm to your dear daughters; with your permission, I want you to know that I am ready to apologize and make amends for this, –but we will discuss this later.</t1300> <t1301>If you have no objection to accepting me into your home, I wish to visit you and your family on Monday, November 18th around four o'clock and possibly seek your hospitality until the following Saturday, as Lady Catherine does not object to my occasional absences provided another clergyman handles the daily duties, bless her.</t1301> <t1302>–I extend my deepest respects to you and your daughters, sir.</t1302> <t1303>Your well-wisher and friend,</t1303>
<t1304>William Collins.</t1304><t1305>"</t1305>
<t1306>"So we can expect this peace-loving gentleman at four o'clock," said Mr. Bennet, folding the letter.</t1306> <t1307>"He truly seems like a conscientious and kind young man; I have no doubt he will be a valuable relative, especially if Lady Catherine allows him to visit us again.</t1307><t1308>"</t1308>
<t1309>"There is a reasonable tone in his words about the girls; if he wants to make amends with the girls, I won't stand in his way."</t1309><t1310>"</t1310>
<t1311>"It's hard to guess how he intends to make the correction he thinks we deserve," said Jane, "but even this desire earns him points.</t1311><t1312>"</t1312>
<t1313>Elizabeth was particularly impressed by his extraordinary respect for Lady Catherine and his intention to baptize, marry, and bury the villagers when necessary.</t1313>
<t1314>"There must be something strange about the man," he said.</t1314> <t1315>"I can't understand him.</t1315> <t1316>–There is something too fancy in his manner.</t1316> <t1317>–What does it mean to apologize for being the first during the inheritance?</t1317> <t1318>–Even if he could, we can't expect him to do anything.</t1318> <t1319>–Do you think he could be a reasonable man, sir?</t1319><t1320>"</t1320>
<t1321>"No, darling; I don't think so.</t1321> <t1322>I have high hopes that the opposite is true.</t1322> <t1323>There is something both servile and boastful in his letter, which is quite meaningful.</t1323> <t1324>I can't wait to see him.</t1324><t1325>"</t1325>
<t1326>"In terms of writing," said Mary, "the letter doesn't seem flawed.</t1326> <t1327>The olive branch idea may not be very new, but I think it is well expressed.</t1327><t1328>"</t1328>
<t1329>The letter and its author held no interest for Catherine and Lydia.</t1329> <t1330>It was almost impossible for their cousins to arrive in a red coat, and they had not enjoyed the presence of a man in any other color for several weeks.</t1330> <t1331>As for their mother, Mr. Collins' letter had taken away most of her bad thoughts, and she was preparing to receive the man with a calmness that surprised her husband and daughters.</t1331>
<t1332>Mr. Collins adhered to the given time; he was received very politely by the whole family.</t1332> <t1333>Mr. Bennet spoke little; but the ladies were quite ready to talk; Mr. Collins, on the other hand, seemed neither to need encouragement nor to have any inclination to sit quietly.</t1333> <t1334>He was a twenty-five-year-old man, tall and heavy-looking.</t1334> <t1335>He had a serious and dignified air; his movements were very formal.</t1335> <t1336>He had not been seated long before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on her daughters; he said he had heard much about their beauty, but now saw that their reputation fell short of the reality, and added that he had no doubt they would all make good marriages in due time.</t1336> <t1337>This compliment did not quite suit the taste of some of the listeners; but Mrs. Bennet, who thought there was no such thing as a bad compliment, immediately responded.</t1337>
<t1338>"You are very kind, believe me; I hope it turns out that way, because otherwise they will be left homeless."</t1338> <t1339>Things are going very strangely."</t1339><t1340>"</t1340>
<t1341>"I suppose you are referring to the mortgage on this property."</t1341><t1342>"</t1342>
<t1343>"Ah sir, of course.</t1343> <t1344>You must understand that this is a great torment for my daughters.</t1344> <t1345>Not that I find fault with you, because I know that these matters are a matter of luck in this world.</t1345> <t1346>I don't understand how an inheritance can be mortgaged away.</t1346><t1347>"</t1347>
<t1348>"I am aware of the difficulty I have created for my dear cousins, madam, and I have much to say on the matter, but I do not wish to appear hasty and rushed.</t1348> <t1349>But I have come ready to admire the young ladies.</t1349> <t1350>I will not say more for now, but, perhaps, when we know each other better–</t1350><t1351>"</t1351>
<t1352>The call to dinner interrupted the conversation; the girls smiled at each other.</t1352> <t1353>Mr. Collins' admiration was not solely directed at them.</t1353> <t1354>The drawing room, the dining room, and all the furniture were examined and praised; Mrs. Bennet's pride would have been flattered by his approval of everything if it weren't for the possibility that he saw it all as his future property.</t1354> <t1355>The dinner, in due course, also received its share of admiration; he wanted to know to which lovely cousin he owed thanks for the excellent cooking.</t1355> <t1356>But here Mrs. Bennet interrupted him and said rather sharply that they were well-off enough to hire a good cook, and that her daughters had no business in the kitchen.</t1356> <t1357>Mr. Collins apologized for having offended her.</t1357> <t1358>Although Mrs. Bennet explained in a gentle voice that she was not at all offended, the man continued to apologize for a quarter of an hour.</t1358>
<t1359>Chapter XIV</t1359>
<t1360>Mr. Bennet did not talk much during the meal; but when the servants withdrew, he thought it was time to converse with his guest and opened a topic in which he hoped he would show himself, saying that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.</t1360> <t1361>Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes and care for his comfort was very impressive.</t1361> <t1362>Mr. Bennet could not have chosen a better topic.</t1362> <t1363>Mr. Collins could not stop praising the lady.</t1363> <t1364>As he spoke, he became more and more enthusiastic, speaking with the air of a very important man, "he had never in his life seen such behavior from someone of title – such sensitivity and generosity as Lady Catherine had shown him.</t1364> <t1365>She had approved with generous satisfaction both of the sermons he had had the honor of delivering in her presence.</t1365> <t1366>She had invited him to dine at Rosings twice, and just last Saturday had sent for him to complete the quartet at the quadrille table in the evening.</t1366> <t1367>Many people he knew thought Lady Catherine was proud, but he had seen nothing but sensitivity in her.</t1367> <t1368>She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she had not objected in the slightest to his forming close relationships with the neighbors or to his leaving his parish for a week or two to visit his relatives occasionally.</t1368> <t1369>She had even shown her generosity by advising him to marry as soon as possible, provided he made a good choice, and had once visited him in his humble abode, fully approving of all the renovations he was making and even making some suggestions herself – such as adding a few shelves to the small rooms upstairs.</t1369><t1370>"</t1370>
<t1371>"These are very appropriate and polite actions," said Mrs. Bennet, "it is clear that she is a very charming woman.</t1371> <t1372>It is a pity that more grand ladies are not like her.</t1372> <t1373>Does she live near you, sir?</t1373><t1374>"</t1374>
<t1375>"My humble abode's garden is separated from the lady's estate, Rosings Park, by only one road."</t1375><t1376>"</t1376>
<t1377>"You said he was dull, didn't you?</t1377> <t1378>Does he have a family?</t1378><t1379>"</t1379>
<t1380>"She has an only daughter, the heiress of Rosings and a vast estate."</t1380><t1381>"</t1381>
<t1382>"Ah!" cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "so she is better off than most girls.</t1382> <t1383>What kind of young lady is she?</t1383> <t1384>Is she beautiful?</t1384><t1385>"</t1385>
<t1386>"A very elegant young lady indeed.</t1386> <t1387>Lady Catherine herself says that in terms of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the most beautiful of her peers, because there is something in her face that shows she is a young woman of innate privilege.</t1387> <t1388>But unfortunately, she is always ill; according to the lady who oversees her education and still stays with them, this prevents her from developing many of her skills, otherwise why would she fall behind.</t1388> <t1389>But she is extremely amiable; she often shows the kindness of passing by my humble abode with her little phaeton and ponies.</t1389><t1390>"</t1390>
<t1391>"Was it presented?"</t1391> <t1392>"I don't remember hearing her name among the ladies in the palace."</t1392><t1393>"</t1393>
<t1394>"His poor health prevents him from coming to the city; therefore, one day I personally told Lady Catherine that he deprives the English court of its brightest ornament.</t1394> <t1395>Her Ladyship seemed to like this idea; you can guess that I always gladly express these little delicate compliments that women always find reasonable at every opportunity.</t1395> <t1396>I have told Lady Catherine several times that her beautiful daughter seems to be born to be a duchess, and that even the highest title would be honored by her rather than adding glory to her.</t1396> <t1397>–These are the kinds of little things that please Her Ladyship, and I consider it my duty to show such attention.</t1397><t1398>"</t1398>
<t1399>"A very sensible thought," said Mr. Bennet, "also, it is nice that you have the ability to make fine compliments.</t1399> <t1400>I wonder if these sweet words are born at the moment or if they are rehearsed beforehand.</t1400><t1401>"</t1401>
<t1402>"They mostly come from things happening at the time; although sometimes I think of and come up with these kinds of delicate compliments that can be adapted to normal situations to keep myself entertained, I always want to say them with an air of spontaneity as much as possible.</t1402><t1403>"</t1403>
<t1404>Mr. Bennet's predictions turned out to be entirely correct.</t1404> <t1405>His nephew was as foolish as he had anticipated; he listened to him with intelligent pleasure, maintaining a serious expression on his face and, except for occasionally glancing at Elizabeth, not seeking to share his enjoyment with anyone.</t1405>
<t1406>Nevertheless, these sufficed for her until tea time; she took her guest back to the sitting room and, when tea was finished, invited him to read to the ladies.</t1406> <t1407>Mr. Collins immediately accepted; a book was brought, but upon seeing the book (it was evident from every aspect that it had been borrowed from a public library), he recoiled and apologized, saying that he did not read novels.</t1407> <t1408>Kitty stared at him intently, and Lydia let out a cry of astonishment.</t1408> <t1409>Other books were brought, and after some deliberation, he chose Fordyce's Sermons.</t1409> <t1410>As Mr. Collins opened the book, Lydia yawned, and he had not read more than three pages in a monotonous seriousness before she stopped him-</t1410>
<t1411>"You know, mom, Aunt Philips is talking about turning Richard away; then Colonel Forster will take him.</t1411> <t1412>My aunt said it herself on Saturday.</t1412> <t1413>Tomorrow I will go to Meryton to learn the rest, and I will also ask when Mr. Denny is returning from the city.</t1413><t1414>"</t1414>
<t1415>Her two older sisters told Lydia to be quiet; but Mr. Collins, who was very offended, put his book aside and said–</t1415>
<t1416>"I have often observed that young ladies are not interested in serious books – yet these are written solely for their benefit.</t1416> <t1417>I must confess, it astonishes me; –because, after all, there is nothing as beneficial as education.</t1417> <t1418>But I will not bore my young cousin any longer.</t1418><t1419>"</t1419>
<t1420>Then he turned to Mr. Bennet and offered to be his opponent in backgammon.</t1420> <t1421>Mr. Bennet accepted the offer, saying that he was wise to leave his daughters to their own trifling affairs.</t1421> <t1422>Mrs. Bennet and her daughters politely apologized for Lydia's interruption and promised it would not happen again if he wished to return to his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring his young cousin that he was not offended by her action, settled at another table with Mr. Bennet and prepared for backgammon.</t1422>
<t1423>Chapter XV</t1423>
<t1424>Mr. Collins was not a clever man; the flaws in his nature had not benefited from education or environment; most of his life had been spent under the control of an illiterate, miserable father; although he was a university graduate, he had only taken the compulsory courses and had not formed a useful connection with education.</t1424> <t1425>The treatment his father subjected him to had given him a great sense of inferiority from the start; but this inferiority was now considerably balanced by the illusions of a weak mind living far from everyone and the feelings provided by early and unexpected prosperity.</t1425> <t1426>A good coincidence had brought Lady Catherine de Bourgh into his life at a time when the Hunsford position was vacant; the respect he felt for the woman's high status, combined with the reverence he felt for her as his patron, and his great appreciation of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a priest, had made him a man of mixed pride and servility, arrogance and inferiority.</t1426>
<t1427>Now that he had a good house and a very reasonable income, he had decided to marry; while seeking reconciliation with the Longbourn family, he had in mind to find a wife, because he wanted to choose one of the family's daughters, provided he found them as beautiful and charming as they were said to be.</t1427> <t1428>This was his plan to compensate – to rectify – inheriting their father's house, and he thought it was a wonderful plan, very clear and convenient, and moreover, extremely generous and selfless.</t1428>
<t1429>His plan did not change upon seeing the girls.</t1429> <t1430>Miss Bennet's beautiful face confirmed his thoughts, and the requirements of being the eldest grounded his choice on solid foundations; his definite choice on the first evening was Jane.</t1430> <t1431>However, the situation changed the next morning; he had a fifteen-minute private conversation with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast; he began by talking about his own home, naturally leading to his hope of finding a lady in Longbourn, and in response, amidst polite smiles and encouraging words, he received a warning about Jane.</t1431> <t1432>"It was not her place to say anything about her younger daughters – she couldn't say anything definite – but as far as she knew, there was no engagement – as for her eldest daughter, she felt compelled to mention that an engagement was imminent.</t1432><t1433>"</t1433>
<t1434>Mr. Collins only needed to change his mind from Jane to Elizabeth – and he did – while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.</t1434> <t1435>Elizabeth, who was not inferior to Jane in beauty and virtue, immediately followed her.</t1435>
<t1436>Mrs. Bennet eagerly seized the opportunity, and soon believed she could marry off her two daughters; the man she couldn't even bear to hear about just yesterday had now become quite favorable in her eyes.</t1436>
<t1437>Lydia's intention to walk to Meryton was not forgotten; all the girls except Mary agreed to go with her; Mr. Collins would accompany them at the request of Mr. Bennet, who wanted to get rid of him and have the library to himself; the man had followed him to the library after breakfast and, pretending to browse one of the largest volumes in the collection, would once again relentlessly talk about his house and garden in Hunsford, giving Mr. Bennet no respite.</t1437> <t1438>Such actions greatly annoyed Mr. Bennet.</t1438> <t1439>He always desired absolute comfort and tranquility in his library; as he told Elizabeth, he was prepared to encounter foolishness and pretentiousness in every other room of the house, but he was accustomed to being free from them there; therefore, without losing a moment, he kindly invited Mr. Collins to join his daughters' walk; Mr. Collins, being more inclined to walk than to read, gladly closed the large book and went.</t1439>
<t1440>He swaggered idly, while his cousins nodded politely, and finally, they arrived in Meryton.</t1440> <t1441>By then, he could no longer attract the attention of the young people.</t1441> <t1442>The girls' eyes immediately started searching for the officers as they wandered the streets, and nothing could distract them except for a very flashy hat in a shop window or a brand new muslin.</t1442>
<t1443>However, it wasn't long before a young man caught the attention of all the ladies, someone they had never seen before, very gentlemanly in appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the road.</t1443><t1444>The officer was Mr. Denny, whom Lydia had come to inquire about whether he had returned from London, and he nodded as they passed by.</t1444><t1445>They were all struck by the stranger's demeanor, all curious about who he might be; Kitty and Lydia pretended to look at something in the shop across the street to find out if possible, and just as they stepped onto the sidewalk, by coincidence, they came face to face with the two gentlemen returning.</t1445><t1446>Mr. Denny immediately began to speak, asking permission to introduce his friend: Mr. Wickham had come to town with him the previous day and, he was happy to say, had agreed to be an officer in their regiment.</t1446><t1447>This was just as it should be; the young man's only missing element for perfect charm was his uniform.</t1447><t1448>Every detail of his demeanor added something to him; everything about him was beautiful: a pleasant face, a well-formed body, and an engaging manner of speaking.</t1448><t1449>After the introductions, the young man showed he was eager to talk – but it was a perfectly measured and easy eagerness; the whole group was standing and chatting sweetly when the sound of horses drew their attention, and they saw Darcy and Bingley coming down the street.</t1449><t1450>As soon as the two gentlemen recognized the ladies in the group, they came directly to them and displayed their usual politeness.</t1450><t1451>Bingley was the main speaker, and Miss Bennet was the main topic.</t1451><t1452>At that moment, Bingley said, he was also on his way to Longbourn to inquire about her health.</t1452><t1453>Mr. Darcy nodded to confirm this and was just beginning to struggle not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth when he noticed the stranger's presence and suddenly froze; Elizabeth saw that both their faces froze in astonishment at the encounter as they looked at each other.</t1453><t1454>Both of their colors changed, one turning white, the other red.</t1454><t1455>Mr. Wickham touched his hat a few seconds later – Darcy barely acknowledged this salute.</t1455><t1456>What could this mean?</t1456><t1457>–It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to be eager to find out.</t1457>
<t1458>Soon after, Mr. Bingley asked for leave without seeming to pay attention to what was happening and set off with his friend.</t1458>
<t1459>Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips's house, then, despite Miss Lydia's insistent invitations to come inside and even Mrs. Philips raising the parlor window to support the invitation, they bowed and took their leave.</t1459>
<t1460>Mrs. Philips was always pleased to see her nieces; the two eldest girls were especially well received after their recent absence; Mrs. Philips was fervently expressing her surprise at their sudden return, saying that if she hadn't seen Mr. Jones's apprentice in the street, who told her they would no longer be sending syrup to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets had left, she wouldn't have known. At that moment, Jane stepped forward and introduced Mr. Collins, drawing her attention to him.</t1460><t1461>Mrs. Philips greeted Mr. Collins in the most polite manner, and received the same courtesy in return; Mr. Collins apologized for being a guest without their prior acquaintance, but he believed that his proud connection with the young ladies who brought him there would excuse this situation.</t1461><t1462>Mrs. Philips was delighted by such extreme politeness; but her observation of the stranger was soon interrupted by excited questions about another stranger, about whom she could tell her nieces what they already knew, namely that Mr. Denny had brought him from London and that he would be taking the rank of lieutenant in the -------shire regiment.</t1462><t1463>She said she had been watching him for the past hour, walking up and down the street; if Mr. Wickham had appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued to watch, but unfortunately, apart from a few officers who were "stupid, disagreeable fellows" compared to the stranger, no one else was passing by the windows.</t1463><t1464>Some of them would be dining with the Philipses the next day; their aunt promised that if the Longbourn family came in the evening, she would send her husband to visit Mr. Wickham and invite him as well.</t1464><t1465>They agreed; Mrs. Philips said they would play a delightful, easy, and boisterous game of lottery tickets, followed by something hot to eat.</t1465><t1466>It was joyful to have such entertainments to look forward to; both parties were in high spirits as they parted.</t1466><t1467>Mr. Collins repeated his apologies as he left the room and was assured with tireless politeness that there was no need for any apology.</t1467>
<t1468>While walking home, Elizabeth explained to Jane what had transpired between the two gentlemen; if they seemed to have made a mistake, Jane would have defended one or both of them, but she too could not make more sense of this behavior than her sister.</t1468>
<t1469>When they returned, Mr. Collins greatly pleased Mrs. Bennet by showering praises on Mrs. Philips's behavior and kindness.</t1469> <t1470>He said that, except for Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant lady in his life; she had not only received him with tremendous politeness but had also emphatically included him in the invitation for the following evening, even though she had never seen him before.</t1470> <t1471>Of course, their familial connection might have had some influence, but still, he had never received such attention in his life.</t1471>
<t1472>Chapter XVI</t1472>
<t1473>Since there was no objection to the young people's agreement with their aunt, and Mr. Collins's complaints about not wanting to leave Mr. and Mrs. Bennet even for an evening were met with belief, the carriage took him and his five cousins to Meryton at a convenient time; as the girls entered the sitting room, they were delighted to learn that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation and was currently at home.</t1473>
<t1474>After this information was given and everyone was seated, Mr. Collins began to idly examine the surroundings; he was so impressed by the spaciousness and furnishing of the apartment that he almost declared he could mistake it for the small summer breakfast room at Rosings. Although this comparison did not initially garner much appreciation, once Mrs. Philips learned what Rosings was and who its owner was – upon hearing a description of just one of Lady Catherine's sitting rooms and that just the fireplace had cost eight hundred pounds – she felt the full force of the compliment, to the extent that she would no longer be offended even if it were compared to the servant's quarters.</t1474>
<t1475>She was very happy to describe the splendor of Lady Catherine and her mansion, occasionally praising her own humble abode and the renovations she was undergoing, until the gentlemen joined them; Mrs. Philips was a very attentive listener for her; after hearing these, she found the young man even more important and decided to share this with her neighbors at the first opportunity.</t1475> <t1476>The girls, who couldn't listen to their cousins, lamented the lack of a piano, and had nothing to do but examine the fake porcelain they had decorated above the fireplace, found the waiting time very long.</t1476> <t1477>But it finally ended, of course.</t1477> <t1478>The gentlemen approached; when Mr. Wickham entered the room, Elizabeth felt that she was not at all wrong in her admiration for him when she had seen him before and since then.</t1478> <t1479>The officers of the -------shire regiment were generally very reasonable, gentlemanly men, and the best of them were at this party; but Mr. Wickham, with his appearance, face, demeanor, and walk, was far superior to all of them, just as the officers were superior to the broad-faced, dull, wine-breathed Mr. Philips who entered the room after them.</t1479>
<t1480>Mr. Wickham was the lucky man who almost every woman's eyes were fixed upon, and Elizabeth soon became the lucky woman when the young man finally came and sat next to her; although he only talked about it being a rainy night and the possibility of a rainy season, the charm with which he started speaking immediately made Elizabeth think that even the most ordinary, most boring, most stale topic could become interesting with the speaker's skill.</t1480>
<t1481>When it came to attracting the attention of the fair sex, with rivals like Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins began to sink into insignificance; he was already a nobody to the young ladies; nevertheless, Mrs. Philips occasionally became a good listener to him and, with her attentiveness, did not leave him without coffee and cake.</t1481>
<t1482>When the game tables were set up, by sitting down to play whist, he also found an opportunity to express his feelings of gratitude towards her.</t1482>
<t1483>"I know very little about the game yet," he said, "but I want to improve myself, because a person in my situation–" Mrs. Philips thanked him for his cooperation but did not want to hear the reason.</t1483>
<t1484>Mr. Wickham did not play whist and was gladly accepted between Elizabeth and Lydia at the other table.</t1484> <t1485>At first, there was a danger of Lydia overwhelming the man; she was a persistent talker; but since she was also extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon got caught up in the game, investing money with such great enthusiasm that she couldn't pay attention to anyone else, and demanded her prize with loud cries.</t1485> <t1486>Thus, Mr. Wickham, adhering to the usual demands of the game, was free to talk to Elizabeth; Elizabeth was very eager to listen to him, but of course, what she most wanted to hear was something else – the story of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.</t1486> <t1487>She didn't even dare to mention it.</t1487> <t1488>Nevertheless, her curiosity was unexpectedly satisfied.</t1488> <t1489>Mr. Wickham brought up the subject himself.</t1489> <t1490>He asked how far Netherfield was from Meryton; after receiving Elizabeth's answer, he hesitated and then wanted to know how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.</t1490>
<t1491>"It has been about a month," said Elizabeth; then, to keep the matter from closing, she continued, "As far as I understand, he has a very large estate in Derbyshire.</t1491><t1492>"</t1492>
<t1493>"Yes," replied Wickham; – "he has a solid estate there.</t1493> <t1494>Ten thousand a year clear.</t1494> <t1495>You couldn't have come across anyone who could give you more information on that subject than me – because I have had a special relationship with his family since my childhood.</t1495><t1496>"</t1496>
<t1497>Elizabeth couldn't hide the astonishment on her face.</t1497>
<t1498>"After seeing the cold atmosphere in our encounter yesterday, such a statement might certainly surprise you, Miss Bennet.</t1498> <t1499>–Do you know Mr. Darcy well?</t1499><t1500>"</t1500>
<t1501>"Enough," cried Elizabeth in a warm voice.</t1501> <t1502>–"I spent four days in the same house with him and I find him quite unpleasant.</t1502><t1503>"</t1503>
<t1504>"I have no right to state my opinion," said Wickham, "I cannot say whether she is charming or not.</t1504> <t1505>I am not authorized to give an opinion.</t1505> <t1506>I have known her for too long and too well to make a fair judgment.</t1506> <t1507>It is impossible for me to be impartial.</t1507> <t1508>But I believe that your opinion of her would surprise many people – though perhaps you would not express it so strongly elsewhere.</t1508> <t1509>After all, you are among family here.</t1509><t1510>"</t1510>
<t1511>"Well, I wouldn't say more about any house in this neighborhood than I would here, except for Netherfield.</t1511> <t1512>No one in Hertfordshire likes it.</t1512> <t1513>Everyone hates its pride.</t1513> <t1514>I don't think you'll hear anyone speaking well of it anywhere.</t1514><t1515>"</t1515>
<t1516>"I can't say I'm sorry," said Wickham, after a brief hesitation, "no one should be given more credit than they deserve; but in his case, I suppose that's not happening.</t1516> <t1517>Anyone who sees him is blinded by his wealth and power, or they are intimidated by his arrogant, oppressive demeanor and see him only as he wants to be seen.</t1517><t1518>"</t1518>
<t1519>"Even though I barely know him, I can say that he is a grumpy man."</t1519> <t1520>Wickham just nodded.</t1520>
<t1521>"I wonder," he said, when he got the chance to speak again, "if he will stay around here much longer?</t1521><t1522>"</t1522>
<t1523>"I have no idea; but I didn't hear anything about him leaving while I was at Netherfield.</t1523> <t1524>I hope your plans for ------shire won't change because of his presence in the area.</t1524><t1525>"</t1525>
<t1526>"No, never!</t1526> <t1527>–Mr. Darcy cannot send me away.</t1527> <t1528>If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must be the one to go.</t1528> <t1529>We are not on good terms; seeing him always brings me pain, but I have no reason to avoid him, and I can tell the whole world why – a terrible sense of being wronged and agonizing remorse towards him.</t1529> <t1530>His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the kindest men to ever walk the earth and was my truest friend in life; when I see this Mr. Darcy, countless tender memories pierce my heart.</t1530> <t1531>His behavior towards me is utterly disgraceful; believe me, I can forgive him for everything but never for shattering his father's hopes and tarnishing his memory.</t1531><t1532>"</t1532>
<t1533>Elizabeth felt that the matter was becoming even more interesting and listened with full attention; but the sensitivity of the subject prevented her from asking questions.</t1533>
<t1534>Mr. Wickham began to talk about more general subjects, Meryton, the surroundings, and the people; he seemed to be very impressed with what he had seen; he spoke of the people in particular with a courteous but very familiar compliment.</t1534>
<t1535>"The main reason I joined this regiment," he added, "was that it promised a solid community of people, an elite environment.</t1535> <t1536>I knew it was a very respectable, reasonable regiment; when my friend Denny described their current headquarters, the close interest Meryton showed them, and the tremendous camaraderie, I was completely captivated.</t1536> <t1537>The environment is essential for me.</t1537> <t1538>I am a disappointed man; my soul cannot endure loneliness.</t1538> <t1539>I need work and friends.</t1539> <t1540>I did not aim for a military life, but circumstances led to it.</t1540> <t1541>My profession should have been the church – I was trained for the church and would now have the most valuable church, had the gentleman we mentioned been willing.</t1541><t1542>"</t1542>
<t1543>"Really?"</t1543><t1544>"</t1544>
<t1545>"Yes – the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed to me the best parish under his administration, and I was to take charge of it when it became vacant.</t1545> <t1546>He was my godfather and was extremely attached to me.</t1546> <t1547>No amount of praise can do justice to his kindness.</t1547> <t1548>He wanted to provide me with a good livelihood, and he thought he had; but when the parish became vacant, it was given to someone else.</t1548><t1549>"</t1549>
<t1550>"Oh my God!" cried Elizabeth; "but how can this be?</t1550> <t1551>–How can the will be disregarded?</t1551> <t1552>–Why didn't you pursue legal action?</t1552><t1553>"</t1553>
<t1554>"There was something unofficial in the conditions of the will, it didn't give me a chance in the eyes of the law.</t1554> <t1555>An honorable man couldn't doubt the intention here, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt – or thought it was a conditional recommendation and claimed that I had renounced all my rights, saying I was extravagant, saying I was imprudent – whatever came to his mind.</t1555> <t1556>That church also became vacant two years ago, just when I was of age to take over, and it was given to someone else, that's certain; but it's also certain that I can't accuse myself of having done anything to deserve losing that church.</t1556> <t1557>I have a warm, unprotected nature; I may have sometimes spoken freely about my opinions of him, I may have even said something to him.</t1557> <t1558>I can't think of anything worse.</t1558> <t1559>But the truth is, we are very different kinds of people and he hates me.</t1559><t1560>"</t1560>
<t1561>"I was shocked!</t1561> <t1562>–They deserve to be humiliated in front of everyone.</t1562><t1563>"</t1563>
<t1564>"It will eventually happen anyway – but I won't be the one to do it.</t1564> <t1565>I can't confront him until he can forget his father, I can't expose him.</t1565><t1566>"</t1566>
<t1567>Elizabeth praised him for these feelings, and thought he looked more handsome than ever while expressing them.</t1567>
<t1568>"Mom," he said, after a moment's hesitation, "what could be the reason?</t1568> <t1569>–what could have driven him to act so cruelly?</t1569><t1570>"</t1570>
<t1571>"A deep, resolute hatred towards me – a hatred that I involuntarily attributed to a certain degree of jealousy.</t1571> <t1572>The late Mr. Darcy might have treated me better if his father had loved me less: but it seems to me that his father's extraordinary attachment to me disturbed him even as a child.</t1572> <t1573>He was not of a nature to endure the competition we were in – a competition in which I was always the preferred one.</t1573><t1574>"</t1574>
<t1575>"I never imagined Mr. Darcy could be so bad – although I never liked him, I did not expect him to be this bad.</t1575> <t1576>–I thought he generally looked down on people, but I never suspected he could stoop to such heartless vindictiveness, such injustice, such cruelty.</t1576><t1577>"</t1577>
<t1578>After thinking for a few minutes, he continued–</t1578> <t1579>"I remember, one day at Netherfield, he was boasting that he had an unforgiving nature, that his resentment never passed.</t1579> <t1580>He must be a terrible person.</t1580><t1581>"</t1581>
<t1582>"I cannot trust myself on this matter," replied Wickham; "it is difficult for me to be fair to him.</t1582><t1583>"</t1583>
<t1584>Elizabeth once again fell into deep thoughts and after a while couldn't hold herself back: "To treat a godson, a friend, someone his father loved in such a way!" –She was about to add, "and to a young man like you, whose beauty is proof of his goodness," –but she settled for saying, "and to someone who is probably your childhood friend, with whom you have close ties according to what you say!</t1584><t1585>"</t1585>
<t1586>"We were born in the same village, under the same grove; much of our youth was spent together; we were people of the same house, shared the same amusements, and experienced the same parental love.</t1586> <t1587>My father started in the same profession that I believe your brother-in-law Mr. Philips is now pursuing with great success – but he left everything to be of service to the late Mr. Darcy and dedicated all his time to managing the Pemberley estate.</t1587> <t1588>He was held in high esteem by Mr. Darcy, being his close friend and confidant.</t1588> <t1589>Mr. Darcy often said himself how much he felt indebted to my father's active management; just before my father's death, when Mr. Darcy voluntarily promised to look after me, I believed it was as much out of gratitude to my father as it was out of affection for me.</t1589><t1590>"</t1590>
<t1591>"How strange!" cried Elizabeth.</t1591> <t1592>"How abominable!</t1592> <t1593>–This Mr. Darcy's pride prevented him from being fair to you!</t1593> <t1594>–Even if not driven by a better impulse, his pride should not have allowed him to act so basely –because I call what he did base.</t1594><t1595>"</t1595>
<t1596>"Great," answered Wickham, "because almost all of his actions can be attributed to pride; – and pride is often his best friend.</t1596> <t1597>His pride has made him closer to virtue than to other feelings.</t1597> <t1598>But none of us are consistent; in his behavior towards me, there were impulses even stronger than pride.</t1598><t1599>"</t1599>
<t1600>"I wonder if he ever saw any benefit from such a vile pride?"</t1600><t1601>"</t1601>
<t1602>"Yes.</t1602> <t1603>That pride often makes him tolerant and generous, –he spends his money lavishly, shows hospitality, supports his tenants, and feeds the poor.</t1603> <t1604>It was family pride, and the pride of being a son that did this –because he was very proud of his father.</t1604> <t1605>Not doing anything to disgrace his family, not deviating from popular traits, not losing the influence of Pemberley Manor, this is a strong impulse.</t1605> <t1606>There is also the pride of being a brother, which, combined with brotherly love, has made him a tender and attentive guardian of his sister; you hear from everyone that he is the most sensitive, the best brother.</t1606><t1607>"</t1607>
<t1608>"What kind of girl is Miss Darcy?"</t1608><t1609>"</t1609>
<t1610>He nodded his head.</t1610> <t1611>–"I wish I could call her cute.</t1611> <t1612>It pains me to speak ill of a Darcy.</t1612> <t1613>But she is just like her brother, –very, very proud.</t1613> <t1614>As a child, she was friendly, sweet, and very fond of me; I spent hours entertaining her.</t1614> <t1615>But now she means nothing to me.</t1615> <t1616>A beautiful girl, fifteen or sixteen years old, and from what I understand, quite talented.</t1616> <t1617>Since her father's death, her home has been in London, where a lady stays with her and oversees her education.</t1617><t1618>"</t1618>
<t1619>After many hesitations and trying many other topics, Elizabeth couldn't help but return to the first topic once again:</t1619>
<t1620>"I am surprised at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!</t1620> <t1621>How can Mr. Bingley, who seems to be a good-natured and truly charming person, be friends with such a man?</t1621> <t1622>How can they be compatible with each other?</t1622> <t1623>–Do you know Mr. Bingley?</t1623><t1624>"</t1624>
<t1625>"No.</t1625><t1626>"</t1626>
<t1627>"He is a sweet, charming, polite man.</t1627> <t1628>She must not have recognized Mr. Darcy.</t1628><t1629>"</t1629>
<t1630>"Probably; but Mr. Darcy can be pleasant when he chooses to be.</t1630> <t1631>He is not without talent.</t1631> <t1632>If he thinks it worth his time, he can be quite engaging.</t1632> <t1633>Among those whose fortunes are equal to his own, he is a very different person than he is among the poor.</t1633> <t1634>His pride never leaves him: but when he is with the wealthy, he is liberal-minded, fair, sincere, sensible, honest, and perhaps even charming – of course, one must give credit where credit is due.</t1634><t1635>"</t1635>
<t1636>The whist party ended shortly after; the players gathered around the other table; Mr. Collins took his place between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips.</t1636> <t1637>Mrs. Philips asked the usual questions about his success.</t1637> <t1638>It had not gone very well; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Philips began to express her regrets, he said with dignity that it did not matter at all, that he did not value money, and asked her not to feel uncomfortable.</t1638>
<t1639>"I know this very well, madam," he said, "when people sit at the gambling table, they try their luck – thankfully, I am not in a position to bet five shillings.</t1639> <t1640>Undoubtedly, there are many who cannot say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I do not need to concern myself with such small matters.</t1640><t1641>"</t1641>
<t1642>Mr. Wickham's eyes fell on Mr. Collins; after watching him for a few seconds, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice if her relative was well acquainted with the de Bourgh family.</t1642>
<t1643>"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," answered Elizabeth, "has recently given him a church.</t1643> <t1644>I don't know how Mr. Collins was introduced to her, but it's clear he hasn't known her for long.</t1644><t1645>"</t1645>
<t1646>"Of course you must know, Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; that is, the current Mr. Darcy's aunts."</t1646><t1647>"</t1647>
<t1648>"No, I truly didn't know.</t1648> <t1649>–I have no knowledge about Lady Catherine's relatives.</t1649> <t1650>Until the day before, I was unaware of their existence.</t1650><t1651>"</t1651>
<t1652>"It is believed that Miss de Bourgh, who will inherit a large fortune, is intended to unite her wealth with that of her cousin."</t1652><t1653>"</t1653>
<t1654>This information made Elizabeth smile, thinking of poor Miss Bingley.</t1654> <t1655>All her interest was in vain, the closeness she showed to his sister and the compliments she paid him were in vain and useless, since he had already chosen another girl.</t1655>
<t1656>"Mr. Collins," said Elizabeth, "You speak highly of both Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some of your words about her ladyship, I think your gratitude has misled you; though she is your patron, she is, in my opinion, an arrogant and conceited woman."</t1656><t1657>"</t1657>
<t1658>"Absolutely so," replied Wickham; "I haven't seen him for years, but I remember that I never liked him; his manner was dictatorial and condescending.</t1658> <t1659>He was famous for being very intelligent and clever; but I think he derived his abilities partly from his position and wealth, partly from his authoritative demeanor, and the rest from his nephew's pride; his nephew believes that everyone related to him possesses a first-rate intellect.</t1659><t1660>"</t1660>
<t1661>Elizabeth acknowledged that she had given a very reasonable explanation of the situation; they continued their conversation happily until the dinner call ended the card game and gave the other ladies a chance to share in Mr. Wickham's kindness.</t1661> <t1662>At Mrs. Philips' dinner party, the noise made conversation impossible, but Mr. Wickham's manners won everyone's admiration.</t1662> <t1663>Whatever he said was well said; whatever he did was done wonderfully.</t1663> <t1664>Elizabeth left the place with her mind full of him.</t1664> <t1665>All the way home, she could think of nothing but Mr. Wickham and what he had told her; but she found no time to mention his name, as neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins stopped talking for a moment.</t1665> <t1666>Lydia kept talking about lottery tickets, the ticket she lost, and the ticket she won; Mr. Collins went on about Mr. and Mrs. Philips' kindness, said he didn't mind his loss at whist in the least, listed all the dishes on the table, repeatedly asked if he had been a bother to his cousins, and when the carriage stopped at Longbourn House, he still hadn't finished telling everything he wanted to say.</t1666>
<t1667>Chapter XVII</t1667>
<t1668>Elizabeth told Jane what had happened between her and Wickham the next day.</t1668> <t1669>Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she did not know how to believe that Mr. Darcy was not as worthy of the esteem Mr. Bingley had shown him; yet, it was not in her nature to question the integrity of someone as pleasant-looking as Wickham.</t1669> <t1670>The possibility that Wickham had truly been subjected to such wrongs was enough to stir her compassionate feelings; therefore, there was nothing left to do but to think well of both, to defend each one's behavior, and in cases that could not be otherwise explained, to suggest an accident or mistake as the explanation.</t1670>
<t1671>"Both of them," he said, "were deceived, I think, in a way that we cannot understand.</t1671> <t1672>The relevant parties might have misrepresented one to the other.</t1672> <t1673>In short, it is impossible for us to guess the reasons or conditions that alienated them from each other without blaming either side.</t1673><t1674>"</t1674>
<t1675>"Very true indeed; –now dear Jane, what can you say on behalf of the concerned individuals who might have been involved in the matter?</t1675> <t1676>–Let's clear them too, otherwise we will have to sacrifice someone.</t1676><t1677>"</t1677>
<t1678>"Laugh as much as you want, but you can't change my mind by laughing.</t1678> <t1679>Dear Lizzy, think about how unpleasant it makes Mr. Darcy look to behave this way towards someone her father promised to look after, someone her father cares for.</t1679> <t1680>No one with a shred of humanity, no one who values their character even a little, could do this, it's beyond them.</t1680> <t1681>Could his closest friends have been so mistaken about him? –no! absolutely not.</t1681><t1682>"</t1682>
<t1683>"It is much easier for me to believe that Mr. Bingley was misled than to believe that Mr. Wickham fabricated a story about himself as he told me last night; names, facts, everything was told sincerely.</t1683> <t1684>If it is not so, let Mr. Darcy object.</t1684> <t1685>Moreover, there was truth in his gaze.</t1685><t1686>"</t1686>
<t1687>"It's hard, really –annoying.</t1687> <t1688>You don't know what to think.</t1688><t1689>"</t1689>
<t1690>Jane could believe only one thing – Mr. Bingley, if he was truly misled, would suffer greatly when the matter came to light.</t1690>
<t1691>Two young ladies were called from the shrubbery where this conversation was taking place; some of the people they had been talking about had arrived: Mr. Bingley and his sisters had come in person to extend an invitation for the long-awaited ball at Netherfield; the ball was to be held the following Tuesday.</t1691> <t1692>The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friends again, –they said it had been ages since they last met, and repeatedly asked what they had been up to since their last meeting.</t1692> <t1693>They paid little attention to the other members of the family; they kept as far away from Mrs. Bennet as possible, said very little to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.</t1693> <t1694>They soon left, rising from their seats with a speed that caught their brother unprepared, and rushed to the door as if to escape Mrs. Bennet's offerings.</t1694>
<t1695>The fact that a ball was to be held at Netherfield made every woman in the family extremely happy.</t1695> <t1696>Mrs. Bennet preferred to think that the ball was given as a compliment to her eldest daughter and took particular pride in receiving the invitation personally from Mr. Bingley rather than through a formal card.</t1696> <t1697>Jane imagined a happy evening in the company of her two friends and under the attention of their brothers; Elizabeth, in her delight, thought of dancing a lot with Mr. Wickham and seeing everything in Mr. Wickham's gaze and posture confirmed.</t1697> <t1698>The happiness Catherine and Lydia anticipated was not so dependent on a single event or person; although they, like Elizabeth, wanted to dance with Mr. Wickham, Mr. Wickham was not the only partner who could satisfy them, besides, a ball was always a ball.</t1698> <t1699>Even Mary told her family that she did not look unfavorably upon the ball.</t1699>
<t1700>"If I reserve my mornings for myself," he said, "that will be enough for me – I suppose missing the occasional evening gathering isn't a great loss.</t1700> <t1701>Society has expectations of us as well; I see myself as one of those who believe that breaks given for entertainment and relaxation are beneficial for everyone.</t1701><t1702>"</t1702>
<t1703>Elizabeth was so delighted at the mention of the ball that, despite usually avoiding conversation with Mr. Collins unless necessary, she couldn't help but ask if he was considering accepting Mr. Bingley's invitation and, if so, whether he found it appropriate to attend the evening festivities. She was surprised to see that he harbored no reservations and was far from fearing any rebuke from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh.</t1703>
<t1704>"My opinion is," he said, "that a ball given by a man of good character to respectable people cannot harbor ill tendencies; I have no personal objection to dancing, and I even hope to have the honor of holding my lovely cousins' hands throughout the evening; and indeed, while we're on the subject, Miss Elizabeth, I would especially like to request you for the first two dances, –I believe my cousin Jane will understand my preference and will not consider it disrespectful."</t1704><t1705>"</t1705>
<t1706>Elizabeth felt that she was caught badly.</t1706> <t1707>She had assumed she would be paired with Mr. Wickham for the dances; now, instead, Mr. Collins! –he couldn't have chosen a worse time to be mischievous.</t1707> <t1708>However, there was nothing to be done.</t1708> <t1709>Her happiness with Mr. Wickham was necessarily postponed for a while, and Mr. Collins's proposal was accepted with all the courtesy that could be mustered.</t1709> <t1710>What really bothered her about the man's assertiveness was the underlying idea it expressed.</t1710> <t1711>–Now, for the first time, she realized that she had been deemed worthy among her sisters to be the lady of Hunsford Parsonage, to form the quartet at the card table in Rosings when there were no more distinguished guests.</t1711> <t1712>The idea quickly turned into belief as she observed the man's increasing interest in her, listened to the compliments he showered on her intelligence and vivacity; although the effect of her charm surprised her more than it honored her, it wasn't long before her mother made it clear that she was quite warm to the possibility of their marriage.</t1712> <t1713>However, Elizabeth refused to acknowledge her mother's insinuation because she knew well that her response would result in a serious disagreement.</t1713> <t1714>Mr. Collins might never make the proposal, and until he did, it was pointless to quarrel over it.</t1714>
<t1715>If there were no ball to be prepared and talked about at Netherfield, the young Miss Bennets would be in a pitiable state at that time, because the continuous rain from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball prevented them from going to Meryton.</t1715> <t1716>No aunt, no officers, no news – even the pink shoes for Netherfield were ordered by mail.</t1716> <t1717>Even Elizabeth had her patience tested by the weather that prevented her from furthering her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday would have been difficult for Kitty and Lydia if there were no dance on Tuesday.</t1717>
<t1718>Chapter XVIII</t1718>
<t1719>It had never occurred to Elizabeth that there was any chance of Mr. Wickham not being present until she entered the sitting room at Netherfield and looked in vain among the cluster of redcoats gathered there.</t1719> <t1720>The belief that she would encounter him had not been tested by memories that might justifiably have made her uneasy.</t1720> <t1721>She had dressed with more than usual care, prepared with all her cheerfulness to conquer everything that remained unconquered in the man's heart, confident that there was not much left unconquered throughout the evening.</t1721> <t1722>But for a moment, she was seized by the suspicion that the Bingleys had deliberately omitted the officers from their invitations to please Mr. Darcy; although this was not the case, the fact of his absence was confirmed by his friend Mr. Denny, who, when approached by the curious Lydia, explained that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the previous day and had not yet returned, adding with a meaningful smile:</t1722>
<t1723>"If she didn't want to avoid a certain gentleman here, she wouldn't care about work or anything else right now."</t1723><t1724>"</t1724>
<t1725>Although this part of the explanation escaped Lydia's attention, it did not escape Elizabeth's, and even if her initial guess was not correct, it convinced her that the reason for Wickham's absence was Darcy; the coldness she felt towards Darcy hardened so much with her current disappointment that she had difficulty responding with reasonable politeness to Darcy's courteous questions when he approached her shortly after.</t1725> <t1726>Showing interest, patience, and understanding to Darcy meant insulting Wickham.</t1726> <t1727>She was determined not to speak to him in any way and turned her back with a certain petulance; her petulance did not fully subside even while talking to Mr. Bingley; she was also angry with him for not being impartial.</t1727>
<t1728>Aunt Elizabeth was not made for sulking; although all the dreams she had for the evening were shattered, the sulking did not last long; after pouring out all her sorrows to Charlotte Lucas, whom she hadn't seen for a week, she became willing to transition to her cousin's oddities and pointed her finger at Charlotte.</t1728> <t1729>However, the first two dances brought back her boredom; they were no different from a death dance.</t1729> <t1730>Clumsy and solemn Mr. Collins, instead of doing what was necessary, apologized and frequently took wrong steps unknowingly, giving Elizabeth all the embarrassment and discomfort that a terrible partner could give during several dances.</t1730> <t1731>The moment of getting rid of the man was wonderful.</t1731>
<t1732>Then she danced with an officer and had the pleasure of hearing everyone speak well of Wickham.</t1732> <t1733>When these dances ended, she turned to Charlotte Lucas; they had just started conversing when suddenly she found Mr. Darcy standing beside her, saying something; she was so caught off guard that when Mr. Darcy asked her to dance, she accepted without realizing it.</t1733> <t1734>Mr. Darcy left as quickly as he had come, and Elizabeth was left to lament her foolishness; Charlotte tried to console her.</t1734>
<t1735>"I think you will like him/her a lot."</t1735><t1736>"</t1736>
<t1737>"God forbid!</t1737> <t1738>–It would be the epitome of misfortune!</t1738> <t1739>–Liking someone you are determined to hate!</t1739> <t1740>–Don't wish such bad things for me.</t1740><t1741>"</t1741>
<t1742>Still, when the dance resumed and Darcy approached to ask her for a dance, Charlotte couldn't help but warn her: she whispered not to act childishly and not to let her fantasies about Wickham make her appear unattractive in the eyes of a man ten times richer.</t1742> <t1743>Elizabeth did not reply and took her place on the dance floor, marveling at the respectability she gained from the chance to stand opposite Mr. Darcy, and saw the same amazement on the faces of their observing neighbors.</t1743> <t1744>They stood without speaking for a while; Elizabeth thought their silence would last until the end of the two dances and initially decided not to break it, but then suddenly considered that forcing him to talk would be a greater punishment and made a few observations about the dance.</t1744> <t1745>Mr. Darcy replied, then fell silent again.</t1745> <t1746>After a few minutes of hesitation, Elizabeth spoke to him a second time – "It is now your turn to say something, Mr. Darcy.</t1746> <t1747>I talked about the dance, you could, for instance, say something about the dimensions of the room, or how many couples there are."</t1747><t1748>"</t1748>
<t1749>Mr. Darcy smiled and assured her that he would say whatever she wished.</t1749>
<t1750>"Very good.</t1750> <t1751>This answer is sufficient for now.</t1751> <t1752>Maybe in a bit, I'll say that private balls are more pleasant than public balls.</t1752> <t1753>But now we must be silent.</t1753><t1754>"</t1754>
<t1755>"Do you talk about rules while dancing?</t1755><t1756>"</t1756>
<t1757>"Sometimes.</t1757> <t1758>A person should talk a little, of course.</t1758> <t1759>Sitting in silence together for half an hour seems strange; but the conversation should be arranged in such a way that they can speak as little as possible to suit some people.</t1759><t1760>"</t1760>
<t1761>"Are you expressing your own feelings right now, or do you think you are responding to mine?</t1761><t1762>"</t1762>
<t1763>"Both," answered Elizabeth mischievously; "I have always seen a great similarity in our ways of thinking.</t1763> <t1764>We are both unsociable, stubborn, we do not like to talk, unless we hope to say something that will enchant the whole room and be passed down to future generations with proverbial grandeur.</t1764><t1765>"</t1765>
<t1766>"This is a picture that does not resemble your character at all," said Mr. Darcy.</t1766> <t1767>"I cannot say how close it is to mine either.</t1767> <t1768>But evidently, you think it is a faithful portrait."</t1768><t1769>"</t1769>
<t1770>"It is not for me to judge my own skill."</t1770><t1771>"</t1771>
<t1772>Mr. Darcy did not reply, and they did not speak again until the dance was over; then Mr. Darcy asked if they often walked to Meryton with their sisters.</t1772> <t1773>Elizabeth said yes, and unable to resist the provocation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we were just making a new acquaintance.</t1773><t1774>"</t1774>
<t1775>The effect of the words was seen immediately.</t1775> <t1776>A darker shadow of arrogance spread across his face, but he did not utter a single word; although Elizabeth blamed herself for her weakness, she could not continue the subject.</t1776> <t1777>Finally, Mr. Darcy spoke, and in a tense manner, said, "Mr. Wickham has such charming manners that he quickly makes friends – but I am not sure if he can keep them.</t1777><t1778>"</t1778>
<t1779>"Losing your friendship has been a great misfortune," replied Elizabeth emphatically, "and he will suffer from it for the rest of his life.</t1779><t1780>"</t1780>
<t1781>Darcy did not respond; he seemed to want to change the subject.</t1781> <t1782>At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared nearby; he intended to cross the room from the middle of the dance floor, but upon noticing Mr. Darcy, he stopped and bowed with superior courtesy, complimenting him on the dance and his partner.</t1782>
<t1783>"I am truly very impressed, sir.</t1783> <t1784>Such an exceptional dance is rarely seen.</t1784> <t1785>It is clear that you belong in the front ranks.</t1785> <t1786>But allow me to say, your lovely wife is not inferior to you; I hope for the frequent repetition of this pleasure, dear Miss Eliza, (glancing towards her sister and Bingley) especially when that happy day arrives.</t1786> <t1787>Then you will see the real congratulations!</t1787> <t1788>My request to Mr. Darcy: –but I won't keep you, sir.</t1788> <t1789>–If I deprive you of this young lady's conversation, you won't thank me, and her bright eyes are already scolding me."</t1789><t1790>"</t1790>
<t1791>Darcy barely heard the second half of these words, but Sir William's insinuation about his friend struck him; with a very serious expression, he turned his eyes to Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.</t1791> <t1792>Nevertheless, he quickly composed himself and turned to his companion, saying, "When Sir William interrupted, I forgot what we were talking about.</t1792><t1793>"</t1793>
<t1794>"I don't think we talked.</t1794> <t1795>Sir William couldn't have found two people who speak less to interrupt.</t1795> <t1796>We already tried two or three topics, it didn't work; I don't know what we will talk about now.</t1796><t1797>"</t1797>
<t1798>"What do you think about books?" he said, smiling.</t1798>
<t1799>"Books –No! absolutely not.</t1799> <t1800>–I'm sure we don't read the same books, and I'm also sure we don't read them with the same feelings.</t1800><t1801>"</t1801>
<t1802>"I am sorry you feel that way; but if that's the case, at least we won't run out of topics.</t1802> <t1803>–We can compare our different views.</t1803><t1804>"</t1804>
<t1805>"No – I cannot talk about books in a ballroom; my mind is always filled with other things.</t1805><t1806>"</t1806>
<t1807>"The current you is always preoccupied with such scenes – isn't it?" said Darcy, with a doubtful look.</t1807>
<t1808>"Yes, always," answered Elizabeth, not knowing what she was saying; her thoughts had wandered away from the subject; it became apparent a moment later when she suddenly spoke: "I remember you saying once, Mr. Darcy, that you do not forgive easily, that once you are offended, your resentment does not pass.</t1808> <t1809>I suppose you are very cautious not to be offended.</t1809><t1810>"</t1810>
<t1811>"Indeed," said Darcy in a firm voice.</t1811>
<t1812>"But wouldn't there be times when you let prejudice blind you?"</t1812><t1813>"</t1813>
<t1814>"I hope not.</t1814><t1815>"</t1815>
<t1816>"It is especially necessary for those who never change their opinions to arrive at the correct judgment in the first place."</t1816><t1817>"</t1817>
<t1818>"May I ask where these questions are leading to?</t1818><t1819>"</t1819>
<t1820>"I am merely trying to reveal your character," said Elizabeth, trying to shake off the weight on her.</t1820> <t1821>"I am trying to understand.</t1821><t1822>"</t1822>
<t1823>"Did you at least understand?</t1823><t1824>"</t1824>
<t1825>Elizabeth nodded, "I haven't made any progress at all.</t1825> <t1826>I hear such different things about you that it confuses me greatly.</t1826><t1827>"</t1827>
<t1828>"I believe that," Darcy replied seriously, "reports about me can vary greatly; I wish, Miss Bennet, that you would not attempt to sketch my character at this moment, for I have reasons to fear that your effort would not do justice to either side.</t1828><t1829>"</t1829>
<t1830>"But if I don't get an idea about you now, I might not have another chance."</t1830><t1831>"</t1831>
<t1832>"Then I shall not spoil your enjoyment," replied Darcy.</t1832> <t1833>Elizabeth said nothing more; they finished the other dance and parted in silence; neither was satisfied, though not equally; for there was a rather strong feeling in Darcy's chest towards her, which allowed him to quickly forgive her and direct all his anger towards someone else.</t1833>
<t1834>It hadn't been long since they parted when Miss Bingley came towards Elizabeth and, with a measured expression of disdain on her face, harassed her as follows: –"I heard, Miss Eliza, that you are quite fond of George Wickham!</t1834> <t1835>Your sister mentioned him to me, she kept asking a thousand questions; I realized that young man forgot to tell you some things, for instance, that he is old Wickham's son, that is, the late Mr. Darcy's steward.</t1835> <t1836>However, as a friend, my advice to you is not to believe everything he says immediately; as for Mr. Darcy having wronged him, that's a blatant lie; quite the contrary, he has always treated him very well, even though George Wickham has done everything possible to harm him.</t1836> <t1837>I don't know the details, but I do know that Mr. Darcy is not at fault in the slightest, and that he can't even bear to hear George Wickham's name; also, my brother thought he couldn't avoid inviting the officers, but he was very pleased to see him withdraw.</t1837> <t1838>His coming to the countryside is really a great impertinence; I truly wonder how he dared.</t1838> <t1839>I pity you for learning about your favorite's fault in this way, Miss Eliza; but honestly, considering the man's downfall, nothing better could be expected.</t1839><t1840>"</t1840>
<t1841>"His crime and his fall seem to be the same as in your story," said Elizabeth angrily; "because I haven't heard you accuse him of anything worse than being Mr. Darcy's steward's son, and rest assured, he himself had already told me as much."</t1841><t1842>"</t1842>
<t1843>"Excuse me," replied Miss Bingley, turning up her nose as she walked away.</t1843> <t1844>"Pardon my interference; I said it with good intentions.</t1844><t1845>"</t1845>
<t1846>"Arrogant thing!" said Elizabeth to herself.</t1846> <t1847>"If you think you can affect me with such pitiful attacks, you are very mistaken.</t1847> <t1848>I see nothing in this but your deliberate ignorance and Mr. Darcy's malice."</t1848> <t1849>Then she looked for her sister; Jane had begun to probe Bingley on the same matter.</t1849> <t1850>She greeted her with such a sweet smile of happiness, such a joyful glow, that it spoke volumes about how pleased she was with what had happened that evening.</t1850> <t1851>Elizabeth understood her feelings at that moment, and in that instant, her solidarity with Wickham, her anger towards Wickham's enemies, and everything else faded away in the face of the hope that Jane was on the most beautiful path to happiness.</t1851>
<t1852>"Tell me," she said with a face no less smiling than her sister's, "what did you learn about Mr. Wickham?</t1852> <t1853>But perhaps you were too occupied with happy things to think of a third person; if so, I apologize.</t1853><t1854>"</t1854>
<t1855>"No," said Jane, "I haven't forgotten him; but there is nothing proper to tell you.</t1855> <t1856>Mr. Bingley doesn't know the whole story; he also doesn't know what originally angered Mr. Darcy; but he vouches for his friend's moral conduct, honor, and integrity; moreover, he is certain that Mr. Wickham has been treated better than he deserves by Mr. Darcy; I'm sorry to say that from what I've heard from him and his sister, Mr. Wickham is not a very reputable young man.</t1856> <t1857>I'm afraid he has behaved too recklessly and deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's trust.</t1857><t1858>"</t1858>
<t1859>"Does Mr. Bingley not know Mr. Wickham personally?"</t1859><t1860>"</t1860>
<t1861>"No; she had never seen him before last morning in Meryton."</t1861><t1862>"</t1862>
<t1863>"Then the things they know are what Mr. Darcy taught them.</t1863> <t1864>I am quite satisfied.</t1864> <t1865>So what does he say about the church?</t1865><t1866>"</t1866>
<t1867>"She has heard from Mr. Darcy a few times but does not remember the events well, yet believes that the church was left to him conditionally.</t1867><t1868>"</t1868>
<t1869>"I have no doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly: "but do not expect me to be convinced merely by suggestions.</t1869> <t1870>It is quite normal for Mr. Bingley to defend his friend; but since he does not know every aspect of the story and has learned the other sides from his friend, I believe I will continue to think the same about both gentlemen as before.</t1870><t1871>"</t1871>
<t1872>Then he moved on to a topic that both would enjoy more and would not disagree on.</t1872> <t1873>He listened with pleasure to Jane's happy but modest hopes regarding Bingley's intentions and said everything he could to boost Jane's confidence.</t1873> <t1874>When Mr. Bingley came over, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas's side; before Miss Lucas could answer whether she liked her last husband, Mr. Collins came over and, in a state of rapture, said he had just made a very important discovery.</t1874>
<t1875>"I learned by accident," he said, "that there is a close relative of my boss in the room right now.</t1875> <t1876>I happened to overhear the gentleman personally telling the young lady of the house, Miss de Bourgh, and her mother, Lady Catherine's names.</t1876> <t1877>What wonderful things happen in life!</t1877> <t1878>Who would have thought that I might meet a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this gathering!</t1878> <t1879>I am grateful to have learned this in time, so I can go and pay my respects now; I hope they will excuse me for not having gone earlier.</t1879> <t1880>My excuse is my ignorance of the relationship.</t1880><t1881>"</t1881>
<t1882>"You will not introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!"</t1882><t1883>"</t1883>
<t1884>"Of course, I will introduce you.</t1884> <t1885>I will also apologize for not introducing you earlier.</t1885> <t1886>I believe you are Lady Catherine's niece.</t1886> <t1887>I will tell her that until last night, her Ladyship was in good health and spirits.</t1887><t1888>"</t1888>
<t1889>Elizabeth tried very hard to dissuade him from the plan, saying that she would consider it an impertinent liberty rather than a compliment to her aunt for Mr. Darcy to speak to her without an introduction, that neither party needed such communication, and that even if they did, the right to initiate the acquaintance belonged to Mr. Darcy, who was superior in rank.</t1889> <t1890>Mr. Collins listened to her with a determined air of knowing better, and when she had finished speaking, he replied: "Dear Miss Elizabeth, I have great respect for your immense judgment in all matters within your understanding; but allow me to say, there is a great difference between the established rules of conduct among worldly men and those governing clergymen; permit me also to express that I see the religious office as equal in sanctity to the highest position in the kingdom – of course, maintaining humble behavior.</t1890> <t1891>Therefore, allow me to do what my conscience tells me to do in this situation; my conscience urges me to do what I see as a duty.</t1891> <t1892>Forgive me for neglecting to take advantage of your advice; in every other matter, your advice will be my guide, but in the present issue, I consider myself more qualified than a young lady like you to decide what is right due to my education and occupation.</t1892><t1893>"</t1893> <t1894>And with a slight bow, he left her to approach Mr. Darcy; Elizabeth watched with curiosity as Mr. Darcy received him: it was very clear that he was surprised to be approached in such a manner.</t1894> <t1895>Her cousin began his speech with a slight bow: although Elizabeth could not hear a single word, she felt as if she heard everything; she saw the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh" in the movement of his lips.</t1895> <t1896>It annoyed her to see him make a fool of himself to such a man.</t1896> <t1897>Mr. Darcy was looking at him with boundless astonishment; when Mr. Collins finally allowed him to speak, he replied with an air of distant politeness.</t1897> <t1898>Nevertheless, Mr. Collins's courage to speak again was not broken; the length of the second speech increased Mr. Darcy's disdain, and in the end, he merely gave a slight bow and walked away in the other direction.</t1898> <t1899>Mr. Collins turned back to Elizabeth.</t1899>
<t1900>"I assure you," he said, "I have no complaints about the way I was received.</t1900> <t1901>Mr. Darcy seemed very pleased with the attention I showed.</t1901> <t1902>He gave extremely kind responses and even paid a compliment, saying that he trusted Lady Catherine's decisions so much that he knew she would never do a favor to someone undeserving.</t1902> <t1903>It was indeed a very nice thought.</t1903> <t1904>As a result, I was very pleased with him.</t1904><t1905>"</t1905>
<t1906>When Elizabeth had no business of her own to attend to, she immediately turned all her attention to her sister and Mr. Bingley; the train of thoughts that emerged from her observations made her almost as happy as Jane.</t1906><t1907>She imagined Jane settled in the same house with all the happiness that a true love marriage could bring; and under those circumstances, she felt that she could even try to love Bingley's two sisters.</t1907><t1908>She could clearly see that her mother's thoughts were in the same direction and decided not to approach her for fear of hearing too much.</t1908><t1909>When they sat down to dinner, she saw that by a stroke of bad luck she was seated next to her; and her spirits sank even further when she saw her mother freely and openly conversing with Lady Lucas on her other side, constantly talking about how she hoped Jane would soon marry Mr. Bingley.</t1909><t1910>–It was an exciting topic, and Mrs. Bennet seemed tireless in enumerating the advantages of that union.</t1910><t1911>The most significant sources of joy were that the man was so charming, so rich, and lived only three miles away from them; then, seeing how fond Bingley's two sisters were of Jane, and how much they desired the union as much as she did, was a great comfort.</t1911><t1912>Moreover, it was a promising thing for her younger sisters as well, because Jane making such a great marriage would pave the way for them to find wealthy men; and finally, knowing that at her age, she could place her unmarried daughters under their sister's protection and not have to go out into society unless she wanted to was a source of happiness.</t1912><t1913>This situation had to be turned into a source of pleasure because etiquette required it; but no one could enjoy staying at home less than Mrs. Bennet at any period of her life.</t1913><t1914>She ended her words with wishes for Lady Lucas to be as fortunate as she was, although she clearly and joyfully believed that this was not possible.</t1914>
<t1915>Elizabeth tried in vain to control the speed of her mother's words, to persuade her to recount her happiness in a less audible whisper; she was extremely annoyed to see that most of her mother's words were reaching the ears of Mr. Darcy, who was sitting opposite.</t1915> <t1916>Her mother contented herself with scolding her, saying she was being foolish.</t1916>
<t1917>"What do I care about Mr. Darcy, for heaven's sake, why should I be afraid of him?</t1917> <t1918>I'm sure we don't owe him the courtesy of not saying things he wouldn't like to hear.</t1918><t1919>"</t1919>
<t1920>"Please, mother, speak softly.</t1920> <t1921>What can offending Mr. Darcy gain you?</t1921> <t1922>–You cannot make him speak well of you to his friend by acting this way.</t1922><t1923>"</t1923>
<t1924>Nothing he said worked.</t1924> <t1925>His mother continued to voice her thoughts in the same audible tone.</t1925> <t1926>Elizabeth blushed repeatedly in shame and discomfort.</t1926> <t1927>She often couldn't resist glancing at Mr. Darcy, and each time she realized her worst fear had come true; even if Mr. Darcy wasn't always looking at her mother, Elizabeth felt his attention was constantly fixed on her mother.</t1927> <t1928>The expression on his face gradually shifted from a haughty disdain to a calm and steady seriousness.</t1928>
<t1929>Finally, Mrs. Bennet had nothing more to say; Lady Lucas, who had begun to yawn from repeatedly hearing the pleasures that Mrs. Bennet deemed impossible to share, was left with the taste of cold ham and chicken.</t1929><t1930>Elizabeth then began to come to her senses.</t1930><t1931>However, the silence did not last long; after the meal, there was talk of singing, and she saw that Mary was preparing to respond to the requests after very little insistence.</t1931><t1932>She tried to prevent such an indiscretion with meaningful looks and silent pleas, but in vain; Mary did not understand these; she liked the opportunity to show off; she began her song.</t1932><t1933>Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her in agony, she watched impatiently as Mary progressed through several verses, but as the verses ended, she saw that it was not worth the patience, because when Mary seemed to receive a signal for another song among the table's thanks, she started a new song after a half-minute pause.</t1933><t1934>Mary's talents were not suited for such a display; her voice was weak, her manner affected.</t1934><t1935>Elizabeth was in pain.</t1935><t1936>She looked at Jane to see how she was enduring it; but Jane was calmly talking to Bingley.</t1936><t1937>She looked at her two sisters, saw that they were making signs of disdain to each other; she looked at Darcy, but he maintained his incomprehensibly serious demeanor.</t1937><t1938>She looked at her father, hoping he would intervene so that Mary would not sing all night.</t1938><t1939>Her father got the signal, and when Mary finished her second song, he said loudly, "You sang wonderfully, my dear.</t1939><t1940>You have made us all happy enough.</t1940><t1941>Let some other young ladies show themselves now.</t1941><t1942>"</t1942>
<t1943>Although Mary pretended not to hear, she was a bit upset; Elizabeth, who was worried for her and for her father's words, feared that her concern was in vain.</t1943> <t1944>Then the other members of the group were consulted.</t1944>
<t1945>"If I were fortunate enough to be able to sing," said Mr. Collins, "I would take great pleasure in entertaining this assembly with a song; I see music as a very innocent occupation, perfectly in harmony with the profession of clergy.</t1945><t1946>–However, I do not say we should devote too much time to music, because there are other things that need attention.</t1946><t1947>A village parson has many duties to attend to.</t1947><t1948>–For one, he must make a contribution agreement that will be beneficial to himself and not disturb his patron.</t1948><t1949>He must write his own sermons; the remaining time is barely enough for church duties and the maintenance and repair of his home, and it would be inexcusable not to make his home as comfortable as possible.</t1949><t1950>Moreover, I find it very important that he should have a careful and conciliatory attitude towards everyone, especially towards those to whom he owes his appointment.</t1950><t1951>I cannot absolve him from this duty; in fact, let me say, I would not look kindly on him missing an opportunity to show his respect to anyone connected with the family."</t1951><t1952>And he concluded his speech by bowing to Mr. Darcy; he had spoken so loudly that half the room had heard him.</t1952><t1953>–Many people stared –many people smiled; but no one seemed more amused than Mr. Bennet; at that moment his wife was seriously engaged in praising Mr. Collins for making such a meaningful speech: in a half-whisper she was telling Lady Lucas that he was quite an intelligent, well-bred young man.</t1953>
<t1954>It seemed to Elizabeth as if her entire family had conspired to disgrace themselves throughout the evening; they could not have played their roles more sincerely or with greater success; she was glad for Bingley and her sister that he had missed some of the disgrace; fortunately, Bingley's feelings were not the kind to be troubled by the foolishness he must have witnessed.</t1954> <t1955>However, it was bad enough that her two sisters had found an opportunity to mock Mr. Darcy's relatives, and Elizabeth could not decide whether Mr. Darcy's silent disdain or the two ladies' insolent smiles were more unbearable.</t1955>
<t1956>The rest of the evening brought very little amusement.</t1956> <t1957>She was weary of Mr. Collins, who stubbornly stood by her side; although he could not persuade her to dance again, he also did not allow her to dance with others.</t1957> <t1958>Elizabeth tried in vain to get rid of him; she even offered to introduce him to one of the young ladies in the room.</t1958> <t1959>The man said that he did not care in the least about dancing, that his main aim was to win her favor by showing delicate attention, and therefore he insisted on staying by her side all evening.</t1959> <t1960>There was no arguing with such a project.</t1960> <t1961>Her friend Miss Lucas often came over to them and meekly took over the task of listening to Mr. Collins' conversation, which allowed Elizabeth to feel somewhat at ease.</t1961>
<t1962>At least she did not have to endure the boredom that Mr. Darcy could cause; although he was often very close and standing by himself, he never came close enough to talk.</t1962> <t1963>Elizabeth felt that this might be the result of his implications regarding Mr. Wickham, and she was pleased.</t1963>
<t1964>The Longbourn group was the last to leave; due to Mrs. Bennet's maneuver, they had to wait fifteen minutes after everyone else had left for their carriage, which gave them the opportunity to see how heartily some members of the family wished for their departure.</t1964> <t1965>Mrs. Hurst and her sister hardly opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue; it was clear that they wanted the house to themselves.</t1965> <t1966>They repelled every attempt Mrs. Bennet made to start a conversation, thereby creating a severe silence over the whole group; Mr. Collins' long speeches, full of compliments about the elegance of the entertainment arranged by Mr. Bingley and his sisters, and their hospitality and kindness as a mark of their treatment of their guests, did nothing to ease them.</t1966> <t1967>Darcy said nothing.</t1967> <t1968>Mr. Bennet, in the same silence, was enjoying the scene.</t1968> <t1969>Mr. Bingley and Jane stood a little apart from the others, talking only to each other.</t1969> <t1970>Elizabeth also maintained her steady silence with Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; even Lydia, except for occasionally exclaiming "My God, how tired I am!" with a violent yawn, was too exhausted to say anything else.</t1970>
<t1971>When they finally rose to leave, Mrs. Bennet, in her most polite manner, expressed her hope of seeing the entire family at Longbourn as soon as possible. Addressing Mr. Bingley specifically, she mentioned that there was no need for formalities between them and that they would be very happy if he and his family came to dinner without waiting for an invitation.</t1971> <t1972>Bingley was very pleased and promised to visit them as soon as he returned from London, where he had to go for a short while the next day.</t1972>
<t1973>Mrs. Bennet was quite satisfied; if she allowed some time for the necessary preparations, new carriages, and wedding clothes, it was certain that within three or four months she would see her daughter settled at Netherfield; she left the house in this delight.</t1973> <t1974>She thought with the same conviction and, if not the same, considerable pleasure that another of her daughters would marry Mr. Collins.</t1974> <t1975>Among her children, she was the least fond of Elizabeth; both the man and the marriage were quite suitable for Elizabeth, but of course, Mr. Bingley and Netherfield were much more valuable than them.</t1975>
<t1976>Chapter XIX</t1976>
<t1977>The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.</t1977> <t1978>Mr. Collins formally made his proposal.</t1978> <t1979>Determined not to waste any time since his leave was only until the following Saturday, and feeling no shyness that would turn the matter into a tension for him at that moment, he set to work in a very orderly manner, adhering to all the rules he considered a usual part of the business.</t1979> <t1980>When he found Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together immediately after breakfast, he addressed the mother with these words: "Madam, may I hope to obtain your approval if I request the honor of a private audience with your fair daughter Elizabeth this morning?</t1980><t1981>"</t1981>
<t1982>Elizabeth, her face flushed with astonishment, before she could find an opportunity to say anything, Mrs. Bennet immediately replied, "Oh my God! –Yes –of course.</t1982> <t1983>I am sure Lizzy will be very happy –I am sure she will not object.</t1983> <t1984>Come, Kitty, I need you upstairs."</t1984> <t1985>As she gathered her things and hurried away, Elizabeth called after her,</t1985>
<t1986>"Mother, don't go.</t1986> <t1987>I beg you, don't go.</t1987> <t1988>Mr. Collins must excuse me.</t1988> <t1989>He cannot have anything to say to me that no one else should hear.</t1989> <t1990>I am going myself.</t1990><t1991>"</t1991>
<t1992>"No, no, don't be ridiculous, Lizzy.</t1992> <t1993>Please stay where you are."</t1993> <t1994>And when he realized that Elizabeth was indeed about to flee with a troubled and anxious face, he added, "Lizzy, I insist that you sit and listen to Mr. Collins.</t1994><t1995>"</t1995>
<t1996>Elizabeth could not resist such coercion – after a moment's thought, she decided that the wisest course was to get through this quickly and quietly, and she sat down again; she tried to mask her feelings, torn between discomfort and patience, with the work in her hand.</t1996> <t1997>Mrs. Bennet and Kitty went outside; as soon as they left, Mr. Collins began to speak.</t1997>
<t1998>"Believe me, dear Elizabeth, your modesty, far from doing you any disservice, adds perfection to your perfection.</t1998> <t1999>If it were not for this little unwillingness, you would appear less admirable in my eyes; but allow me to assure you, I have obtained your venerable mother's permission for this conversation.</t1999> <t2000>You cannot doubt the purpose of my words, but your natural delicacy may cause your mind to be confused; the interest I have shown was too evident to be disregarded.</t2000> <t2001>As soon as I entered the house, I chose you as my future life partner.</t2001> <t2002>But before my feelings on the subject take over my senses, it might be appropriate to state my reasons for marriage – indeed, the reason for my coming to Hertfordshire with the intention of choosing a wife.</t2002><t2003>"</t2003>
<t2004>Looking at his solemn demeanor, the thought that Mr. Collins's feelings could sweep him off his feet almost made Elizabeth laugh; therefore, she couldn't use the brief pause to prevent the man from going further; Mr. Collins continued:–</t2004>
<t2005>"My reasons for getting married are as follows; first, I think it is right for a clergyman with comfortable conditions (like myself) to set an example of marriage in his village; second, I believe my happiness will greatly increase; third – and perhaps I should have mentioned this first, it is the special advice and recommendation of that noble lady whom I have the honor to call my patroness.</t2005> <t2006>She gave me her opinion on this matter twice (unsolicited); it was the Saturday night before I left Hunsford – between the quadrilles, Mrs. Jenkinson was adjusting Miss de Bourgh's footstool, and she said, 'Mr. Collins, you must marry.</t2006> <t2007>A clergyman like you must marry.</t2007> <t2008>–Make a suitable choice, select a young lady for my sake; for your own sake, she should be lively, useful, not overly pampered, but able to manage a small income.</t2008> <t2009>That is my advice.</t2009> <t2010>Find such a woman as soon as possible, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit.</t2010><t2011>'</t2011> <t2012>Meanwhile, my dear cousin, allow me to mention that I do not consider the privilege of being able to present you with Lady Catherine de Bourgh's interest and kindness as the least of my advantages.</t2012> <t2013>You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; your intelligence and liveliness, I believe, will be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the awe her rank will inspire.</t2013> <t2014>That is enough explanation for my intention to consider marriage; now it remains to explain why my thoughts have directed me to Longbourn instead of my own neighborhood; believe me, there are many beautiful young women in my own neighborhood.</t2014> <t2015>But the truth is, after the death of your esteemed father (may he live long), this estate will pass to me, and I would not feel at ease unless I chose one of his daughters as my wife to lessen the loss they would suffer, which I repeat, may it be long delayed.</t2015> <t2016>That was my reason, dear cousin; I believe this will not lower me in your eyes.</t2016> <t2017>Now it only remains to convince you of the intensity of my feelings in the most colorful language.</t2017> <t2018>I have no concern about a dowry; I will not make such a demand from your father, as I am aware it is impossible to meet; the only thing you may have a right to is that thousand-pound bond at 4 percent interest, which will not come to you until after your mother's death.</t2018> <t2019>I will not say a word about this; and rest assured, when we are married, not a single ungenerous complaint will ever escape my lips.</t2019><t2020>"</t2020>
<t2021>It was now necessary to stop him.</t2021>
<t2022>"You are in too much of a hurry," cried Elizabeth.</t2022> <t2023>"You forget that I have not answered.</t2023> <t2024>Let me answer without wasting time.</t2024> <t2025>Accept my thanks for your compliments.</t2025> <t2026>I appreciate the sincerity of your proposal, but there is nothing I can do except say no.</t2026><t2027>"</t2027>
<t2028>"I do not wish to learn immediately," Mr. Collins replied, waving his hand formally, "it is normal for young ladies to reject the proposal of a man they intend to accept at first; sometimes a second, or even a third refusal may occur.</t2028> <t2029>Therefore, your words never discourage me; I hope to soon lead you to the altar."</t2029><t2030>"</t2030>
<t2031>"Believe me, sir," cried Elizabeth, "it is very strange that you still have hope after my explanation.</t2031> <t2032>I assure you, I am not one of those girls who would risk their happiness by expecting a second proposal (if such girls even exist).</t2032> <t2033>I am extremely serious in my refusal.</t2033> <t2034>You cannot make me happy, and I am certain that I am the last woman in the world who could make you happy.</t2034> <t2035>Moreover, if your friend Lady Catherine knew me, I know she would find me inadequate in every respect.</t2035><t2036>"</t2036>
<t2037>"Even if Lady Catherine is certain to think so," said Mr. Collins seriously, "I don't think she will object to you.</t2037> <t2038>You can be sure that when I have the honor of seeing her again, I will speak highly of your humility, modesty, and other positive qualities.</t2038><t2039>"</t2039>
<t2040>"Believe me, Mr. Collins, it will not be necessary for you to praise me.</t2040> <t2041>Allow me to evaluate myself; and please be kind enough to believe what I say.</t2041> <t2042>I wish you happiness and wealth, and by rejecting your proposal, I have done my utmost to prevent you from being otherwise.</t2042> <t2043>By proposing to me, you must have satisfied your kind feelings towards my family; you can take the Longbourn estate without any pangs of conscience when it becomes available.</t2043> <t2044>Therefore, this matter should be considered closed."</t2044> <t2045>As she said this, she stood up and was leaving the room when Mr. Collins spoke again:</t2045>
<t2046>"I hope that when I have the honor of discussing the matter with you next time, you will give me a more positive answer than you have now; I will not accuse you of cruelty at this moment, because I know it is customary for women to reject men at the first proposal; perhaps even now you have said enough to encourage me within the true delicacy of the female character."</t2046><t2047>"</t2047>
<t2048>"Well, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth, beginning to get angry, "you astonish me greatly.</t2048> <t2049>If what I have said so far seems like a promise to you, I don't know how else to say no to convince you.</t2049><t2050>"</t2050>
<t2051>"Allow me to give myself some credit, dear cousin; your refusal of my offer is merely in words.</t2051> <t2052>Here are my reasons for believing so: –It does not seem to me that I am unworthy of you, and the life I offer is quite attractive.</t2052> <t2053>My position in life, my connections with the De Bourgh family, our kinship, all these are in my favor; if you think more thoroughly, despite your many charms, it appears you have not received any other marriage proposals so far.</t2053> <t2054>Unfortunately, your income is so small that it surely diminishes the effect of your beauty and charming qualities.</t2054> <t2055>Therefore, I conclude that you are not serious in rejecting me; as a reason for your refusal, I see that, as is customary for polite ladies, you wish to increase my love by making me wait.</t2055><t2056>"</t2056>
<t2057>"Believe me, sir, I have no such courtesies as to torture a respectable man.</t2057> <t2058>I would be more pleased if my sincerity is believed.</t2058> <t2059>Thank you again and again for the honor you have given me with your offer, but it is impossible for me to accept your offer.</t2059> <t2060>My feelings forbid it in every respect.</t2060> <t2061>Could I be more clear?</t2061> <t2062>Now, think of me not as a polite woman trying to stall you, but as a sensible person speaking the truth from her heart.</t2062><t2063>"</t2063>
<t2064>"You are extremely charming!" exclaimed Mr. Collins, with an air of awkward flirtation; "I believe that my proposal will be accepted once it is clearly approved by both of your parents."</t2064><t2065>"</t2065>
<t2066>Faced with such a stubbornness of self-deception, Elizabeth could not find an answer to give and immediately and quietly withdrew; if he insisted on interpreting her no as a promise of hope, she decided to appeal to her father; her father would say no in such a way that it would be understood as final; her father's behavior could not be mistaken for the coquetry or coyness of a polite woman.</t2066>
<t2067>Chapter XX</t2067>
<t2068>Mr. Collins could not remain alone with his dreams of successful love for long; Mrs. Bennet, who had been lingering in the hall waiting for the conversation to end, entered the breakfast room when she saw Elizabeth open the door and pass by her quickly to go up the stairs, and warmly congratulated both Mr. Collins and herself on the possibility of becoming closer relatives.</t2068> <t2069>Mr. Collins accepted these congratulations and responded with equal pleasure; then he proceeded to recount the details of the meeting; he believed he had every reason to be satisfied with the outcome of the conversation, as his cousin's persistent refusal stemmed from her shy modesty and genuine elegance of character.</t2069>
<t2070>This information still surprised Mrs. Bennet; –she would have been equally pleased if her daughter had opposed the proposal with the intention of encouraging him, but she did not dare to believe it, and could not help but say that she did not dare.</t2070>
<t2071>"But rest assured, Mr. Collins," she added, "Lizzy will come to her senses.</t2071> <t2072>I will speak to her personally.</t2072> <t2073>She is a very stubborn, foolish girl who doesn't know her own interest, but I will make sure she understands.</t2073><t2074>"</t2074>
<t2075>"Forgive me for interrupting, madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but if she is truly stubborn and foolish, I am not sure if she would be a reasonable wife for a man like me who naturally seeks happiness in marriage.</t2075> <t2076>If she persists in rejecting my proposal, it would be better not to force her to accept me, because if she has such flaws, she would not contribute much to my happiness.</t2076><t2077>"</t2077>
<t2078>"Sir, you misunderstood," said Mrs. Bennet, becoming frightened.</t2078> <t2079>"Lizzy is only stubborn about matters like this.</t2079> <t2080>In every other matter, she is the most good-natured girl in the world.</t2080> <t2081>I will go straight to Mr. Bennet and take Elizabeth to settle the matter, I am sure.</t2081><t2082>"</t2082>
<t2083>Without giving the man time to respond, she immediately hurried to her husband, calling out as she entered the library, "Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are urgently needed; we are in great distress.</t2083> <t2084>You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins; she is insisting she won't, and if you don't hurry, the man will change his mind about taking her.</t2084><t2085>"</t2085>
<t2086>As she entered, Mr. Bennet lifted his eyes from his book and fixed them on his wife's face with a calm indifference that was unaffected by what he heard.</t2086>
<t2087>"I haven't had the pleasure of understanding you," he said when his wife finished speaking.</t2087> <t2088>"What are you talking about?</t2088><t2089>"</t2089>
<t2090>"From Mr. Collins and Lizzy.</t2090> <t2091>Lizzy says she doesn't want Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins is about to say he doesn't want Lizzy.</t2091><t2092>"</t2092>
<t2093>"So what should I do?</t2093> <t2094>–The situation looks hopeless.</t2094><t2095>"</t2095>
<t2096>"You talk to Lizzy.</t2096> <t2097>Tell her that you insisted on marrying the man.</t2097><t2098>"</t2098>
<t2099>"Let them come.</t2099> <t2100>Let them learn my opinion.</t2100><t2101>"</t2101>
<t2102>Mrs. Bennet rang the bell; Miss Elizabeth was called to the library.</t2102>
<t2103>"Come here, my child," said her father when Elizabeth appeared at the door.</t2103> <t2104>"I called you for an important matter.</t2104> <t2105>I heard that Mr. Collins has proposed to you.</t2105> <t2106>Is it true?</t2106><t2107>"</t2107>
<t2108>Elizabeth said it was true.</t2108>
<t2109>"Alright – did you also reject the marriage proposal?</t2109><t2110>"</t2110>
<t2111>"Yes, sir."</t2111><t2112>"</t2112>
<t2113>"Alright.</t2113> <t2114>Now we get to the point.</t2114> <t2115>Your mother insists that you accept.</t2115> <t2116>Isn't that right, Mrs. Bennet?</t2116><t2117>"</t2117>
<t2118>"Yes, otherwise I won't look at your face again."</t2118><t2119>"</t2119>
<t2120>"You have an unhappy choice before you, Elizabeth.</t2120> <t2121>From this day onward, you must be a stranger to one of your parents.</t2121> <t2122>Your mother says she will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do.</t2122><t2123>"</t2123>
<t2124>Elizabeth couldn't help but smile at such a beginning leading to such an end; but Mrs. Bennet, who believed that her husband would handle the matter as she wished, was very surprised.</t2124>
<t2125>"What do you mean by talking this way, Mr. Bennet?</t2125> <t2126>You promised me that you would insist on her marrying him.</t2126><t2127>"</t2127>
<t2128>"My dear," replied her husband, "I am asking for two favors.</t2128> <t2129>First, allow me to use my mind freely on this matter, and then my room.</t2129> <t2130>The sooner my library is left to me, the happier I will be.</t2130><t2131>"</t2131>
<t2132>Even though she was disappointed in her husband, Mrs. Bennet did not give up easily.</t2132> <t2133>She repeatedly talked to Elizabeth; sometimes she tried to flatter her, sometimes she threatened her.</t2133> <t2134>She also tried to get Jane on her side; but Jane, with all her mildness, avoided getting involved; Elizabeth responded to her mother's attacks sometimes with genuine excitement, sometimes with cheerful jesting.</t2134> <t2135>Though her style changed from time to time, her determination did not.</t2135>
<t2136>Meanwhile, Mr. Collins had fallen into solitary contemplation over what had transpired.</t2136> <t2137>He thought too highly of himself to understand why his cousin might reject him; although his pride was wounded, he felt no other pain.</t2137> <t2138>He had a very fanciful interest in Elizabeth; the possibility of deserving his mother's scoldings prevented him from feeling any regret.</t2138>
<t2139>While the family was in this turmoil, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them.</t2139> <t2140>She was met in the hall by Lydia; Lydia threw herself at her and exclaimed in a half-whisper, "I'm glad you came, because there's some strange fun here!</t2140> <t2141>–Guess what happened this morning?</t2141> <t2142>–Mr. Collins proposed to Lizzy, and Lizzy said she didn't want to.</t2142><t2143>"</t2143>
<t2144>Before Charlotte could respond, Kitty also came over to share the same news; as soon as they entered the breakfast room where Mrs. Bennet was sitting alone, Mrs. Bennet brought up the subject and asked Miss Lucas to take pity on their situation and persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of the entire family.</t2144> <t2145>"Please speak, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a sorrowful tone, "no one is on my side, no one supports me, they are being cruel to me, no one considers my nerves.</t2145><t2146>"</t2146>
<t2147>Charlotte's response was interrupted by Jane and Elizabeth's entrance.</t2147>
<t2148>"Oh, here he comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "look, he doesn't care at all; as if we were in York and he couldn't see us, doing whatever he pleases.</t2148> <t2149>–But let me tell you, Miss Lizzy –if you keep rejecting every suitor like this, you'll never find a husband –who do you think will take care of you when your father dies?</t2149> <t2150>–I certainly won't be able to take care of you –so I'm warning you.</t2150> <t2151>–From this day forward, I have nothing more to do with you.</t2151> <t2152>–Didn't I tell you in the library that I wouldn't speak to you again, see how I'm keeping my word.</t2152> <t2153>I don't speak to ungrateful children.</t2153> <t2154>–If it were up to me, I wouldn't speak to anyone.</t2154> <t2155>People with nervous complaints like mine are not inclined to talk.</t2155> <t2156>Only I know what I have suffered.</t2156> <t2157>They say those who don't express their troubles have no one to pity them.</t2157><t2158>"</t2158>
<t2159>The girls listened to this plea in silence, knowing that trying to talk to her or calm her down would only increase her discomfort.</t2159> <t2160>Mrs. Bennet kept complaining, and no one intervened until Mr. Collins came to join them; seeing Mr. Collins enter with an even more pompous air than usual, Mrs. Bennet told the girls, "Now all of you hold your tongues and let me have a little chat with Mr. Collins alone."</t2160><t2161>"</t2161>
<t2162>Elizabeth quietly left the room, followed by Jane and Kitty, but Lydia remained in place, determined to hear everything she could; Charlotte stayed there first because of Mr. Collins' interest, who inquired thoroughly about her and her family's well-being, and then out of a little curiosity, she walked to the window and pretended not to hear while satisfying her curiosity.</t2162> <t2163>In a distressed voice, Mrs. Bennet began the anticipated conversation: –"Oh, Mr. Collins dear!</t2163><t2164>"</t2164>
<t2165>"Dear madam," replied Mr. Collins, "let us forever maintain our silence on this matter.</t2165> <t2166>It is not my place," he continued immediately after, in a voice that emphasized his displeasure, "to condemn your daughter's behavior.</t2166> <t2167>It is our duty to face unexpected disasters with resignation; it is especially the duty of a young man like myself, who has had the fortune to rise at a young age; and I have indeed resigned myself.</t2167> <t2168>It is not because I doubted the happiness I would feel if my beautiful cousin had granted me the honor of taking my hand; I have often observed that resignation takes on a marvelous quality when the beauty we are deprived of begins to lose its value in our eyes.</t2168> <t2169>I hope you do not think I have disrespected your family by withdrawing my claims regarding your daughter without showing the courtesy of asking you and Mr. Bennet to use your influence in my favor.</t2169> <t2170>I fear it may not be pleasant that I accepted the rejection from your daughter rather than from you.</t2170> <t2171>But we can all make mistakes.</t2171> <t2172>Throughout the whole matter, I was certainly very well-intentioned.</t2172> <t2173>My aim was to find a compassionate life partner for myself while also ensuring the benefit of your entire family; if I have behaved inappropriately, I apologize to you.</t2173><t2174>"</t2174>
<t2175>Chapter XXI</t2175>
<t2176>The discussion regarding Mr. Collins' proposal was now considered over; Elizabeth only had to endure the boredom that naturally arose from the argument and her mother's occasional irritable scoldings.</t2176> <t2177>As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were expressed not in shame or sorrow or attempts to avoid Elizabeth, but in cold manners and angry silence.</t2177> <t2178>He hardly spoke to Elizabeth; the determined praises he was well aware of were directed towards Miss Lucas for the rest of the day; Miss Lucas's kindness in listening to him greatly relieved everyone, especially her friend.</t2178>
<t2179>The next morning brought no relief to Mrs. Bennet's discomfort or illness.</t2179> <t2180>Mr. Collins was in the same state of angry arrogance.</t2180> <t2181>Elizabeth had hoped that his anger might shorten his visit, but his plans seemed unaffected in any way.</t2181> <t2182>He had kept saying he would leave on Saturday, and he still intended to stay until Saturday.</t2182>
<t2183>After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to ask if Mr. Wickham had returned and to lament his absence at the Netherfield ball.</t2183> <t2184>Mr. Wickham joined them as they entered the town and accompanied them to their aunt's house; at home, Mr. Wickham's sorrow and grief, and everyone's curiosity were discussed in detail.</t2184> <t2185>–Only, he explained to Elizabeth, it was his own decision not to attend.</t2185>
<t2186>"As the time approached," she said, "I felt it would be better not to encounter Mr. Darcy; –being in the same room, in the same company with him for so many hours could be more than I could bear, scenes that could disturb others more than myself might occur.</t2186><t2187>"</t2187>
<t2188>Elizabeth regarded the cautious behavior very positively; on the return journey, as Wickham and another officer accompanied them to Longbourn, they found ample time to discuss the matter in detail and exchange numerous compliments; during the walk, Wickham paid her special attention.</t2188> <t2189>Their accompaniment was doubly delightful; firstly, Elizabeth felt that this act was a compliment directed at her, and secondly, it was a good opportunity to introduce Wickham to her parents.</t2189>
<t2190>Immediately after their return, a letter arrived for Miss Bennet; it was from Netherfield and was opened at once.</t2190> <t2191>Inside the envelope was a polite, small, high-quality piece of paper, covered with a lady's careful, flowing handwriting; as Elizabeth read the letter, she sensed her sister's face changing and saw her getting stuck at certain points.</t2191> <t2192>Jane soon composed herself, put the letter away, and tried to join the conversation with her usual cheerfulness; but Elizabeth felt a concern that distracted her even from Wickham; as soon as Wickham and his friend left, Jane, with her eyes, called her to follow upstairs.</t2192> <t2193>When they entered their room, Jane took out the letter and said, "It is from Caroline Bingley; what she wrote surprised me a lot.</t2193> <t2194>They have all left Netherfield and are going to the city –and they have no intention of returning.</t2194> <t2195>Listen to what she says.</t2195><t2196>"</t2196>
<t2197>He read the first sentence aloud; it was announcing that they had immediately decided to go to the city after their siblings and that they planned to have dinner that evening on Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst resided.</t2197> <t2198>The rest was described with these words: "I don't think I will miss anything I left behind in Hertfordshire except your friendship; but I hope that we will enjoy our pleasant companionship again and again in the future, and in the meantime, we can lessen the pain of separation with frequent and sincere letters.</t2198> <t2199>I trust you on this matter."</t2199> <t2200>Elizabeth listened to these generous expressions with a calm filled with doubt; although the suddenness of their departure surprised her, she saw nothing to lament in their wake: their absence from Netherfield did not necessarily mean Mr. Bingley would not be there; as for losing their friendship, she believed that Jane should stop thinking about it and focus on Mr. Bingley's companionship.</t2200>
<t2201>"Bad luck," he said after a brief silence, "it would have been good if you could see your friends before leaving.</t2201> <t2202>But can't we hope that the day Miss Bingley is expecting will come sooner than predicted, and that the companionship you enjoyed as friends will be renewed more firmly as sisters?</t2202> <t2203>They cannot keep Mr. Bingley in London.</t2203><t2204>"</t2204>
<t2205>"Caroline insists that no one from the family will return to Hertfordshire this winter.</t2205> <t2206>Let me read it to you:–</t2206>
<t2207>" ‘My brother, when leaving us yesterday, thought that the business requiring him to go to London could be handled within three or four days; but now that we know this is not possible, and also believing that Charles will not return once he gets to the city, we decided to follow him so that he wouldn't have to spend his idle hours in an uncomfortable hotel.</t2207> <t2208>Most of my acquaintances have already come there for the winter; I wish you too, my dear friend, would consider joining us – but I am not hopeful about this.</t2208> <t2209>With all my heart, I wish that Christmas brings joy to Hertfordshire and to you as it always does, and that your admirers prevent you from feeling the loss of the three friends we have deprived you of.' "</t2209>
<t2210>"It is clear," added Jane, "that he will not return this winter."</t2210><t2211>"</t2211>
<t2212>"The only certain thing is, Miss Bingley is not saying she will return.</t2212><t2213>"</t2213>
<t2214>"Why do you think that way?</t2214> <t2215>It should be his decision.</t2215> <t2216>The man is his own master.</t2216> <t2217>But you haven't heard everything yet.</t2217> <t2218>I will read you the part that especially hurt me.</t2218> <t2219>I have nothing to hide from you.</t2219>
<t2220>" 'Mr. Darcy is eager to see his sister; to be honest, we are no less eager to see her than Mr. Darcy himself.</t2220> <t2221>In my opinion, there is no one who can match Georgiana Darcy in beauty, grace, and talent; the affection she has inspired in Louisa and me has become even more interesting because we hope she will soon become our sister.</t2221> <t2222>I don't know if I have mentioned my feelings on this matter to you before; but I will not leave here without opening up to you about my feelings, and I am sure you will find them reasonable.</t2222> <t2223>My brother already admires her immensely; now he will have the chance to see her often in the closest of settings; her relatives, just like us, desire this union; not because he is my brother, but Charles is someone who could win any woman's heart.</t2223> <t2224>When all circumstances are in favor of a relationship, and there is no obstacle, could I be wrong in hoping for an event that will ensure the happiness of many people, dear Jane?</t2224><t2225>'</t2225>
<t2226>"What do you say to this sentence, dear Lizzy?" said Jane, as she finished the letter.</t2226> <t2227>"Isn't it quite clear?</t2227> <t2228>Doesn't Caroline plainly say that she neither wants nor hopes for me as her sister-in-law? She is quite certain of her brother's indifference; even if she suspects my feelings for him, she (kindly!) warns me to be cautious.</t2228> <t2229>Can there be any other interpretation of this matter?</t2229><t2230>"</t2230>
<t2231>"Yes, it could be; because mine is completely different.</t2231> <t2232>–Will you listen?</t2232><t2233>"</t2233>
<t2234>"With great enthusiasm.</t2234><t2235>"</t2235>
<t2236>"I will say it in a few words.</t2236> <t2237>Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants to marry him to Miss Darcy.</t2237> <t2238>She is going to the city after him with the intention of keeping him there, and wants to convince you that the man does not care about you.</t2238><t2239>"</t2239>
<t2240>Jane nodded her head.</t2240>
<t2241>"Truly, Jane, you must believe me.</t2241> <t2242>–No one who has seen you together can doubt his affection.</t2242> <t2243>I am sure Miss Bingley cannot doubt it either.</t2243> <t2244>She cannot be that foolish.</t2244> <t2245>If she could see that Mr. Darcy was half as in love with her, she would have ordered her wedding dress by now.</t2245> <t2246>But the situation is this: –We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; she wants to marry Miss Darcy to her brother because she thinks that once there is one marriage, achieving a second one will be easier, which she may be partly right about, and she might even succeed if it weren't for the obstacle of Miss de Bourgh.</t2246> <t2247>But, dear Jane, just because Miss Bingley told you that her brother admires Miss Darcy very much, you cannot believe that Mr. Bingley values your superiority any less than he did at your parting on Tuesday, or that her influence could make him fall in love with her friend instead of you.</t2247><t2248>"</t2248>
<t2249>"If we had similar thoughts about Miss Bingley," Jane replied, "these explanations would greatly relieve me.</t2249> <t2250>But I know there is a fundamental mistake.</t2250> <t2251>Even Caroline cannot deliberately deceive anyone; in this case, all I can hope for is that she is deceiving herself.</t2251><t2252>"</t2252>
<t2253>"That's true.</t2253> <t2254>–You couldn't have come up with a better idea, since my idea didn't comfort you.</t2254> <t2255>Whatever happens, believe that he is deceiving himself.</t2255> <t2256>You have done your duty towards him; don't be sad anymore.</t2256><t2257>"</t2257>
<t2258>"But my dear brother, can I be happy even in the best case by accepting a man whom all my sisters and friends wish to marry someone else?"</t2258><t2259>"</t2259>
<t2260>"The decision is up to you," said Elizabeth; "if, after careful consideration, the sorrow of disappointing your two sisters outweighs the happiness of being his wife, then I advise you to reject him."</t2260><t2261>"</t2261>
<t2262>"How can you talk like that?" said Jane, with a faint smile.</t2262> <t2263>"You know that if they don't approve, I would be very upset, but I wouldn't hesitate for a minute.</t2263><t2264>"</t2264>
<t2265>"I don't think you deserve it either; if that's the case, your situation isn't that dire."</t2265><t2266>"</t2266>
<t2267>"But if he doesn't come back this winter, I won't need to make a choice.</t2267> <t2268>A thousand things can happen in six months!</t2268><t2269>"</t2269>
<t2270>Elizabeth never took seriously the thought of him not returning again.</t2270> <t2271>She believed that this was merely an implication of Caroline's self-serving wishes, and she did not for a moment think that such wishes, whether expressed openly or subtly, could influence a young man who seemed so independent of everyone.</t2271>
<t2272>Elizabeth explained her thoughts on the matter to her sister with all her persuasiveness and soon had the pleasure of seeing the happy effect she had created.</t2272> <t2273>Jane's nature was not inclined to remain sorrowful; although occasional doubts of affection hindered her hope, she increasingly believed that Bingley would return to Netherfield and fulfill all the desires of her heart.</t2273>
<t2274>They decided to only tell Mrs. Bennet about the family's departure, so as not to cause her to panic over the man's behavior; but even this partial information greatly distressed Mrs. Bennet. She kept lamenting that it was a great misfortune for the ladies to leave just when they had gotten so close.</t2274> <t2275>Nevertheless, after her complaints subsided, she soon consoled herself with the thought that Mr. Bingley would be coming very soon and would be dining at Longbourn in the near future; as a result, she cheered up by saying that she would need to prepare a double menu, even though he was only invited to a family dinner.</t2275>
<t2276>Chapter XXII</t2276>
<t2277>The Bennets had promised to dine with the Lucases; throughout most of the day, Miss Lucas showed kindness by listening to Mr. Collins.</t2277> <t2278>Elizabeth thanked her when she found an opportunity.</t2278> <t2279>"He is being kept occupied thanks to you," she said, "I am grateful to you for that."</t2279> <t2280>Charlotte reassured her friend by saying she was happy to be of use and that she had been more than rewarded for spending a little time.</t2280> <t2281>This was very friendly; but Charlotte's kindness went further than Elizabeth thought; –her aim was to draw Mr. Collins' attention to herself, thus sparing Elizabeth from having to reciprocate.</t2281> <t2282>This was Miss Lucas's plan, and it seemed to work so well that by the time they parted at night, Miss Lucas would have been almost certain of her success if Mr. Collins were not to leave Hertfordshire so soon.</t2282> <t2283>But at this point, she did not account for Mr. Collins' passionate and independent character; for his character led him to escape from Longbourn House the next morning with admirable secrecy and throw himself at Miss Lucas's feet at Lucas Lodge.</t2283> <t2284>He had taken care not to be seen by his cousins, as he thought they would guess his purpose if they saw him leave, and he did not want his attempt to be known until his success was certain; though he felt almost secure, as he had a right to, because Charlotte had been quite encouraging, but he was relatively shy after Wednesday's adventure.</t2284> <t2285>Nevertheless, he was received in a very flattering manner.</t2285> <t2286>As he walked towards the house, Miss Lucas saw him from an upstairs window and immediately went out to meet him on the road, pretending it was a coincidence.</t2286> <t2287>But she could not dare to hope that such a strong love and such beautiful words awaited her there.</t2287>
<t2288>During the short intervals allowed by Mr. Collins' long speeches, everything between them was settled in a manner satisfactory to both; as they entered the house, Mr. Collins asked her to set the day that would make him the happiest man in the world; although there was no need to rush such a decision, the young lady had no intention of playing with his happiness.</t2288> <t2289>The foolishness nature had bestowed upon him had protected his courtship style from any charm that might make a woman want it to continue; Miss Lucas, who accepted him out of a pure and selfless desire for marriage, did not mind how quickly that marriage was obtained.</t2289>
<t2290>Sir William and Lady Lucas were quickly visited to obtain their approval; the approval was given with joyful promptness.</t2290> <t2291>Mr. Collins' current circumstances made him a very suitable husband for their daughters, who could not expect much of a dowry; besides, his future prospects of wealth were quite high.</t2291> <t2292>Lady Lucas immediately began to calculate how many more years Mr. Bennet might live with more interest than the matter had previously aroused; Sir William also expressed his firm opinion that it would be quite appropriate for both him and his wife to make an appearance at St.</t2292> <t2293>James's once Mr. Collins became the owner of the Longbourn estate.</t2293> <t2294>In short, this event filled the entire family with joy.</t2294> <t2295>The younger girls hoped that they might come out a year or two earlier than would otherwise have been possible; the boys were relieved of the fear that Charlotte would remain unmarried.</t2295> <t2296>Charlotte, however, was more composed.</t2296> <t2297>She had achieved her goal and had had time to consider it.</t2297> <t2298>Her thoughts were generally satisfactory.</t2298> <t2299>Mr. Collins, of course, was neither sensible nor agreeable; his conversation was dreadful; his attachment to her must be imaginary.</t2299> <t2300>But still, he would be her husband.</t2300> <t2301>Without indulging in great expectations regarding men or the marital bond, she had always aimed for marriage; marriage was the only honorable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and though it might not ensure happiness, it must be their most eligible protection against want.</t2301> <t2302>She had now secured that protection; at twenty-seven, with no beauty to recommend her, she knew it to be a fortunate chance.</t2302> <t2303>The most unpleasant part of the affair was the possibility of surprising Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued more than any other.</t2303> <t2304>Elizabeth would be astonished and probably would reproach her; her decision would not be altered, but it would hurt her feelings to face such a surprise.</t2304> <t2305>She decided to give the news to her herself and enjoined Mr. Collins not to say a word to anyone in the family about what had happened when he returned to Longbourn for dinner.</t2305> <t2306>Of course, the promise of secrecy was given with all his heart, but it would not be easy to keep; the curiosity aroused by his long absence would lead to such direct questions on his return that it would require considerable dexterity to avoid answering; moreover, he was burning with the desire to proclaim his triumphant love, so he had to struggle hard with himself.</t2306>
<t2307>Since he would leave so early in the morning that he wouldn't see any of the family, the farewell ceremony was held as the ladies retired for the night; Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and generosity, said how happy they would be to see him at Longbourn again whenever his duties allowed.</t2307>
<t2308>"Dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is especially honorable, because I was also expecting it; you can be sure that I will respond to your invitation at the first opportunity."</t2308><t2309>"</t2309>
<t2310>They were all surprised; not wanting such a quick turn of events, Mr. Bennet immediately spoke up–</t2310>
<t2311>"But isn't there a danger of offending Lady Catherine here, sir?"</t2311> <t2312>"It is better to neglect your relatives than to risk offending your patron."</t2312><t2313>"</t2313>
<t2314>"Dear sir," replied Mr. Collins, "I am particularly grateful for this friendly advice; you can be assured that I would not take such an important step without first obtaining permission from her ladyship.</t2314><t2315>"</t2315>
<t2316>"You can never be too careful.</t2316> <t2317>Just don't upset him, and do whatever you want; if you see that coming back to us will be risky, which I think it will be, just stay quietly at home, and be assured that we won't be offended.</t2317><t2318>"</t2318>
<t2319>"Believe me, dear sir, my gratitude has increased manifold with your kind concern; for this and for all the understanding you have shown during my stay in Hertfordshire, you can be sure that you will receive a thank-you letter from me immediately.</t2319> <t2320>As for my lovely cousins, although my absence will not be long enough to necessitate it, I wish them health and happiness, including my cousin Elizabeth.</t2320><t2321>"</t2321>
<t2322>After the necessary courtesies, the ladies withdrew; since they thought she would return quickly, they were all equally surprised.</t2322><t2323>Mrs. Bennet preferred to conclude that she intended to turn to one of her younger daughters; Mary might be persuaded to accept her.</t2323><t2324>Mary had valued her qualities more than the others; there was a solidity in her thoughts that Mary found interesting, and although she did not consider her as intelligent as herself, she thought she could take her as a model, encourage her to read, improve herself, and become a very reasonable life partner.</t2324><t2325>But the next morning, all such hopes vanished.</t2325><t2326>Immediately after breakfast, Miss Lucas called and, while they were sitting alone, told Elizabeth what had happened the previous day.</t2326>
<t2327>The possibility that Mr. Collins might think himself in love with her friend had crossed Elizabeth's mind in the last few days; but the idea that Charlotte would encourage him seemed as unlikely as her encouraging him herself; thus, the astonishment she felt was so great that it surpassed the bounds of etiquette, and she involuntarily exclaimed–</t2327>
<t2328>"Are you engaged to Mr. Collins!</t2328> <t2329>Dear Charlotte, –impossible!"</t2329>
<t2330>Miss Lucas's calm face while telling her story took on a temporary disheartenment when faced with such a direct reproach; however, it was not more than she had expected, so she quickly recovered and replied calmly–</t2330>
<t2331>"Why are you surprised, dear Eliza? –Do you think Mr. Collins cannot win any woman's favor just because he couldn't win yours?"</t2331><t2332>"</t2332>
<t2333>But now Elizabeth had composed herself, and with a serious effort, she managed to convincingly assure Miss Lucas that she found their relationship very gratifying and wished her all the happiness imaginable.</t2333>
<t2334>"I understand how you feel," replied Charlotte, "you must be surprised, very surprised – just the other day Mr. Collins wanted to marry you.</t2334> <t2335>But when you have time to think it all over, I hope you will be as happy with my decision as I am.</t2335> <t2336>You know I'm not romantic; I never have been.</t2336> <t2337>All I want is a comfortable home; considering Mr. Collins' character, connections, and life circumstances, I believe my chances of being happy with him are as high as anyone entering into marriage could boast.</t2337><t2338>"</t2338>
<t2339>Elizabeth calmly replied, "Undoubtedly," – and after an awkward silence, they returned to the other members of the family.</t2339> <t2340>Charlotte did not stay long; Elizabeth was lost in thoughts about what she had heard.</t2340> <t2341>It took her a long time to come to terms with the idea of such an inappropriate marriage.</t2341> <t2342>The strangeness of Mr. Collins making two marriage proposals within three days was nothing compared to the fact that it had now been accepted.</t2342> <t2343>Elizabeth had always sensed that Charlotte's idea of marriage was quite different from her own, but she could never believe that all good feelings would be sacrificed for worldly comfort when it came to making a decision.</t2343> <t2344>Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, what a degrading picture!</t2344> <t2345>–And to the pain of a friend who had diminished herself and fallen from grace was added the sorrow of knowing that this friend could not be truly happy in the life she had chosen.</t2345>
<t2346>Chapter XXIII</t2346>
<t2347>Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, thinking about what she had heard and trying to decide whether she had the authority to explain it, when Sir William Lucas himself arrived; he had been sent by his daughter to inform the family of her engagement.</t2347> <t2348>Due to the possibility of kinship between the families, he opened the matter with compliments to them and with pride in himself – to an audience that was not only astonished but also could not believe their ears; so much so that Mrs. Bennet, with an insistence that went beyond politeness, said he must be mistaken; and Lydia, who was always tactless and often behaved rudely, shouted at the top of her lungs–</t2348>
<t2349>"My God! Sir William, how can you make up such a story?</t2349> <t2350>Don't you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?</t2350><t2351>"</t2351>
<t2352>Nothing less than courtly politeness could endure this treatment without anger; but Sir William's manners enabled him to withstand it all; he did not consent to confirm the accuracy of the information he provided, but he listened to all their rudeness with very patient nobility.</t2352>
<t2353>Feeling that it was her duty to rescue the poor man from such an awkward situation, Elizabeth stepped forward and confirmed the news by saying that Charlotte had previously informed her; in an effort to put an end to her mother and sisters' cries of astonishment, she warmly expressed her congratulations to Sir William; Jane immediately joined her and they spoke various words about the happiness promised by the marriage, Mr. Collins' wonderful character, and the proximity of Hunsford to London.</t2353>
<t2354>Mrs. Bennet was actually too overwhelmed to say much as long as Sir William was there; but as soon as he left, her emotions quickly poured out.</t2354> <t2355>First, she insisted on not believing the matter in the slightest; then, she decided that Mr. Collins had been deceived; next, she argued that they could never be happy together; finally, she said that the engagement could be broken off.</t2355> <t2356>In fact, two things emerged from all she said: first, the root cause of all the abomination was Elizabeth; second, everyone had personally treated her, Mrs. Bennet, barbarically: she dwelled on these two points for the rest of the day.</t2356> <t2357>Nothing could calm her down or console her.</t2357> <t2358>Her grief did not end when the day ended.</t2358> <t2359>It took a week for her to look at Elizabeth without scolding, a month to speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without rudeness, and months to forgive her daughters.</t2359>
<t2360>Mr. Bennet's feelings on the matter were much more subdued; as far as he could see, it was quite a reasonable situation; he said that it pleased him to see that Charlotte Lucas, whom he thought to be a sensible person, was as foolish as his wife and even more foolish than his daughter!</t2360>
<t2361>Jane admitted that she was a bit surprised by the engagement; but she spoke of her sincere wishes for their happiness rather than her astonishment; even Elizabeth could not convince her to find the matter impossible.</t2361> <t2362>Kitty and Lydia were far from being jealous of Miss Lucas, because Mr. Collins was just a clergyman; the matter only interested them as a morsel of news to spread in Meryton.</t2362>
<t2363>Lady Lucas did not refrain from savoring the feeling of triumph by rubbing in Mrs. Bennet's face the pleasure of her daughter's good marriage; she visited Longbourn more frequently than ever to say how happy she was, even though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and grumpy replies were enough to destroy her happiness.</t2363>
<t2364>There was a tension between Elizabeth and Charlotte that kept both of them silent on the subject; Elizabeth felt that there could never be true trust between them again.</t2364> <t2365>The disappointment regarding Charlotte made her look at her sister with more affection; she was certain that her views on her sister's honesty and taste would never be shaken, and she worried more and more each day for her sister's happiness, as it had been a week since Bingley had left and there was no news of his return.</t2365>
<t2366>Jane had immediately replied to Caroline's letter and was waiting for the time to pass so she could hope to receive another letter.</t2366> <t2367>The promised thank-you letter from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday; it was addressed to their father and written with a serious gratitude as if he had stayed with the family for twelve months.</t2367> <t2368>Thus, after easing his conscience, he expressed with enthusiastic words the happiness he felt from having won the heart of their dear neighbor Miss Lucas, and then explained that he was ready to accept the kind invitation they had extended to him, solely with the aim of seeing her again, hoping to return the following Monday; Lady Catherine, he continued, had so wholeheartedly approved of his marriage that she wanted it to be completed as soon as possible, and he believed that his dear Charlotte would have no objection to choosing an earlier day to make him the happiest man in the world.</t2368>
<t2369>Mr. Collins's return to Hertfordshire was no longer a source of pleasure for Mrs. Bennet.</t2369> <t2370>On the contrary, she began to complain about it like her husband.</t2370> <t2371>–It was very strange for him to come to Longbourn instead of going to Lucas Lodge; moreover, it was very inappropriate and extremely inconvenient.</t2371> <t2372>–She hated having a guest at home when her health was so fickle; besides, lovers were the most irritable people in the world.</t2372> <t2373>Thus Mrs. Bennet murmured her complaints, and her grumbling was only subdued by the greater distress caused by Mr. Bingley's prolonged absence.</t2373>
<t2374>Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable about this.</t2374> <t2375>Days chased days without bringing any news from him; only a rumor emerged in Meryton that he would not come to Netherfield again throughout the winter; this rumor drove Mrs. Bennet mad, she ranted that such a lie could not be.</t2375>
<t2376>Elizabeth even began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but that his sisters would succeed in keeping him away.</t2376> <t2377>Though she was unwilling to accept the idea, which would be so destructive to Jane's happiness and damaging to her lover's reliability, she could not prevent it from frequently arising.</t2377> <t2378>She feared that the combined efforts of Bingley's two unfeeling sisters and his discouraging friend, along with the allure of Miss Darcy and the entertainments of London, might overpower the strength of his attachment.</t2378>
<t2379>When it came to Jane, her fear under this uncertainty was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's; but she wished to conceal her feelings; therefore, the subject was never touched upon between her and Elizabeth.</t2379> <t2380>But since such sensitivity did not affect her mother, not an hour passed without her mentioning Bingley, expressing her impatience for his return, or even pressing Jane to admit that she would feel deceived if he did not come back.</t2380> <t2381>Jane had to use all her gentleness to remain calm in the face of these attacks.</t2381>
<t2382>Mr. Collins returned the next Monday as he had said, but this time he was not received with the same attention at Longbourn as during his first visit.</t2382> <t2383>However, he was too happy to seek much attention; and fortunately for the others, the courtship business largely spared them from having to endure Mr. Collins.</t2383> <t2384>Mr. Collins spent most of each day at Lucas Lodge and sometimes returned to Longbourn so late that he barely had time to apologize for his absence before the family went to bed.</t2384>
<t2385>Mrs Bennet was truly in a pitiable state.</t2385> <t2386>Every mention of marriage left her in agony, and wherever she went, she inevitably heard it being talked about.</t2386> <t2387>Even seeing Miss Lucas was repulsive to her.</t2387> <t2388>She watched her with jealous disgust as her successor in that house.</t2388> <t2389>Whenever Charlotte came to visit them, she was convinced that she was calculating when she would move in; whenever she whispered with Mr. Collins, she believed they were talking about the Longbourn estate and had decided to evict her and her daughters from the house as soon as Mr. Bennet died.</t2389> <t2390>She bitterly complained about all this to her husband.</t2390>
<t2391>"Really, Mr. Bennet," she was saying, "it's very hard for me to think that Charlotte Lucas will be the mistress of this house; it's very hard for me to think that they will force me to give my home to her, that she will come and take my place!</t2391><t2392>"</t2392>
<t2393>"My dear, don't succumb to such sorrowful thoughts.</t2393> <t2394>Let's hope for better things.</t2394> <t2395>For instance, let's do ourselves a favor and think that the one who survives will be me.</t2395><t2396>"</t2396>
<t2397>These did not comfort Mrs. Bennet; therefore, instead of replying, she continued as she knew best.</t2397>
<t2398>"I can't bear the thought of them taking all this property.</t2398> <t2399>If it weren't for the mortgage, I wouldn't care at all.</t2399><t2400>"</t2400>
<t2401>"Wouldn't it be in his lifetime?</t2401><t2402>"</t2402>
<t2403>"I wouldn't care about anything.</t2403><t2404>"</t2404>
<t2405>"Then let's be glad that you don't have to be subjected to such insensitivity."</t2405><t2406>"</t2406>
<t2407>"I cannot be pleased with anything regarding the mortgage, Mr. Bennet.</t2407> <t2408>How can one, in good conscience, leave a house to anyone other than their own daughters, I do not understand; especially to Mr. Collins – Why should he get it and not someone else?</t2408><t2409>"</t2409>
<t2410>"The decision is up to you," said Mr. Bennet.</t2410>
<t2411>Second Book</t2411>
<t2412>Chapter I</t2412>
<t2413>Miss Bingley's letter arrived and put an end to the doubt.</t2413> <t2414>The first sentence confirmed that they had settled in London for the winter and ended by saying how sorry her brother was for leaving without finding time to say goodbye to his friends in Hertfordshire.</t2414>
<t2415>Hope was gone, completely gone; when Jane could look at the rest of the letter, she found little to comfort her besides the author's supposed affection.</t2415> <t2416>A large part of the letter was devoted to praising Miss Darcy.</t2416> <t2417>Again, many virtues were emphasized; Caroline, boasting joyfully of their increasing closeness, ventured to predict that the wishes expressed in her previous letter would come true.</t2417> <t2418>Once more, she wrote with great pleasure that her brother was staying at Mr. Darcy's house and spoke enthusiastically about Mr. Darcy's plans to buy new furniture.</t2418>
<t2419>Jane summarized the letter to Elizabeth shortly after; Elizabeth listened to it in silent fury.</t2419> <t2420>Her heart was divided between the concern she felt for her sister and the anger she felt towards the others.</t2420> <t2421>She did not believe Caroline's claim that her brother was interested in Miss Darcy.</t2421> <t2422>She still did not doubt that Jane genuinely felt close to her; although she had always been inclined to like Mr. Bingley, she could not think of the weakness, that indecisiveness that made him a slave to his meddlesome friends and caused him to sacrifice his own happiness to their spoiled preferences, without feeling anger, even hatred.</t2422> <t2423>Moreover, if only his own happiness were being sacrificed, no one could object to him doing as he pleased, but her sister's happiness was also at stake, and he needed to consider that.</t2423> <t2424>In short, the matter was not something that could be resolved by thinking.</t2424> <t2425>Elizabeth could think of nothing else; had Bingley's interest truly waned, or was it suppressed by his friends' interference, was he aware of Jane's attachment or had it escaped his notice; whatever the answer, although her opinion of Bingley would change significantly depending on the answer, her sister's situation remained the same, and her own peace of mind was equally damaged.</t2425>
<t2426>A few days passed before Jane could find the strength to talk about her feelings to Elizabeth; but finally, after Mrs. Bennet left them alone and following an unusually long discomfort regarding Netherfield and its owner, Jane couldn't hold back and said,</t2426>
<t2427>"If only my mother could manage herself a little! She doesn't know how much she hurts me by constantly talking about her.</t2427> <t2428>But I won't let it bother me.</t2428> <t2429>It won't last long anyway.</t2429> <t2430>I will forget her and we will all be as we were before.</t2430><t2431>"</t2431>
<t2432>Elizabeth looked at her sister with a suspicious concern, but said nothing.</t2432>
<t2433>"You don't believe me," cried Jane, her color slightly changing, "but there is no reason for you not to believe.</t2433> <t2434>He may live in my memories as the nicest man I have known, but that's all.</t2434> <t2435>I have nothing to hope for or fear, and nothing that requires me to condemn him.</t2435> <t2436>Thank goodness!</t2436> <t2437>I don't suffer that kind of pain.</t2437> <t2438>So a little time will be enough.</t2438> <t2439>–Of course, I will try to get better.</t2439><t2440>"</t2440>
<t2441>Immediately after, he added in a stronger voice, "In this respect, I am at ease; from my perspective, it was merely a mistake of imagination, and it harmed no one but myself.</t2441><t2442>"</t2442>
<t2443>"Dear Jane!" cried Elizabeth, "you are so good.</t2443> <t2444>Your sweetness and nobility are truly worthy of angels; I don't know what else to say to you.</t2444> <t2445>I feel like I have never treated you fairly or loved you as much as you deserve.</t2445><t2446>"</t2446>
<t2447>Miss Bennet persistently denied all these extraordinary qualities and attributed the praise to her sister's kindness.</t2447>
<t2448>"No," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair.</t2448> <t2449>You want to believe that the whole world is moral, and you get hurt when I speak ill of someone.</t2449> <t2450>I just want to think that you are perfect, and you object to this.</t2450> <t2451>Do not fear my going to extremes, my getting too caught up in your absolute goodwill.</t2451> <t2452>There is no need.</t2452> <t2453>There are very few people I truly love; even fewer people I respect.</t2453> <t2454>The more I know the world, the more my discontent grows; every day my belief in the inconsistency of human character and that even those who seem intelligent and sensitive cannot be trusted strengthens.</t2454> <t2455>Recently, I have encountered two examples; I will not mention one; the other is Charlotte's marriage.</t2455> <t2456>It is not understandable! From whichever angle you look, it is not understandable!</t2456><t2457>"</t2457>
<t2458>"My dear Lizzy, do not give in to such feelings.</t2458> <t2459>You will be unhappy.</t2459> <t2460>You are not giving enough consideration to the differences in rank and temperament.</t2460> <t2461>Think of Mr. Collins's respectability and Charlotte's sensible, steady character.</t2461> <t2462>Remember that Charlotte belongs to a large family; she is a financially suitable choice; and, for the good of everyone, you must believe that you can feel some respect and warmth for our cousin.</t2462><t2463>"</t2463>
<t2464>"I would try to believe almost anything to please you, but such a belief would benefit no one; if I were convinced that Charlotte respected him, his mind would fall as low in my estimation as his heart.</t2464> <t2465>Dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, boastful, selfish, foolish man; you know this as well as I do; you must also be able to guess as well as I can that any woman who marries him must be out of her mind.</t2465> <t2466>Even if it were Charlotte Lucas, you cannot defend such a woman.</t2466> <t2467>You are not going to try to change the meaning of principle and honor for the sake of one person, or try to convince yourself or me that selfishness is common sense, or that insensitivity to danger is a guarantee of happiness.</t2467><t2468>"</t2468>
<t2469>"If you ask me, you are using harsh language when talking about them," Jane replied; "and I hope you will believe it when you see that they are happy together.</t2469> <t2470>But let's leave this aside now.</t2470> <t2471>You mentioned something else.</t2471> <t2472>You spoke of two examples.</t2472> <t2473>There is no way I can misunderstand you, but I beg you, my dear Lizzy, do not cause me pain by thinking that person is guilty and saying that your impression of him is terrible.</t2473> <t2474>We should not be so ready to see ourselves as people who are intentionally hurt.</t2474> <t2475>We should not expect a cheerful young man to be so careful and cautious at all times.</t2475> <t2476>Often it is nothing but our own pride that deceives us.</t2476> <t2477>Women think admiration means more than it does.</t2477><t2478>"</t2478>
<t2479>"Men are also working to make it meaningless."</t2479><t2480>"</t2480>
<t2481>"If it is done deliberately, it cannot be justified; but I don't think there are as many plans in the world as some people think.</t2481><t2482>"</t2482>
<t2483>"I do not intend to attribute any part of Mr. Bingley's actions to a plan," said Elizabeth; "but mistakes can be made and sorrow can be caused without the intention of making mistakes or making others unhappy.</t2483> <t2484>Thoughtlessness, insensitivity to the feelings of others, and indecision can achieve the same result.</t2484><t2485>"</t2485>
<t2486>"Is this one of the reasons for you?"</t2486><t2487>"</t2487>
<t2488>"Yes; the last one.</t2488> <t2489>But if I continue, I will upset you by telling you what I think about the people you respect.</t2489> <t2490>Stop me while you have the chance.</t2490><t2491>"</t2491>
<t2492>"You still think that his sisters influence him, do you?"</t2492><t2493>"</t2493>
<t2494>"Yes, in partnership with his friend."</t2494><t2495>"</t2495>
<t2496>"I can't believe this.</t2496> <t2497>Why would they want to influence him?</t2497> <t2498>They just want him to be happy; if he's passionate about me, no other woman can make him happy.</t2498><t2499>"</t2499>
<t2500>"Your first assumption is wrong.</t2500> <t2501>They want other things besides happiness; they want their wealth and power to increase; they want to marry a girl with money, important relatives, and ostentation.</t2501><t2502>"</t2502>
<t2503>"No doubt, they would prefer Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this might be due to better feelings than you think.</t2503> <t2504>They have known her for a longer time than they have known me; it is not surprising that they love her more.</t2504> <t2505>But regardless of their own wishes, it is unlikely that they would oppose their brother's desire.</t2505> <t2506>Which sister would see herself with this right, if there is nothing much to object to?</t2506> <t2507>If they believed he was attached to me, they would not try to separate us; because if he were attached, they would not succeed.</t2507> <t2508>By searching for such an intention, you make everyone behave unnaturally and wrongly, and you make me very unhappy.</t2508> <t2509>Do not upset me with this idea.</t2509> <t2510>I am not ashamed of being mistaken – or whatever, it does not matter, not at all compared to the feelings I would have if I thought badly of him or his sisters.</t2510> <t2511>Let me see the matter from the best perspective, that is, the one that can be understood.</t2511><t2512>"</t2512>
<t2513>Elizabeth could not object to such a request; from that moment on, Mr. Bingley's name was never mentioned between them again.</t2513>
<t2514>Mrs. Bennet continued to be amazed and saddened by the fact that he would not be returning anymore; although not a single day passed without Elizabeth explaining the situation, it seemed almost impossible to get Mrs. Bennet to handle the situation more calmly.</t2514> <t2515>Her daughter tried to make her believe something she did not want to believe, that his interest in Jane was nothing more than a normal and temporary liking, and that his interest ceased once he stopped seeing her; however, even if the explanation was accepted as possibly true at the time, she repeated the same story every day.</t2515> <t2516>Mrs. Bennet's only consolation was that Mr. Bingley would come there again in the summer.</t2516>
<t2517>Mr. Bennet approached the matter differently.</t2517> <t2518>"So, Lizzy," he said one day, "your sister has lost in love.</t2518> <t2519>I congratulate her.</t2519> <t2520>Every girl likes to lose in love once in a while as much as she likes to get married.</t2520> <t2521>It gives her something to think about and a sort of distinction among her friends.</t2521> <t2522>When is it going to be your turn?</t2522> <t2523>You can't stand being left behind Jane for too long.</t2523> <t2524>Your time has come.</t2524> <t2525>There are enough officers in Meryton to disappoint all the women in the country.</t2525> <t2526>Let yours be Wickham.</t2526> <t2527>A charming man, he will leave you nicely.</t2527><t2528>"</t2528>
<t2529>"Thank you, sir, but a less charming man will suffice for me."</t2529> <t2530>"We cannot all hope to be as fortunate as Jane."</t2530><t2531>"</t2531>
<t2532>"True," said Mr. Bennet, "but whatever may come to her, it is comforting to know that she has a loving mother who knows how to make the best of the situation.</t2532><t2533>"</t2533>
<t2534>Mr. Wickham's presence was quite effective in dispelling the sorrow caused by recent misfortunes among many members of the Longbourn family.</t2534> <t2535>They saw him frequently, and now a general frankness was added to his other qualities.</t2535> <t2536>The things Elizabeth had already heard, the claims about Mr. Darcy, the sufferings caused by him were now openly spoken of, publicly declared; even before everyone learned everything, she took pleasure in thinking about how much she hated Mr. Darcy.</t2536>
<t2537>Miss Bennet was the only person who could think that there might be mitigating circumstances in the matter unknown to the people of Hertfordshire; her moderate and steady sincerity always allowed room for tolerance, seeking the possibility of error – but everyone else cursed Mr. Darcy as the most heartless man in the world.</t2537>
<t2538>Chapter II</t2538>
<t2539>After a week filled with vows of love and dreams of happiness, Mr. Collins had to part from his dear Charlotte with the arrival of Saturday.</t2539> <t2540>But the pain of separation was alleviated for him by the preparations being made for his bride's arrival; he had reasons to hope that the day which would make him the happiest man in the world would be set immediately upon his next return to Hertfordshire.</t2540> <t2541>He bade farewell to his relatives at Longbourn with the same solemnity as before; he once again wished his beautiful cousins health and happiness and promised their father a new letter of thanks.</t2541>
<t2542>The following Monday, Mrs. Bennet joyfully welcomed her brother and his wife, who, as usual, had come to spend Christmas at Longbourn.</t2542> <t2543>Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanly man; in both nature and education, he was far superior to his sister.</t2543> <t2544>The ladies at Netherfield found it hard to believe that a man who made his living through trade and whose house was within sight of his shop could be so polite and charming.</t2544> <t2545>Mrs. Gardiner, who was a few years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was a pleasant, intelligent, and graceful woman; she was the favorite of all her nieces and nephews at Longbourn.</t2545> <t2546>She had a particularly special bond with her two eldest nieces.</t2546> <t2547>When they went to town, they often stayed with her.</t2547>
<t2548>Mrs. Gardiner's first task upon arrival was to distribute her gifts and discuss the latest fashion trends.</t2548> <t2549>After this task was completed, she had a less active role.</t2549> <t2550>It was her turn to listen.</t2550> <t2551>Mrs. Bennet had a lot of grievances and many complaints to share.</t2551> <t2552>Since the last time she had seen her aunt, everything had gone wrong for everyone.</t2552> <t2553>Two of her daughters had come to the brink of marriage but had remained there.</t2553>
<t2554>"I don't blame Jane," she continued, "because if Jane could, she would have won over Mr. Bingley.</t2554> <t2555>But Lizzy! oh, my sister! by now she would have already been Mr. Collins's wife if she hadn't been so perverse.</t2555> <t2556>The man proposed to her in this very room, and she refused.</t2556> <t2557>The result is clear, Lady Lucas will be the mother of a married daughter before me; and the Longbourn estate is still mortgaged as ever.</t2557> <t2558>The Lucases are indeed very clever people, my sister.</t2558> <t2559>They take whatever they can get.</t2559> <t2560>I'm sorry to speak about them this way, but it's the truth.</t2560> <t2561>Being pushed around within my own family like this irritates me, it makes me miserable; especially when you have neighbors who think of themselves before anyone else.</t2561> <t2562>Nevertheless, your coming at such a time is the greatest consolation; I really enjoyed what you said about the long sleeves.</t2562><t2563>"</t2563>
<t2564>Mrs. Gardiner, who had learned the essence of these news during her correspondence with Jane and Elizabeth, responded lightly to her sister-in-law, then, feeling sorry for her nieces, changed the subject.</t2564>
<t2565>Later, when he was alone with Elizabeth, he talked a little more about this subject.</t2565> <t2566>"It seems like it would have been an ideal marriage for Jane," he said.</t2566> <t2567>"I'm sorry it didn't happen.</t2567> <t2568>But such things happen a lot!</t2568> <t2569>If Mr. Bingley is the kind of man you described, who easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and then forgets her just as easily when circumstances separate them, it means he often engages in such infidelity.</t2569><t2570>"</t2570>
<t2571>"A perfect solace on its own," said Elizabeth, "but it doesn't work for us.</t2571> <t2572>We are not suffering by chance.</t2572> <t2573>That a friend's intervention convinces a young man with his own income to forget a girl he was passionately in love with just a few days ago, this is not something that happens often.</t2573><t2574>"</t2574>
<t2575>"But this expression 'violently in love' is so clichéd, so doubtful, so vague that it gives me very little idea.</t2575> <t2576>It can apply to feelings born from half an hour's acquaintance as well as to real, strong attachments.</t2576> <t2577>Please, can you tell me how intense Mr. Bingley's love was?</t2577><t2578>"</t2578>
<t2579>"I have never seen a more promising interest; gradually, he became oblivious to other people; he was so captivated by Jane.</t2579> <t2580>Whenever they met, this became more apparent, more definite.</t2580> <t2581>At his own ball, he offended several ladies by not asking them to dance; I spoke to him twice, but received no reply.</t2581> <t2582>Could there be clearer signs?</t2582> <t2583>Isn't indifference to others the essence of love?</t2583><t2584>"</t2584>
<t2585>"Ah yes! –the kind of love I thought he felt.</t2585> <t2586>Poor Jane! I feel sorry for her; someone of her character cannot get over it quickly.</t2586> <t2587>I wish it had happened to you, Lizzy; you would laugh it off more quickly.</t2587> <t2588>But do you think we can persuade Jane to come back with us?</t2588> <t2589>A change of air might help –and perhaps just being away from home would be a relief in itself.</t2589><t2590>"</t2590>
<t2591>Elizabeth was extremely pleased with the offer; she said she believed her sister was more than willing from the start.</t2591>
<t2592>"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that her concerns about this young man do not affect her.</t2592> <t2593>We live in a very different part of the city, all our associations are very different, and as you know, we seldom go out; so it is almost impossible for them to encounter us, unless the man comes to see her."</t2593><t2594>"</t2594>
<t2595>"There is no way; because now he is under the watchful eye of his friend; Mr. Darcy cannot tolerate him visiting Jane in such a neighborhood of London!</t2595> <t2596>My dear aunt, how could such a thing cross your mind?</t2596> <t2597>Mr. Darcy may have heard of a place called Gracechurch Street, but once he sets foot there, he would think he couldn't rid himself of its grime even if he scrubbed for a month; rest assured, Mr. Bingley won't move an inch without him.</t2597><t2598>"</t2598>
<t2599>"All the better."</t2599> <t2600>"I hope they never meet."</t2600> <t2601>"But isn't Jane corresponding with the man's sister?"</t2601> <t2602>"She can't ignore that."</t2602><t2603>"</t2603>
<t2604>"He will end the friendship permanently.</t2604><t2605>"</t2605>
<t2606>Although Elizabeth seemed very confident when describing this point and the even more intriguing fact that Bingley was being kept from seeing Jane, a doubt about the matter crept into her mind, and upon reflection, it convinced her that the situation was not entirely hopeless.</t2606> <t2607>It was possible, even quite possible, that Bingley's affection could be rekindled and that the influence of his friends could be overcome by the more natural effect of Jane's charm.</t2607>
<t2608>Miss Bennet gladly accepted her sister-in-law's invitation; her only thought about the Bingleys was Caroline; since she did not live in the same house as her brother, she hoped to spend a morning with Caroline now and then without the danger of seeing him.</t2608>
<t2609>The Gardiners stayed at Longbourn for a week; with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, not a single day passed without entertainment.</t2609> <t2610>Mrs. Bennet tried so hard to ensure her brother and sister-in-law had fun that they couldn't even sit down for a family dinner once.</t2610> <t2611>When the entertainment was at home, some officers were always present – Mr. Wickham, of course, was one of them; once, Mrs. Gardiner became suspicious after Elizabeth spoke warmly of him and decided to keep a close watch on the two.</t2611> <t2612>From what she observed, she did not seriously conclude that they were in love, but the obvious interest they showed in each other disturbed her a bit, and before leaving Hertfordshire, she decided to talk to Elizabeth about it and advise her that continuing such a closeness would be unwise.</t2612>
<t2613>Mrs. Gardiner found Wickham interesting not only because of his general characteristics.</t2613> <t2614>Ten or twelve years ago, when she was still single, she had spent quite some time in the part of Derbyshire where Wickham was from.</t2614> <t2615>Therefore, they had many mutual acquaintances; although Wickham had not visited there much since Darcy's father died five years ago, Mrs. Gardiner had more recent information about their old friends than he could provide.</t2615>
<t2616>Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley and had heard much about the late Mr. Darcy's reputation.</t2616> <t2617>Here was an inexhaustible topic of conversation.</t2617> <t2618>Comparing what she remembered of Pemberley with the detailed description given by Wickham, and speaking in praise of the late owner's character, she made both Wickham and herself happy.</t2618> <t2619>Upon hearing what the current Mr. Darcy had done to him, she tried to recall something that would match the reputation of that gentleman in his childhood, and finally she was sure that she remembered hearing Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy described as an excessively proud, mischievous child even then.</t2619>
<t2620>Chapter III</t2620>
<t2621>Mrs. Gardiner firmly and kindly warned Elizabeth at the first opportunity they had to speak alone; after sharing her thoughts, she continued: –</t2621>
<t2622>"You are a very sensible girl, Lizzy, you won't fall in love with anyone just because you were warned; so I am not afraid to speak openly with you.</t2622> <t2623>Seriously, I advise you to protect yourself.</t2623> <t2624>Do not enter into or try to force a relationship that would be impossible due to lack of money.</t2624> <t2625>I have nothing against him; he is a very interesting young man; if he had the fortune he deserved, I would say you couldn't do better.</t2625> <t2626>But in his current state, you must not let yourself get carried away by dreams.</t2626> <t2627>You have common sense, and we all want to see you use it.</t2627> <t2628>Your father trusts your decisions and actions, I am sure.</t2628> <t2629>You must not disappoint your father.</t2629><t2630>"</t2630>
<t2631>"My dear sister-in-law, this matter is getting very serious."</t2631><t2632>"</t2632>
<t2633>"Yes, and I invite you to be serious in the same way.</t2633><t2634>"</t2634>
<t2635>"Well then; there's no need for you to worry.</t2635> <t2636>I will take care of myself, and of course, Mr. Wickham too.</t2636> <t2637>He will not fall in love with me, if I can help it.</t2637><t2638>"</t2638>
<t2639>"Elizabeth, you are not serious right now."</t2639><t2640>"</t2640>
<t2641>"Excuse me; I will try again.</t2641> <t2642>At present, I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, not at all.</t2642> <t2643>But he is the most charming man I have ever seen – if he truly attaches himself to me – I think it would be better if he did not.</t2643> <t2644>I can see the impossibility of it.</t2644> <t2645>–Oh! that scoundrel Mr. Darcy! – My father's opinion of me honors me; if I lose it, I would be devastated.</t2645> <t2646>My father, meanwhile, likes Mr. Wickham.</t2646> <t2647>In short, my dear aunt, I am very sorry to have made you unhappy; but we see every day that when there is love, young people get engaged without worrying about money; in this situation, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my peers when I am about to be tempted, or even know that it would be wise to resist?</t2647> <t2648>Therefore, all I can promise you is not to rush.</t2648> <t2649>I will not be in a hurry to believe that I am his first choice.</t2649> <t2650>I will not be eager when I am with him.</t2650> <t2651>In short, I will do my best.</t2651><t2652>"</t2652>
<t2653>"Maybe you can also prevent him from coming here so often.</t2653> <t2654>At least you won't remind your mother to invite him.</t2654><t2655>"</t2655>
<t2656>"Like I did the other day," said Elizabeth with a meaningful smile: "very true, I should give it up."</t2656> <t2657>But don't think it happens that often.</t2657> <t2658>This week, thanks to you, I've been invited so frequently.</t2658> <t2659>You know my mother always wants company.</t2659> <t2660>But really, I give you my word, I will do what seems most sensible to me; now I hope you are satisfied."</t2660><t2661>"</t2661>
<t2662>Her sister-in-law said she was satisfied, and after Elizabeth thanked her for her courtesy in the warnings, they parted ways; an unusual example of giving advice on such a matter without causing offense.</t2662>
<t2663>Right after Jane left with the Gardiners, Mr. Collins returned to Hertfordshire; but since he stayed with the Lucases, his arrival did not cause much inconvenience for Mrs. Bennet.</t2663> <t2664>His marriage was now rapidly approaching; Mrs. Bennet had finally been forced to accept that this matter was inevitable, and even repeatedly said, in a malicious tone, "I hope they can be happy."</t2664> <t2665>The wedding was to be on Thursday; on Wednesday, Miss Lucas came for a farewell visit; when she rose to leave, Elizabeth, embarrassed by her mother's sour-faced, reluctant good wishes and sincerely moved on her own behalf, accompanied her out of the room.</t2665> <t2666>As they descended the stairs together, Charlotte said–</t2666>
<t2667>"I believe I will hear from you often, Eliza.</t2667><t2668>"</t2668>
<t2669>"Of course you will get it."</t2669><t2670>"</t2670>
<t2671>"I have one more request.</t2671> <t2672>Would you come and see me?</t2672><t2673>"</t2673>
<t2674>"I hope we often meet in Hertfordshire."</t2674><t2675>"</t2675>
<t2676>"It doesn't seem possible for me to leave Kent for a while.</t2676> <t2677>So promise to come to Hunsford.</t2677><t2678>"</t2678>
<t2679>Elizabeth did not like the idea of the visit, but she could not say no.</t2679>
<t2680>"My father and Maria will come to visit me in March," added Charlotte, "I hope you will join them as well.</t2680> <t2681>Honestly, Eliza, your arrival would make me as happy as theirs.</t2681><t2682>"</t2682>
<t2683>The marriage was solemnized: the bride and groom left the church and set off towards Kent; as always, there was much to tell or listen to about the event.</t2683> <t2684>Elizabeth soon received news from her friend; they were corresponding as frequently and regularly as before, but it was impossible for it to be as intimate.</t2684> <t2685>Elizabeth couldn't write to her without feeling that all sense of closeness had ended, and although she was determined not to neglect writing letters, she was writing them for the sake of past things, not present ones.</t2685> <t2686>Charlotte's first letters were received with considerable excitement; there was natural curiosity about how she would describe her new home, whether she liked Lady Catherine, and if she was happy; however, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself exactly as she had expected in every way.</t2686> <t2687>She wrote cheerfully, seemed comfortable, and mentioned nothing that she couldn't praise.</t2687> <t2688>The house, the furniture, the neighborhood, the roads, all were to her liking, and Lady Catherine's demeanor was extremely friendly and kind.</t2688> <t2689>The picture Mr. Collins painted of Hunsford and Rosings was only smartly softened; Elizabeth realized she would have to wait for her own visit to learn the rest.</t2689>
<t2690>Jane had already informed her sister with a few lines that they had arrived safely in London; she believed that when she wrote again, she would be able to say something about the Bingleys.</t2690>
<t2691>His impatience for this second letter, like every impatience, received its reward.</t2691> <t2692>Jane had been in the city for a week and had neither seen Caroline nor heard from her.</t2692> <t2693>But she attributed this to the possibility that the last letter she wrote to her friend from Longbourn had been accidentally lost.</t2693>
<t2694>"My sister-in-law," he continued, "is going to that part of the city tomorrow; I will also have the opportunity to stop by Grosvenor Street.</t2694><t2695>"</t2695>
<t2696>After the visit, he wrote again; he had seen Miss Bingley.</t2696> <t2697>"I found Caroline unwell," he wrote, "but she was very happy to see me; she was upset that I hadn't informed her of my arrival in London.</t2697> <t2698>So I was right; my last letter did not reach her.</t2698> <t2699>Of course, I asked about her siblings.</t2699> <t2700>They are well, but she is so occupied with Mr. Darcy that they rarely see her.</t2700> <t2701>I learned that Miss Darcy is expected for dinner.</t2701> <t2702>I wish I could see her.</t2702> <t2703>I couldn't stay long; Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were about to go out.</t2703> <t2704>I think I will see them here soon.</t2704><t2705>"</t2705>
<t2706>Elizabeth read the letter, shaking her head.</t2706> <t2707>So, Mr. Bingley could only have learned that his sister was in town by chance.</t2707>
<t2708>Four weeks passed and Jane did not see Mr. Bingley.</t2708> <t2709>She tried to convince herself that she was not upset about this; but she could no longer ignore Miss Bingley's indifference.</t2709> <t2710>After waiting at home every morning for fifteen days, and making excuses for him every evening, the visitor finally appeared; but his short stay, moreover the change in his demeanor, did not allow Jane to deceive herself any longer.</t2710> <t2711>The letter she wrote to her sister about this will show how she felt.</t2711>
<t2712>"I am sure, my dear Lizzy, that Miss Bingley will not derive any pleasure from being proven right in her judgments against me when I admit to myself that I was entirely mistaken about her regard for me.</t2712><t2713>But, my dear sister, although events have proven you right, I hope you do not think me stubborn if I continue to say that, considering Miss Bingley's behavior, my confidence was as natural as your doubt.</t2713><t2714>I cannot understand why she wanted to be close to me; but if the same things were to happen again, I am sure I would be deceived once more.</t2714><t2715>Caroline only returned my visit yesterday; during the intervening time, I received neither a note nor a single line from her.</t2715><t2716>When she did come, it was clear she did not enjoy it; she made a light, formal apology for not having called earlier, said nothing about wanting to see me again, and in every way was so changed that I resolved not to continue our acquaintance after she left.</t2716><t2717>I pity her, but I cannot help blaming her.</t2717><t2718>She made a great mistake in singling me out; I can safely say that all the advances came from her.</t2718><t2719>But I pity her, because she must feel she has acted wrongly, and I am sure it is her concern for her brother that is the cause.</t2719><t2720>I need not explain myself further; we know that this concern is entirely unnecessary, but if she is worried, it easily explains her behavior towards me; since she is justly so fond of her brother, any concern on his behalf is natural and reasonable.</t2720><t2721>However, I cannot help being surprised that she should feel such fears now, because if Mr. Bingley cared about me, we would have met a very, very long time ago.</t2721><t2722>He knows I am in town, I gathered that from something Miss Bingley said; yet it was evident from the way she spoke that she wanted to convince herself that Mr. Bingley really admired Miss Darcy.</t2722><t2723>I cannot understand it.</t2723><t2724>If I were not afraid of making a harsh judgment, I would say there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.</t2724><t2725>But I will try to keep every painful thought at bay and think only of what will make me happy, your love, the unfailing kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.</t2725><t2726>I wish to hear from you as soon as possible.</t2726><t2727>Miss Bingley said something about not returning to Netherfield and leaving the house, but she was not definite.</t2727><t2728>It is best not to speak of it.</t2728><t2729>I am very glad to hear that you have received pleasant news from our friends at Hunsford.</t2729><t2730>Please go and see them, with Sir William and Maria.</t2730><t2731>I am sure you will be very comfortable there.</t2731><t2732>–With love.</t2732><t2733>"</t2733>
<t2734>This letter upset Elizabeth a little; but at least she felt better thinking that Jane could no longer be deceived by that sister.</t2734> <t2735>Expectations regarding the brother were now definitely over.</t2735> <t2736>She didn't even want his interest to revive.</t2736> <t2737>With every examination, his character became a little more unpleasant; punishing him and giving Jane a possible advantage, she seriously hoped that he would soon truly marry Mr. Darcy's sister, because according to Wickham, the girl was the kind who would make him regret the things he had thrown away a thousand times over.</t2737>
<t2738>Around the same days, Mrs. Gardiner reminded Elizabeth of her promise regarding that gentleman and asked for information; Elizabeth had such information that would please her aunt more than herself.</t2738> <t2739>Wickham's evident admiration had passed, his interest had ended; he was now infatuated with someone else.</t2739> <t2740>Elizabeth was perceptive enough to see it all, but she could see and write about it without feeling significant pain.</t2740> <t2741>She wasn't very hurt; her pride was satisfied when she believed that she would be his only choice if his financial situation allowed it.</t2741> <t2742>The most striking charm of the young lady he was now trying to impress was that she had suddenly come into possession of ten thousand pounds; but perhaps because Elizabeth, who showed more understanding to Wickham than she did to Charlotte, wanted to be free, she did not quarrel with him.</t2742> <t2743>On the contrary, nothing could be more natural; while she guessed that Wickham had to struggle a bit to leave her, she was ready to accept that it was a wise and suitable solution for both of them and sincerely wished him happiness.</t2743>
<t2744>All this was told to Mrs. Gardiner; after recounting the events, Elizabeth continued: – "Now I believe, my dear aunt, that I was not too much in love; for if I had experienced that pure and intoxicating passion, I would now be cursing his name and wishing him ill.</t2744> <t2745>But I have good feelings towards him, and I am indifferent to Miss King.</t2745> <t2746>I don't even feel like hating him or refusing to think that she is a very good girl.</t2746> <t2747>There can be no love in all this.</t2747> <t2748>Being alert has helped me; if I were madly in love with him, I would certainly be a more interesting person to all my acquaintances, but I can't say that I regret my relative insignificance.</t2748> <t2749>Importance can sometimes be bought at a very high price.</t2749> <t2750>Kitty and Lydia are much more troubled by this betrayal than I am.</t2750> <t2751>They are still young in the ways of the world; they are not yet open to believing that handsome young men can be as concerned with making a living as ordinary men.</t2751><t2752>"</t2752>
<t2753>Chapter IV</t2753>
<t2754>The months of January and February passed for the Longbourn family without any events of greater significance, or without much color aside from occasional walks to Meryton, sometimes in the mud, sometimes in the cold.</t2754> <t2755>In March, Elizabeth was to go to Hunsford.</t2755> <t2756>Initially, she was not very serious about going; but soon she realized that Charlotte valued the plan, and gradually she learned to think about it with both greater pleasure and greater determination.</t2756> <t2757>In their absence, her desire to see Charlotte again had increased, and her displeasure towards Mr. Collins had diminished.</t2757> <t2758>Life demanded novelty; a home with such a mother and such unbearable sisters could not be considered perfect; a small change, even for her own sake, would not be bad at all.</t2758> <t2759>Moreover, the journey would give her the opportunity to see Jane; in short, as the time approached, she began to worry that there might be a delay or something.</t2759> <t2760>But everything went smoothly and was arranged according to Charlotte's initial plan.</t2760> <t2761>Sir William would accompany her along with his second daughter.</t2761> <t2762>The plan became perfect with the addition of the idea of spending the night in London.</t2762>
<t2763>Her only sorrow was parting from her father; her father would miss her very much, so when the time came, he was not very supportive of her leaving, told her to write to him, and almost promised to reply to her letter.</t2763>
<t2764>The farewell with Mr. Wickham was quite amicable, especially from Wickham's perspective.</t2764> <t2765>His current objective had not allowed him to forget that Elizabeth was the first woman to catch his interest and deserve it, the first to listen and sympathize, the first to be admired; there was a closeness, an interest in his manner while saying goodbye, wishing her good times, reminding her what to expect from Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and saying that he believed they would be in agreement about her – about everyone – and because of this, Elizabeth felt she would remain forever sincerely attached to Wickham; when she parted from him, whether married or single, she believed he would always be the model of a charming and delightful man for her.</t2765>
<t2766>The passengers accompanying him the next day were not the type to make Wickham fall out of favor.</t2766> <t2767>Sir William Lucas and his daughter Maria, a polite but as empty-headed girl as her father, did not have anything worth listening to; listening to them was no more enjoyable than listening to the creaking of the carriage.</t2767> <t2768>Elizabeth liked oddities, but she had known Sir William's for too long.</t2768> <t2769>He could not tell her anything new about the wonders of his presentation at court and his knighthood; his polite manners, like his stories, had worn out.</t2769>
<t2770>It was a twenty-four-mile journey; they set out early and arrived at Gracechurch Street by noon.</t2770> <t2771>As they approached Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at the sitting room window, waiting for their arrival; when they entered the courtyard, she came down to greet them; Elizabeth, who looked eagerly at her face, was happy to see her looking as healthy and charming as ever.</t2771> <t2772>There was a group of girls and boys on the stairs; their curiosity to see their cousins had not allowed them to wait in the sitting room, and their shyness, having not seen her for twelve months, had not allowed them to come down.</t2772> <t2773>Everything was cheerful and sweet.</t2773> <t2774>Most of the day passed pleasantly; bustling and shopping in the morning, theater in the evening.</t2774>
<t2775>Elizabeth made an adjustment and sat down next to her aunt.</t2775> <t2776>Their first topic was her sister; as detailed questions were answered, she felt more pain than surprise upon hearing that Jane always struggled to be cheerful but also went through periods of depression.</t2776> <t2777>Fortunately, it was possible to hope that it wouldn't last long.</t2777> <t2778>Mrs. Gardiner also gave her the details of Miss Bingley's visit to Gracechurch Street and repeated the details of the conversations that took place between her and Jane at different times; it was understood that Miss Bingley had ended the friendship from her own perspective.</t2778>
<t2779>Mrs. Gardiner then pressed her niece about Wickham's misconduct and congratulated her for enduring it so well.</t2779>
<t2780>"But, dear Elizabeth," he added, "what kind of girl is Miss King?</t2780> <t2781>It is sad to think that our friend is a gold-digger.</t2781><t2782>"</t2782>
<t2783>"Please tell me, dear aunt, what is the difference between being greedy and being prudent in matters of marriage?</t2783> <t2784>Where do emotions end and greed begin?</t2784> <t2785>Last Christmas you were afraid of him marrying me because you thought it would be foolish; but now you want to think he is greedy just because he is trying to win a girl who only has ten thousand pounds.</t2785><t2786>"</t2786>
<t2787>"If you tell me what kind of girl Miss King is, I will decide what to think.</t2787><t2788>"</t2788>
<t2789>"She is a very good girl, in my opinion.</t2789> <t2790>I haven't seen any harm from her.</t2790><t2791>"</t2791>
<t2792>"But he never showed any interest in the girl until he inherited this fortune after his grandfather's death."</t2792><t2793>"</t2793>
<t2794>"No –why should he show it?</t2794> <t2795>If he doesn't care about winning my heart because I have no money, what sense does it make for him to court a girl who is equally penniless?</t2795><t2796>"</t2796>
<t2797>"But there's something crude about immediately turning his attention to her right after this incident.</t2797><t2798>"</t2798>
<t2799>"A man in distress does not have the time to devote to all those elegant customs that others might observe."</t2799> <t2800>If the girl does not object, why should we?</t2800><t2801>"</t2801>
<t2802>"The girl's lack of objection does not justify the man.</t2802> <t2803>It only shows a deficiency within the girl herself – either emotion or sensitivity.</t2803><t2804>"</t2804>
<t2805>"Well," cried Elizabeth, "say whatever you like.</t2805> <t2806>Let the man be greedy, and the girl be foolish.</t2806><t2807>"</t2807>
<t2808>"No, Lizzy, that's not what I meant.</t2808> <t2809>It would truly upset me to think badly of a young man who has lived in Derbyshire for so long.</t2809><t2810>"</t2810>
<t2811>"Oh! If that's the issue, I have no regard for the young men living in Derbyshire; their close friends living in Hertfordshire are no better.</t2811> <t2812>I'm tired of all of them.</t2812> <t2813>Thank God!</t2813> <t2814>Tomorrow, I'm going to a place where I'll meet a man who has not a single charming aspect, neither inside nor out.</t2814> <t2815>In my opinion, foolish men are the only ones worth knowing.</t2815><t2816>"</t2816>
<t2817>"Oh dear, Lizzy; there's a strong sense of disappointment in this conversation.</t2817><t2818>"</t2818>
<t2819>Before parting ways at the end of the game, with unexpected joy, they received an invitation to accompany their uncle and aunt on the trip they were planning to take in the summer.</t2819>
<t2820>"We haven't decided exactly how far we will go yet," said Mrs. Gardiner, "perhaps we might go as far as the Lake District.</t2820><t2821>"</t2821>
<t2822>No offer could be more appealing to Elizabeth; she accepted the invitation immediately and gratefully.</t2822> <t2823>"My dear, beloved aunt," she exclaimed with enthusiasm, "what joy! what happiness!</t2823> <t2824>You have given me new life and energy.</t2824> <t2825>Goodbye to disappointment and sorrow.</t2825> <t2826>What are men compared to mountains and rocks?</t2826> <t2827>Oh! just think of the hours we will spend on the roads!</t2827> <t2828>When we return, we will not be like other travelers; we will be able to describe everything in detail.</t2828> <t2829>We will know where we went – we will remember what we saw.</t2829> <t2830>Lakes, mountains, rivers will not get mixed up in our minds; when we try to describe a particular scene, we will not start arguing about what was near and what was far.</t2830> <t2831>Even our hastily told stories will be more convincing than most travelers' accounts.</t2831><t2832>"</t2832>
<t2833>Chapter V</t2833>
<t2834>Everything Elizabeth saw on the journey the next day was new and interesting to her; she was in a cheerful mood because she had seen her sister well enough to dispel all her fears about her health, and the possibility of taking a northern tour was a constant source of joy for her.</t2834>
<t2835>When they left the main road and turned onto the Hunsford road, all eyes began to search for the Parsonage, expecting it to appear after every bend.</t2835> <t2836>The fence of Rosings Park marked their boundaries on one side.</t2836> <t2837>Elizabeth smiled as she remembered all that she had heard about the inhabitants of the estate.</t2837>
<t2838>Finally, the lodgings were chosen.</t2838> <t2839>The garden sloping towards the road, the house within it, the green posts, the laurel bushes, everything announced their arrival.</t2839> <t2840>Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door; the carriage stopped at a small gate; a short gravel path led up from the gate to the house; everyone's satisfaction was evident on their faces.</t2840> <t2841>Soon they all got out of the carriage, looking at each other with joy.</t2841> <t2842>Mrs. Collins greeted her friend with enthusiastic delight; seeing how warmly she was welcomed, Elizabeth was even more pleased to have come.</t2842> <t2843>She immediately noticed that her cousin's behavior had not changed after marriage; his formal politeness was just as it had been, and he detained Elizabeth at the door for a few minutes, inquiring about the health of each member of her family.</t2843> <t2844>Then, without any delay except to draw their attention to the neatness of the entrance, they were taken inside; as soon as they entered the parlor, he welcomed them to his humble abode with grand formality for the second time, and repeated all of his wife's offers of refreshments verbatim.</t2844>
<t2845>Elizabeth was prepared to see him display his triumph; while drawing attention to the dimensions, atmosphere, and furniture of the room, she couldn't help but think that it was specifically addressing her: as if it wanted to make her feel what she had lost by rejecting him.</t2845><t2846>However, although everything appeared to be in place and comfortable, Elizabeth couldn't detect any sign of regret that would please her; on the contrary, she looked at her friend with some amazement for being able to capture such a cheerful atmosphere with such a life partner.</t2846><t2847>Whenever Mr. Collins said something that his wife might be embarrassed by, which was evidently not infrequent, Elizabeth couldn't help but fix her eyes on Charlotte.</t2847><t2848>Once or twice she thought she detected a slight blush; but Charlotte was wise, mostly pretending not to hear.</t2848><t2849>After sitting long enough to admire every piece of furniture in the room, from the display cabinet to the fireplace grate, and to recount their travels and what had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them for a walk in the garden; the garden was large, well-arranged, and he personally took care of its maintenance.</t2849><t2850>Working in his garden was one of his most esteemed pleasures; Elizabeth admired Charlotte's ability to control her facial expressions while she spoke about the benefits of exercise and her great encouragement in this matter.</t2850><t2851>Falling ahead of them on every path, without giving them a second to utter the praises he expected, he pointed out the details of the scenery with a speed that made them forget every beauty.</t2851><t2852>He could count the fields in every direction and tell how many trees were in the most distant grove.</t2852><t2853>But among all the landscapes that his garden, or the country, or the kingdom could boast of, Rosings was incomparable, as seen through the clearing among the trees surrounding the grove facing the front of his house.</t2853><t2854>It was a beautiful, modern building; built on a rising ground.</t2854>
<t2855>After the garden, Mr. Collins was going to show them his two lawns, but the ladies turned back as their shoes were not suitable for the remnants of frost on the ground; while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend back to the house, seemingly very delighted to have the opportunity to show the house without her husband's help.</t2855> <t2856>It was a small house, but well-built and functional; everything was matched with a care and harmony that Elizabeth attributed to Charlotte.</t2856> <t2857>When Mr. Collins was forgotten, there was an air of great comfort everywhere and Charlotte's enjoyment of it; Elizabeth thought that the man must often be forgotten.</t2857>
<t2858>He had previously learned that Lady Catherine was still in the countryside.</t2858> <t2859>This was mentioned again at dinner; Mr. Collins joined the conversation and said-</t2859>
<t2860>"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honor of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh in church next Sunday; I don't even need to tell you that you will be delighted with her.</t2860> <t2861>She is a paragon of kindness and magnanimity; I have no doubt that you will receive a certain amount of her attention once the service is over.</t2861> <t2862>I can say without hesitation that during your stay here, she will include you and my sister-in-law Maria in every invitation she honors us with.</t2862> <t2863>Her behavior towards my dear Charlotte is simply charming.</t2863> <t2864>We dine at Rosings twice a week and are not allowed to walk home.</t2864> <t2865>Her ladyship's carriage is regularly called for us.</t2865> <t2866>One of her carriages, I should say, because she has several.</t2866><t2867>"</t2867>
<t2868>"Lady Catherine is indeed a very respectable, understanding woman," added Charlotte, "and a very considerate neighbor.</t2868><t2869>"</t2869>
<t2870>"That's right, my dear, I say the same thing.</t2870> <t2871>She is such a woman that no matter how much respect you show, it is never enough.</t2871><t2872>"</t2872>
<t2873>The evening mostly passed by talking about Hertfordshire news and recounting things that had already been written; when the evening ended, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her room, had to reflect on how content Charlotte was with her life, understand her ability to guide and endure her husband, and accept that everything was going quite well.</t2873> <t2874>She also had to anticipate how her visit would go, the calm flow of her daily activities, Mr. Collins' tedious interventions, and the amusements in their interactions with Rosings.</t2874> <t2875>A vivid imagination soon resolved everything.</t2875>
<t2876>By the middle of the next day, while preparing for a walk in his room, a sudden noise from downstairs seemed to turn the whole house upside down; after listening for a moment, he heard someone running up the stairs in a wild rush and shouting at him.</t2876> <t2877>He opened the door and saw Maria on the landing; out of breath from excitement, she was shouting-</t2877>
<t2878>"Ah dear Eliza! Please hurry, come to the dining room, there's a sight to see!</t2878> <t2879>I won't tell you what it is.</t2879> <t2880>Hurry up, come down immediately.</t2880><t2881>"</t2881>
<t2882>Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria was not going to say anything else; they ran together down to the dining room; the dining room faced the road, and the marvel they were pursuing was right in front of them! Two ladies were standing in a low carriage at the garden gate.</t2882>
<t2883>"Is that all?" cried Elizabeth.</t2883> <t2884>"I had at least hoped that the pigs had gotten into the garden, but there's nothing here except Lady Catherine and her daughter!</t2884><t2885>"</t2885>
<t2886>"Oh, my dear," said Maria, bewildered by the mistake, "this is not Lady Catherine.</t2886> <t2887>The elderly lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other one is Miss de Bourgh.</t2887> <t2888>Look at her.</t2888> <t2889>What a cute thing.</t2889> <t2890>Who would have thought she was so slim and small!</t2890><t2891>"</t2891>
<t2892>"It's very rude to keep Charlotte outside in this wind.</t2892> <t2893>Why isn't she coming inside?</t2893><t2894>"</t2894>
<t2895>"Charlotte says she rarely comes in.</t2895> <t2896>Miss de Bourgh's entrance is the greatest compliment.</t2896><t2897>"</t2897>
<t2898>"I liked his appearance," said Elizabeth, her mind occupied with other thoughts.</t2898> <t2899>"He looks sick and irritable.</t2899> <t2900>Yes, it will do him good.</t2900> <t2901>She would make a very suitable wife for him.</t2901><t2902>"</t2902>
<t2903>Mr. Collins and Charlotte were standing at the door, talking to the ladies; Sir William, in a manner that would surprise Elizabeth, was positioned in front of the door, eagerly watching the noble person before him, and every time Miss de Bourgh looked that way, he kept bowing his head in greeting.</t2903>
<t2904>Finally, there was nothing left to say; the ladies continued on their way, and the others returned home.</t2904> <t2905>As soon as Mr. Collins saw the two girls, he began to congratulate them on their fortune, and Charlotte explained what the fortune was: the whole group had been invited to dinner at Rosings the next day.</t2905>
<t2906>Chapter VI</t2906>
<t2907>With this invitation, Mr. Collins' success was complete.</t2907> <t2908>The opportunity to showcase his patroness's splendor to curious guests and to have them witness the kindness shown to him and his wife was exactly what he desired; that this opportunity was given so quickly was such a rare example of Lady Catherine's generosity that no amount of gratitude would be sufficient.</t2908>
<t2909>"I must confess," he said, "I wouldn't have been surprised if her ladyship had invited us to Rosings for tea and to spend Sunday evening together.</t2909> <t2910>Knowing how humble she is, I was expecting this.</t2910> <t2911>But who would have thought that we would be invited to dine there immediately after your arrival, and all of us at that!</t2911><t2912>"</t2912>
<t2913>"I wasn't that surprised," replied Sir William, "if you ask why, it's because I know the manners of great people, my position in life has allowed me to acquire that style.</t2913> <t2914>Such refinements are not uncommon in the court circles.</t2914><t2915>"</t2915>
<t2916>All day and the next morning, little was talked about other than the visit to Rosings.</t2916> <t2917>Mr. Collins was carefully warning them about what to expect, so that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and such a magnificent table would not completely overwhelm them.</t2917>
<t2918>While the ladies withdrew to dress, Elizabeth was told-</t2918>
<t2919>"Do not feel uncomfortable about your attire, dear cousin.</t2919> <t2920>Lady Catherine does not expect us to wear dresses that match her and her daughter's elegance.</t2920> <t2921>My advice is to wear whichever of your clothes is superior to the others – nothing more is needed.</t2921> <t2922>Lady Catherine will not think ill of you for being plainly dressed.</t2922> <t2923>She likes to maintain the difference in status.</t2923><t2924>"</t2924>
<t2925>While they were getting dressed, he came to their door several times, urging them to hurry, saying that Lady Catherine did not like to be kept waiting for dinner.</t2925> <t2926>Such grand pronouncements about Her Ladyship and her way of life intimidated Maria Lucas, who was not accustomed to such crowds, and she began to await her introduction at Rosings with the same anxiety as she had awaited her father's introduction at St.</t2926> <t2927>James's.</t2927>
<t2928>Because the weather was nice, they took a pleasant half-mile walk in the grove.</t2928> <t2929>Each grove has its own beauty and characteristics; Elizabeth saw many things she liked, but she still did not feel as much enthusiasm as Mr. Collins hoped the scene would inspire, nor was she very impressed by his counting the windows on the front facade of the house and telling her how much the glass had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.</t2929>
<t2930>As they ascended the stairs, Maria's anxiety increased with each passing moment; even Sir William did not appear very calm.</t2930> <t2931>Elizabeth's courage did not fail her.</t2931> <t2932>She had not heard Lady Catherine praised for extraordinary talents or miraculous virtues, and she thought she could observe the usual splendor of money and rank without feeling intimidated.</t2932>
<t2933>They followed the servants from the entrance hall, which Mr. Collins, in a state of rapture, pointed out for its vast dimensions and perfect adornments, through a waiting room, and entered the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were seated.</t2933> <t2934>Her Ladyship rose with great condescension to receive them; Mrs. Collins, having previously arranged with her husband that the duty of introduction should fall to her, performed the introduction accordingly, without any of the apologies and thanks the man might have deemed necessary.</t2934>
<t2935>Although he had previously been to St. James,</t2935> <t2936>Sir William was so astonished by the surrounding splendor that he could only muster the courage to bow deeply and sit down without uttering a word; his daughter, almost fainting from fear, sat on the edge of her seat, not knowing where to look.</t2936> <t2937>Elizabeth felt quite at ease and was able to calmly observe the three ladies in front of her.</t2937> <t2938>–Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman with stern features that might have been beautiful once.</t2938> <t2939>Her demeanor was not conciliatory, and the way she received them did not make her visitors forget their lower status.</t2939> <t2940>When silent, she was not intimidating; but she spoke in such an authoritative voice that demonstrated her self-importance, which immediately reminded Elizabeth of Mr. Wickham; after observing her all day, Elizabeth concluded that Lady Catherine was exactly as he had described.</t2940>
<t2941>After examining the mother, in whom she immediately found a resemblance to Mr. Darcy in her face and posture, and then turning her eyes to the girl, she seemed to share Maria's astonishment at finding her so thin and petite.</t2941> <t2942>There was neither stature nor facial similarity among the ladies.</t2942> <t2943>Miss de Bourgh looked pale and sickly; her facial features, if not ordinary, were expressionless; she spoke very little and in a low voice only to Mrs. Jenkinson; there was nothing remarkable about Mrs. Jenkinson's appearance, and she was entirely occupied with listening to her and aligning the screen so that the light from the fireplace would not hurt her eyes.</t2943>
<t2944>After sitting for a few minutes, they were all sent to the window to enjoy the view; Mr. Collins accompanied them to point out the beauties of the scenery, and Lady Catherine remarked that it should really be seen in the summer.</t2944>
<t2945>The meal was extremely delightful, and all those servants and all that tableware Mr. Collins had promised were there; as he had mentioned beforehand, he took his place at the other end of the table at the behest of her ladyship, and he looked like someone who thought life could offer no more.</t2945> <t2946>He cut up his food, ate, and praised it with delightful care; each dish was complimented separately, first by him, then by Sir William; Sir William had by then recovered enough to repeat everything his son-in-law said, in a manner that Elizabeth could not understand how Lady Catherine could endure.</t2946> <t2947>But Lady Catherine seemed to take pleasure in their excessive admiration and distributed generous smiles, especially when a dish appeared that they seemed not to have tasted before.</t2947> <t2948>The company was not very talkative.</t2948> <t2949>Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever she found a gap, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh – the former was busy listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter did not say a single word to her throughout the meal.</t2949> <t2950>Mrs. Jenkinson was mostly occupied with observing how little Miss de Bourgh ate, insisting she try another dish, and fearing she had no appetite.</t2950> <t2951>Maria thought that conversation was out of the question, while the gentleman did nothing but eat and admire.</t2951>
<t2952>When the ladies returned to the sitting room, there was little to do but listen to Lady Catherine's conversation; she talked incessantly until the coffee arrived, expressing her opinions on every subject with such a definitive manner that it was clear she was not accustomed to having her judgments questioned.</t2952> <t2953>She closely and meticulously inquired into Charlotte's household affairs and gave her plenty of advice on how to manage everything; she explained how everything should be organized in a small family like hers, and gave lessons on the care of her cows and chickens.</t2953> <t2954>Elizabeth noticed that nothing was beneath this grand lady's interest, as long as it provided her with the opportunity to give instructions to others.</t2954> <t2955>In the midst of her conversation with Mrs. Collins, she directed various questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to Elizabeth; she did not know her relatives and told Mrs. Collins that she was a very elegant and beautiful girl.</t2955> <t2956>At different times, she asked Elizabeth how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than her, whether any of them were likely to get married, whether they were beautiful, where they were educated, what kind of carriages her father had, and her mother's maiden name.</t2956> <t2957>–Elizabeth, though she felt the impertinence of her questions, answered quite calmly.</t2957> <t2958>–Lady Catherine then made this observation,</t2958>
<t2959>"Your father's estate is mortgaged to Mr. Collins, I believe.</t2959> <t2960>From your perspective," he turned to Charlotte, "this is fortunate; but in fact, mortgaging the estate to anyone other than the daughters is not acceptable.</t2960> <t2961>–In Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family, this has not been deemed necessary.</t2961> <t2962>Do you know how to play the piano, sing, Miss Bennet?</t2962><t2963>"</t2963>
<t2964>"A little.</t2964><t2965>"</t2965>
<t2966>"Ah!</t2966> <t2967>Then we would be happy to listen to you sometime.</t2967> <t2968>Our piano is one of the best, probably better than yours–</t2968> <t2969>You should try it one day.</t2969> <t2970>Do your siblings also play and sing?</t2970><t2971>"</t2971>
<t2972>"One of them.</t2972><t2973>"</t2973>
<t2974>"Why didn't all of you learn?</t2974> <t2975>–All of you should have learned.</t2975> <t2976>All the Webblers know, and their father's income isn't as good as yours.</t2976> <t2977>–Will you draw a picture?</t2977><t2978>"</t2978>
<t2979>"No, never.</t2979><t2980>"</t2980>
<t2981>"What do you mean, none of you?"</t2981><t2982>"</t2982>
<t2983>"None of us.</t2983><t2984>"</t2984>
<t2985>"This is very strange.</t2985> <t2986>But you probably haven't had the opportunity.</t2986> <t2987>Your mother should have taken you to the city every spring to benefit from the teachers.</t2987><t2988>"</t2988>
<t2989>"My mother wouldn't object, but my father hates London.</t2989><t2990>"</t2990>
<t2991>"Did your governess leave you?</t2991><t2992>"</t2992>
<t2993>"We never had a governess.</t2993><t2994>"</t2994>
<t2995>"Not at all! How is that possible?</t2995> <t2996>Raising five girls at home without a governess!</t2996> <t2997>I've never heard of such a thing.</t2997> <t2998>Your mother must have worked like a slave for your education.</t2998><t2999>"</t2999>
<t3000>Elizabeth couldn't help but smile as she said that wasn't the case.</t3000>
<t3001>"So, who educated you? Who looked after you?</t3001> <t3002>You must have been neglected without a governess.</t3002><t3003>"</t3003>
<t3004>"According to some families, I'm sure we were privileged; but those of us who wanted to learn were never deprived of the necessary means.</t3004> <t3005>We were always encouraged to read and had all the necessary teachers.</t3005> <t3006>But those who chose idleness were also free to choose it.</t3006><t3007>"</t3007>
<t3008>"Yes, undoubtedly; but that is precisely what a governess is for; if I knew your mother, I would insistently advise her to hire one.</t3008> <t3009>I always say, nothing can be achieved in education without continuous and regular lessons, and only a governess can provide those lessons.</t3009> <t3010>You would be amazed if you knew how many families' needs I have met in this regard.</t3010> <t3011>I am always pleased to place a young person in a good position.</t3011> <t3012>Thanks to me, Mrs. Jenkinson's four nieces have secured very good positions; just the other day, I recommended another young girl who was mentioned to me by chance, and the family was very pleased with her.</t3012> <t3013>Mrs. Collins, did I tell you that Lady Metcalfe came to thank me yesterday?</t3013> <t3014>Miss Pope was a treasure for her.</t3014> <t3015>'Lady Catherine,' she said, 'you have given me a treasure.'</t3015> <t3016>Have your younger sisters been presented to society, Miss Bennet?</t3016><t3017>"</t3017>
<t3018>"Yes, sir, all of them.</t3018><t3019>"</t3019>
<t3020>"All of you! –All five of you at once?</t3020> <t3021>Very strange! –Moreover, you are only the second one.</t3021> <t3022>–The younger ones are coming out before the older ones get married!</t3022> <t3023>–Are your siblings very young?</t3023><t3024>"</t3024>
<t3025>"Yes, our youngest is not even sixteen.</t3025> <t3026>Maybe too young to be among too many people.</t3026> <t3027>But really, sir, it would be very sad if the young ones were deprived of gatherings and entertainments just because the elders do not have the means or desire to marry early.</t3027> <t3028>The youngest has as much right to enjoy the pleasures of youth as the firstborn.</t3028> <t3029>To be kept closed for such a reason!</t3029> <t3030>I don't think it would be very helpful in developing a sense of brotherhood or understanding.</t3030><t3031>"</t3031>
<t3032>"Honestly," said the lady, "you express your opinions very decisively for someone so young.</t3032> <t3033>For God's sake, how old are you?</t3033><t3034>"</t3034>
<t3035>"Since my three younger sisters are grown," replied Elizabeth with a smile, "I suppose her ladyship cannot expect me to state my age.</t3035><t3036>"</t3036>
<t3037>Lady Catherine seemed very surprised not to receive a direct answer; Elizabeth suspected that she was the first person to dare to take such dignified impudence lightly.</t3037>
<t3038>"You can't be more than twenty, I'm sure, –so there's no need to hide your age.</t3038><t3039>"</t3039>
<t3040>"I haven't turned twenty-one yet."</t3040><t3041>"</t3041>
<t3042>When the gentlemen joined them, and the tea was finished, the game tables were set up.</t3042> <t3043>Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; since Miss de Bourgh preferred to play cassino, the two girls supported Mr. Jenkinson to form a group with her.</t3043> <t3044>The tables were extraordinarily dull.</t3044> <t3045>Not a single syllable unrelated to the game came out of anyone's mouth; only Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her concerns about whether Miss de Bourgh was too hot or too cold, whether her clothing was too thick or too thin.</t3045> <t3046>More was happening at the other table.</t3046> <t3047>Lady Catherine was generally speaking – pointing out the mistakes of the other three people or telling an anecdote about herself.</t3047> <t3048>Mr. Collins was busy approving everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every chip he won, and apologizing if he thought he had won too much.</t3048> <t3049>Sir William did not say much.</t3049> <t3050>He was storing anecdotes and noble names in his memory.</t3050>
<t3051>After Lady Catherine and her daughter played until they were bored, the tables were cleared, a carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, the offer was gratefully accepted, and the carriage was immediately ordered.</t3051> <t3052>Then the group gathered around the fire to listen to Lady Catherine decide what the weather would be like the next day.</t3052> <t3053>With the arrival of the carriage, they bid farewell to these observations; they departed with Mr. Collins's numerous expressions of gratitude and Sir William's endless salutations.</t3053> <t3054>As soon as the carriage left the door, Elizabeth was invited by her cousin to comment on what they had seen at Rosings; for Charlotte's sake, Elizabeth made a more favorable comment than she actually felt.</t3054> <t3055>But the praises she struggled so hard to fabricate did not satisfy Mr. Collins in any way, and soon Mr. Collins had to take the task of praising her ladyship into his own hands.</t3055>
<t3056>Chapter VII</t3056>
<t3057>Sir William stayed in Hunsford for only a week, but his visit was long enough to convince him that his daughter had made an extraordinary marriage, and that she had a rare husband and neighbor.</t3057> <t3058>While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to taking him around the countryside in his one-horse carriage; but after he left, the whole family returned to their usual routines; Elizabeth was glad that she did not have to see her cousin more often due to the change; Mr. Collins spent most of the time between breakfast and dinner either working in the garden or reading and writing, or watching the outside from the window of his reading room facing the front road.</t3058>
<t3059>The room where the ladies sat was at the back.</t3059> <t3060>Elizabeth was initially surprised that Charlotte had not chosen the dining room for everyday use; it was a larger room and had a more pleasant view; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for doing so, because if they sat in an equally beautiful room, Mr. Collins would undoubtedly spend less time in his own room; Elizabeth appreciated Charlotte for this arrangement.</t3060>
<t3061>While they were in the living room, they were unaware of what was happening on the road; they could only learn which cars passed by thanks to Mr. Collins, who would promptly inform them of Miss de Bourgh's every passing, even though she passed almost every day.</t3061> <t3062>Occasionally, he would stop at the lodge and talk to Charlotte for a few minutes, but he was reluctant to get out of the car.</t3062>
<t3063>Few days passed without Mr. Collins walking to Rosings, and his wife also deemed it necessary to go as well; Elizabeth did not understand the sacrifice of so many hours until she realized there might be other church parishes to be distributed.</t3063> <t3064>Occasionally, they were honored by a visit from her ladyship; during these visits, nothing that happened in the room escaped her notice.</t3064> <t3065>She examined their occupations, looked at the work they produced, and advised them to do it differently; she found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the servant's neglect; if she accepted to eat or drink something, it seemed she did so only to see that Mrs. Collins's meat allowance was too much for her family.</t3065>
<t3066>Elizabeth soon realized that although this great lady was not a member of the provincial peace committee, she was very active as a judge in her own village; Mr. Collins would bring her detailed reports, and whenever one of the villagers fought, got into trouble, or became very poor, she would immediately go to the village, resolve disputes, silence complaints, and give them a scolding while calling for unity and solidarity.</t3066>
<t3067>The evening entertainment at Rosings was repeated twice a week; since Sir William's place was vacant and only one game table was set up throughout the evening, each of these entertainments was a copy of the first.</t3067> <t3068>They had very few other occupations, as the lifestyle of the neighborhood generally exceeded Mr. Collins' means.</t3068> <t3069>Nevertheless, Elizabeth was not bothered by this and mostly spent her time quite pleasantly; there were sweet half-hour conversations with Charlotte, and the weather was so beautiful for that time of year that she often spent cheerful hours outdoors.</t3069> <t3070>When the others went to visit Lady Catherine, she often went for a walk; she had a favorite route; there was a sheltered, beautiful path along the open plain adjacent to that side of the grove that seemed to matter to no one else, and here she felt herself in a place where Lady Catherine's curiosity could not reach.</t3070>
<t3071>The first fifteen days of her visit passed quickly in this tranquility.</t3071> <t3072>Easter was approaching, and the week before it, there would be a new addition to the family at Rosings, which must have been significant for such a small circle.</t3072> <t3073>Elizabeth had heard shortly after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected to come there within a few weeks; although there were few acquaintances she liked less, his arrival would have added someone relatively new to the parties at Rosings; moreover, by observing his behavior towards her cousin, she could amuse herself by seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's plans regarding him were; Lady Catherine was clearly considering him for her daughter; she spoke of his arrival with great joy, praised him endlessly, and was almost furious when she learned that Miss Lucas and Elizabeth had already seen him many times.</t3073>
<t3074>Mr. Darcy's arrival at the parsonage was immediately noticed, because Mr. Collins had spent the entire morning walking within the view of the outbuildings that opened onto Hunsford Road in order to detect the exact moment of his arrival, and after bowing as the carriage turned into the Grove, he had rushed back to the house with the great news.</t3074> <t3075>The next morning, he hurried to Rosings to pay his respects.</t3075> <t3076>Lady Catherine had two nephews who commanded respect; Mr. Darcy had brought along Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord --------, and as Mr. Collins returned home, the two gentlemen accompanied him, causing great astonishment to everyone.</t3076> <t3077>Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road; she immediately ran to the other room to tell the girls what an honor awaited them, and added–</t3077>
<t3078>"I owe you thanks, Eliza, for this kind gesture.</t3078> <t3079>Mr. Darcy would not have come to visit me so quickly.</t3079><t3080>"</t3080>
<t3081>Before Elizabeth could say that she did not deserve this compliment at all, the doorbell announced their arrival, and shortly after, three gentlemen entered the room.</t3081> <t3082>Leading the way, Colonel Fitzwilliam was in his thirties, unpretentious, but a true gentleman in both his actions and speech.</t3082> <t3083>Mr. Darcy looked just as he had in Hertfordshire – with his usual reserved demeanor, he complimented Mrs. Collins and, regardless of what he felt towards his friend, looked at her with perfect composure.</t3083> <t3084>Elizabeth greeted with a mere bend of her knees, without uttering a single word.</t3084>
<t3085>Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the energy and ease of a well-bred man and spoke sweetly; but his cousin, after expressing a slight observation to Mrs. Collins about the house and garden, sat for a while without speaking to anyone.</t3085> <t3086>Yet, in the end, his politeness prevailed, and he asked Elizabeth about her family's health.</t3086> <t3087>Elizabeth answered in the usual manner and, after a moment's pause, said–</t3087>
<t3088>"My brother has been in the city for three months.</t3088> <t3089>Haven't you ever run into him there?</t3089><t3090>"</t3090>
<t3091>Elizabeth knew very well that she had not met them, but she wanted to see if she would reveal that she knew what had transpired between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought she seemed a bit surprised while answering that she had not had the chance to see Miss Bennet.</t3091> <t3092>The subject was not prolonged; the gentlemen left shortly after.</t3092>
<t3093>Chapter VIII</t3093>
<t3094>Colonel Fitzwilliam's behavior was much appreciated at the parsonage; all the ladies felt that he would add pleasure to their activities at Rosings.</t3094> <t3095>However, it took a few days for them to receive any invitation from there – because when there were guests at the house, they were not needed; they did not receive such attention until Easter day, that is, a week after the gentlemen's arrival; even then, they were only asked to come in the evening as they were leaving the church.</t3095> <t3096>They had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter during the past week.</t3096> <t3097>The Colonel had come to the parsonage several times during that period, but they had only seen Mr. Darcy at church.</t3097>
<t3098>The invitation was, of course, accepted; at a suitable hour, they joined the group in Lady Catherine's drawing room.</t3098> <t3099>Her Ladyship received them politely, but it was clear that their presence was not as welcome as when she could find no one else; indeed, she was almost enraptured with her nephews and spoke to them, especially Darcy, more than to anyone else in the room.</t3099>
<t3100>Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed genuinely pleased to see them; everything at Rosings was a pleasant diversion for him, and Mrs. Collins' beautiful friend had quite caught his interest.</t3100> <t3101>He sat next to her and spoke so sweetly about Kent and Hertfordshire, about traveling and staying at home, about new books and music, that Elizabeth had never enjoyed herself half as much in that room before; they conversed so cheerfully and fluently that they even attracted the attention of both Lady Catherine and Mr. Darcy.</t3101> <t3102>Mr. Darcy's eyes soon and repeatedly turned to them with a curious gaze; Her Ladyship, after a while, also openly expressed her shared sentiment by calling out to them without any hesitation–</t3102>
<t3103>"What are you talking about, Fitzwilliam?</t3103> <t3104>What are you saying like that?</t3104> <t3105>What are you telling Miss Bennet?</t3105> <t3106>Tell me, I want to listen too.</t3106><t3107>"</t3107>
<t3108>"We are talking about music, madam," said Fitzwilliam, when he could no longer avoid answering.</t3108>
<t3109>"From music!</t3109> <t3110>In that case, please speak loudly.</t3110> <t3111>It is my favorite subject.</t3111> <t3112>If you are talking about music, I should have my share of the conversation too.</t3112> <t3113>In England, there are few as keen music listeners as myself, even fewer with as natural a taste, in my opinion.</t3113> <t3114>If I had learned, I would have been a great artist.</t3114> <t3115>Oh look, Anne too, if her health had allowed her to work.</t3115> <t3116>I'm sure she would have done extraordinarily well.</t3116> <t3117>How is Georgiana doing, Darcy?</t3117><t3118>"</t3118>
<t3119>Mr. Darcy spoke with emotional praise about his sister's talent.</t3119>
<t3120>"I am very glad to hear that," said Lady Catherine; "please tell her that she will never succeed unless she practices a great deal."</t3120><t3121>"</t3121>
<t3122>"Rest assured, madam," replied Mr. Darcy, "he has no need of such advice.</t3122> <t3123>He practices constantly.</t3123><t3124>"</t3124>
<t3125>"The more, the better.</t3125> <t3126>There is no end to it; when I write to her again, I will urge her never to neglect this matter.</t3126> <t3127>I often tell young ladies that perfection in music is not achieved without constant practice.</t3127> <t3128>I have also told Miss Bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practices more; Mrs. Collins does not have a piano, but how many times have I told her that she can easily come to Rosings every day and play the piano in Mrs. Jenkinson's room.</t3128> <t3129>It wouldn't interfere with anyone, after all, it's on that side of the house.</t3129><t3130>"</t3130>
<t3131>Mr. Darcy was a bit embarrassed by his aunt's rudeness and did not respond.</t3131>
<t3132>When the coffee was finished, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of her promise to play the piano for him; Elizabeth sat down at the piano immediately.</t3132> <t3133>Fitzwilliam also pulled up a chair next to her.</t3133> <t3134>Lady Catherine listened to half a song, then, as before, talked to her other nephew; until her nephew moved away from her and, with his usual determination, approached the piano and positioned himself where he could fully see the beautiful pianist's face.</t3134> <t3135>Elizabeth saw what he was doing and, at the first suitable pause, turned to him with a mocking smile and said–</t3135>
<t3136>"Are you trying to frighten me by coming to listen to me in this state, Mr. Darcy?</t3136> <t3137>But I will not be alarmed because your sister plays so well.</t3137> <t3138>I have a stubbornness that does not accept being intimidated by others.</t3138> <t3139>Any attempt to frighten me only increases my courage.</t3139><t3140>"</t3140>
<t3141>"I will not say that you are mistaken," replied Mr. Darcy, "because you cannot really believe that I plan to frighten you; I have known you long enough to know that you take great pleasure in occasionally adopting views that are not actually your own.</t3141><t3142>"</t3142>
<t3143>Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pleasant idea of me and will advise you not to believe a single word I say.</t3143> <t3144>It is truly unfortunate that in a place where I hoped to make myself a little liked, I have encountered someone who reveals my true character so well.</t3144> <t3145>Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very cruel of you to speak of everything you learned against me in Hertfordshire – and allow me to say, very imprudent – because it provokes me to take revenge; things that could shock your relatives might come to light.</t3145><t3146>"</t3146>
<t3147>"I am not afraid of you," said Mr. Darcy, smiling.</t3147>
<t3148>"Please tell me what you are accusing him of," cried Colonel Fitzwilliam.</t3148> <t3149>"I want to know how he behaves among strangers.</t3149><t3150>"</t3150>
<t3151>"Listen then –but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.</t3151> <t3152>When I first saw him in Hertfordshire, we were at a ball –and guess what he did at this ball?</t3152> <t3153>He danced only four times!</t3153> <t3154>I apologize for upsetting you –but that's how it was.</t3154> <t3155>Only four dances, despite the lack of men; and I know very well that many ladies were left sitting due to the absence of partners.</t3155> <t3156>Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny what you did.</t3156><t3157>"</t3157>
<t3158>"At that time, I had not had the honor of meeting any lady outside of my own group.</t3158><t3159>"</t3159>
<t3160>"That's right; no one can meet anyone at the ball anyway.</t3160> <t3161>So, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what shall I play now?</t3161> <t3162>My fingers are awaiting your orders.</t3162><t3163>"</t3163>
<t3164>"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I would behave differently if I sought the opportunity to meet; but I am inept at introducing myself to strangers.</t3164><t3165>"</t3165>
<t3166>"Shall we ask your cousin the reason for this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.</t3166> <t3167>"Why would an intelligent, educated man, someone who has seen the world, be inept at introducing himself to strangers, shall we ask?</t3167><t3168>"</t3168>
<t3169>"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "there is no need for you to consult him.</t3169> <t3170>Because it won't cause any trouble.</t3170><t3171>"</t3171>
<t3172>"I don't have the talent that some people possess," said Darcy, "the ability to comfortably talk to people I haven't met before.</t3172> <t3173>I can't catch the tone of their conversations like others do, I can't seem to show interest in the things they talk about.</t3173><t3174>"</t3174>
<t3175>"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not skillfully glide over this instrument like the fingers of many women.</t3175> <t3176>They do not have the same strength, the same speed, nor do they create the same expression.</t3176> <t3177>But I always thought that this was my own fault – because I did not endure the trouble of practicing.</t3177> <t3178>Not because I believed that my fingers could not possess the superior skill like another woman's fingers.</t3178><t3179>"</t3179>
<t3180>Darcy smiled and said, "You are very right.</t3180> <t3181>You have used your time much better.</t3181> <t3182>No one who has had the privilege of listening to you can find any fault.</t3182> <t3183>We both do not play for strangers.</t3183><t3184>"</t3184>
<t3185>Lady Catherine interrupted here: she called out and asked what they were talking about.</t3185> <t3186>Elizabeth immediately started to play.</t3186> <t3187>Lady Catherine approached, and after listening for a few minutes, she said to Darcy–</t3187>
<t3188>"If Miss practiced more and could benefit from a teacher from London, she would never play incorrectly.</t3188> <t3189>Her finger technique is very good, but of course, her taste is not as refined as Anne's.</t3189> <t3190>Anne would have been an extraordinary pianist if her health had allowed her to learn.</t3190><t3191>"</t3191>
<t3192>Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how he would react to the praise about his cousin; but neither at that moment nor at any other time did she see any sign of affection; from his overall behavior towards Miss de Bourgh, Elizabeth drew this consolation on behalf of Miss Bingley: he could have married her too, if she had been his relative.</t3192>
<t3193>Lady Catherine continued to express her opinions about Elizabeth's performance, adding lessons of practice and taste to her remarks.</t3193> <t3194>Elizabeth received these words with all the fortitude of politeness and continued to play the piano at the gentlemen's request until her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them home.</t3194>
<t3195>Chapter IX</t3195>
<t3196>Elizabeth was sitting alone the next morning, writing a letter to Jane; Mrs. Collins and Maria had gone to the village on an errand; at one point, Elizabeth was startled by the ringing of the doorbell, clearly indicating a visitor.</t3196> <t3197>Since she did not hear the sound of a carriage, she thought it might be Lady Catherine and, with that thought, she was putting away her half-finished letter to avoid being subjected to impertinent questions when the door opened and, leaving Elizabeth in great astonishment, Mr. Darcy entered, and it was only Mr. Darcy.</t3197>
<t3198>He also seemed surprised to find Elizabeth alone and apologized for his unannounced visit, saying that he thought all the ladies were at home.</t3198>
<t3199>Then they sat down; after Elizabeth's questions about Rosings were asked, the danger of falling into silence arose.</t3199> <t3200>So it was necessary to think of something, and in this urgent situation, she began to speak, recalling the last time she saw him in Hertfordshire and wondering what he would say about their hasty departure–</t3200>
<t3201>"How suddenly you left Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! Mr. Bingley must have been very surprised and pleased to see you all come right after him; if I remember correctly, he had left the day before.</t3201> <t3202>I hope both he and his sisters were in good health when you left London.</t3202><t3203>"</t3203>
<t3204>"They were very good, thank you.</t3204><t3205>"</t3205>
<t3206>Elizabeth realized she could not get another answer, and after a short silence, she continued–</t3206>
<t3207>"I think they said Mr. Bingley would not return to Netherfield again.</t3207><t3208>"</t3208>
<t3209>"I didn't hear him say such a thing; but it is likely that he won't stay there for long in the future.</t3209> <t3210>He has many friends, and he is at an age where both his friendships and relationships are constantly increasing.</t3210><t3211>"</t3211>
<t3212>"If he does not intend to stay long at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighborhood if he left it altogether, because then a family could settle there.</t3212> <t3213>But perhaps Mr. Bingley has rented the house not for the benefit of the neighborhood, but for himself; and he will probably keep it or leave it for the same reason.</t3213><t3214>"</t3214>
<t3215>"If he leaves as soon as a place to buy comes up," said Darcy, "I wouldn't be surprised.</t3215><t3216>"</t3216>
<t3217>Elizabeth did not respond.</t3217> <t3218>She was afraid to talk more about her friend; since she had nothing else to say, she decided to leave the trouble of finding a new topic to him.</t3218>
<t3219>Darcy received the signal and soon began to speak, "This place looks like a very comfortable home.</t3219> <t3220>When Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford, I believe Lady Catherine did a lot here.</t3220><t3221>"</t3221>
<t3222>"He must have done it – he couldn't have shown his kindness better for someone who knows how to thank better."</t3222><t3223>"</t3223>
<t3224>"Mr. Collins seems very fortunate in his choice of wife."</t3224><t3225>"</t3225>
<t3226>"Indeed it is so; her friends may rejoice that she has met one of the rare, sensible women who can accept her, even make her happy.</t3226> <t3227>My friend has a flawless intellect –though I am not sure marrying Mr. Collins was the wisest thing she has ever done.</t3227> <t3228>Nevertheless, she seems quite happy; and from a common-sense perspective, he is a rather suitable match for her.</t3228><t3229>"</t3229>
<t3230>"He liked settling in a place so close to his family and friends.</t3230><t3231>"</t3231>
<t3232>"Are you saying it's close to here?"</t3232> <t3233>"It's almost fifty miles."</t3233><t3234>"</t3234>
<t3235>"Once the road is good, what is fifty miles?</t3235> <t3236>A little more than half a day's journey, that's all.</t3236> <t3237>Yes, I think it's very close.</t3237><t3238>"</t3238>
<t3239>"I wouldn't really consider proximity as one of the advantages of marriage," exclaimed Elizabeth.</t3239> <t3240>"I wouldn't say Mrs. Collins settled close to her family.</t3240><t3241>"</t3241>
<t3242>"This is proof of your attachment to Hertfordshire.</t3242> <t3243>Everywhere else seems evidently distant to you except the vicinity of Longbourn.</t3243><t3244>"</t3244>
<t3245>While Darcy was speaking, there was a kind of smile on his face, and Elizabeth thought she understood it; she must have assumed he was thinking of Netherfield with Jane; her face turned red as she replied–</t3245>
<t3246>"I do not mean to say that a woman may not settle too near her family.</t3246> <t3247>Distance and nearness are relative; they depend on many varying circumstances.</t3247> <t3248>When there is fortune to make the expenses of traveling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.</t3248> <t3249>But that is not the case here.</t3249> <t3250>Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not enough to allow for frequent journeys – I think my friend would not consider herself near her family unless she lived at half that distance.</t3250><t3251>"</t3251>
<t3252>Mr. Darcy pulled his chair a little towards her and said, "You do not have the right to such strong attachment to your country."</t3252> <t3253>"You cannot always live in Longbourn."</t3253><t3254>"</t3254>
<t3255>Elizabeth seemed surprised.</t3255> <t3256>Mr. Darcy changed his mind; he pulled back his chair, took the newspaper from the table, and, looking over the top of the newspaper, said in a cold voice–</t3256>
<t3257>"Did you like the city?</t3257><t3258>"</t3258>
<t3259>A brief discussion about the region followed, with both sides being calm and measured – it was soon interrupted by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister returning from their walk.</t3259> <t3260>They were surprised to see the two of them alone.</t3260> <t3261>Mr. Darcy explained to Miss Bennet the mistake that caused him to be an uninvited guest, and after sitting for a few more minutes without saying much to anyone, he left.</t3261>
<t3262>"What could this mean?" said Charlotte, as soon as she left.</t3262> <t3263>"My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, otherwise he would never come to us so unceremoniously.</t3263><t3264>"</t3264>
<t3265>When Elizabeth mentioned Miss Darcy's silence, it became clear, despite Charlotte's wishes, that the situation was not quite as she had hoped; after various speculations, they finally assumed that her visit stemmed from the difficulty of finding something to do, which was very possible for that time of year.</t3265> <t3266>All outdoor sports had ended.</t3266> <t3267>Inside, there were only Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but men cannot stay indoors all the time; soon, the parsonage, or the walk there, or the pleasantness of the people there, enticed the two cousins to walk there almost every day thereafter.</t3267> <t3268>In the mornings, at different times, sometimes separately, sometimes together, they visited, and sometimes their aunt accompanied them.</t3268> <t3269>Everyone understood that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he enjoyed their conversation, which made them like him even more; Elizabeth, thinking about the pleasure she took in his company, especially the admiration he showed her, was reminded of her former favorite, George Wickham; comparing the two, she found that Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners had less of a heart-winning softness, but she decided he was better educated.</t3269>
<t3270>It was hard to understand why Mr. Darcy came to the lodge so often.</t3270> <t3271>It couldn't be for friendship, because he would come, sit for ten minutes, and leave without opening his mouth; and when he did speak, it seemed out of necessity rather than desire – not for pleasure, but to avoid rudeness.</t3271> <t3272>He rarely appeared cheerful.</t3272> <t3273>Mrs. Collins didn't know what to make of it.</t3273> <t3274>Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasional amusement at his absent-mindedness indicated that he was normally a different person, otherwise, she didn't know Mr. Darcy well enough to decide for herself; she seriously dedicated herself to finding out, because she liked to believe that this change was due to the effect of love, and that the object of his affection was her friend Elizabeth.</t3274> <t3275>She observed him every time they went to Rosings or whenever he came to Hunsford, but she didn't achieve much success.</t3275> <t3276>He looked at her friend a lot, but the expression of that gaze was debatable.</t3276> <t3277>It was a determined, steady gaze, but she wasn't sure if it contained much admiration and sometimes it just seemed like absent-mindedness.</t3277>
<t3278>Once or twice, she mentioned to Elizabeth the possibility that Mr. Darcy might be in love with her, but every time Elizabeth laughed it off, Mrs. Collins decided it was not right to insist on the matter too much, as there was a danger of raising hopes that could only end in disappointment, because it seemed to her that the moment her friend believed Mr. Darcy was in love with her, all her coldness towards him would disappear.</t3278>
<t3279>While making sweet plans for Elizabeth, he sometimes imagined her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.</t3279> <t3280>He was a more charming man than anyone else; he was clearly enamored with Elizabeth; his means were extremely ample; however, despite these advantages, Mr. Darcy was also a significant patron of the church, whereas his cousin had no connection to the church.</t3280>
<t3281>Chapter X</t3281>
<t3282>While Elizabeth was walking around, she unexpectedly encountered Mr. Darcy several times.</t3282> <t3283>–She felt all the discomfort of the unfortunate coincidence that brought him to a place where no one else came, and to prevent it from happening again, she immediately told him that it was her favorite refuge.</t3283> <t3284>–However, it was very strange for this to happen a second time!</t3284> <t3285>–But it did, and in fact, it happened once more after that.</t3285> <t3286>It was actually no different from a deliberate mischief or a voluntary ordeal, because in these situations, it wasn't just about asking a few formal questions, awkwardly hesitating, and then leaving; on the contrary, Mr. Darcy found it really necessary to turn back and walk with her.</t3286> <t3287>He didn't talk much; Elizabeth also didn't bother to talk or listen to him much; but during their third encounter, she was intrigued by some odd, unrelated questions he asked –whether she liked being in Hunsford, her solitary walks, her views on Mr. and Mrs. Collins' happiness; then, when Elizabeth mentioned Rosings and that she didn't know the house well, Mr. Darcy spoke as if he hoped she would stay there during her next visit to Kent.</t3287> <t3288>His words implied this.</t3288> <t3289>Could he have been thinking of Colonel Fitzwilliam?</t3289> <t3290>Elizabeth thought that if he meant anything, he might be hinting in that direction.</t3290> <t3291>This bothered her a bit, and she was glad when she found herself at the gate of the fence opposite the lodge.</t3291>
<t3292>One day, while walking and rereading Jane's last letter, her mind got stuck on a part that showed Jane wrote without cheer, and instead of being surprised by Mr. Darcy again, she looked up and saw Colonel Fitzwilliam coming towards her.</t3292> <t3293>She immediately put the letter away and, with difficulty smiling, said–</t3293>
<t3294>"I didn't know you were walking this path.</t3294><t3295>"</t3295>
<t3296>"I was walking through the grove," answered Colonel Fitzwilliam, "I do it every year; I was going to end the walk by stopping by the lodge.</t3296> <t3297>Are you going any further?</t3297><t3298>"</t3298>
<t3299>"No, I was about to leave too.</t3299><t3300>"</t3300>
<t3301>She turned around; they started walking towards the lodging together.</t3301>
<t3302>"Are you really leaving Kent on Saturday?" said Elizabeth.</t3302>
<t3303>"Yes – if Darcy doesn't postpone again.</t3303> <t3304>But I am subject to him.</t3304> <t3305>He arranges things as he pleases.</t3305><t3306>"</t3306>
<t3307>"If she is not pleased with the arrangement, at least she can be satisfied with having had the choice.</t3307> <t3308>I have never seen anyone who loves having the power to do as they wish more than Mr. Darcy.</t3308><t3309>"</t3309>
<t3310>"He loves to do as he pleases," answered Colonel Fitzwilliam.</t3310> <t3311>"But of course, we all do.</t3311> <t3312>He just has more means to do so, because he is rich and many others are poor.</t3312> <t3313>I am speaking of myself.</t3313> <t3314>Being the younger son, I am accustomed to sacrifice and dependency.</t3314><t3315>"</t3315>
<t3316>"I don't think the younger son of a count knows either of them very well.</t3316> <t3317>Seriously, do you know what sacrifice and dependency are?</t3317> <t3318>When has a lack of money ever stopped you from going wherever you wanted or buying something you desired?</t3318><t3319>"</t3319>
<t3320>"These are valid questions –perhaps I can't say I've faced too much difficulty of that kind.</t3320> <t3321>But I might face financial difficulties in more important matters.</t3321> <t3322>Young sons cannot marry the person they want.</t3322><t3323>"</t3323>
<t3324>"If they don't want wealthy women, of course; I suppose they do this very often."</t3324><t3325>"</t3325>
<t3326>"Our spending habits make us quite dependent; there aren't many people in my position in life who can afford to get married without giving some importance to money.</t3326><t3327>"</t3327>
<t3328>"I wonder," thought Elizabeth, "is he referring to me with this?" and the thought made her blush; but, pulling herself together, she said in a cheerful voice, "For God's sake, can you tell me, what is the usual price for the younger son of an earl?</t3328> <t3329>If his elder brother is not very ill, surely you wouldn't ask for more than fifty thousand pounds.</t3329><t3330>"</t3330>
<t3331>He responded in the same manner, and the matter was dropped.</t3331> <t3332>Elizabeth immediately said the following to avoid a silence that might suggest she was affected by the conversation–</t3332>
<t3333>"I think your cousin brought you along to have someone at his command.</t3333> <t3334>I'm surprised he hasn't married to have this kind of comfort all the time.</t3334> <t3335>But maybe for now his sister is enough; since he is her guardian, he can manage her as he wishes.</t3335><t3336>"</t3336>
<t3337>"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "this is a privilege that should be shared with me.</t3337> <t3338>I am a partner with him in Miss Darcy's guardianship.</t3338><t3339>"</t3339>
<t3340>"Is that really so?</t3340> <t3341>God knows what kind of saints you have become?</t3341> <t3342>Does the young lady upset you a lot?</t3342> <t3343>It is a bit difficult to manage young girls at that age; especially if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may want to do as she pleases.</t3343><t3344>"</t3344>
<t3345>Elizabeth noticed that Colonel Fitzwilliam was looking at her with curiosity while she was speaking, and the way he immediately asked her why Miss Darcy might upset them convinced Elizabeth that she was quite close to the truth from one angle.</t3345> <t3346>He immediately replied,</t3346>
<t3347>"You don't need to be afraid.</t3347> <t3348>I haven't heard anything bad about him; in fact, I think he is one of the most charming people in the world.</t3348> <t3349>He is a favorite of some ladies I know, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.</t3349> <t3350>If I'm not mistaken, you mentioned that you know them.</t3350><t3351>"</t3351>
<t3352>"I know him a little.</t3352> <t3353>His brothers are pleasant gentlemen – Darcy's close friend.</t3353><t3354>"</t3354>
<t3355>"Indeed," said Elizabeth in a dry tone – "Mr. Darcy is extremely kind to Mr. Bingley; he looks after him as if he were his child.</t3355><t3356>"</t3356>
<t3357>"He looks out for him, right!</t3357> <t3358>Yes, I think Darcy looks out for him when needed.</t3358> <t3359>From something he told me on the way here, I got the impression that Bingley owes him.</t3359> <t3360>But forgive me, I have no right to think that the person in question is Bingley.</t3360> <t3361>It's all my assumption.</t3361><t3362>"</t3362>
<t3363>"What do you mean?</t3363><t3364>"</t3364>
<t3365>"A situation Darcy doesn't want to spread around; if it reaches the lady's family, it would be very unpleasant.</t3365><t3366>"</t3366>
<t3367>"You can be sure that I won't tell anyone."</t3367><t3368>"</t3368>
<t3369>"But remember, I have little reason to believe it was Bingley.</t3369> <t3370>All he told me was that he recently congratulated himself for saving a friend from making an unwise marriage, without giving any names or details. I only suspected it was Bingley because he is the kind of man who would be influenced in that way, and also because I knew they were together all last summer.</t3370><t3371>"</t3371>
<t3372>"Did Mr. Darcy tell you the reasons for his intervention?</t3372><t3373>"</t3373>
<t3374>"There were some very strong objections against the lady."</t3374><t3375>"</t3375>
<t3376>"So, what skills did he use to separate them?"</t3376><t3377>"</t3377>
<t3378>"He didn't tell me about his own skills," said Fitzwilliam, smiling.</t3378> <t3379>"He only told me what I told you.</t3379><t3380>"</t3380>
<t3381>Elizabeth did not answer; she continued walking, her heart swelling with anger.</t3381> <t3382>After watching her for a while, Fitzwilliam asked why she was so pensive.</t3382>
<t3383>"I am thinking about what you told me," said Elizabeth.</t3383> <t3384>"Your cousin's behavior does not align with my feelings.</t3384> <t3385>Why would he be a judge?</t3385><t3386>"</t3386>
<t3387>"It seems you found his intervention meddlesome.</t3387><t3388>"</t3388>
<t3389>"What right does Mr. Darcy have to decide whether his friend's wish is appropriate, or how does he determine and direct what will make his friend happy, I don't understand."</t3389> <t3390>"But," he continued, collecting himself, "it would not be fair to condemn him as we do not know the details.</t3390> <t3391>Clearly, there was no significant affection involved.</t3391><t3392>"</t3392>
<t3393>"This is not an incorrect assumption," said Fitzwilliam, "but it sadly diminishes the grandeur of my cousin's triumph.</t3393><t3394>"</t3394>
<t3395>This remark was made in jest, but it seemed to Elizabeth such an accurate depiction of Darcy that she did not dare to respond; consequently, she immediately changed the subject and talked about trivial matters until they reached the parsonage.</t3395> <t3396>At the parsonage, as soon as the guest left, she shut herself in her room and thought long and hard about everything she had heard.</t3396> <t3397>She thought it could not have been referring to anyone other than the people she knew.</t3397> <t3398>There could not be a second man in the world whom Darcy could so thoroughly influence.</t3398> <t3399>She had no doubt that he had been involved in measures to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane; but she had always attributed the main plan and execution to Miss Bingley.</t3399> <t3400>If Mr. Bingley's own pride did not guide him, then the reason for all Jane's suffering, which she still continued to endure, was him, his pride and arrogance.</t3400> <t3401>He had temporarily shattered all hope of happiness in the most loving, most generous heart in the world; moreover, no one could yet know how lasting the damage was.</t3401>
<t3402>"There were some very strong objections against the lady," these were the words of Colonel Fitzwilliam, and those strong objections were probably that her uncle was a country lawyer and her other uncle was a tradesman in London.</t3402>
<t3403>"Jane herself," he cried, "could never have objected.</t3403> <t3404>She is a monument of beauty and goodness!</t3404> <t3405>Her intelligence is so flawless, her spirit so mature, her manners so graceful.</t3405> <t3406>Nothing can be said against my father either; yes, he has his peculiarities, but he has talents that Mr. Darcy cannot scorn and a honesty he probably will never possess."</t3406> <t3407>Thinking of her mother, of course, shook her confidence a little, but she did not believe that even the objections at that point would have a significant effect on Mr. Darcy; it seemed to Elizabeth that Mr. Darcy's pride had been most deeply wounded by the insignificance of his friend's relatives, not their impropriety; in the end, she concluded that he acted out of this worst kind of pride on one hand, and on the other hand, the desire to keep Mr. Bingley for his own sister.</t3407>
<t3408>The excitement and tears caused by the issue brought on a headache; the pain worsened so much by the evening that, combined with her reluctance to see Mr. Darcy, it prevented her from accompanying her cousins to the tea invitation at Rosings.</t3408> <t3409>Seeing that she was truly unwell, Mrs. Collins did not insist on her going, and did her best to prevent her husband from insisting as well, but Mr. Collins did not hide his fear that Lady Catherine would not be pleased to hear this.</t3409>
<t3410>Chapter XI</t3410>
<t3411>When they left, Elizabeth, as if wanting to make herself even angrier with Mr. Darcy, began to examine all the letters Jane had written to her since she came to Kent.</t3411> <t3412>There was no specific complaint in the letters; past events were not remembered, nor was there any mention of present suffering.</t3412> <t3413>But in all of them, and in almost every line of them, there was a lack of that cheerfulness which had so far hardly ever been dimmed, coming from the tranquility of a spirit at peace with itself and kind to everyone, which was a typical feature of her style.</t3413> <t3414>When Elizabeth read them more carefully than she had the first time, she noticed that every sentence carried a sense of discomfort.</t3414> <t3415>Mr. Darcy's arrogant boasting about the sorrow he had caused made her feel her sister's pains more acutely.</t3415> <t3416>The thought that Mr. Darcy's visit to Rosings would end the next day gave her some relief; the thought that in less than fifteen days she would be with Jane again, and with all her love would help restore her cheerfulness, gave her even more comfort.</t3416>
<t3417>She could not imagine Darcy leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin would be going with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions regarding her, and although he was a pleasant man, Elizabeth had no intention of being unhappy because of him.</t3417>
<t3418>While sorting out this point in her mind, she was suddenly startled by the doorbell; the thought that it might be Colonel Fitzwilliam made her heart race; Colonel Fitzwilliam had called once in the afternoon and might have come now out of special concern for her.</t3418> <t3419>But this thought quickly passed, and her heart came under a different influence: she saw with astonishment that Mr. Darcy had entered the room.</t3419> <t3420>Mr. Darcy, with an unhurried demeanor, immediately inquired about her health, attributing his visit to a desire to hear that she was feeling better.</t3420> <t3421>Elizabeth responded to him with cold politeness.</t3421> <t3422>Mr. Darcy sat for a few seconds, then got up and began to walk around the room.</t3422> <t3423>Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.</t3423> <t3424>After a few minutes of silence, he approached her excitedly and began to speak,</t3424>
<t3425>"I have struggled in vain.</t3425> <t3426>It will not work.</t3426> <t3427>My feelings cannot be repressed.</t3427> <t3428>Allow me to tell you how passionately I admire and love you.</t3428><t3429>"</t3429>
<t3430>Elizabeth's astonishment was indescribable.</t3430> <t3431>Her eyes widened, her face turned red, she became doubtful and fell silent.</t3431> <t3432>Mr. Darcy took this as a sign of hope; immediately afterward, he began to confess all his feelings for her, feelings he had harbored for a long time.</t3432> <t3433>He spoke beautifully, but there were other emotions to express alongside the feelings of the heart; he was not more passionate when speaking of love than when speaking of pride.</t3433> <t3434>His thoughts on Elizabeth's lower status, the disgrace it brought, the family obstacles in the way, and how his mind had always opposed it were conveyed with a warmth that seemed more injurious to his own family position than likely to benefit his marriage proposal.</t3434>
<t3435>Despite the deep coldness she felt, Elizabeth couldn't remain indifferent to the pleasure of having won the love of such a man; although her intention had not changed for even a moment, she pitied him for the pain he was about to endure; but then, feeling disturbed by the language he used, all her pity vanished in anger.</t3435> <t3436>Nevertheless, she tried to compose herself to be able to respond to him patiently when he finished speaking.</t3436> <t3437>Mr. Darcy, despite all his efforts, concluded his speech by expressing the strength of the love he couldn't manage to forget, and his hope that his love would be reciprocated and his proposal accepted.</t3437> <t3438>As he said these things, Elizabeth could easily see that he had no doubt he would receive a positive response.</t3438> <t3439>He spoke of anxiety and concern, but his face expressed genuine confidence.</t3439> <t3440>This sight only increased her anger; when Mr. Darcy finished his words, Elizabeth, with her cheeks flushed, said,</t3440>
<t3441>"In situations like this, I believe it is customary to express a sense of obligation in response to confessed feelings, even if they cannot be reciprocated to the same extent.</t3441> <t3442>It is natural to feel obligated; if I could feel gratitude, I would thank you now.</t3442> <t3443>But I cannot – I never desired your kind feelings, and you expressed them quite reluctantly anyway.</t3443> <t3444>I would not want to cause anyone pain.</t3444> <t3445>It was something done thoughtlessly, and I hope it passes soon.</t3445> <t3446>The thoughts you said prevented you from accepting your feelings for a long time will not have much difficulty overcoming your feelings after this explanation.</t3446><t3447>"</t3447>
<t3448>Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the fireplace with his eyes fixed on Elizabeth's face, seemed to meet her words with as much confusion as distress.</t3448> <t3449>His face paled with anger; it was evident in every line of his face that his mind was troubled.</t3449> <t3450>He struggled to control his appearance and did not open his mouth until he believed he had succeeded.</t3450> <t3451>The silence was terrifying to Elizabeth.</t3451> <t3452>Finally, Mr. Darcy said with forced calmness,</t3452>
<t3453>"The answer you granted is just this, clearly!</t3453> <t3454>Maybe I'll have the chance to learn why I was rejected with such limited courtesy.</t3454> <t3455>But it's not that important.</t3455><t3456>"</t3456>
<t3457>"I might ask you this," replied Elizabeth, "why do you tell me that you love me against your will, your reason, and even your character, with such a clear sense of insult?</t3457> <t3458>If I have acted rudely, isn't that a sufficient reason to behave rudely?</t3458> <t3459>But I have other reasons as well.</t3459> <t3460>You know I do.</t3460> <t3461>Do you think I would accept the man who perhaps forever ruined the happiness of my dearest sister, for any reason, if my feelings towards you were not negative, if they were indifferent, or even if they were positive?</t3461><t3462>"</t3462>
<t3463>Upon hearing this, Mr. Darcy's color changed; but his discomfort quickly passed, and he listened to Elizabeth, who continued speaking, without intervening.</t3463>
<t3464>"I have every reason to think badly of you.</t3464> <t3465>No explanation can excuse the unfair and cruel role you played there.</t3465> <t3466>Even if you were not alone in separating them, you cannot deny that you played the leading role, you made one fall from grace by calling them spoiled and unstable, and you made the other a subject of ridicule for having false hopes, forcing both into severe misery.</t3466><t3467>"</t3467>
<t3468>She saw that he was listening with an air that showed he felt not the slightest bit of remorse, and she became angry again.</t3468> <t3469>Mr. Darcy, on the contrary, was looking at her with a smile of feigned disbelief.</t3469>
<t3470>"Can you deny what you have done?" he repeated.</t3470>
<t3471>Then Mr. Darcy replied with a feigned calmness, "I will not deny that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, and that I am pleased with my success.</t3471> <t3472>I was more careful with my friend than I was with myself.</t3472><t3473>"</t3473>
<t3474>Elizabeth could not bring herself to appear to have noticed this kind-hearted thought, but its meaning did not escape her; besides, it was impossible to appease her.</t3474>
<t3475>"But the reason I dislike you is not just this matter," he continued; "my opinion of you was formed long before this.</t3475> <t3476>The story I heard from Mr. Wickham months ago revealed your character clearly.</t3476> <t3477>What do you have to say about this?</t3477> <t3478>With what imaginary act of friendship can you defend yourself? Or with what unfounded words can you deceive others?</t3478><t3479>"</t3479>
<t3480>"You are quite interested in those brain matters," said Darcy in a less calm tone of voice, his color deepening further.</t3480>
<t3481>"No one who hears about the misfortune he suffered can remain indifferent to him.</t3481><t3482>"</t3482>
<t3483>"Misfortune!" repeated Darcy with disdain; "yes, she has indeed encountered great misfortune.</t3483><t3484>"</t3484>
<t3485>"You are the reason," cried Elizabeth excitedly.</t3485> <t3486>"You pushed him into this poverty, relatively speaking, into poverty.</t3486> <t3487>You deprived him of the opportunities you knew he left for.</t3487> <t3488>You took away the best years of his life, the chance for the freedom he deserved.</t3488> <t3489>You did all this! And now you mock his misfortune.</t3489><t3490>"</t3490>
<t3491>"So, this is it," cried Darcy as he paced the room briskly, "so this is what you think of me!</t3491> <t3492>So this is how you see me!</t3492> <t3493>Thank you for explaining it so thoroughly.</t3493> <t3494>According to this account, my faults are indeed great!</t3494> <t3495>Perhaps," he added, turning towards her, "these insults could have been overlooked, but your pride was wounded because I honestly confessed the concerns that have long prevented me from making a serious attempt.</t3495> <t3496>If I had concealed my struggle with a finer strategy, flattering your pride with reason, logic, and everything, making you believe I was a captive of an indescribable, pure passion, these bitter accusations might have been dismissed.</t3496> <t3497>But I despise every kind of falsehood.</t3497> <t3498>Moreover, I am not ashamed of the feelings I have expressed.</t3498> <t3499>Because they are natural and justified feelings.</t3499> <t3500>Can you expect me to take pleasure in the low status of your relatives?</t3500> <t3501>Should I congratulate myself for having kin whose positions in life are so far below mine?</t3501><t3502>"</t3502>
<t3503>Elizabeth felt herself becoming even angrier; nevertheless, she made a great effort to control herself while speaking:</t3503>
<t3504>"If you think that making your proposal in another manner would have affected me, you are mistaken, Mr. Darcy; by not behaving more gentlemanly, you have only spared me from worrying whether you were hurt because I rejected you.</t3504><t3505>"</t3505>
<t3506>She saw that Darcy flinched at these words but did not respond, and she continued,</t3506>
<t3507>"There was no way to make me accept the hand you extended."</t3507><t3508>"</t3508>
<t3509>Once again, his astonishment was evident; he was looking at her with a mixture of disbelief and humiliation.</t3509> <t3510>Elizabeth continued.</t3510>
<t3511>"From the very beginning, almost from the first moment I saw you, your demeanor convinced me that you were an arrogant, conceited person who selfishly disregarded the feelings of others. That is how my anger towards you was born, and it turned into a severe discontent with subsequent events; it hadn't even been a month since I got to know you when I felt that even if you were the last man on earth, no force could persuade me to marry you."</t3511><t3512>"</t3512>
<t3513>"You have spoken enough, madam.</t3513> <t3514>I understand your feelings very well; now I must only be ashamed of my own feelings.</t3514> <t3515>Forgive me for taking up so much of your time and accept my wishes for health and happiness.</t3515><t3516>"</t3516>
<t3517>And with these words, he hurriedly left the room; shortly after, Elizabeth heard him open the front door and leave the house.</t3517>
<t3518>The storm in her mind had increased to a painful extent.</t3518> <t3519>She didn't know how to stand and, in complete exhaustion, sat down and cried for half an hour.</t3519> <t3520>As she thought about what had happened, every image increased her astonishment.</t3520> <t3521>To receive a marriage proposal from Mr. Darcy! for him to be in love with her for so many months! for him to want to marry her despite all the obstacles that led him to prevent his friend from marrying her sister, obstacles that were equally valid for his own situation, it was unbelievable! To have unknowingly inspired such a strong love was an honor.</t3521> <t3522>But Darcy's pride, that disgusting pride, his shameless confession of what he did regarding Jane, his unforgivable arrogance in accepting it even though he couldn't justify himself, and his callous demeanor when speaking of Mr. Wickham, the cruelty he did not deny towards him, soon destroyed the feeling of pity that thinking about his love had momentarily created.</t3522>
<t3523>He continued with the thoughts that shook his heart until he realized, with the noise of Lady Catherine's carriage, that he was in no state to face Charlotte and hurried to his room.</t3523>
<t3524>Chapter XII</t3524>
<t3525>The next morning, Elizabeth woke up with the same feelings and thoughts she had when she last closed her eyes.</t3525> <t3526>She had not yet recovered from the impact of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; she also did not feel like engaging in any activity, so she decided to entertain herself by taking a walk in the open air right after breakfast.</t3526> <t3527>She was heading straight to her favorite path when she remembered that Mr. Darcy sometimes came there, so she stopped and, instead of entering the grove, went up the path and moved away from the main road.</t3527> <t3528>The grove fences still marked a boundary on one side; shortly after, she passed through one of the gates and entered the field.</t3528>
<t3529>After walking along that part of the path two or three times, he felt the urge to stop at the door and watch the grove, captivated by the beauty of the morning.</t3529> <t3530>The five weeks he had spent in the city had changed many things in nature; each new day was increasing the greenness of the blossoming trees.</t3530> <t3531>As he was about to continue his walk, he caught sight of a man in the wooded area along the edge of the grove; the man was coming towards him; fearing it might be Mr. Darcy, he immediately turned back.</t3531> <t3532>But the approaching man was now close enough to see him and excitedly rushed forward, calling out his name.</t3532> <t3533>Elizabeth had turned the other way, but upon hearing herself being called, she continued walking towards the door, even though she recognized Mr. Darcy's voice.</t3533> <t3534>Mr. Darcy caught up with her at the door and handed her a letter, and as Elizabeth instinctively took the letter, he said with a haughty solemnity, "I was walking in the grove hoping to meet you.</t3534> <t3535>Would you be so kind as to read this letter?" –Then he bowed slightly, turned, disappeared among the trees, and was out of sight.</t3535>
<t3536>Without any expectation of satisfaction, but with a strong curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter and saw with increasing astonishment that the envelope contained two sheets of letter paper filled with cramped handwriting.</t3536> <t3537>–The envelope itself was also similarly filled.</t3537> <t3538>–She began to read the letter as she walked along the path.</t3538> <t3539>It was written at eight o'clock in the morning at Rosings, and it said: –</t3539>
<t3540>"When you receive this letter, Madam, do not be alarmed thinking that he repeated the confessions that were so repulsive to you last night or renewed those proposals.</t3540> <t3541>I am not writing with the intention of causing you pain by dwelling on wishes that should be forgotten as soon as possible for the happiness of both of us, nor to demean myself; my respectability required that this letter be written and read, but it would not be worth the effort to write or read it.</t3541> <t3542>Therefore, you must excuse my audacity in seeking your attention; I know your feelings will reluctantly respond to my request, but I make this appeal relying on your sense of justice.</t3542>
<t3543>"Last night, you accused me of two evils of very different natures and varying degrees of importance.</t3543> <t3544>The first was that I separated Mr. Bingley from your sister without regard for either of their feelings, and the second was that I hindered Mr. Wickham's prosperity and darkened his future by rejecting various claims, disregarding honor and humanity.</t3544> <t3545>–To deliberately and irresponsibly cast aside a childhood friend, known to be my father's favorite, who had no means of subsistence outside our protection and was raised to expect to benefit from our patronage, would have been a deprivation incomparable to the separation of children with only a few weeks of shared feelings.</t3545> <t3546>–But when the following explanation of my actions and reasons is read, I hope to be spared from the severity of the accusations so unreservedly directed at me last night in both matters.</t3546> <t3547>–If I feel compelled to explain emotions that may seem repulsive to you while doing so, I can only apologize for it.</t3547> <t3548>–I must comply with this obligation –to apologize further would be absurd.</t3548> <t3549>–It wasn't long after I arrived in Hertfordshire that I, like others, saw that Bingley preferred your sister over all the other girls in the countryside.</t3549> <t3550>But it wasn't until the dance evening at Netherfield that I realized he had serious attachment.</t3550> <t3551>–I had seen him in love many times before.</t3551> <t3552>–At that ball, while I was dancing with you, a casual remark by Sir William Lucas made me realize for the first time that Bingley's interest in your sister had created expectations of marriage in everyone.</t3552> <t3553>Sir William spoke of it as if it were a certain event, with only the date left to be determined.</t3553> <t3554>From that moment, I observed my friend's actions carefully; and it was only then that I understood his attachment to Miss Bennet was beyond what I had seen before.</t3554> <t3555>I also watched your sister.</t3555> <t3556>–Her demeanor was as open, cheerful, and charming as ever, but there were no signs of special interest; from my observations that evening, I concluded that while Miss Bennet accepted Bingley's interest with pleasure, she did not invite it with any shared feelings.</t3556> <t3557>–If you are not mistaken on this point, then I was wrong.</t3557> <t3558>Your better knowledge of your sister strengthens the second possibility.</t3558> <t3559>–If so, if I made a mistake that caused her pain, your resentment would not be unjust.</t3559> <t3560>But I will say without hesitation that the seriousness in your sister's face and demeanor was such that even the most careful observer would think she was someone who, while friendly, was not easily accessible to the heart.</t3560> <t3561>–It is true that I wanted to believe in her indifference, –but I can say that my investigations and decisions are generally not influenced by my hopes or fears.</t3561> <t3562>–I did not believe in your sister's indifference because I wanted it to be so; –I believed it with impartial conviction, and with the same sincerity.</t3562> <t3563>–My objections to the marriage were not the matters I confessed last night could be overcome by a great passion on my part; the issue of relatives was not as great an obstacle for my friend as it was for me.</t3563> <t3564>–But there were other annoying circumstances; –although they still exist, and even if they exist to the same extent for both of us, they are not constantly in front of me, so I personally try to forget them.</t3564> <t3565>–These reasons also need to be briefly mentioned.</t3565> <t3566>–The situation of your mother's family, though repulsive, is insignificant compared to the absolute vulgarity almost always displayed by her, your three younger sisters, and even occasionally your father.</t3566> <t3567>–Forgive me.</t3567> <t3568>–It pains me to offend you.</t3568> <t3569>However, despite the discomfort you feel because of the faults of your closest relatives and the displeasure you will feel at their being described in this way, you may find consolation in knowing that the praise of your and your sister's intelligence and sensitivity, which prevents you from sharing in a similar judgment, is frequently expressed as you deserve.</t3569> <t3570>–Lastly, I must say that what happened that evening confirmed my views on everyone and strengthened my desire to protect my friend from a connection I found very unpleasant without further delay.</t3570> <t3571>–The next day, as you surely know, he went to London from Netherfield, intending to return soon.</t3571> <t3572>–Now it's time to explain the role I played.</t3572> <t3573>–His sisters' discomfort was no less than mine; we soon realized we shared the same thought; and believing that we should not waste time in separating their brother, we immediately decided to go to London to join him.</t3573> <t3574>–We went –there I began to explain to my friend the certain disadvantages of such a choice.</t3574> <t3575>–I did not just describe them, I proved them.</t3575> <t3576>–This intervention could have accelerated or delayed his decision, but in my opinion, it would not have prevented the marriage in the end if I had not mentioned your sister's indifference, which I did without hesitation.</t3576> <t3577>Until then, he believed he had received sincere reciprocation of feelings, if not to the same extent as his own.</t3577> <t3578>–But Bingley has a tremendous natural humility; he trusts my judgments more than his own.</t3578> <t3579>–It was not difficult to convince him that he was deceiving himself.</t3579> <t3580>After giving him this belief, persuading him not to return to Hertfordshire was a moment's work.</t3580> <t3581>–I cannot blame myself for what I did.</t3581> <t3582>There is one aspect of my behavior in the whole matter that I do not like to remember; that is, I stooped so low as to scheme to keep from him the fact that your sister was in town.</t3582> <t3583>I knew, Miss Bingley knew, but her brother still does not know.</t3583> <t3584>–It is possible that they could have met without bad consequences; –but it seemed to me that his feelings had not yet faded enough for him to see her safely.</t3584> <t3585>–Perhaps these secretive, devious actions did not suit me.</t3585> <t3586>–But I did it once, and I did it with good intentions.</t3586> <t3587>–I have nothing more to say on this matter, no other excuse to offer.</t3587> <t3588>If I hurt your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly; the reasons that guided me may naturally seem insufficient to you, but I have not yet learned to reject them.</t3588> <t3589>–As for the more serious accusation, the accusation that I harmed Mr. Wickham, I can refute it by revealing his entire connection with my family.</t3589> <t3590>I do not know exactly what he accuses me of; but I can present more than one witness whose reliability is beyond doubt regarding the truth of what I will tell.</t3590> <t3591>Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man who managed all the Pemberley estates; his father's good conduct in his duties naturally inspired my father with a desire to be beneficial to him, and he showed his affection for his godson George Wickham with all his generosity.</t3591> <t3592>My father supported him at school, and later at Cambridge –significantly, because his own father, condemned to poverty by his wife's extravagance, was not in a position to provide him with a gentleman's education.</t3592> <t3593>My father not only valued the friendship of this young man, who always had pleasant manners, but also held high hopes for him and decided to provide him with a means of livelihood by hoping he would choose the church as his profession.</t3593> <t3594>For my part, I began to think differently about him years, long years ago.</t3594> <t3595>He was careful to hide his immoral tendencies and indecency from his closest friend, but these did not escape the notice of a young man almost the same age as him, who had the opportunity to catch him in unguarded moments, unlike Mr. Darcy.</t3595> <t3596>Here I will upset you again –only you can know how much.</t3596> <t3597>But whatever feelings Mr. Wickham has aroused, my doubts about their nature will not prevent me from revealing his true face.</t3597> <t3598>There is another reason.</t3598> <t3599>My kind-hearted father died five years ago; his attachment to Mr. Wickham continued until the end; so much so that in his will, he specifically instructed me to assist him in advancing in his profession as much as possible, and if he qualified for the clergy, to give him a valuable family living as soon as it became vacant.</t3599> <t3600>There was also a sum of one thousand pounds.</t3600> <t3601>His father did not outlive mine by much; six months after these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to me saying he had decided to give up his religious education, and hoped I would not find it inappropriate to expect some financial assistance instead of a church appointment that would be of no use to him.</t3601> <t3602>He also added that he intended to study law; he assumed I would understand that the interest on a thousand pounds would not be enough to support him there.</t3602> <t3603>Although I did not believe he was sincere, I wished he were; but in any case, I was ready to accept his proposal.</t3603> <t3604>I knew Mr. Wickham should not be a clergyman.</t3604> <t3605>The matter was quickly settled.</t3605> <t3606>He renounced all financial rights he could have received from the church and accepted three thousand pounds in return.</t3606> <t3607>Thus, all relations between us seemed to be over.</t3607> <t3608>My thoughts about him were so negative that I neither invited him to Pemberley nor allowed him to appear to me in town.</t3608> <t3609>I believe he mostly lived in town, but the study of law was merely a lie; once free of all obstacles, his life became one of complete idleness and vagabondage.</t3609> <t3610>For three years, I heard little from him; but upon the death of the clergyman intended for him, he again approached me for the letter of appointment.</t3610> <t3611>He wanted me to believe he was in very bad condition, which I found easy to believe.</t3611> <t3612>He had seen that law was a non-lucrative profession and had now definitely decided to take the clergy, provided I gave him the said living –he had no doubt about it, and besides, who else did I have to look after, and I could not have forgotten my dear father's intention.</t3612> <t3613>You cannot blame me for refusing this attempt or resisting its repetition.</t3613> <t3614>His resentment was proportional to the harshness of his circumstances –his complaints to others were as intense as the insults he directed at me.</t3614> <t3615>After this period, all signs of acquaintance were abandoned.</t3615> <t3616>I do not know how he lived.</t3616> <t3617>But last summer, he entered my life again in a very painful way.</t3617> <t3618>I must now speak of an event I wish I could forget and which no force other than the current matter would compel me to reveal to anyone.</t3618> <t3619>I am telling you this because I have no doubt you know how to keep a secret.</t3619> <t3620>My sister, who is at least ten years younger than me, was left under the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.</t3620> <t3621>About a year ago, she was taken from school and a house was opened for her in London; last summer, she went to Ramsgate with the lady managing the house; Mr. Wickham also went there, undoubtedly with intent; for it turned out he had a prior acquaintance with Mrs. Younge, which we had been quite mistaken about her character; with her arrangement and assistance, he managed to ingratiate himself with Georgiana; my sister, whose sensitive heart had been filled with affectionate memories of him since childhood, was convinced she was in love with him and agreed to elope with him.</t3621> <t3622>She was only fifteen at the time; this must be her excuse; after expressing her imprudence, I am also pleased to add that I learned of the matter from her.</t3622> <t3623>A few days before the planned elopement, I unexpectedly joined them; at that time, Georgiana could no longer bear the idea of subjecting a brother she saw as a father to such distress and insult, and she told me everything as it was.</t3623> <t3624>You can imagine what I felt and how I acted.</t3624> <t3625>My concern for my sister's reputation and feelings prevented the matter from becoming public; but my writing to Mr. Wickham and his immediate departure were simultaneous; Mrs. Younge was, of course, dismissed from her position.</t3625> <t3626>Mr. Wickham's main goal was undoubtedly my sister's thirty thousand-pound fortune; on the other hand, I cannot help but think that the hope of taking revenge on me was also a strong motivating factor.</t3626> <t3627>This, madam, is an honest explanation of every event between us; if you do not reject it as a lie, I hope you will retract the accusation that I have been cruel to Mr. Wickham.</t3627> <t3628>I do not know what style or lies he used to influence you; but perhaps his success should not be surprising, as you had no prior knowledge of these matters.</t3628> <t3629>You could not have learned these things yourself; doubting them was naturally not in your nature.</t3629> <t3630>You may wonder why all this was not told to you last night.</t3630> <t3631>But at that time, I was not in a state to decide how much could be explained.</t3631> <t3632>Regarding the truth of everything told here, I can particularly recommend the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam; due to our close relationship and constant confidences, and as one of the executors of my father's will, he has inevitably been involved in every detail of these transactions.</t3632> <t3633>If your contempt for me makes my explanations worthless, there is no reason to prevent you from consulting my cousin; I will try to find an opportunity to give you this letter this morning so that you can consult him.</t3633> <t3634>All I can wish is, may God protect you.</t3634>
<t3635>FITZWILLIAM DARCY"</t3635>
<t3636>Chapter XIII</t3636>
<t3637>When Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, although Elizabeth did not expect it to reiterate his marriage proposal, she had no idea what it might be about.</t3637> <t3638>But given what it explained, it is easy to imagine how eagerly she read the letter and the complex emotions she experienced.</t3638> <t3639>What she felt while reading is indescribable.</t3639> <t3640>First, she saw with astonishment that Mr. Darcy believed he could somehow manage to apologize; whereas Elizabeth firmly believed that there was no explanation Mr. Darcy could give without blushing from shame.</t3640> <t3641>With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began reading his words about what happened at Netherfield.</t3641> <t3642>She read with an excitement that did not leave her mind at ease, and due to her impatience to learn what the next sentence might bring, she could not manage to pay attention to the meaning of the sentence before her.</t3642> <t3643>She immediately dismissed Mr. Darcy's belief in her sister's indifference as wrong; the most real, the worst objections against the marriage angered her so much that she could not remain impartial.</t3643> <t3644>She found it understandable that he said he did not regret what he had done; there was no remorse in his tone, there was arrogance.</t3644> <t3645>From beginning to end, it was proud and disrespectful.</t3645>
<t3646>But when the explanation regarding Mr. Wickham followed this subject, if it were true, it should have shattered every good thought she had about Mr. Wickham, and as she read the explanation of events that bore a very disturbing similarity to the story he had told with a bit more clear attention, she felt an even more intense and indescribable pain.</t3646> <t3647>She was left in astonishment, anxiety, even horror.</t3647> <t3648>She wanted to oppose it all, repeatedly cried out, "Lies!</t3648> <t3649>It cannot be true!</t3649> <t3650>The utmost of lies!" – when she finished reading the letter, although she understood very little from the last one or two pages, she hastily folded and put it away, saying she would not believe what was written and would not look at it again.</t3650>
<t3651>In this shaken state of mind, he continued to walk with scattered thoughts; but it didn't work; half a minute later, the letter was opened again; he tried to collect himself as best as he could and began to read all those things about Wickham again in shame, forcing himself to examine the meaning of each sentence.</t3651> <t3652>The connection with the Pemberley family was exactly as he had described; although he did not know the extent of it until then, the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy matched his own words exactly.</t3652> <t3653>Up to that point, both statements corroborated each other: but when it came to the will, the difference was significant.</t3653> <t3654>What Wickham had said about the church was still fresh in his memory; remembering his words, it was impossible not to feel that there was a heavy lie on one side or the other; for a few minutes, he complimented himself by saying that his instincts would not mislead him.</t3654> <t3655>But upon closer reading, upon re-reading, the details behind Wickham's relinquishment of all claims to the church and instead receiving a substantial sum of three thousand pounds made him hesitate again.</t3655> <t3656>He put the letter aside, trying to weigh every possibility in his mind impartially – he pondered and considered the likelihood of every word, but he was unsuccessful.</t3656> <t3657>Both statements were merely claims.</t3657> <t3658>He read it again.</t3658> <t3659>But each line more clearly revealed that although he did not believe the matter had been falsified to make Mr. Darcy's behavior appear vile, it was also open to an interpretation that would show him completely innocent from the beginning to the end of the story.</t3659>
<t3660>The accusation of excess and general immorality that he did not hesitate to direct at Mr. Wickham shook him deeply; it shook him even more as he could not find any evidence to disprove the accusation.</t3660><t3661>He had heard nothing about him before he joined the -------shire Regiment; he had joined this regiment on the recommendation of a young man he had met by chance in the city and quickly renewed his friendship with.</t3661><t3662>Nothing was known about his previous lifestyle except for what he had told in Hertfordshire.</t3662><t3663>If he had learned something about his true character, he would not have felt the desire to investigate.</t3663><t3664>Thanks to his face, voice, and demeanor, he had immediately established himself as a very virtuous person.</t3664><t3665>Elizabeth tried to remember an example of goodness, a sign of evident honesty or humanity that could save him from Mr. Darcy's attacks or at least help classify the faults Mr. Darcy described as long-standing idleness and wickedness as mere ordinary mistakes through his inherent morality, but she could not recall anything more tangible than the general positive opinion in the village and the reputation his sociability had earned him among his fellow soldiers.</t3665><t3666>After dwelling on this point for a while, she continued reading once again.</t3666><t3667>But alas!</t3667><t3668>The next story described his plans regarding Miss Darcy and was somewhat confirmed by the conversations she had had with Colonel Fitzwilliam earlier that morning; in the end, every detail was referred to Colonel Fitzwilliam for verification, from whom she had already learned about his close interest in all his cousin's affairs and had no reason to question his character.</t3668><t3669>At one point, she almost decided to consult him but realized it would seem odd and gave up; in the end, she dismissed the idea entirely, thinking that Mr. Darcy would not risk making such an offer unless he was quite sure of his cousin's cooperation.</t3669>
<t3670>Mr. Philips remembered everything that was said during his conversations with Wickham very well.</t3670> <t3671>Most of his words remained fresh in his memory.</t3671> <t3672>Now, he was disturbed by the impropriety of making such revelations to a stranger and was amazed that he had overlooked this until now.</t3672> <t3673>He saw the indiscretion in revealing oneself in such a manner and that his words did not align with his actions.</t3673> <t3674>He recalled Wickham boasting that he was not afraid of seeing Mr. Darcy – that Mr. Darcy could leave the village if he wanted, but he would not budge from his place, yet he avoided the ball at Netherfield the following week.</t3674> <t3675>He remembered that Wickham did not tell his story to anyone else until the family at Netherfield left the village, but after they were gone, the story was talked about everywhere, and despite saying that his respect for his father would not allow him to disgrace his son in public, he ceaselessly criticized Mr. Darcy.</t3675>
<t3676>How different everything related to Wickham seemed now!</t3676> <t3677>His interest in Miss King was now only the result of his low and selfish inclinations; the modesty of the girl's fortune no longer proved the ordinariness of Wickham's desires, but his desire to cling to whatever he could find.</t3677> <t3678>There was now no understandable reason for his behavior towards Elizabeth; either he was mistaken about her wealth, or he was feeding his own vanity by encouraging the intimacy he believed Elizabeth had shown so imprudently.</t3678> <t3679>As her last efforts to defend him weakened and further justified Mr. Darcy, she couldn't help but agree with Mr. Bingley's assertion of his innocence in response to Jane's question long ago; although his behavior was so proud and repulsive, throughout their acquaintance, which had recently brought them together frequently and made her familiar with his manner, she had never seen anything that revealed him to be unprincipled or unjust – nothing that suggested he had impious or immoral habits.</t3679> <t3680>He was respected and complimented among their acquaintances – even Wickham had admitted he was valuable as a brother, and Elizabeth had often witnessed him speaking of his sister with great affection, so much so that she thought he was capable of feeling closeness in his own way.</t3680> <t3681>If his actions were as Wickham described, such a grave disregard for everything right would be hard to hide from the world; a friendship between a person capable of this and a man as extremely kind-hearted as Mr. Bingley would be inconceivable.</t3681>
<t3682>In the end, she was terribly ashamed of herself.</t3682> <t3683>–She couldn't think of Darcy or Wickham without feeling blind, biased, prejudiced, and ridiculous.</t3683>
<t3684>"I acted disgracefully!" he shouted.</t3684> <t3685>–"I, who used to take pride in my intuition!</t3685> <t3686>–I, who used to admire my talents! I would belittle my sister's boundless goodwill, and in a shameful and meaningless skepticism, I would constantly admire myself.</t3686> <t3687>–How humiliating it is to realize this!</t3687> <t3688>–How utterly humiliating!</t3688> <t3689>–If I had been in love, I couldn't have been in a more wretched blindness than this.</t3689> <t3690>But my foolish mistake was not love, it was pride.</t3690> <t3691>As soon as we met, I liked being someone's choice, and I was offended by being neglected by the other; I acted prejudiced and ignorantly about both, setting reason aside.</t3691> <t3692>It turns out I didn't know myself until this moment.</t3692><t3693>"</t3693>
<t3694>From herself to Jane – from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts progressed in a line and soon brought to mind that Mr. Darcy's explanation there seemed quite inadequate; she read the letter once more.</t3694> <t3695>The effect of the second reading was very different.</t3695> <t3696>–How could she accept part of his explanations as true while rejecting the other part?</t3696> <t3697>–He had said that he never considered the possibility that her sister was interested; –Elizabeth couldn't help but recall Charlotte's opinion.</t3697> <t3698>–She couldn't deny that his observations about Jane were also correct.</t3698> <t3699>– Elizabeth felt that Jane's feelings, even if passionate, were seldom displayed, that there was a constant contentment in her demeanor and manner rarely accompanied by great sensitivity.</t3699>
<t3700>When the letter reached his family with such a humiliating but justified reproach, he felt intense shame.</t3700> <t3701>The justification of the accusation shook him so severely that he could not object; the events at the Netherfield ball, which Darcy particularly mentioned and which confirmed all his initial suspicions, could not have been more strongly imprinted in his mind than they were in Elizabeth's.</t3701>
<t3702>The compliments directed at her and her sister were not ignored.</t3702> <t3703>The compliments soothed the pain of the disgrace caused by her other family members, but they couldn't erase it; –while thinking that Jane's disappointment was actually the work of her closest relatives and how such vulgarity must have greatly damaged the dignity of both, she felt a distress heavier than anything she had ever experienced before.</t3703>
<t3704>After walking on the path for two hours, getting caught up in all sorts of thoughts, reconsidering events, determining possibilities, and reconciling as best as he could with such a sudden and significant change, the fatigue and his long absence made him head home; he entered the house with the desire to appear cheerful as usual and with the decision to suppress thoughts that might cause him to become silent in the presence of others.</t3704>
<t3705>As soon as she entered, they told her that while she was out, two gentlemen from Rosings had called separately; Mr. Darcy had stopped by for just a few minutes to say goodbye, but Colonel Fitzwilliam had sat with them for at least an hour in the hope of Elizabeth's return, and had even attempted to walk after her to find her.</t3705> <t3706>Elizabeth pretended to be sorry she had missed him, but inwardly she was glad.</t3706> <t3707>Colonel Fitzwilliam no longer interested her.</t3707> <t3708>Now she could think of nothing but the letter in her hand.</t3708>
<t3709>Chapter XIV</t3709>
<t3710>The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; Mr. Collins, who was waiting near the outbuildings to bid them farewell, came back to the house with this pleasant news: both of them appeared to be in very good health, and despite the sad scene that had just occurred at Rosings, they were in quite good spirits.</t3710> <t3711>Then he hurried to Rosings to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; upon his return, he brought a message from Lady Catherine with great satisfaction; she felt so sorrowful that she wanted to see them all at dinner with her.</t3711>
<t3712>Elizabeth could not look at Lady Catherine without thinking that she might have already been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without smiling, of how her ladyship's anger would be.</t3712> <t3713>"What would she say?</t3713> <t3714>–how would she behave?" she amused herself with these questions.</t3714>
<t3715>The first topic was the reduced group at Rosings.</t3715> <t3716>–"Believe me, I feel it immensely," said Lady Catherine; "I'm sure no one feels the loss of their friends as much as I do.</t3716> <t3717>But I am particularly fond of these young men; I know they are equally fond of me!</t3717> <t3718>–How sorry they were to leave!</t3718> <t3719>They always are.</t3719> <t3720>Dear Colonel kept his spirits up until the last moment; but Darcy seemed very upset, even more than last year, it seemed.</t3720> <t3721>His attachment to Rosings is clearly growing.</t3721><t3722>"</t3722>
<t3723>Mr. Collins made a compliment here and also hinted at something, receiving a polite smile from both the mother and the daughter.</t3723>
<t3724>Lady Catherine said that Miss Bennet looked unwell after dinner, and then immediately stated the reason; because she did not want to return home so quickly; and continued,</t3724>
<t3725>"But if that's the case, write to your mother and ask for permission to stay a bit longer.</t3725> <t3726>Mrs. Collins would be very happy for you to stay, I think.</t3726><t3727>"</t3727>
<t3728>"I am grateful to Her Ladyship for the kind invitation," replied Elizabeth, "but it is not possible for me to accept it.</t3728> <t3729>–I must be in the city next Saturday.</t3729><t3730>"</t3730>
<t3731>"But if that's the case, you will have only stayed here for six weeks.</t3731> <t3732>I was expecting you to stay for two months.</t3732> <t3733>That's what I told Mrs. Collins before you arrived.</t3733> <t3734>There can be no reason for you to leave so soon.</t3734> <t3735>Mrs. Bennet can certainly give you another fifteen days.</t3735><t3736>"</t3736>
<t3737>"But my father can't give it.</t3737> <t3738>– Last week, he wrote and told me to return quickly.</t3738><t3739>"</t3739>
<t3740>"Oh, come on!</t3740> <t3741>If your mother allows it, your father will definitely allow it too.</t3741> <t3742>–Girls are not that important to fathers.</t3742> <t3743>If you stay for another month, I'll take one of you to London; I'm going at the beginning of June; since Dawson didn't object to the big car, there will be plenty of room for one of you –and if the weather is cool, I wouldn't say no to taking both of you, after all, neither of you are fat.</t3743><t3744>"</t3744>
<t3745>"You are very kind, Madam; but it would be best to stick to our plan.</t3745><t3746>"</t3746>
<t3747>Lady Catherine seemed to be giving up.</t3747>
<t3748>"Mrs. Collins, you must give them a servant.</t3748> <t3749>You know, I always say what's on my mind; I can't bear the thought of two young ladies traveling alone in a hired carriage.</t3749> <t3750>It's very improper.</t3750> <t3751>Find someone, send them.</t3751> <t3752>This is the kind of thing I detest the most in the world.</t3752> <t3753>–Young ladies should always have a companion, a protector, according to their status.</t3753> <t3754>When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I insisted on having two footmen with her.</t3754> <t3755>–Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy of Pemberley and Lady Anne, could not appear otherwise, it would be unbecoming.</t3755> <t3756>–I pay extreme attention to such matters.</t3756> <t3757>You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins.</t3757> <t3758>I'm glad it occurred to me to say it; if you had sent them alone, you would have done something truly unforgivable.</t3758><t3759>"</t3759>
<t3760>"My uncle will send a servant for us."</t3760><t3761>"</t3761>
<t3762>"Ha, your uncle! –He has a child, does he?</t3762> <t3763>–I'm glad you have a relative who thinks about these kinds of things.</t3763> <t3764>Where will you change the horses?</t3764> <t3765>–Ah, Bromley of course.</t3765> <t3766>–If you give my name at the Bell Inn, they will serve you well.</t3766><t3767>"</t3767>
<t3768>Lady Catherine had many more questions to ask about her travels, and it was necessary to pay attention because she did not answer all the questions herself, which pleased Elizabeth, otherwise, she might forget where she was while her mind was so occupied.</t3768> <t3769>Reflection should be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave herself up to thought with great relief; not a single day passed without her taking a solitary walk and indulging in all the pleasure of her troubling memories.</t3769>
<t3770>At this rate, she would memorize Mr. Darcy's letter.</t3770> <t3771>She examined every sentence; her feelings towards the author of the letter frequently changed.</t3771> <t3772>When she remembered the writing style, she was still filled with anger; but when she thought about how unjustly she had accused and condemned him, her anger turned towards herself; she began to pity Mr. Darcy for his unrequited feelings.</t3772> <t3773>The man's interest evoked gratitude, his character respect; yet Elizabeth still could not accept him, she did not even regret rejecting him for a moment; she did not even feel like seeing him again.</t3773> <t3774>Within her past behaviors, there was a constant source of distress and regret, and in the sad mistakes of her family, an even heavier subject of unhappiness.</t3774> <t3775>Their situation was hopeless.</t3775> <t3776>Their father, who consoled himself by laughing at them, did not make any effort to restrain the wild recklessness of his younger daughters; their mother, with actions far from propriety, was unaware of the vulgarity at hand.</t3776> <t3777>Elizabeth often joined hands with Jane, trying to control the instability of Catherine and Lydia; but how could they possibly improve as long as they were supported by their mother's obsession?</t3777> <t3778>Weak-willed, uneasy, and having taken Lydia as her complete role model, Catherine was offended by their advice; ambitious and indifferent Lydia did not even hear them.</t3778> <t3779>They were ignorant, idle, and headstrong.</t3779> <t3780>As long as there were officers in Meryton, they would flirt with them; as long as Meryton was within walking distance of Longbourn, they would go there forever.</t3780>
<t3781>Another source of her unhappiness was the worry she felt for Jane; Mr. Darcy's explanation had revived all her former positive opinions about Bingley, making her feel the magnitude of Jane's loss even more.</t3781> <t3782>Bingley's love had proven to be genuine, his behavior free from blame, unless one finds fault in his unquestioning trust in his friend.</t3782> <t3783>How painful it was that Jane, in every way so perfect, so satisfying, so promising of happiness, had lost such a match due to her own family's foolishness and lack of manners!</t3783>
<t3784>When the emergence of Wickham's character was added to these thoughts, it can easily be believed that it made it impossible for her to appear even somewhat cheerful, whereas she had previously rarely been in a dark mood.</t3784>
<t3785>During the last week of her visit, the invitations at Rosings were as frequent as they were in the first week.</t3785> <t3786>The last evening was also spent there; Her Ladyship once again inquired in detail about their travels, gave instructions on the best methods for packing, and insisted so much on the only correct way to arrange clothes that Maria felt compelled to undo all her work from the morning and repack her trunk from scratch when they returned home.</t3786>
<t3787>When they parted, Lady Catherine deigned to wish them a good journey and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; Miss de Bourgh also made an effort to curtsy and extended her hand to both of them.</t3787>
<t3788>Chapter XV</t3788>
<t3789>On Saturday morning, Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met at breakfast a few minutes before the others arrived; Mr. Collins seized the opportunity to say the polite words he deemed absolutely necessary for a farewell.</t3789>
<t3790>"I don't know, Miss Elizabeth," he said, "perhaps Mrs. Collins has not yet expressed her own feelings about the kindness you have shown by coming to us, but I am quite sure that you will not leave this house without receiving her thanks.</t3790> <t3791>Rest assured, the happiness your presence has brought is deeply felt.</t3791> <t3792>We know that there is very little in our humble abode to make it appealing to people.</t3792> <t3793>Our simple life, small rooms, few servants, and limited means must make Hunsford extremely dull for a young lady like yourself; but we hope you will believe that we are grateful for your condescension in coming, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you from being bored during your stay here.</t3793><t3794>"</t3794>
<t3795>Elizabeth thanked eagerly, wanting them to be sure that she was happy.</t3795> <t3796>She had spent six weeks with great pleasure; the joy of being with Charlotte, and the close attention shown to her, made her the one who should be truly grateful.</t3796> <t3797>Mr. Collins was very pleased and replied with a more smiling solemnity,</t3797>
<t3798>"I am very glad to hear that you did not spend your time badly.</t3798> <t3799>Of course, we did our best; fortunately, we were also able to introduce you to very high-ranking individuals; I think we can take some pride in our connection with Rosings, which often brings liveliness to our humble home atmosphere, if your visit to Hunsford was not entirely dull.</t3799> <t3800>Our situation with Lady Catherine's family is indeed a very exceptional privilege, an honor that very few people can attain.</t3800> <t3801>You see what friends we have.</t3801> <t3802>You see how we are constantly invited.</t3802> <t3803>In fact, I must confess that despite all the flaws of this modest parsonage, no one living in it would be pitiable as long as they share our closeness with Rosings.</t3803><t3804>"</t3804>
<t3805>Words failed in the face of the intensity of his emotions; he had to pace around the room; meanwhile, Elizabeth was trying to politely condense the truth into a few short sentences.</t3805>
<t3806>"Of course, you can take a very favorable report about us back to Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.</t3806> <t3807>At least being able to do that would make me proud.</t3807> <t3808>You have witnessed day by day the great kindness Lady Catherine has shown to Mrs. Collins; finally, I hope your friend is not so unfortunate a – but anyway, it is best to remain silent on this matter.</t3808> <t3809>Just believe, dear Miss Elizabeth, that I sincerely and wholeheartedly wish you such a happy marriage.</t3809> <t3810>My dear Charlotte and I have become of one mind and one soul.</t3810> <t3811>There is a magnificent similarity of feeling and thought between us in everything.</t3811> <t3812>It is as if we were made for each other.</t3812><t3813>"</t3813>
<t3814>Elizabeth could easily say that this situation was a great happiness; with the same sincerity, she managed to add that she wholeheartedly believed in and rejoiced in her familial peace.</t3814> <t3815>However, she was not at all sorry that their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of the lady they were talking about.</t3815> <t3816>Poor Charlotte! –how sad it was to leave her to such a life!</t3816> <t3817>–But she had chosen this herself, knowingly; she was obviously sorry to see her guests leave, but she did not have an air of expecting pity.</t3817> <t3818>Her house and household chores, her church and chickens, and all the concerns related to these had not yet lost their charm.</t3818>
<t3819>Finally, the car arrived, the crates were tied, the packages were placed inside, and it was announced that it was ready to move.</t3819> <t3820>After an emotional farewell among friends, Mr. Collins escorted Elizabeth to the car; as they walked down the garden, Mr. Collins was asking her to convey his deepest respects to her family, his thanks for the hospitality he received at Longbourn during the winter, and his regards to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, even though he did not know them.</t3820> <t3821>Then he took her hand and helped her get in, Maria followed her, and just as the door was about to close, he suddenly remembered with a certain concern that they had forgotten to leave a message for the ladies at Rosings.</t3821>
<t3822>"But," he added, "of course you would like your deepest respects and your heartfelt thanks for the kindness they have shown during your stay here to be conveyed to them.</t3822><t3823>"</t3823>
<t3824>Elizabeth did not object; –then the door was allowed to close and the carriage set off.</t3824>
<t3825>"Oh my God!" cried Maria after a few minutes of silence, "it feels like we just arrived a day or two ago!</t3825> <t3826>–but so much has happened!</t3826><t3827>"</t3827>
<t3828>"A lot has really happened," said his travel companion with a sigh.</t3828>
<t3829>"We had dinner at Rosings nine times, and we also had tea three times!</t3829> <t3830>–I have so much to tell!</t3830><t3831>"</t3831>
<t3832>"I also have so many things to hide," said Elizabeth to herself.</t3832>
<t3833>They didn't talk much along the way; there were no mishaps either; four hours after leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner's house; they would stay there for a few days.</t3833>
<t3834>Jane looked well; Elizabeth did not find time to examine her among the various entertainments her aunt had prepared for them.</t3834> <t3835>But Jane would also be returning home with her, and there would be plenty of free time to observe at Longbourn.</t3835>
<t3836>Meanwhile, even waiting for Longbourn to tell her sister about Mr. Darcy's proposal required a considerable effort.</t3836> <t3837>Knowing that she had the power to reveal something that would astonish Jane to such a degree and at the same time flatter the pride she had not yet managed to rid herself of, tempted her so much that she could only resist this temptation thanks to her indecision about how much to reveal and the fear that if she started to tell, she might inadvertently repeat something about Bingley that could cause her sister even more pain.</t3837>
<t3838>Chapter XVI</t3838>
<t3839>In the second week of May, three young ladies set out from Gracechurch Street towards the town of ------- in Hertfordshire; as they approached the inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, thanks to the punctuality of the coachman, they caught sight of Kitty and Lydia looking out from one of the upper-floor dining rooms.</t3839> <t3840>These two girls had been there for over an hour, had paid a pleasant visit to a draper across the street, watched the soldiers on guard, and made a curly lettuce and cucumber salad.</t3840>
<t3841>After welcoming their sisters, they proudly showed the table prepared with cold meat that a pantry could offer; "isn't it nice? isn't it a lovely surprise?" they exclaimed.</t3841>
<t3842>"We are thinking of treating you all to a feast," Lydia added; "but you must lend us some money, because we spent all our money in this shop."</t3842> <t3843>Then she showed what she had bought: "Look, I bought this bonnet.</t3843> <t3844>It's not very nice, but I bought it just for the sake of it.</t3844> <t3845>When I get home, I'll take it apart to see if I can make something out of it.</t3845><t3846>"</t3846>
<t3847>When her sisters called it ugly, she nonchalantly added, "There were only two or three hats in the shop uglier than this one; if I take a more nicely colored satin and decorate it again, it will be quite good.</t3847> <t3848>Anyway, what people wear this summer is not that important, the --------shire regiment has left Meryton, they are leaving within fifteen days.</t3848><t3849>"</t3849>
<t3850>"Really?" cried Elizabeth, with great satisfaction.</t3850>
<t3851>"They are going to camp near Brighton; I want my father to take all of us there so much this summer!</t3851> <t3852>What a fun plan it would be; and it’s not even a major expense.</t3852> <t3853>My mother would want to go the most!</t3853> <t3854>Otherwise, just imagine what a boring summer we will have!</t3854><t3855>"</t3855>
<t3856>"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "this would indeed be an amusing plan, we would all be ruined at once.</t3856> <t3857>Oh my God! Brighton, a whole camp full of soldiers and us, already a scattered poor militia regiment because of Meryton's monthly balls.</t3857><t3858>"</t3858>
<t3859>"Now I have news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down at the table.</t3859> <t3860>"Guess what!</t3860> <t3861>Wonderful news, extraordinary news, and it's about someone we all love.</t3861><t3862>"</t3862>
<t3863>Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other; they told the waiter he didn't need to stay.</t3863> <t3864>Lydia laughed and said,</t3864>
<t3865>"Ah, your formality and tight-lipped nature, don't you see.</t3865> <t3866>You didn't want the waiter to hear, as if he cared!</t3866> <t3867>He probably hears worse things than what I'm about to tell you.</t3867> <t3868>But what an ugly fellow!</t3868> <t3869>Good thing he left.</t3869> <t3870>I've never seen such a long chin in my life.</t3870> <t3871>Anyway, let's get to my news: about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, isn't it?</t3871> <t3872>There's no danger of Wickham marrying Mary King.</t3872> <t3873>How's that for news! The girl has gone to her uncle in Liverpool; she's gone to stay.</t3873> <t3874>Wickham is safe now.</t3874><t3875>"</t3875>
<t3876>"Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "she has escaped a financially imprudent marriage."</t3876><t3877>"</t3877>
<t3878>"Leaving was a big mistake if he loved her."</t3878><t3879>"</t3879>
<t3880>"But I guess there isn't a strong commitment on either side," said Jane.</t3880>
<t3881>"I'm sure he's not in Wickham.</t3881> <t3882>I don't think he cared about the girl at all.</t3882> <t3883>Who would care about such a pesky, freckled, insignificant girl?</t3883><t3884>"</t3884>
<t3885>Elizabeth was stunned, and although she could not bring herself to use such coarse expressions, she thought about how she had once harbored such coarse feelings in her own heart and had found them reasonable!</t3885>
<t3886>After everyone finished their meal and the sisters paid the bill, the car was summoned; after a bit of effort, they all settled into the car along with all the boxes, craft bags, and packages, and the annoying addition of Kitty and Lydia's shopping.</t3886>
<t3887>"How nicely we fit!" cried Lydia.</t3887><t3888>"I'm so glad I brought my bonnet, it's worth it just for the box!</t3888><t3889>Now let's make ourselves comfortable, talk and laugh all the way home.</t3889><t3890>Tell me what happened since you left.</t3890><t3891>Did you see any handsome men?</t3891><t3892>Did you have any flirtations?</t3892><t3893>I was saying that at least one of you wouldn't return without finding a husband.</t3893><t3894>Jane will soon be left on the shelf.</t3894><t3895>She's almost twenty-three!</t3895><t3896>God, how embarrassed I would be if I weren't married before twenty-three!</t3896><t3897>You can't imagine how much Aunt Philips wants us to find husbands.</t3897><t3898>She says Lizzy should have accepted Mr. Collins; but I think that wouldn't have been fun.</t3898><t3899>God! How I wish to get married before you; then I would play matchmaker for you at all the balls.</t3899><t3900>Honestly, we had such fun at Colonel Forster's the other day!</t3900><t3901>Kitty and I were going to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised a little dance in the evening; (by the way, we became close friends with Mrs. Forster!) then she invited the Harringtons, but Harriet was sick, so Pen had to come alone; and guess what we did?</t3901><t3902>We dressed Chamberlayne in women's clothes and passed him off as a maid – imagine how much fun we had!</t3902><t3903>Only Colonel and Mrs. Forster, Kitty and I, and my aunt knew about it; we told my aunt to borrow her dress; you can't imagine how great it was!</t3903><t3904>Denny, Wickham, Pratt, and a few others came, and they didn't recognize him.</t3904><t3905>God! How I laughed!</t3905><t3906>Mrs. Forster laughed so much too.</t3906><t3907>I was dying of laughter.</t3907><t3908>The men got suspicious because of this, and then they figured it out anyway.</t3908><t3909>"</t3909>
<t3910>By recounting the stories of their parties and sweet jokes, Lydia, with Kitty's help and additions, tried to entertain their companions all the way to Longbourn.</t3910> <t3911>Elizabeth listened as little as possible, but she couldn't help noticing Wickham's name being mentioned frequently.</t3911>
<t3912>They were warmly welcomed at home.</t3912> <t3913>Mrs. Bennet was very happy to see that Jane's beauty was still intact; during the meal, Mr. Bennet said to Elizabeth several times, "I'm glad you're back, Lizzy," with affection.</t3913>
<t3914>There was a large crowd in the dining room; almost all the Lucases had come to welcome Maria and hear the news; everyone was occupied with a different matter; Lady Lucas was asking Maria about her eldest daughter's well-being and her chickens from across the table; Mrs. Bennet was engaged in two tasks at once, receiving the latest fashion news from Jane, who was sitting a little further away, and relaying this information to the younger Lucas girls; Lydia, in a voice louder than anyone else's, was recounting her morning's amusements to the room, for anyone who cared to listen.</t3914>
<t3915>"Ah, Mary," he was saying, "I wish you had come with us, we had so much fun!</t3915> <t3916>On the way, Kitty and I opened all the curtains, pretending there was no one else in the car; if Kitty hadn't gotten nauseous, I would have gone the whole way like that; when we arrived at George's inn, I think we acted very chic and offered these three people the best cold dishes in the world, if you had come, we would have offered them to you too.</t3916> <t3917>Our return was just as fun!</t3917> <t3918>I thought we would never get into the car.</t3918> <t3919>I was laughing so hard I almost died.</t3919> <t3920>And such joy on the way back!</t3920> <t3921>What a laugh, they must have heard us from miles away.</t3921><t3922>"</t3922>
<t3923>Mary answered this seriously, "Oh, keep it away from me, sister, such pleasures are not for me."</t3923> <t3924>Most women like such things.</t3924> <t3925>But they are not attractive to me at all.</t3925> <t3926>I prefer to read books.</t3926><t3927>"</t3927>
<t3928>Aunt Lydia did not hear a single word of this answer.</t3928> <t3929>She rarely listened to anyone for more than half a minute, and she didn't even listen to Mary for that long.</t3929>
<t3930>In the afternoon, Lydia insisted on walking to Meryton with the other girls to see what everyone was up to; but Elizabeth stubbornly opposed the plan.</t3930> <t3931>It should not be said that the Miss Bennets were chasing after officers without even spending half a day at home.</t3931> <t3932>There was another reason for her opposition.</t3932> <t3933>The thought of seeing Wickham again was terrifying to her, and she was determined to avoid it as much as possible.</t3933> <t3934>The proximity of the regiment's departure gave her an indescribable comfort.</t3934> <t3935>They would be gone within fifteen days; and once they were gone, she hoped she would no longer be troubled because of Wickham.</t3935>
<t3936>She had not been home for long when she saw that the Brighton plan Lydia had mentioned at the inn was a frequent topic of discussion between her mother and father.</t3936> <t3937>She immediately understood that her father had no intention of going; but his responses were so vague and evasive that, although her mother often lost hope, she had not yet lost her belief that she would eventually succeed.</t3937>
<t3938>Chapter XVII</t3938>
<t3939>Elizabeth could no longer resist the impatience she felt to tell Jane what had happened; finally, deciding to withhold the details concerning her sister and asking her to be prepared for a surprise, she recounted to her the majority of what had transpired between her and Mr. Darcy the next morning.</t3939>
<t3940>Miss Bennet's astonishment did not last long, as she found it quite natural that Elizabeth should be admired, due to her strong sisterly partiality; indeed, soon there was no astonishment left at all.</t3940> <t3941>She was upset that Mr. Darcy had expressed his feelings in a rather ungracious manner; but she was more upset by the unhappiness that her sister's rejection must have caused him.</t3941>
<t3942>"It was a mistake to be so sure it would be accepted," he said, "it shouldn't have looked that way; but just think, how much it must have increased his disappointment.</t3942><t3943>"</t3943>
<t3944>"Of course," replied Elizabeth, "I really feel sorry for him; but he has other feelings that will extinguish his interest in me.</t3944> <t3945>Still, you don't blame me for rejecting him, do you?</t3945><t3946>"</t3946>
<t3947>"Blame you!</t3947> <t3948>No, not at all.</t3948><t3949>"</t3949>
<t3950>"But you blame me for speaking so sympathetically about Wickham.</t3950><t3951>"</t3951>
<t3952>"No – I don't know if I made a mistake by saying them.</t3952><t3953>"</t3953>
<t3954>"But you will know when I tell you what happened the next day."</t3954><t3955>"</t3955>
<t3956>Then she spoke about the letter, repeating all the parts concerning George Wickham.</t3956> <t3957>These were a great blow to poor Jane!</t3957> <t3958>She could have spent her whole life believing that such baseness did not exist in any one person among the entire human race.</t3958> <t3959>Even though Darcy's exoneration pleased her, it could not lessen the pain of such a discovery.</t3959> <t3960>She searched with all her might for the possibility of a mistake and tried to find one innocent without implicating the other.</t3960>
<t3961>"It's no use," said Elizabeth.</t3961> <t3962>"You can't do a good thing with both of them at the same time.</t3962> <t3963>Make your choice, but you must be content with just one.</t3963> <t3964>Even if you take all their virtues, it would only be enough to make one good man; besides, he has been changing sides a lot lately.</t3964> <t3965>For my part, I am inclined to believe Mr. Darcy, but you must make your own choice.</t3965><t3966>"</t3966>
<t3967>It still took some time for Jane to be able to smile.</t3967>
<t3968>"I don't remember being more surprised," she said.</t3968> <t3969>"Wickham being so bad!</t3969> <t3970>It's an incredible thing.</t3970> <t3971>Poor Mr. Darcy! Imagine the agony he must have endured, my dear Lizzy.</t3971> <t3972>Such a disappointment! and knowing your negative opinions as well! To have to tell such a thing about his sister!</t3972> <t3973>It's truly very distressing.</t3973> <t3974>I'm sure you feel the same way.</t3974><t3975>"</t3975>
<t3976>"No, no!</t3976> <t3977>My chances of regret or pity are disappearing, while you have both in abundance.</t3977> <t3978>I know you will treat him quite fairly, so I am becoming more indifferent, more detached by the minute.</t3978> <t3979>Your generosity makes me frugal; if you complain about him a little more, my heart will feel as light as a feather.</t3979><t3980>"</t3980>
<t3981>"Poor Wickham; goodness radiates from his face! His manners are so charming, so kind."</t3981><t3982>"</t3982>
<t3983>"It is clear that a great mistake was made in the education of these two young men.</t3983> <t3984>Goodness is in one of them, and in the appearance of the other.</t3984><t3985>"</t3985>
<t3986>"I never thought there was any goodness in Mr. Darcy's appearance, unlike you.</t3986><t3987>"</t3987>
<t3988>"Still, I thought I was being incredibly smart by feeling an unfounded coldness towards him.</t3988> <t3989>This kind of coldness stimulates one's genius, opens up one's intellect.</t3989> <t3990>A person can continuously harass someone without saying a single justified word; but a person cannot laugh at someone forever without occasionally saying something clever.</t3990><t3991>"</t3991>
<t3992>"Lizzy, I'm sure you couldn't evaluate the matter the same way when you first read that letter as you do now."</t3992><t3993>"</t3993>
<t3994>"Of course not.</t3994> <t3995>I am very disturbed.</t3995> <t3996>I can say I am quite disturbed, even unhappy.</t3996> <t3997>There is no one to talk to about what I feel, no Jane to comfort me and tell me that I am not acting as weak, brainless, and heartless as I think!</t3997> <t3998>Oh! how I have missed you!</t3998><t3999>"</t3999>
<t4000>"It was unfortunate that you used such strong expressions when talking to Mr. Darcy about Wickham; now it turns out he didn't deserve it at all."</t4000><t4001>"</t4001>
<t4002>"Absolutely.</t4002> <t4003>But the misfortune of speaking harsh words is the natural result of the prejudices I have nurtured within me.</t4003> <t4004>There is a point where I need your advice.</t4004> <t4005>You need to tell me whether I should or should not speak about Wickham's character to others.</t4005><t4006>"</t4006>
<t4007>After a moment's hesitation, Miss Bennet replied, "There is no reason to disgrace the poor man in front of everyone."</t4007> <t4008>"What is your opinion?"</t4008><t4009>"</t4009>
<t4010>"I think it is best not to do it.</t4010> <t4011>Mr. Darcy did not allow me to explain what he had told me.</t4011> <t4012>On the contrary, he instructed me to keep every detail about his sister to myself as much as possible; if I try to correct people's misconceptions about his other behaviors, who would believe me?</t4012> <t4013>The prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so strong that to make him appear likable, one would have to kill half the people in Meryton.</t4013> <t4014>I can't manage that much.</t4014> <t4015>Wickham will be leaving soon; therefore, his true nature will not mean anything to anyone.</t4015> <t4016>One day in the future, it will be known, and then we will laugh at their foolishness for not having learned it earlier.</t4016> <t4017>For now, I will not say anything about it.</t4017><t4018>"</t4018>
<t4019>"You are absolutely right.</t4019> <t4020>Revealing his flaws could ruin his life.</t4020> <t4021>Maybe he regrets what he has done and is trying to become a better person again.</t4021> <t4022>Let's not crush his hopes.</t4022><t4023>"</t4023>
<t4024>The storm within Elizabeth calmed with this conversation.</t4024> <t4025>She had rid herself of two of the secrets that had burdened her for fifteen days, and she knew that Jane would be a willing listener if she ever wanted to talk about them again.</t4025> <t4026>But there was still something lurking in the background, something that common sense did not allow to be explained.</t4026> <t4027>She did not dare to tell the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, to explain to her sister how sincerely her friend was valued by him.</t4027> <t4028>This was knowledge that no one could share, and Elizabeth knew that it would not be right to rid herself of this final burden of secrecy without complete mutual understanding between the two parties.</t4028> <t4029>"Then," she thought, "if this impossible situation happens, I will tell what Bingley himself could explain much more pleasantly.</t4029> <t4030>I cannot have the right to tell it until this information loses all its value.</t4030><t4031>"</t4031>
<t4032>Now that she had settled at home, she had time to observe her sister's true state of mind.</t4032> <t4033>Jane was not happy.</t4033> <t4034>She still harbored a deep affection for Bingley.</t4034> <t4035>Since she had never imagined herself in love before, her feelings carried all the warmth of a first attachment, and, due to her age and temperament, with a greater solidity than first attachments usually possess; she valued Bingley's memory so passionately and regarded him as superior to everyone else that, if she did not use all her sensitivity and attention to avoid hurting her friends, it would be easy for her to succumb to these sorrows, compromising her own health and the peace of those around her.</t4035>
<t4036>"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs. Bennet one day, "what do you say now about Jane's sad business?</t4036> <t4037>As for myself, I am determined never to speak of it to anyone again.</t4037> <t4038>I told my sister Philips so the other day.</t4038> <t4039>But how is it that Jane never sees him in London, I do not understand.</t4039> <t4040>Well, he turned out to be a worthless man – surely now there is no chance of her marrying him.</t4040> <t4041>There is no talk of him coming to Netherfield in the summer either; I asked everyone who might know.</t4041><t4042>"</t4042>
<t4043>"I don't think he will live at Netherfield again."</t4043><t4044>"</t4044>
<t4045>"It's up to him."</t4045> <t4046>"Oh, as if anyone wants him to come."</t4046> <t4047>"I always say he treats my daughter badly, but if I were in my daughter's place, I couldn't bear it."</t4047> <t4048>"My only consolation is that Jane will die of a broken heart, and then the man will suffer for what he has done."</t4048><t4049>"</t4049>
<t4050>Elizabeth, unable to find solace in such an expectation, did not respond.</t4050>
<t4051>"Well, Lizzy," her mother continued shortly after, "the Collinses live quite comfortably, don't they?</t4051> <t4052>Well, I hope they live long.</t4052> <t4053>How is their table?</t4053> <t4054>Charlotte understands household management well, I think.</t4054> <t4055>If she is half as frugal as her mother, she will save quite a bit.</t4055> <t4056>I don't think they ever go to excess in their home.</t4056><t4057>"</t4057>
<t4058>"No, not at all."</t4058><t4059>"</t4059>
<t4060>"He is very frugal, very, trust my word.</t4060> <t4061>Truly.</t4061> <t4062>They are careful to spend only as much as they earn.</t4062> <t4063>That's why they never have money troubles.</t4063> <t4064>Well, may God accept it!</t4064> <t4065>Then, I think, they often talk about inheriting Longbourn when your father dies.</t4065> <t4066>They see this place as their own property, I suppose, eventually.</t4066><t4067>"</t4067>
<t4068>"This was a topic they couldn't talk about in front of me.</t4068><t4069>"</t4069>
<t4070>"Indeed.</t4070> <t4071>It would be strange if they talked.</t4071> <t4072>But I have no doubt, they often talk about this among themselves.</t4072> <t4073>Well, if they will feel at ease by settling in a house that doesn't legally belong to them, it's their choice.</t4073> <t4074>If such an inheritance were to come to me, I would be ashamed to claim it.</t4074><t4075>"</t4075>
<t4076>Chapter XVIII</t4076>
<t4077>The first week of their return passed quickly.</t4077> <t4078>The second one began.</t4078> <t4079>It was the last week the regiment would spend in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the vicinity were swooning.</t4079> <t4080>Sorrow had enveloped almost everyone.</t4080> <t4081>Only the elder Miss Bennets were still able to eat, drink, sleep, and continue their daily activities.</t4081> <t4082>They were often scolded by Kitty and Lydia for this insensitivity; those two were in deep mourning and could not accept such heartlessness in the family.</t4082>
<t4083>"For God's sake! What will happen to us!"</t4083> <t4084>"What will we do!" they often lamented in a bitter voice.</t4084> <t4085>"How can you smile like that, Lizzy?"</t4085>
<t4086>Their loving mothers shared in all their pain; she too remembered facing a similar situation, twenty-five years ago.</t4086>
<t4087>"Believe me," she said, "when Colonel Millar's regiment left, I cried for exactly two days.</t4087> <t4088>I thought I was done for.</t4088><t4089>"</t4089>
<t4090>"But I am really exhausted," said Lydia.</t4090>
<t4091>"Oh, if only we could go to Brighton!" said Mrs. Bennet.</t4091>
<t4092>"Ah yes! –If only we could go to Brighton!</t4092> <t4093>But my father is so stubborn.</t4093><t4094>"</t4094>
<t4095>"Going to the sea used to make me feel so good.</t4095><t4096>"</t4096>
<t4097>"Aunt Philips says it will be especially good for me," added Kitty.</t4097>
<t4098>Such pleas echoed incessantly in the Longbourn estate.</t4098> <t4099>Elizabeth tried to distract herself with them; but all sense of pleasure vanished in shame.</t4099> <t4100>She felt the validity of Mr. Darcy's objections once again; never before had she been so inclined to forgive his interference in his friend's opinions.</t4100>
<t4101>But Lydia's sorrow was soon alleviated; she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the regiment's Colonel, to accompany her to Brighton.</t4101> <t4102>This dear friend was a very young woman, newly married.</t4102> <t4103>The similarity in their temperaments and their fondness for amusement had drawn her and Lydia close to each other, and during their three months of acquaintance, Lydia had become like a member of the family.</t4103>
<t4104>The joy Lydia felt in this situation, the love she felt for Mrs. Forster, Mrs. Bennet's satisfaction, and Kitty's sorrow were indescribable.</t4104> <t4105>Lydia, who was completely indifferent to her sister's feelings, ran around the house in a state of ecstasy, wanting everyone to congratulate her, laughed louder than ever, and spoke; meanwhile, the unfortunate Kitty continued to grumble about her fate in the living room with a grumpy voice and equally unreasonable expressions.</t4105>
<t4106>"I may not be a close friend," she said, "but I don't understand why Mrs. Forster doesn't invite me instead of Lydia.</t4106> <t4107>I have as much right to be invited as she does, even more; I am two years older.</t4107><t4108>"</t4108>
<t4109>Elizabeth tried to persuade Jane to be reasonable and give up, but it was in vain.</t4109> <t4110>As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation did not evoke the same feelings in her as it did in her mother and Lydia; she saw the invitation as the death knell for any chance of her sister behaving sensibly; knowing that learning of the trip would put her in a difficult position, Elizabeth couldn't help but secretly speak to her father to prevent her from going.</t4110> <t4111>She explained to her father all the impropriety of Lydia's general behavior, that a woman like Mrs. Forster would be of no benefit to her, and that in a place full of traps like Brighton, she was likely to get even more out of control with such a friend.</t4111> <t4112>After listening to her carefully, her father said,</t4112>
<t4113>"Lydia will not be at ease until she has shown herself to the public in one community or another; and we cannot expect her to do this with so little expense or inconvenience to her family."</t4113><t4114>"</t4114>
<t4115>"If you knew the discomfort Lydia's imprudent and careless appearance to the public would cause us all," said Elizabeth, "or even the discomfort it has already caused; I am sure you would then evaluate the matter differently."</t4115><t4116>"</t4116>
<t4117>"Already created, ha!" repeated Mr. Bennet.</t4117> <t4118>"What, did she scare away her suitors?</t4118> <t4119>Poor Lizzy! Don't worry.</t4119> <t4120>It's not worth feeling sorry for young men who can't stand being related to a few oddballs.</t4120> <t4121>Come on, count the poor souls scared away by Lydia's foolishness.</t4121><t4122>"</t4122>
<t4123>"You are truly mistaken.</t4123> <t4124>I don't have those kinds of wounds that you worry about.</t4124> <t4125>I'm not afraid of any specific thing, but rather of general dangers.</t4125> <t4126>Because of Lydia's character trait of wild variability, her tendency to break all rules and disregard them, our importance and respect in the world will be damaged.</t4126> <t4127>Forgive me – because I must speak openly.</t4127> <t4128>If you, dear father, do not take the trouble to curb her rebellious spirit and teach her that she cannot spend her life chasing such fantasies, she will soon become uncontrollable.</t4128> <t4129>Her character will settle, and at sixteen, she will become a complete disgrace to herself and her family.</t4129> <t4130>And a disgrace of the worst, most vulgar kind; someone who has no charm beyond her youth and physique; due to her ignorance and stupidity, while she struggles to be admired, she will not be able to prevent everyone from despising her.</t4130> <t4131>This danger applies to Kitty as well.</t4131> <t4132>Wherever Lydia goes, she follows.</t4132> <t4133>Foolish, ignorant, idle, and completely uncontrolled!</t4133> <t4134>Oh! Dear father, don't you see that they will be condemned and scorned wherever they are known, and their sisters will also share in this shame?</t4134><t4135>"</t4135>
<t4136>Mr. Bennet understood that Elizabeth was speaking with all her heart; he lovingly took her hand and replied,</t4136>
<t4137>"Don't be upset, my dear.</t4137> <t4138>Wherever you and Jane are known, you will be met with respect and love; having one or two, how should I say, quite foolish sisters does not diminish your worth.</t4138> <t4139>If Lydia does not go to Brighton, we will not see peace at Longbourn.</t4139> <t4140>Therefore, let her go.</t4140> <t4141>Colonel Forster is a reasonable man, he will not allow her to get into serious trouble; fortunately, she is too poor to be preyed upon by anyone.</t4141> <t4142>As an ordinary floozy in Brighton, she will be less significant than she is here.</t4142> <t4143>The officers will find more useful women.</t4143> <t4144>So let us hope that going there teaches her her own insignificance.</t4144> <t4145>After all, she cannot go worse than she is now, otherwise it would mean we have to keep her locked up for the rest of her life.</t4145><t4146>"</t4146>
<t4147>Elizabeth was forced to find solace in this answer; but her own view remained the same, and she left her father's side feeling disappointed and sad.</t4147> <t4148>Nevertheless, she did not have the habit of increasing her troubles by dwelling on them.</t4148> <t4149>She was confident that she had done her duty; it was not in her nature to worry about inevitable disasters or to magnify them with anxiety.</t4149>
<t4150>If her mother and Lydia knew the subject of the conversation she had with her father, they would join forces and say everything they could out of anger.</t4150> <t4151>In Lydia's imagination, the trip to Brighton encompassed every possibility of earthly happiness.</t4151> <t4152>She saw the streets of the cheerful seaside resort, filled with officers, through the creative eye of dreams.</t4152> <t4153>She saw herself as an object of attention for dozens, even scores, of men she had yet to meet.</t4153> <t4154>She envisioned all the splendor of the military camp; rows of tents stretched out beautifully, filled with young and cheerful men in dazzling red; and to complete the scene, she saw herself sitting under a canopy, playfully flirting with at least six officers.</t4154>
<t4155>What would his reaction be if he knew that his sister was trying to separate him from these opportunities and these realities?</t4155> <t4156>Only his mother could understand this, because she might have felt more or less the same things.</t4156> <t4157>Lydia going to Brighton was her mother's only consolation against the sorrow caused by her husband's reluctance to go.</t4157>
<t4158>But they were completely unaware of what had happened; their joy continued uninterrupted until the day Lydia left the house.</t4158>
<t4159>Elizabeth was now going to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.</t4159> <t4160>Since she had been in his company frequently since his return, her excitement had considerably diminished; the excitement caused by their former intimacy had entirely vanished.</t4160> <t4161>She had even learned to detect a tiresome, wearisome falseness and sameness in the politeness that had once pleased her so much.</t4161> <t4162>Moreover, she found a new source of dissatisfaction in Wickham's current behavior towards her because his attempt to restore the intimacy that had characterized the first part of their relationship, after all that had happened in between, only served to irritate Elizabeth.</t4162> <t4163>Seeing herself chosen as the object of such idle and spurious flirtation, she had lost all interest in him; while resolutely resisting Wickham's advances, she could not help but feel the condescension underlying his belief that he would flatter her pride and win her heart by rekindling an interest she had long since and for known reasons ceased to have.</t4163>
<t4164>On the last day of the regiment's stay in Meryton, Wickham dined at Longbourn with other officers; Elizabeth was so reluctant to part on bad terms with him that when Wickham asked how she had spent her time in Hunsford, she mentioned that Colonel Fitzwilliam and Mr. Darcy had spent three weeks at Rosings and asked if he had met the former.</t4164>
<t4165>Wickham appeared surprised, bored, and flustered; but after a moment's thought, his smile returned, and he replied that he had often seen him before; after stating that he was a very gentlemanly man, he asked Elizabeth whether she liked him.</t4165> <t4166>Elizabeth's response was very positive.</t4166> <t4167>Wickham added shortly after, in an indifferent manner, "How long did you say he stayed at Rosings?</t4167><t4168>"</t4168>
<t4169>"About three weeks.</t4169><t4170>"</t4170>
<t4171>"Did you see him often?</t4171><t4172>"</t4172>
<t4173>"Yes, almost every day."</t4173><t4174>"</t4174>
<t4175>"His/her behavior is different from his/her cousin's.</t4175><t4176>"</t4176>
<t4177>"Yes, very much.</t4177> <t4178>But I think Mr. Darcy becomes more likable as you get to know him.</t4178><t4179>"</t4179>
<t4180>"What do you say!" cried Wickham, with a look that did not escape Elizabeth's notice.</t4180> <t4181>"Well, may I ask?" but collecting himself, he added in a more cheerful voice, "Did you like the way of speaking?</t4181> <t4182>Does he condescend to add other things to his usual manner? because," he continued in a lower and more serious voice, "I don't think you would like him at heart.</t4182><t4183>"</t4183>
<t4184>"No, no!" said Elizabeth.</t4184> <t4185>"I think he is what he is at his core."</t4185><t4186>"</t4186>
<t4187>While Elizabeth was speaking, Wickham could not decide whether to be pleased by her words or to doubt their meaning.</t4187> <t4188>There was something in Elizabeth's face that compelled him to listen with an uneasy and anxious attention as she said the following words,</t4188>
<t4189>"When I said 'he becomes more pleasant as you get to know him,' I didn't mean that his thoughts or behaviors undergo a pleasant change, but rather that as you get to know him better, his temperament is better understood.</t4189><t4190>"</t4190>
<t4191>Wickham's agitation now appeared with a tense face and an excited look; he was silent for a few minutes; finally, shaking off his discomfort, he turned to her again and said in a very gentle voice,</t4191>
<t4192>"You, who know well my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, can imagine how sincerely I am glad that he is wise enough to assume the appearance of truthfulness, even if only in form.</t4192> <t4193>His pride can be beneficial in that respect, if not to himself, then to many others; thus preventing the wrongs done to me from being inflicted on others.</t4193> <t4194>My only fear is that the prudence you mentioned only manifests during his visits to his aunt; he cares greatly about how she perceives him.</t4194> <t4195>I know that he is always afraid of her when they are together; and considerable weight should also be given to his desire to expedite his marriage to Miss de Bourgh, which I am sure is always on his mind.</t4195><t4196>"</t4196>
<t4197>Elizabeth couldn't help but smile when she heard these words, but she only responded with a slight nod of her head.</t4197> <t4198>She realized that Wickham wanted to draw her back to the old topic, to his sufferings, but she was not in a state to comply now.</t4198> <t4199>The rest of the evening passed with Wickham's usual appearance of cheerfulness; he made no further attempt towards Elizabeth; eventually, they parted with mutual politeness and possibly a desire never to meet again.</t4199>
<t4200>As the meeting dispersed, Lydia went to Meryton with Mrs. Forster; they would set off from there early the next morning.</t4200> <t4201>Her farewell with the family was not sorrowful but noisy.</t4201> <t4202>Only Kitty shed tears; the reason for her crying was boredom and jealousy.</t4202> <t4203>Mrs. Bennet wished her daughter plenty of happiness and sternly advised her not to miss any opportunity to have fun; it was evident that this advice would be followed; amidst Lydia's boisterous happiness while bidding farewell, the more polite farewell words of her sisters went unheard.</t4203>
<t4204>Chapter XIX</t4204>
<t4205>If Elizabeth's views had come from her family, she might not have been able to paint a very pleasant picture of a happy marriage or a comfortable home life.</t4205> <t4206>Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and the cheerful appearance that youth and beauty generally bring, had married a woman who was lacking in both sense and manners, and had lost all real affection for her soon after their marriage began.</t4206> <t4207>Respect, reverence, and trust had vanished forever; all hopes for family happiness were shattered.</t4207> <t4208>But Mr. Bennet was not the kind of man to seek solace in the pleasures that other unfortunate people, who had acted foolishly or wickedly, might resort to in their disappointment caused by their own imprudence.</t4208> <t4209>He was fond of the countryside and books; his main enjoyment came from these pleasures.</t4209> <t4210>He owed very little to his wife, except for the amusement her ignorance and foolishness provided him.</t4210> <t4211>This is not usually the kind of happiness a man wishes to owe to his wife; but when there are no other means of distraction, a true philosopher makes do with what he has.</t4211>
<t4212>However, Elizabeth had never been blind to her father's inappropriate behavior as a husband.</t4212> <t4213>She had always watched these with pain; but because she respected her father's abilities and was grateful for the love he showed her, she tried not to think about the extremely unpleasant act of constantly violating the duties and decorum of marriage, such as belittling his wife at every opportunity in front of their children.</t4213> <t4214>But never had she felt so strongly the troubles that children of such an incompatible marriage had to endure; never had she understood so well the harm caused by talents directed at the wrong targets – talents that, if used correctly, could at least have preserved her daughters' dignity, even if they failed to improve her wife's mind.</t4214>
<t4215>While Elizabeth Wickham was happy to be gone, she couldn't find any other consoling aspect in losing the regiment.</t4215> <t4216>The parties outside were duller than before; at home, her mother and sister, who constantly complained about the monotony of everything around them, cast a gloom over their family life; with the things that troubled her mind now distant, Kitty might eventually regain her former common sense, but her other sister, from whom greater mischief could be expected, seemed likely to harden all her foolishness and stubbornness in a situation that involved the double danger of the seaside and the military camp.</t4216> <t4217>In the end, as she had seen a few times before, she realized that an event she had been waiting for with impatient anticipation did not bring the joy Elizabeth had promised her when it finally happened.</t4217> <t4218>Another date would have to be set for true happiness to begin, another turning point where her wishes and hopes could be realized; and once again, she would console herself for the time being with the pleasure of anticipation, and prepare for another disappointment.</t4218> <t4219>The trip to the Lake District now formed her happiest thoughts; it was her strongest consolation against all those distressing hours made inevitable by her mother and Kitty; if she could include Jane in the plan, everything would be perfect.</t4219>
<t4220>"But luckily," she thought, "I have something to wish for.</t4220> <t4221>If all the arrangements had been made, I would certainly be disappointed.</t4221> <t4222>But here, while my sister is not around, I can carry a continuous source of sorrow with me and hope for all my joy expectations to come true.</t4222> <t4223>A plan that promises pleasure in every part can never succeed; the only way to prevent a great disappointment is to defend a small inconvenience.</t4223><t4224>"</t4224>
<t4225>Lydia had promised her mother and Kitty that she would write to them often and at length; but her letters always arrived very late and were always very short.</t4225> <t4226>The letters she wrote to her mother contained little more than the fact that they had just returned from the bookstore, that such and such officers had accompanied them there, that she had seen some trinkets that had taken her breath away, or that she had bought a new dress or a new umbrella that she would describe in detail but couldn't because Mrs. Forster had called and they were about to go to the camp; –even less could be learned from the letters she wrote to her sister –because although the letters to Kitty were somewhat longer, they were filled with underlined sentences not to be told to anyone else.</t4226>
<t4227>After the first two or three weeks of his absence, health, cheerfulness, and liveliness returned to Longbourn.</t4227> <t4228>Everything took on a happier appearance.</t4228> <t4229>Families who had gone to the city for the winter returned, and summer clothes and summer invitations emerged.</t4229> <t4230>Mrs. Bennet resumed her usual fretful solemnity; by mid-June, Kitty had recovered enough to go to Meryton without shedding tears – which was such a happy event in Elizabeth's eyes that she hoped Kitty might normalize to the point of not mentioning an officer's name more than once a day until the next Christmas, provided, of course, that the war office did not cruelly and ominously decide to station a new regiment in Meryton.</t4230>
<t4231>The start date of the northern travels was rapidly approaching; only fifteen days were left when a letter from Mrs. Gardiner both postponed the start date of the trip and narrowed its scope.</t4231> <t4232>Mr. Gardiner's work would not allow him to leave until mid-July, and he had to be back in London within a month; this left them so little time that they would not be able to go as far as they wanted or visit every place they wished, or at least not comfortably; therefore, they had to give up the Lake District and settle for a more limited tour; according to the current plan, they would not go further north than Derbyshire.</t4232> <t4233>There were enough places to visit and see in that county to keep them occupied for three weeks; it was particularly appealing to Mrs. Gardiner.</t4233> <t4234>The city where she had spent a few years of her life in the past and where she would now stay for a few days was probably as much of a curiosity for her as famous places like Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.</t4234>
<t4235>Elizabeth was greatly disappointed; she had very much wanted to see the Lake District; yet she thought there might still be time.</t4235> <t4236>But her task was to be content – of course, her inclination was also to be happy; soon everything was fine.</t4236>
<t4237>The mention of Derbyshire brought many ideas to mind.</t4237> <t4238>It was impossible to see that word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner.</t4238> <t4239>"What if," she said, "I secretly enter his homeland and steal a few florid stones without being seen by him.</t4239><t4240>"</t4240>
<t4241>The waiting period had now doubled.</t4241> <t4242>Four more weeks would pass before her uncle and aunt arrived.</t4242> <t4243>But it passed; finally, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner appeared at Longbourn with their four children.</t4243> <t4244>The children, two girls aged six and eight and two younger boys, were to be entrusted specifically to their cousin Jane; Jane was their favorite cousin, and with her calm speech and affectionate behavior, she was able to look after them in every way – educating them, entertaining them, and loving them.</t4244>
<t4245>The Gardiners stayed at Longbourn for only one night and set out the next morning with Elizabeth in search of novelty and amusement.</t4245> <t4246>There was a certain pleasure – they were well-suited as travel companions; both mentally and physically capable of enduring hardships – they had a cheerfulness that would enhance every happiness, and a love and intelligence that would compensate for any possible disappointments in their journey.</t4246>
<t4247>Describing Derbyshire or the notable places along the way is not the purpose of this book; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, and Birmingham are well known enough.</t4247> <t4248>Now, we are only concerned with a small part of Derbyshire.</t4248> <t4249>After seeing the main wonders of the countryside, they turned their steps towards the small town of Lambton, where Mrs. Gardiner used to live and recently learned that a few of her acquaintances still resided; Elizabeth learned from her aunt that Pemberley was located about five miles from Lambton.</t4249> <t4250>It was not directly on their way, but it was not more than a mile or two off the road either.</t4250> <t4251>While discussing their route the previous evening, Mrs. Gardiner mentioned that she wanted to see the place again.</t4251> <t4252>Mr. Gardiner also expressed his desire, so they turned to Elizabeth for approval.</t4252>
<t4253>"Sweetie, wouldn't you like to see a place you've heard so much about?" said her aunt.</t4253> <t4254>"A place with connections to many of your friends, moreover.</t4254> <t4255>Wickham spent all his youth there.</t4255><t4256>"</t4256>
<t4257>Elizabeth was bored.</t4257> <t4258>She felt that she had no business at Pemberley; she was inwardly inclined to object to seeing the place.</t4258> <t4259>She had to admit that she was tired of large houses; she had seen so many that she no longer truly enjoyed silk carpets or satin curtains.</t4259>
<t4260>Mrs. Gardiner was annoyed by the indifference.</t4260> <t4261>"If it were just a beautifully furnished house," she said, "I wouldn't care; but the land is magnificent.</t4261> <t4262>Some of the finest woods in the area are there.</t4262><t4263>"</t4263>
<t4264>Elizabeth did not object any further – but it wasn't coming from her heart.</t4264> <t4265>As she was walking around, the possibility of encountering Mr. Darcy suddenly crossed her mind.</t4265> <t4266>It would be dreadful!</t4266> <t4267>The mere thought of it was enough to make her blush; she thought it would be better to speak openly with her aunt rather than face such a danger.</t4267> <t4268>But there were obstacles to this as well; finally, she decided that this would be the last resort, in case a secret investigation about whether the family was there or not yielded an unpleasant result.</t4268>
<t4269>Accordingly, when she retired to her room at night, she asked the servant whether Pemberley was a beautiful place, who its owner was, and, quite anxiously, whether the family was at the summer house.</t4269> <t4270>The answer to the last question was a very reassuring no – with her anxiety thus relieved, she had the opportunity to feel a great curiosity to see the house; when the subject was brought up again the next morning and she was asked, her answer was ready; she said, with a very indifferent air, that she had no objection to the plan.</t4270>
<t4271>So, they were going to Pemberley.</t4271>
<t4272>Third Book</t4272>
<t4273>Chapter I</t4273>
<t4274>Elizabeth watched the first glimpses of Pemberley Woods from the carriage with some unease; by the time they entered through the lodge, she was quite discomposed.</t4274>
<t4275>The grove was very large; the terrain was filled with various elevations.</t4275> <t4276>They entered the grove from one of its lowest points and proceeded for a while through a beautiful forest that stretched far to both sides.</t4276>
<t4277>Elizabeth's mind was too full to speak, but she saw and admired every remarkable detail and view.</t4277> <t4278>They climbed about half a mile up the slope, then found themselves on a rather high hill; the forest had ended, and in an instant, her eyes were caught by Pemberley Manor; the Manor rose on the opposite side of a valley into which the road suddenly wound down.</t4278> <t4279>It was a large, beautiful stone building; set on the slope, backed by the ridges of high wooded hills; –in front, a river of natural significance swelled, but without creating an artificial appearance, it joined a larger river.</t4279> <t4280>The banks of the river were neither formal nor artificially adorned.</t4280> <t4281>Elizabeth was delighted.</t4281> <t4282>She had never seen a place where nature had been more generous or where natural beauty had been less marred by tastelessness in her life.</t4282> <t4283>They all stood in awe; and at that moment, Elizabeth felt that being the mistress of Pemberley might mean something!</t4283>
<t4284>They went down the slope, crossed the bridge, and arrived at the door; while Elizabeth was examining the house more closely, the possibility of encountering its owner again crossed her mind.</t4284> <t4285>She was seized by the fear that the servant might have been mistaken.</t4285> <t4286>When they knocked on the door to see the house, they were taken into the hall; while waiting for the steward to come, Elizabeth was surprised to find herself there.</t4286>
<t4287>The housekeeper arrived; she was an elderly woman with a dignified appearance, less ornate but more elegant than Elizabeth had imagined.</t4287> <t4288>Following her, they entered the dining room.</t4288> <t4289>It was a large, well-proportioned, beautifully furnished room.</t4289> <t4290>After briefly examining the room, Elizabeth went to the window to see the view.</t4290> <t4291>The hill they had descended was crowned with forest, appearing even more steep and magnificent from a distance.</t4291> <t4292>The garden was well-kept; Elizabeth looked with pleasure at the entire view, the river, the scattered trees along its banks, and the valley rising in winding curves.</t4292> <t4293>As they moved to the other rooms, these views took on different perspectives; but there was beauty to be seen from every window.</t4293> <t4294>The rooms were grand and beautiful; the furniture was fitting for the owner's wealth; but Elizabeth, admiring the owner's taste, saw that they were neither gaudy nor unnecessarily simple; they had a more genuine elegance than the furniture at Rosings.</t4294>
<t4295>"And I," she thought, "could have been the mistress of this place!</t4295> <t4296>I could have known these rooms very well by now!</t4296> <t4297>Instead of looking at them as a stranger, I could have enjoyed them as mine and could have invited my uncle and aunt as guests.</t4297> <t4298>–But no," –she pulled herself together, – "it wouldn't be like that: I would have lost my uncle and aunt: I wouldn't have been allowed to invite them.</t4298><t4299>"</t4299>
<t4300>This was a fortunate recollection – it prevented him from feeling something like regret.</t4300>
<t4301>The butler wanted to ask if the landlord was really traveling, but he didn't dare.</t4301> <t4302>Still, in the end, his uncle asked the question; while Elizabeth turned away in fear, Mrs. Reynolds said he was traveling and added, "but we expect him to come tomorrow, many of his friends will also come."</t4302> <t4303>How glad Elizabeth was that their own travels were not delayed by a day for any reason!</t4303>
<t4304>Her aunt called her to look at a picture at that moment.</t4304> <t4305>When Elizabeth approached, she saw Mr. Wickham's likeness among several miniatures above the fireplace.</t4305> <t4306>Her aunt asked with a smile how she found it.</t4306> <t4307>The housekeeper approached and said that the picture belonged to the son of her late master's steward, and that the young man had been raised by her master.</t4307> <t4308>–"He is in the army now," she added, "but I'm afraid he has become quite a rascal.</t4308><t4309>"</t4309>
<t4310>Mrs. Gardiner smiled at her niece, but Elizabeth could not respond.</t4310>
<t4311>"This one," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another miniature, "is my master – it resembles him greatly.</t4311> <t4312>It was drawn at the same time as the other one – about eight years ago.</t4312><t4313>"</t4313>
<t4314>"I have heard much praise of your master," said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; "a handsome face.</t4314> <t4315>But Lizzy, you can tell us whether it resembles him or not.</t4315><t4316>"</t4316>
<t4317>Mrs. Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase upon the implication that she knew her master.</t4317>
<t4318>"Does this young lady know Mr. Darcy?"</t4318><t4319>"</t4319>
<t4320>Elizabeth blushed; "A little," she said.</t4320>
<t4321>"Don't you think he is a very handsome gentleman, madam?</t4321><t4322>"</t4322>
<t4323>"Yes, very handsome."</t4323><t4324>"</t4324>
<t4325>"I am sure I have never seen someone so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs, you will see a bigger and more beautiful portrait of him.</t4325> <t4326>This room was my late master's favorite room; these miniatures are exactly as he left them.</t4326> <t4327>He was very fond of them.</t4327><t4328>"</t4328>
<t4329>This explained to Elizabeth why Wickham's portrait was there.</t4329>
<t4330>Mrs. Reynolds then drew their attention to a picture of Miss Darcy that had been drawn when she was eight years old.</t4330>
<t4331>"Is Miss Darcy as beautiful as her brother?" said Mr. Gardiner.</t4331>
<t4332>"Ah yes – the most beautiful young lady ever; and so talented too!</t4332> <t4333>–She plays and sings all day long.</t4333> <t4334>There is a new piano that just arrived for her in the next room – a gift from my master; the young lady is coming with it tomorrow.</t4334><t4335>"</t4335>
<t4336>Mr. Gardiner, who was in a relaxed and pleasant manner, increased the woman's talkativeness with his questions and observations; Mrs. Reynolds, either out of pride or loyalty, clearly took great pleasure in talking about her master and his sister.</t4336>
<t4337>"Does your master stay at Pemberley much throughout the year?"</t4337><t4338>"</t4338>
<t4339>"Not as much as I would like, sir; but I can say that he spends half the year here; Miss Darcy is always here during the summer months.</t4339><t4340>"</t4340>
<t4341>"Of course," thought Elizabeth, "except for the times he went to Ramsgate.</t4341><t4342>"</t4342>
<t4343>"If your master gets married, you can see him more often."</t4343><t4344>"</t4344>
<t4345>"Yes, sir; but I don't know when he will get married.</t4345> <t4346>I don't know anyone worthy of him.</t4346><t4347>"</t4347>
<t4348>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.</t4348> <t4349>Elizabeth couldn't help but say, "You say that because you value him."</t4349><t4350>"</t4350>
<t4351>"I am telling the truth; everyone who knows him would say the same," replied the other.</t4351> <t4352>Elizabeth thought things had gone too far; she listened to the steward's words with increasing astonishment, "In my life, I have never heard a single harsh word from his mouth, and I have known him since he was four years old.</t4352><t4353>"</t4353>
<t4354>This praise was the most unusual of all, the one most contrary to Elizabeth's thoughts.</t4354> <t4355>She was absolutely convinced that he was not a charming man.</t4355> <t4356>All her attention was aroused; she wanted to hear more and felt grateful to her uncle when she heard his words,</t4356>
<t4357>"Very few people can be spoken of in such a way.</t4357> <t4358>You are lucky to have such a master.</t4358><t4359>"</t4359>
<t4360>"Yes, sir, I know that I am lucky.</t4360> <t4361>I couldn't find a better one even if I traveled the world.</t4361> <t4362>But I have always seen that those who are well-behaved as children remain well-behaved when they grow up; and he was the sweetest-natured, most soft-hearted child in the world.</t4362><t4363>"</t4363>
<t4364>Elizabeth stared at the woman.</t4364> <t4365>–"Could this be Mr. Darcy!" she thought.</t4365>
<t4366>"Her father was a wonderful man," said Mrs. Gardiner.</t4366>
<t4367>"Yes ma'am, it was like that; his son will be just like him – a friend to the poor and needy like him."</t4367><t4368>"</t4368>
<t4369>Elizabeth listened, was astonished, doubted, and was impatient for it to continue.</t4369> <t4370>Mrs. Reynolds could not draw her attention to another subject.</t4370> <t4371>She touched on topics such as the pictures, the dimensions of the room, and the prices of the furniture, but it was in vain.</t4371> <t4372>Mr. Gardiner, attributing the woman's excessive praise of her master to family pride, was quite amused and soon returned to the subject; as they all went up the grand staircase together, the woman began enumerating her master's virtues again.</t4372>
<t4373>"Of all time," he said, "he is the best landlord and the best master.</t4373> <t4374>He is unlike today's wild young men who think of nothing but themselves.</t4374> <t4375>There is not a single tenant or servant who would not speak well of him.</t4375> <t4376>Some call him proud, but I am sure I have not seen a trace of it.</t4376> <t4377>In my opinion, they say so because he does not make a fuss like other young men.</t4377><t4378>"</t4378>
<t4379>"How charming these words make him appear!" thought Elizabeth.</t4379>
<t4380>"This description," whispered her aunt as they walked, "doesn't quite match the way she behaves towards our poor friend.</t4380><t4381>"</t4381>
<t4382>"Maybe we were wrong.</t4382><t4383>"</t4383>
<t4384>"Sanmam; our source was reliable."</t4384><t4385>"</t4385>
<t4386>When they reached the spacious lobby on the upper floor, they were taken to a very pleasant sitting room furnished in a more elegant and lighter style than the apartments below; it was said that the room was newly built to please Miss Darcy, who liked the room when she last came to Pemberley.</t4386>
<t4387>"It is clear that he is a good brother," said Elizabeth, walking towards one of the windows.</t4387>
<t4388>Mrs. Reynolds could see how pleased Miss Darcy would be when she entered the room.</t4388> <t4389>"The master is always like this," she added.</t4389> <t4390>–"If there is something that will please his sister, it is done at that moment.</t4390> <t4391>There is nothing he wouldn't do for her.</t4391><t4392>"</t4392>
<t4393>There remained the picture gallery to be shown and a few main bedrooms.</t4393> <t4394>There were many beautiful paintings in the gallery; but Elizabeth did not understand paintings; she left the pictures she saw below and turned her attention to Miss Darcy's pencil sketches, which had more interesting subjects and were more comprehensible.</t4394>
<t4395>There were many family portraits in the gallery, but they had no aspects that might be interesting to a stranger.</t4395> <t4396>Elizabeth continued to walk, searching for the one face she would recognize.</t4396> <t4397>Finally, that face stopped her – and she saw a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with the smile she remembered seeing occasionally when she looked at him.</t4397> <t4398>She stood in front of it for a few minutes, examining the painting with curiosity, and before leaving the gallery, she turned to look at it once more.</t4398> <t4399>Mrs. Reynolds said the painting was done during his father's lifetime.</t4399>
<t4400>There was a feeling within Elizabeth during their relationship that was much warmer than what she had felt towards him before.</t4400> <t4401>The praises Mrs. Reynolds showered upon him were by no means ordinary.</t4401> <t4402>What praise is more valuable than that of an intelligent servant?</t4402> <t4403>As a brother, a landlord, a master, how many people's happiness was under his protection!</t4403> <t4404>–How much power he had to bring joy or sorrow!</t4404> <t4405>–How much good or evil he could do!</t4405> <t4406>Every word the steward spoke elevated his character; as Elizabeth stood before the portrait with her eyes fixed upon it, she looked at the image with a deeper sense of gratitude than ever before; she remembered the warmth of that image, softened the flaw in its expression.</t4406>
<t4407>After they had seen every part of the house that was open to visitors, they went back downstairs; they bid farewell to the steward, and at the hall door, the gardener took over from him.</t4407>
<t4408>As they walked from the meadow towards the river, Elizabeth turned around to look again; her uncle and aunt also stopped; while Elizabeth was trying to determine the construction date of the house, the owner of the house suddenly appeared in front of them from the road winding from the back of the house to the stables.</t4408>
<t4409>They were twenty steps apart from each other; his appearance had been so sudden that it was impossible not to see him.</t4409> <t4410>Their eyes met instantly; both of their cheeks were covered in a deep blush.</t4410> <t4411>Darcy was stunned and couldn't move for a moment out of shock; but soon he composed himself, advanced towards the visitors, and spoke to Elizabeth with perfect politeness, if not perfect calmness.</t4411>
<t4412>Elizabeth instinctively turned the other way; but when she saw him approaching, she stopped and accepted his compliments with an insurmountable discomfort.</t4412> <t4413>If his initial appearance, or his resemblance to the portrait they were examining, had not been enough to convince the other two that it was Mr. Darcy they were seeing, the gardener's expression of astonishment upon seeing his master would have immediately confirmed it.</t4413> <t4414>While Mr. Darcy spoke with his nephews, the two of them stood a little aside; the nephews were astonished, dazed, and did not even dare to lift their eyes to look at his face, unsure of how to respond to his polite inquiries about their family's health.</t4414> <t4415>As she marveled at how differently he behaved compared to the last time they parted, every sentence he uttered increased her discomfort a bit more; the inappropriateness of her presence repeatedly came to mind, making the few minutes they stood face to face some of the most tense moments of her life.</t4415> <t4416>On the other hand, Mr. Darcy did not seem very comfortable either; there was no trace of his usual calmness in his voice as he spoke; he repeatedly, frequently, and hurriedly asked when she had left Longbourn and how long she would stay in Derbyshire, making it clear that his mind was confused.</t4416>
<t4417>In the end, it seemed as if no thought was enough for him; after standing silently for a few minutes, he suddenly pulled himself together and said goodbye.</t4417>
<t4418>Then the others came to her and expressed how much they admired Mr. Darcy; but Elizabeth did not hear a single word and followed them silently, surrounded by her own feelings.</t4418><t4419>She was exhausted from shame and distress.</t4419><t4420>Coming there was the most unfortunate, most foolish thing she had ever done!</t4420><t4421>How strange she must have appeared to him!</t4421><t4422>Such a thing would seem so unbecoming to such a proud man!</t4422><t4423>It would look as if she had deliberately thrown herself in his way!</t4423><t4424>Why had she come, why?</t4424><t4425>And why had Mr. Darcy arrived a day earlier than expected?</t4425><t4426>If they had left ten minutes earlier, he wouldn't have even noticed them, because it was clear he had just arrived, just dismounted from his horse or carriage.</t4426><t4427>She blushed repeatedly at the thought of the awkward encounter.</t4427><t4428>And his so changed behavior – what to make of that?</t4428><t4429>It was a miracle that he even spoke to her! – especially speaking so kindly and inquiring about her family's health!</t4429><t4430>She had never seen him behave so humbly, never heard him speak so delicately as he did in that unexpected encounter.</t4430><t4431>How different it was from their last conversation at Rosings Park, especially when he handed her that letter!</t4431><t4432>She did not know what to think, how to explain it.</t4432>
<t4433>They had now entered a beautiful road by the water; each step revealed a larger slope or a small extension of the forest they were approaching; but it took Elizabeth some time to see these; she was so busy answering her uncle and aunt's incessant questions, turning her eyes to the places they pointed out, that she could not distinguish any part of the scene.</t4433> <t4434>Her thoughts were fixed on that single point of Pemberley Manor, the point where Mr. Darcy was at that moment.</t4434> <t4435>She wanted to know what was going through his mind at that moment, what he thought of her, and whether she still mattered to him despite everything.</t4435> <t4436>Perhaps he had been kind just because he felt comfortable; but still, there was that thing in his voice, that thing that was not like comfort.</t4436> <t4437>She did not know whether he felt pain or joy at seeing Elizabeth, but she knew he could not remain calm when he saw her.</t4437>
<t4438>Nevertheless, in the end, the words of his friends woke him from his reverie; he felt he needed to appear more present.</t4438>
<t4439>They entered the forest, bidding farewell to the river for a while; they descended several slopes; at points where the clearings among the trees allowed the eye to wander, they caught magnificent views of the valley, the opposite hills, the distant forests covering many hills, and occasionally a part of the river.</t4439><t4440>Mr. Gardiner said he wanted to explore the entire grove, but he feared it might not be possible to do so on foot.</t4440><t4441>With a triumphant smile, they were told that the grove was ten miles in diameter.</t4441><t4442>This settled the matter; they followed the usual path, which after a while led them down a slope through drooping trees to the water's edge, at one of its narrowest points.</t4442><t4443>They crossed a simple bridge made in a style suitable to the atmosphere of the surroundings; it was a less adorned place than the areas they had previously explored; here the valley narrowed, allowing space only for the river and a narrow path winding through the bushes along the river.</t4443><t4444>Elizabeth wanted to follow the path; but when they crossed the bridge and realized how far they were from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a vigorous walker, could go no further and was eager to return to the carriage as soon as possible.</t4444><t4445>Her niece had to agree, and they walked towards the house by a shortcut on the opposite side of the river; they moved slowly because, although Mr. Gardiner could not spare the time, he was very keen on fishing and would get absorbed in watching a trout in the water, talking about trout, and hardly walking at all.</t4445><t4446>As they walked at this slow pace, something else surprised them; seeing Mr. Darcy approaching them and not far away at all, Elizabeth was once again as astonished as before.</t4446><t4447>Because the path on that side of the river was less sheltered than the one on the opposite side, they could see him before coming face to face with him.</t4447><t4448>Although Elizabeth was surprised, she was at least more prepared to speak than before and decided to appear and speak calmly if Mr. Darcy indeed intended to talk to them.</t4448><t4449>For a few minutes, she really thought he would take another path.</t4449><t4450>As a bend in the path hid him from view, they continued, then the bend was passed, and they found him right in front of them.</t4450><t4451>At a glance, Elizabeth saw that he had not lost his previous courtesy; and to reciprocate his politeness, as they came face to face, she began to express how much she admired the beauty of the surroundings, but she could not get beyond the words "magnificent" and "extraordinary" when some unfortunate memories intervened, and she thought that praising Pemberley might be misunderstood.</t4451><t4452>She blushed and fell silent.</t4452>
<t4453>Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; when Elizabeth paused, Mr. Darcy asked her to introduce him to her friends.</t4453> <t4454>This was a gesture of courtesy for which Elizabeth was quite unprepared, and she could barely suppress a smile when she saw that he now wanted to be introduced to the same people whom his pride had previously rejected.</t4454> <t4455>"How surprised he will be," she thought, "when he finds out who they are!</t4455> <t4456>He thinks they are from high society.</t4456><t4457>"</t4457>
<t4458>However, the introduction was made immediately; while Elizabeth was explaining their kinship, she cast a furtive glance at Mr. Darcy's face to see how he would react; she did not entirely expect him to quickly distance himself from such lowly friends.</t4458> <t4459>Mr. Darcy was clearly surprised by the kinship; nevertheless, he endured this information with composure, and instead of walking away, he turned to the other side with them and began conversing with Mr. Gardiner.</t4459> <t4460>Elizabeth felt joy, she felt the intoxication of victory.</t4460> <t4461>It was reassuring to have relatives who were not disgraceful, and for Mr. Darcy to know this.</t4461> <t4462>She listened to the conversation between them with great attention and took pride in every expression, every sentence of her uncle; he was showing himself to be an intelligent, tasteful, and cultured man.</t4462>
<t4463>The conversation quickly turned to fishing; he heard that Mr. Darcy had very kindly invited him to fish as often as he wished while he was in the area, had also offered to give him fishing tackle, and had shown him the spots in the river where the catch was most abundant.</t4463> <t4464>Mrs. Gardiner, walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look of astonishment.</t4464> <t4465>Elizabeth said nothing, but she was extremely proud of the situation; the compliment must have been entirely directed at her.</t4465> <t4466>Nevertheless, her astonishment was very great, and she kept repeating to herself, "Why has he changed so much?</t4466> <t4467>What can be inferred from this?</t4467> <t4468>The softening of his actions cannot be for me, it cannot be for my sake.</t4468> <t4469>My words at Hunsford cannot have caused such a change.</t4469> <t4470>It is impossible that he still loves me.</t4470><t4471>"</t4471>
<t4472>Two ladies in front, two gentlemen behind, after walking this way for a while, there was a small change in the situation after descending to the riverbank to better examine a strange water plant.</t4472> <t4473>Mrs. Gardiner, tired from the morning walk, did not get enough support from Elizabeth's arm and eventually preferred her husband's arm.</t4473> <t4474>Mr. Darcy took his place beside his niece and they walked together.</t4474> <t4475>After a short silence, Elizabeth spoke first.</t4475> <t4476>She wanted him to know that she was sure he wasn't there before they arrived and said his arrival was very sudden – "your steward," she added, "said you wouldn't come before tomorrow; we even learned before leaving Bakewell that you wouldn't come to the village nearby."</t4476> <t4477>Mr. Darcy confirmed these were true; he said his business with the steward caused him to arrive a few hours earlier than the rest of the group they traveled with.</t4477> <t4478>"They will join me early tomorrow," he continued, "and among them are those who know you, –Mr. Bingley and his sisters.</t4478><t4479>"</t4479>
<t4480>Elizabeth merely nodded slightly in response.</t4480> <t4481>Her thoughts suddenly returned to the last time Mr. Bingley's name was mentioned among them; from what she could tell from his face, Mr. Darcy's mind was not occupied with anything very different.</t4481>
<t4482>"There is one more person in the group," he continued after pausing, "who particularly wants to meet you. –While staying in Lambton, would you allow me to introduce my sister to you, or am I asking too much?</t4482><t4483>"</t4483>
<t4484>The astonishment caused by this request was great; he felt a tremendous desire to know how he had attained this privilege.</t4484> <t4485>He immediately sensed that Miss Darcy's desire to meet him must have been the result of her brother's words, and without looking further, he found this explanation sufficient; it was pleasing to see that his resentment had not led him to think ill of Elizabeth.</t4485>
<t4486>Now they were walking silently, each deep in thought.</t4486> <t4487>Elizabeth was not comfortable; it was impossible; but her pride was flattered, she was happy.</t4487> <t4488>The desire to introduce his sister to her was the highest form of compliment.</t4488> <t4489>They quickly left the others behind; by the time they reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were a quarter mile behind.</t4489>
<t4490>Then Mr. Darcy invited her to the house – but Elizabeth, saying she was not tired, declined the offer; they stood together on the lawn.</t4490> <t4491>Much could have been said at such a time, and the silence was very strange.</t4491> <t4492>Elizabeth wanted to speak, but it was as if every topic was forbidden.</t4492> <t4493>Finally, she remembered that they were traveling; with great effort, they talked about Matlock and Dove Dale.</t4493> <t4494>But both time and her aunt were progressing slowly – her patience and ideas were nearly exhausted when their tête-à-tête ended.</t4494> <t4495>Upon the arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, they were all invited to the house for some refreshments, but this offer was declined; both parties bid farewell very politely.</t4495> <t4496>Mr. Darcy helped the ladies into the carriage, and as it moved away, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly back towards the house.</t4496>
<t4497>Then her uncle and aunt's observations began; both said they found her far superior to what they had expected.</t4497> <t4498>"Extremely polite, kind, humble," said her uncle.</t4498>
<t4499>"Of course, there's a slightly pretentious side to her," replied her aunt, "but it's just about her demeanor and it doesn't look bad on her, to be honest.</t4499> <t4500>Now I agree with the steward, some call her proud but I haven't seen a trace of it.</t4500><t4501>"</t4501>
<t4502>"What surprised me the most was his behavior towards us.</t4502> <t4503>There was more than just politeness; he was genuinely interested, which was more attention than necessary.</t4503> <t4504>He had a superficial acquaintance with Elizabeth.</t4504><t4505>"</t4505>
<t4506>"Indeed, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not as handsome as Wickham; or rather, he lacks Wickham's charm, otherwise his features are perfect.</t4506> <t4507>But what made you tell us he was such a disagreeable person?</t4507><t4508>"</t4508>
<t4509>Elizabeth tried her best to excuse herself; she said that she liked him more than before when they met in Kent, and that he had never seemed as charming as he did that morning.</t4509>
<t4510>"But maybe his politeness is a bit of a coincidence," his uncle replied.</t4510> <t4511>"Great men are like that; so I won't take his words about fishing seriously, because he might forget what he said and fire me the day after tomorrow.</t4511><t4512>"</t4512>
<t4513>She felt that they were completely wrong about Elizabeth's character, but she said nothing.</t4513>
<t4514>"As far as we can see," continued Mrs. Gardiner, "I can't imagine anyone treating poor Wickham as cruelly as he did.</t4514> <t4515>He doesn't have the appearance of a bad-hearted person.</t4515> <t4516>On the contrary, when he speaks, a pleasant air emanates from his words.</t4516> <t4517>There is such nobility in his face that one cannot think there could be evil in his heart.</t4517> <t4518>But of course, the lovely woman showing us the house exaggerated him a lot!</t4518> <t4519>At one point, I held myself back from laughing.</t4519> <t4520>But he must be a generous master for his servant to think he possesses every virtue.</t4520><t4521>"</t4521>
<t4522>Elizabeth felt the need to say something corrective about her behavior towards Wickham and, as limited as possible, told them that, according to what she had heard from relatives in Kent, his actions were open to a very different interpretation, his character was not at all flawed, and on the other hand, Wickham was not as good as they thought in Hertfordshire.</t4522> <t4523>To confirm this, without specifying the source but stating that it was reliable, she explained all the details of the financial transactions that concerned them all.</t4523>
<t4524>Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and worried; but as they approached the places of her old happy days, these thoughts gave way to the charm of memories; she became so engrossed in pointing out the interesting places in the vicinity to her husband that she couldn't think of anything else.</t4524> <t4525>Although she was tired from the morning walk, she immediately set out to search for old acquaintances as soon as the meal was over; the evening passed in the pleasure of a relationship renewed after a long separation.</t4525>
<t4526>The events of that day were so intriguing to Elizabeth that she could not focus on these new friends; she could not stop thinking about Mr. Darcy's politeness and, most of all, his desire to introduce her to his sister, and she was astonished by it.</t4526>
<t4527>Chapter II</t4527>
<t4528>Elizabeth had arranged for Mr. Darcy to bring his sister to visit the day after they arrived at Pemberley; therefore, she decided not to leave the inn's vicinity throughout the morning.</t4528><t4529>But her assumption was wrong; because these visitors came the morning after they themselves arrived in Lambton.</t4529><t4530>They were touring the surroundings with some of their new friends; they had returned to the inn to change their clothes to go dine with the same family when they heard the sound of a carriage and went to the window; they saw a gentleman and a lady coming up the street in an open carriage.</t4530><t4531>Elizabeth immediately recognized the coachman's uniform, guessed its meaning, and surprised her relatives just as much by announcing the expected visit.</t4531><t4532>Her uncle and aunt were astonished; their discomfort in their movements while speaking, combined with the situation itself and the events of the previous day, sparked a new idea about the matter in their minds.</t4532><t4533>Nothing had suggested this possibility before, but now they felt that the only explanation for such attention from such a place could be an interest in their niece.</t4533><t4534>As these new thoughts passed through their minds, the confusion of Elizabeth's feelings increased every moment.</t4534><t4535>She was surprised at her own agitation; but among other reasons for discomfort, she most feared that the brother had praised her too much; she wanted to appear pleasing, but she was afraid that nothing she did would be enough to achieve that.</t4535>
<t4536>He pulled back from the window, afraid of being seen; while trying to compose himself, he saw the bewildered looks filled with questions from his uncle and aunt, and his task became even more difficult.</t4536>
<t4537>Miss Darcy and her brother arrived, and the intimidating introduction took place.</t4537> <t4538>Elizabeth was surprised to see that her new acquaintance was at least as uncomfortable as she was.</t4538> <t4539>Since coming to Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was extremely proud; but a few minutes of observation convinced her that she was extremely shy.</t4539> <t4540>It was difficult to get a single word out of her, except for monosyllables.</t4540>
<t4541>Miss Darcy was tall, larger than Elizabeth; although she was only sixteen, she had matured well; her appearance was feminine and graceful.</t4541> <t4542>She was not as beautiful as her brother, but there was sensitivity and kindness in her face; her manners were modest and polite.</t4542> <t4543>Elizabeth, who expected to find in her as sharp and bold an observer as Mr. Darcy, was quite relieved to distinguish such different feelings.</t4543>
<t4544>It hadn't been long since they had come together when Darcy told her that Bingley would also be visiting her; and before Elizabeth could express her pleasure and prepare herself for such a visitor, Bingley's quick steps were heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.</t4544> <t4545>Elizabeth's anger towards him had long passed; but if any remained, it vanished in the face of Bingley's humble closeness as he expressed how delighted he was to see her again.</t4545> <t4546>In a friendly but impartial manner, he inquired about her family's health and moved and spoke with his usual cheerful ease.</t4546>
<t4547>He was just as interesting to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.</t4547> <t4548>They had wanted to see him for some time.</t4548> <t4549>The entire group in front of them was exciting.</t4549> <t4550>The doubts they had just heard about Mr. Darcy and his nieces directed their attention to the two with curious but covert scrutiny; soon they concluded from their observation that at least one of them knew what love was.</t4550> <t4551>They had little doubt about the girl's feelings; but the boy was evidently burning with admiration.</t4551>
<t4552>Elizabeth had a lot to do on her own behalf.</t4552> <t4553>She wanted to be sure of the feelings of each of her guests, to calm her own mood, and to make herself appear charming to everyone; the chance of success for her second goal, which she feared she would fail at most, was certain because the people she was trying to please were already on her side.</t4553> <t4554>Bingley was ready, Georgiana was willing, and Darcy was determined to be pleased.</t4554>
<t4555>Upon seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally turned to her sister; oh, how she wished she knew if his thoughts were directed to the same place!</t4555> <t4556>Sometimes it seemed to her that Bingley spoke less than he used to; indeed, once or twice she was delighted by the thought that he was trying to find traces of resemblance while looking at her.</t4556> <t4557>These could be mere figments of her imagination, but she could not be mistaken about his behavior towards Miss Darcy, who was set up as a rival to Jane.</t4557> <t4558>Neither party's looks indicated any special interest.</t4558> <t4559>There was nothing between them that could justify her sisters' hopes.</t4559> <t4560>She was quickly satisfied on this point; indeed, before their departure, there were a few small incidents which, according to Elizabeth's eager interpretation, showed that he remembered Jane and wanted to say something more that could lead to her being mentioned, but did not dare to.</t4560> <t4561>At a moment when the others were talking among themselves, he said to Elizabeth in a voice filled with genuine regret, "It has been a very long time since I had the pleasure of seeing her;" and before Elizabeth could respond, he added, "It has been over eight months.</t4561> <t4562>We have not met since the 26th of November, the day we danced at Netherfield.</t4562><t4563>"</t4563>
<t4564>Elizabeth was pleased to see that her memory was so strong; later, finding an opportunity when the others were not around, she asked if all her sisters were at Longbourn.</t4564> <t4565>There was nothing much in the question, nor in the answer that came, but there was a look and a manner that gave them meaning.</t4565>
<t4566>She could not often turn her eyes towards Mr. Darcy; but whenever she did catch a glimpse of him, she saw a general expression of politeness, and in everything he said, she heard a tone of voice that was far removed from arrogance or disdain towards his companions, which convinced her that the improvement in his behavior she had witnessed yesterday, even if temporary, had lasted for more than just a day.</t4566><t4567>Seeing him seek opportunities to meet people he would have been ashamed to encounter a few months ago, and trying to win their approval, and observing him being courteous not only to her but also to the relatives he had previously openly scorned, and recalling the last lively scenes at the parsonage in Hunsford, the difference and change seemed so great and made such a strong impression on her mind that she could not help but show her astonishment.</t4567><t4568>She had never seen him so eager to be liked, whether among his dear friends at Netherfield or his noble relatives at Rosings, and so far removed from self-importance or pretentiousness, even though his efforts would bring him no benefit and his acquaintance with the people he was showing kindness to would lead to the mockery and disapproval of the ladies at Netherfield and Rosings.</t4568>
<t4569>The guests stayed with them for more than half an hour; when they got up to leave, Mr. Darcy turned to his sister and asked her to join him in expressing the desire to see Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner and Miss Bennet again for dinner at Pemberley before they left the area.</t4569> <t4570>Miss Darcy, though shyly indicating her lack of habit in making invitations, complied with the request.</t4570> <t4571>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece to see if she, the person most concerned with the invitation, was inclined to accept, but Elizabeth had turned her head away.</t4571> <t4572>However, assuming that this eager avoidance indicated momentary discomfort rather than displeasure with the offer, and seeing in her husband a complete willingness to accept, she accepted the invitation; the next day was agreed upon.</t4572>
<t4573>Bingley said that he was very happy to see Elizabeth again, that he still had much to tell her and many questions to ask about their friends in Hertfordshire.</t4573> <t4574>Elizabeth, attributing all this to his desire to hear news about her sister, was pleased; therefore, and for some other reasons as well, she found that she could think back on the last half hour with a certain satisfaction after the guests had left, even though it had not seemed very enjoyable at the time.</t4574> <t4575>She wanted to be alone, fearing questions or insinuations from her uncle and aunt, and stayed with them just long enough to learn their positive opinions about Bingley, then hurriedly went to change her clothes.</t4575>
<t4576>However, there was no reason for Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner to fear their curiosity; they did not intend to force her to talk.</t4576> <t4577>It was clear that Elizabeth knew Mr. Darcy much better than they had previously realized; it was also clear that Mr. Darcy was deeply in love with her.</t4577> <t4578>They were seeing interesting things, but there was no need to ask questions.</t4578>
<t4579>Thinking well of Mr. Darcy was now a matter of concern; throughout their acquaintance, they had seen no fault in him.</t4579> <t4580>It was impossible not to be impressed by his politeness; if they had drawn his character from their own feelings and the words of his servant without resorting to anyone else's expression, the Hertfordshire community who knew him could not recognize this Mr. Darcy.</t4580> <t4581>However, there was also meaning in believing the steward; they realized that the testimony of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own behavior exuded respectability could not be easily disregarded.</t4581> <t4582>There was nothing known by their friends in Lambton that could significantly lessen the weight of this.</t4582> <t4583>They could not accuse him of anything other than pride; he was probably proud, but even if he were not, the residents of a small market town that the family did not visit would somehow attach that label to him.</t4583> <t4584>On the other hand, it was accepted that he was a generous man, and that he did much good for the poor and needy.</t4584>
<t4585>As for Wickham, the travelers learned that he was not held in high regard there; although most of his troubles, particularly those involving his master's son, were not well known, it was a well-known fact that he had left behind a considerable amount of debt when he departed from Derbyshire, and that these debts were later paid off by Mr. Darcy.</t4585>
<t4586>Elizabeth's thoughts this evening were even more focused on Pemberley than the previous evening; the evening hours seemed long as they passed, but not long enough for her to understand her feelings for someone at that estate; she lay awake for two hours trying to make sense of her emotions.</t4586> <t4587>Of course, she did not hate him.</t4587> <t4588>No; the hatred had passed long ago, and Elizabeth had almost been ashamed of the coldness she had felt towards him since then.</t4588> <t4589>The respect that his superior qualities had aroused, though initially accepted reluctantly, had for some time ceased to be repulsive to her; moreover, thanks to the praise spoken about him, he now appeared in a more friendly light, and his character was shown in a very charming light that had emerged yesterday.</t4589> <t4590>But more than anything, more than respect and trust, there was a feeling of goodwill within Elizabeth that she could not ignore.</t4590> <t4591>It was gratitude.</t4591> <t4592>–Not just gratitude for once loving him, but gratitude for loving him enough to forgive all the rudeness and irritability in her manner of rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations that accompanied them.</t4592> <t4593>When she should have seen him as her greatest enemy and avoided him, he had shown willingness to maintain their friendship when they met by chance, had tried to win the hearts of her friends without the discourtesy of limiting his attention to her, and had decided to introduce her to his sister.</t4593> <t4594>Such a change in a man so proud not only aroused astonishment but also gratitude –for it must have been because of love, passionate love; thus, the effect on Elizabeth was not irritating but rather of a kind that sought encouragement, though it was not clear exactly what it was.</t4594> <t4595>She felt respect, appreciation, and gratitude towards him, and sincerely wished for his well-being; she just wanted to know to what extent she wished that well-being to be tied to herself, Elizabeth, and to what extent her imagination, which still told her she had the power, would take their happiness if he used the power to renew his proposal.</t4595>
<t4596>The aunt and the niece decided that evening that it was necessary to respond to Miss Darcy's tremendous kindness, that is, the kindness she showed by getting up to visit them on the day she arrived at Pemberley, even though she arrived at breakfast time, with a response that, even if not as exquisite, should be close to it; as a result, they agreed that it would be very appropriate to visit her at Pemberley the next morning.</t4596> <t4597>They would go, that is.</t4597> <t4598>–Elizabeth was happy, but when she asked herself why she was happy, she couldn't find much of an answer.</t4598>
<t4599>Mr. Gardiner left them immediately after breakfast.</t4599> <t4600>The invitation to go fishing had been repeated the previous day, and it was arranged to meet a few gentlemen at Pemberley around noon.</t4600>
<t4601>Chapter III</t4601>
<t4602>Elizabeth, now thoroughly convinced that Miss Bingley's dislike for her stemmed from jealousy, couldn't help but think about how uncomfortable it must be for her to appear at Pemberley; indeed, she wondered how much courtesy that lady would show while renewing their acquaintance.</t4602>
<t4603>When they arrived at the house, they were taken from the hall to the living room; its north-facing aspect made the living room a pleasant place for summer.</t4603> <t4604>The windows opening to the garden displayed the refreshing view of the high wooded hills behind the house and the magnificent oak and chestnut trees rising in the grassy area just in front.</t4604>
<t4605>They were greeted in this room by Miss Darcy; Miss Darcy was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst, Miss Bingley, and a lady from London.</t4605> <t4606>Georgiana greeted them very politely; but there was no lack of that discomfort stemming from shyness and the fear of making mistakes, which could make those who felt inferior to her think she was proud and distant.</t4606> <t4607>Nevertheless, Mrs. Gardiner and her niece gave her credit and felt sorry for her.</t4607>
<t4608>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley greeted them only with a slight bend of the knee; once seated, there was a silence, the kind of awkward silence that can occur in such a situation, and it lasted for a few minutes.</t4608> <t4609>The first to break the silence was Mrs. Annesley; she appeared to be a kind and amiable woman, and her attempt to start a conversation showed that she was better bred than the other two; the conversation continued between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth.</t4609> <t4610>Miss Darcy seemed to be gathering the courage to join the conversation and sometimes dared to say a brief word when the risk of being heard was at its lowest.</t4610>
<t4611>Elizabeth soon realized that she was under the close watch of Miss Bingley and that she couldn't speak a single word to Miss Darcy without drawing her attention.</t4611> <t4612>This observation did not prevent her from trying to talk to her, but there was an inconvenient distance between their seats; however, she was not upset as she was relieved from the obligation of much conversation.</t4612> <t4613>Her thoughts were already occupying her.</t4613> <t4614>She was expecting some of the gentlemen to enter the room at any moment.</t4614> <t4615>She wanted the master of the house to be among them, feared he would be, and couldn't decide whether she wanted it or feared it.</t4615> <t4616>After sitting for a quarter of an hour in this manner without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was startled when a cold question about her family's health came from her.</t4616> <t4617>She replied with the same indifference and brevity, and the other said nothing more.</t4617>
<t4618>The second movement during the visit occurred with the entrance of the servants; they brought cold cuts, cake, and various seasonal fruits; but for this movement to happen, Mrs. Annesley had to make numerous gestures to Miss Darcy to remind her of her duty.</t4618> <t4619>Now there was something for everyone to occupy themselves with; they couldn't all talk, but they could all eat; seeing the grapes, nectarines, and peaches arranged in marvelous pyramids, they soon gathered around the table.</t4619>
<t4620>In the midst of this occupation, was Elizabeth afraid of Mr. Darcy's arrival, or did she want him to come? She had the opportunity to truly decide when Mr. Darcy entered the room; then, she began to feel upset that he had come, even though she thought she wanted it just a minute before.</t4620>
<t4621>Mr. Darcy had been with Mr. Gardiner for a while; Mr. Gardiner was busy at the river with a few gentlemen who were guests at the house, and Mr. Darcy had only left him alone upon learning that the ladies of the family were planning to visit Georgiana that morning.</t4621> <t4622>As soon as she entered the room, Elizabeth decided to appear quite at ease and natural – a necessary decision but perhaps not so easy to adhere to, because she saw that the suspicions of everyone in the room were aroused against the two of them and that there was not a single eye that did not follow Mr. Darcy's behavior when he first entered.</t4622> <t4623>No one else's face bore such a strongly fixed look of attentive curiosity as Miss Bingley's, even though her face lit up with smiles while speaking to one of the two people who aroused her curiosity; jealousy had not yet exhausted all her hopes, and she had not given up showing interest in Mr. Darcy.</t4623> <t4624>Miss Darcy forced herself to talk more upon her brother's arrival; Elizabeth saw that Mr. Darcy wanted his sister and herself to become closer and that he supported every attempt at conversation from both sides as much as he could.</t4624> <t4625>Miss Bingley also saw all this and, in the carelessness of her anger, said with a contemptuous interest at the first opportunity,</t4625>
<t4626>"May I ask, Miss Eliza, hasn't the -------shire regiment withdrawn from Meryton?</t4626> <t4627>It must have been a great loss for your family.</t4627><t4628>"</t4628>
<t4629>She did not dare to mention Wickham's name in Darcy's presence; but Elizabeth immediately understood that he was on her mind; various memories related to Wickham briefly troubled her, but she gathered her attention to fend off that malicious attack and answered the question in a very indifferent tone.</t4629> <t4630>While speaking, she glanced at Darcy for a moment and saw a serious expression on his face, persistently looking at her, and his sister, unable to lift her eyes, sinking into distress.</t4630> <t4631>If Miss Bingley had known how much she was hurting her dear friend at that moment, she undoubtedly would not have made such an insinuation, but she only wanted to upset Elizabeth by mentioning a man she believed she was close to, revealing a sensitivity that could lower him in Darcy's eyes, and perhaps reminding Darcy of all the foolishness and ridiculousness of some of her family members associating with soldiers.</t4631> <t4632>Miss Darcy had not heard a single word about the planned elopement.</t4632> <t4633>This had been kept as secret as possible from everyone, except Elizabeth; her brother especially wanted to keep it from all of Bingley's relatives due to the same wish Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, namely the wish for Bingley's relatives to be his relatives.</t4633> <t4634>Of course, he had made such a plan; although it might not have had an effect on his effort to separate Bingley from Miss Bennet, it could have contributed to his concern for his friend's well-being.</t4634>
<t4635>Elizabeth quickly calmed her excitement with her careful demeanor; Georgiana, who was disappointed and bored, gradually recovered as Miss Bingley did not dare to approach Wickham any further, but of course, she could not speak to anyone for a while.</t4635> <t4636>Her brother, whose eyes she was afraid to meet, did not seem to remember her involvement in the matter; the words designed to distract his mind from Elizabeth seemed to fix his mind on Elizabeth even more and with more joy.</t4636>
<t4637>After the question-and-answer session described above, their visit did not last long; while Mr. Darcy accompanied them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting by criticizing Elizabeth's personality, behavior, and attire.</t4637> <t4638>But Georgiana did not join her.</t4638> <t4639>Her brother's admiration was enough to win her heart: her brother could not be mistaken; he had spoken of Elizabeth in such terms that Georgiana had no choice but to find her beautiful and amiable.</t4639> <t4640>When Darcy returned to the drawing room, Miss Bingley could not help but share some of what she had been telling her sister with him as well.</t4640>
<t4641>"Eliza Bennet looks so ill this morning, Mr. Darcy," she exclaimed; "how much she has changed since winter; I have never seen anyone change so much in my life.</t4641> <t4642>She has become brown and coarse!</t4642> <t4643>Louisa and I were saying that we should not see her again.</t4643><t4644>"</t4644>
<t4645>Although Mr. Darcy did not like such a conversation, he contented himself with answering coldly: he had not seen any change except that she was a little tanned, –it was not a miracle for a person to get tanned when traveling in the summer.</t4645>
<t4646>"Speaking for myself," continued Miss Bingley, "I must confess that I have not seen any beauty in her.</t4646> <t4647>Her face is too thin; her skin lacks brightness; and her features are not delicate at all.</t4647> <t4648>There is no character in her nose; the lines of her nose are not even noticeable.</t4648> <t4649>Her teeth are not bad, but just average; as for her eyes, it has been said occasionally that they are beautiful, but in my opinion, there is nothing extraordinary about them.</t4649> <t4650>She has a harsh, irritable look that I do not like at all; overall, there is a careless arrogance in her demeanor that I find unbearable.</t4650><t4651>"</t4651>
<t4652>Miss Bingley had believed that Darcy admired Elizabeth, but she had not chosen a good way to ingratiate herself; however, angry people are not always smart; in the end, when Darcy appeared a bit bored, she achieved all the success she had hoped for.</t4652> <t4653>However, Darcy remained tightly silent; Miss Bingley, determined to make him talk, continued,</t4653>
<t4654>"I remember how surprised we all were when we first met her in Hertfordshire and found out she was a famous beauty; especially that one night after dinner at Netherfield, when you said, 'If she is a beauty, we might as well call her mother a scholar.'</t4654> <t4655>But later on, she seemed to have an effect on you, and if I'm not mistaken, at one point you found her beautiful.</t4655><t4656>"</t4656>
<t4657>"Yes," answered Darcy; he could no longer contain himself; "but that was only when I first met her, because for months I have thought she is one of the most beautiful women I have ever known.</t4657><t4658>"</t4658>
<t4659>Then he left, and Miss Bingley was left with the full satisfaction of having forced him to say something that caused pain to no one but herself.</t4659>
<t4660>Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked about what happened during their visit on the way back, but they did not mention the thing that particularly interested both of them.</t4660> <t4661>They talked about the appearance and behavior of everyone they saw, but they did not mention the person they paid the most attention to.</t4661> <t4662>They talked about his sister, his friends, his house, his fruits, in short, everything about him except himself; yet Elizabeth wanted to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought about him, and Mrs. Gardiner was impatient for her niece to bring up the subject.</t4662>
<t4663>Chapter IV</t4663>
<t4664>Elizabeth was very surprised when she saw that no letter had arrived from Jane upon their first arrival at Lambton; this surprise grew with each morning they spent there; but on the third morning, her concern dissipated; her sister was proven right by receiving two letters from her at the same time; one of the letters had been marked as incorrectly addressed.</t4664> <t4665>Elizabeth was not surprised by this, as Jane had written the address very illegibly.</t4665>
<t4666>They were just about to go for a walk when the letters arrived; her uncle and aunt went for a walk on their own to let her enjoy the letters in silence.</t4666> <t4667>The wrongly sent letter had to be read first; it had been written five days earlier.</t4667> <t4668>The introduction described their small parties and invitations, giving news from the village; but the second letter, dated the next day, was written in a semi-urgent manner and contained more important information.</t4668> <t4669>It said:</t4669>
<t4670>"After writing the above, my dear Lizzy, something unexpected and serious happened, but I am afraid of alarming you – believe me, we are all well.</t4670> <t4671>What I have to tell you is about poor Lydia.</t4671> <t4672>Last night at twelve, just as we were going to bed, a courier came from Colonel Forster; he reported that Lydia had gone to Scotland with one of the officers; you understand, with Wickham! – Imagine how surprised we were.</t4672> <t4673>However, Kitty did not seem so surprised.</t4673> <t4674>I am very, very sorry.</t4674> <t4675>Such an imprudent union for both sides! – But I prefer to hope for the best and think that we have misunderstood Wickham's character.</t4675> <t4676>I can easily believe that he is thoughtless and irresponsible, but this step (I think we should be glad) shows that there is no malice in him.</t4676> <t4677>At least he has not made a mercenary choice, because he knows that my father can give Lydia nothing.</t4677> <t4678>Our poor mother is very distressed.</t4678> <t4679>My father is bearing it better.</t4679> <t4680>I am so glad we did not tell them what was said about Wickham; we must forget these things ourselves too.</t4680> <t4681>They left around twelve on Saturday night, presumably, but it was not noticed until eight the next morning.</t4681> <t4682>A courier was sent immediately.</t4682> <t4683>My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.</t4683> <t4684>According to Colonel Forster, we may see him here soon.</t4684> <t4685>Lydia left a few lines for his wife, explaining her intention.</t4685> <t4686>I must stop now, because I cannot leave my mother for long.</t4686> <t4687>I fear you will not be able to read my writing, but I am not aware of what I am writing myself.</t4687><t4688>"</t4688>
<t4689>Without giving herself time to think and without knowing what she felt, Elizabeth immediately grabbed the other letter as soon as she finished this one; she opened it impatiently and read: it was written one day after the first letter.</t4689>
<t4690>"By now, my dear brother, you must have received my hastily written letter; I hope this one is more legible, but although I am not pressed for time, my mind is so unsettled that I may not be able to be coherent.</t4690> <t4691>Dear Lizzy, I don't know what to write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.</t4691> <t4692>While the idea of a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia was considered imprudent, now we are anxious to be assured that they are married, because there are many reasons to fear that they did not go to Scotland.</t4692> <t4693>Colonel Forster arrived yesterday; he had set out from Brighton the day before, just a few hours after the courier.</t4693> <t4694>According to the note Lydia wrote to Mrs. F., they were going to Gretna Green, but in the meantime, Denny said that he did not believe W. intended to go there or to marry Lydia; when this was conveyed to Colonel Forster, he immediately became alarmed and set out from B. to follow them.</t4694> <t4695>He tracked them easily as far as Clapham but could go no further; for there they had hired a carriage and dismissed the one that had brought them from Epsom.</t4695> <t4696>After that, all that is known is that they continued on the road to London.</t4696> <t4697>I don't know what to think.</t4697> <t4698>After making every possible inquiry on that side of London, Colonel F.</t4698> <t4699>came to Hertfordshire, searched for them at the toll gates and in Barnet and Hatfield, but to no avail, as no one had seen such persons pass through.</t4699> <t4700>He came to Longbourn in distress and told us what he had learned in sorrow.</t4700> <t4701>I am truly sorry for him and Mrs. F., but no one can blame them.</t4701> <t4702>Our distress, dear Lizzy, is immense.</t4702> <t4703>My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of W.</t4703> <t4704>Instead of carrying out their first plan, they may have found it more suitable for various reasons to marry secretly in town; even if Lydia, in her position, had such intentions, which is impossible, can I think Lydia would disregard everything?</t4704> <t4705>–Impossible.</t4705> <t4706>On the other hand, Colonel F.'s inclination not to believe they are married greatly distresses me; when I expressed my hopes, he shook his head and said he feared W. was not a trustworthy man.</t4706> <t4707>My poor mother is ill, confined to her room.</t4707> <t4708>It would be good for her to show herself, but we cannot expect it; as for my father, I have never seen him so upset in my life.</t4708> <t4709>Poor Kitty is blamed by everyone for keeping their companionship a secret; but what could she do, things told in confidence.</t4709> <t4710>I am truly glad, dear Lizzy, that you are not here to witness these distressing scenes; but now that we have passed the initial shock, may I confess that I wish for your return?</t4710> <t4711>However, if it is not convenient, I am not selfish enough to insist.</t4711> <t4712>Goodbye.</t4712> <t4713>I have taken up my pen again to do what I just said I would not, but the circumstances are such that I cannot help it, I beg you all to come here as soon as possible.</t4713> <t4714>Knowing my dear uncle and aunt well, I am not hesitant to make this request, but there is one more thing I ask of them.</t4714> <t4715>My father is going to London immediately with Colonel Forster to search for them.</t4715> <t4716>I do not know what he intends to do; but his extreme distress will not allow him to conduct any business properly and safely; Colonel Forster must return to Brighton by tomorrow evening.</t4716> <t4717>In such an urgent situation, my uncle's advice and assistance would be most beneficial; he will immediately understand what I feel; I rely on his compassion.</t4717><t4718>"</t4718>
<t4719>"Uncle, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, leaping up from her seat like an arrow to follow him after finishing the letter, so as not to waste any precious time; but just as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant and Mr. Darcy appeared.</t4719> <t4720>Elizabeth's pale face and anxious demeanor surprised him; before she could gather herself enough to speak, Elizabeth, with Lydia's situation foremost in her mind, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.</t4720> <t4721>I need to find Mr. Gardiner immediately, it's an urgent matter; I can't afford to lose a moment.</t4721><t4722>"</t4722>
<t4723>"My God! What is the matter?" cried Darcy, more in excitement than politeness; then composing himself, "I won't keep you for even a moment, but let me call them, or let the servant call them.</t4723> <t4724>You are not well; you cannot go by yourself.</t4724><t4725>"</t4725>
<t4726>Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees were trembling, and she felt how futile it would be to try to follow them.</t4726> <t4727>Upon this, she called back the servant and told him, in a voice almost unintelligible from breathlessness, to bring his master and mistress home immediately.</t4727>
<t4728>When the servant left the room, Elizabeth sat down; she couldn't stand; she looked so terribly ill that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her; in a gentle and warm voice, he said, "Shall I call your maid?</t4728> <t4729>Is there any medicine you can take, something to ease you?</t4729> <t4730>–How about some wine –shall I bring you some wine?</t4730> <t4731>–You look very ill," he said.</t4731>
<t4732>"No, thank you;" replied Elizabeth, trying to pull herself together.</t4732> <t4733>"There is nothing wrong with me.</t4733> <t4734>I am perfectly fine.</t4734> <t4735>I am just distressed by some terrible news I have just received from Longbourn.</t4735><t4736>"</t4736>
<t4737>When she mentioned the issue, she burst into tears and couldn't say a word for several minutes.</t4737> <t4738>Darcy, filled with anxious curiosity, could barely express his concern and watched her in a silence full of pity.</t4738> <t4739>Finally, Elizabeth spoke again.</t4739> <t4740>"I just received a letter from Jane, bringing terrible news.</t4740> <t4741>It's not something that can be hidden from anyone.</t4741> <t4742>My youngest sister has abandoned all her friends – she has run away; she has thrown herself into the hands of that – that – Mr. Wickham.</t4742> <t4743>They have eloped from Brighton together.</t4743> <t4744>You know him well enough to have no doubt about the rest.</t4744> <t4745>My sister has no money, no relatives, nothing to make him marry her – the poor girl is ruined forever.</t4745><t4746>"</t4746>
<t4747>Darcy was frozen in place with astonishment.</t4747> <t4748>"To think that I could have prevented it!" Elizabeth continued in an even more excited voice, "I knew who he was.</t4748> <t4749>If I had explained even a part of it to my family – even a part of what I knew!</t4749> <t4750>If they had known his character, none of this would have happened.</t4750> <t4751>But now it's too late, too late for everything.</t4751><t4752>"</t4752>
<t4753>"I'm very sorry, truly," cried Darcy; "I'm sorry – I'm shocked.</t4753> <t4754>But is it certain?</t4754><t4755>"</t4755>
<t4756>"Ah yes! –They went to Brighton together on Sunday night; they were tracked as far as London, but no further; clearly, they did not go to Scotland.</t4756><t4757>"</t4757>
<t4758>"So, what did they do to find it?"</t4758><t4759>"</t4759>
<t4760>"My father has gone to London; Jane also wrote a letter asking for my uncle's help; we will leave within half an hour, I hope.</t4760> <t4761>But there is nothing to be done; I know, there isn't.</t4761> <t4762>How can such a man be persuaded?</t4762> <t4763>How will we find them?</t4763> <t4764>I have no hope.</t4764> <t4765>It's dreadful in every way!"</t4765>
<t4766>Darcy nodded in silent approval.</t4766>
<t4767>"When I saw his true face.</t4767> <t4768>–Ah! If only I knew what I should do, what I could dare!</t4768> <t4769>I didn't know –I was afraid to move forward.</t4769> <t4770>What a miserable mistake I made!</t4770><t4771>"</t4771>
<t4772>Darcy did not respond.</t4772> <t4773>He seemed not to hear Elizabeth; he was pacing up and down the room in deep thought, his brows furrowed, his expression gloomy.</t4773> <t4774>Elizabeth saw this shortly and immediately understood it.</t4774> <t4775>Her influence over Darcy was ending; in the face of such proof of family weakness, in the face of such deep shame, everything would be over.</t4775> <t4776>She could neither be surprised nor angry; the belief that Darcy would distance himself despite his feelings did not console her, did not alleviate her distress.</t4776> <t4777>On the contrary, everything seemed calculated to make her understand her own desires; she had never felt as deeply as she did now that she could love Darcy, as much as she did in that moment when love seemed so empty.</t4777>
<t4778>But even though her own troubles intervened, they could not completely occupy her.</t4778> <t4779>The disgrace and shame that Lydia brought upon her entire family soon erased her personal worries; Elizabeth covered her face with a handkerchief and soon forgot everything else; after a few minutes of silence, her friend's voice brought her back to the present moment, with a kind but measured tone saying: "I fear you have wanted me to leave for some time now; I have no excuse for my continued presence here other than my genuine but futile concern.</t4779> <t4780>I wish there was something I could do or say to alleviate your distress.</t4780> <t4781>–But I will not burden you with empty wishes that might seem like I am expecting your gratitude.</t4781> <t4782>This unfortunate matter, I fear, will deprive my sister of the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley today.</t4782><t4783>"</t4783>
<t4784>"Ah yes.</t4784> <t4785>Please convey my apologies to Miss Darcy.</t4785> <t4786>Tell her that an urgent matter requires us to return home immediately.</t4786> <t4787>Please conceal the distressing truth as much as possible.</t4787> <t4788>–Now, as far as it goes.</t4788><t4789>"</t4789>
<t4790>Darcy assured her that he would keep it a secret – he repeated how sorry he was for her distress, wished for a happier ending than currently seemed possible, left his regards to her relatives, and with one serious, parting glance, he left.</t4790>
<t4791>As she left the room, Elizabeth felt how impossible it was for them to see each other again with the same warmth that had enveloped their few meetings in Derbyshire; looking back at the entirety of their relationship, filled with contrasts and changes, she now felt sorrow as she realized that the feelings which would now desire the continuation of the relationship had replaced the feelings that were once satisfied with its end.</t4791>
<t4792>If gratitude and respect are the solid foundations of love, then Elizabeth's change of feelings would be neither impossible nor wrong.</t4792> <t4793>But if the opposite is true, if the admiration arising from these sources remains irrational or unnatural compared to what is said to arise at first sight and even without a word being exchanged, then, except for the fact that her interest in Wickham was tested by the subsequent method and its failure justified her beginning to follow another, less interesting attachment, nothing can be said to defend Elizabeth.</t4793> <t4794>Even so, she saw his departure with sadness; and in this first instance of the disgrace brought by Lydia's notoriety, Elizabeth found a separate source of pain while contemplating that miserable incident.</t4794> <t4795>Since reading Jane's second letter, she had never hoped that Wickham intended to marry Lydia.</t4795> <t4796>No one but Jane, she thought, could entertain such an expectation.</t4796> <t4797>The least she felt in this development was surprise.</t4797> <t4798>As long as the content of the first letter remained in her mind, she was in a state of astonishment – astonishment at Wickham marrying a girl he couldn't marry for money; how Lydia could have become attached to him seemed incomprehensible.</t4798> <t4799>But now it all seemed quite natural.</t4799> <t4800>Lydia might have had enough charm for such an attachment; although she did not think Lydia had deliberately run away without the thought of marriage, she found it easy to believe that neither a sense of honor nor understanding would be enough to prevent her from becoming an easy prey.</t4800>
<t4801>While Alay was in Hertfordshire, he had never noticed that Lydia was interested in him, but he knew that Lydia only needed a face to feel attached to anyone.</t4801> <t4802>At one time, she was the favorite of one officer, at another time, the favorite of another officer, depending on the attention she received from them.</t4802> <t4803>Her feelings were constantly in a state of fluctuation but never had any specific targets.</t4803> <t4804>The harm done to such a girl by neglect and indulgence.</t4804> <t4805>–How sharply she felt it now!</t4805>
<t4806>She was writhing to be at home –now to hear, see, and share all the worries that had entirely fallen on Jane's shoulders, in such a scattered family, no father, a mother incapable of showing herself and constantly in need of care; although she almost believed that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's intervention seemed of vital importance; the pain of her impatience was quite intense until her uncle entered the room.</t4806> <t4807>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had returned in a hurry, assuming from the servant's statement that their niece had suddenly fallen ill; –but she reassured them on that account and explained the reason for their urgent summons, reading both letters aloud with trembling energy and emphasizing the note in the second one.</t4807> <t4808>–Although Lydia was not their favorite niece, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner couldn't help but feel deep sorrow.</t4808> <t4809>The matter concerned not just Lydia, but everyone; after the initial cries of shock and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised to do all he could to help.</t4809> <t4810>–Elizabeth thanked him with tears of gratitude, although she expected no less; since all three were in the same state of mind, all the travel details were quickly settled.</t4810> <t4811>They would set out at the first opportunity.</t4811> <t4812>"But what about Pemberley?" cried Mrs. Gardiner.</t4812> <t4813>"When John called us, he said Mr. Darcy was here; –was he here?</t4813><t4814>"</t4814>
<t4815>"Yes; I told him that we wouldn't be able to keep our promise.</t4815> <t4816>Everything is settled.</t4816><t4817>"</t4817>
<t4818>"Everything is taken care of," repeated the other, darting to their room to get ready.</t4818> <t4819>"I wonder if they are close enough to reveal the truth!</t4819> <t4820>Oh, I wish I knew!</t4820><t4821>"</t4821>
<t4822>It was not a time for wishes; or if there were any, they would only serve to distract her in the rush and hurry of the next hour.</t4822> <t4823>If Elizabeth had the chance to be idle, she would believe that it was impossible for someone as miserable as herself to engage in any activity, but she had as much work to do as her aunt; it fell to her to write notes to all their friends in Lambton, making up false excuses for their sudden departure.</t4823> <t4824>Yet within an hour, all the work was completed; in the meantime, Mr. Gardiner settled the inn's account and there was nothing left to do but leave.</t4824> <t4825>After all the morning's misery, Elizabeth found herself settled in the carriage and on the way to Longbourn sooner than she had expected.</t4825>
<t4826>Chapter V</t4826>
<t4827>"I keep thinking about it, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they moved away from the town; "and the more I think, the more inclined I am to view the matter as your sister does.</t4827> <t4828>It seems highly unlikely to me that a young man would make such a plan against a girl who is not unprotected, not without guardians, and who is a guest of his colonel's family; so much so that I am inclined to hope for the best outcome.</t4828> <t4829>Can this young man expect that the girl's relatives will not emerge?</t4829> <t4830>Can he expect to be accepted into the regiment after such an insult to Colonel Forster?</t4830> <t4831>The reasons do not outweigh the risks.</t4831><t4832>"</t4832>
<t4833>"Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, coming to life for a moment.</t4833>
<t4834>"Absolutely," said Mrs. Gardiner, "I am beginning to think like your uncle.</t4834> <t4835>He cannot risk being guilty of such a great abuse in so many matters of decorum, honor, and profession.</t4835> <t4836>I cannot think so badly of Wickham.</t4836> <t4837>Have you, yourself, Lizzy, lost hope in him enough to think he could do this?</t4837><t4838>"</t4838>
<t4839>"Maybe not to the extent of thinking he neglected his own interests.</t4839> <t4840>But I expect every other kind of neglect from him.</t4840> <t4841>What if it is so! I hope it isn't.</t4841> <t4842>Then why didn't they go to Scotland?</t4842><t4843>"</t4843>
<t4844>"For one thing," replied Mr. Gardiner, "there is no definite proof that they did not go to Scotland.</t4844><t4845>"</t4845>
<t4846>"But that means they switched to the city car!</t4846> <t4847>Besides, no traces of them were found on Barnet Road.</t4847><t4848>"</t4848>
<t4849>"Alright – let's assume they are in London.</t4849> <t4850>They might be there to hide, but there can't be any other exceptional reason.</t4850> <t4851>It's unlikely that both sides are swimming in money; they might have thought that getting married in London would be more economical, if not more urgent, than in Scotland.</t4851><t4852>"</t4852>
<t4853>"But why this secrecy?</t4853> <t4854>Why are they afraid of being found?</t4854> <t4855>Why must their marriage be secret?</t4855> <t4856>Oh! No, no, it's not possible.</t4856> <t4857>From what Jane told us, we saw that his closest friend says he has no intention of marrying her.</t4857> <t4858>Wickham would never marry a woman without money.</t4858> <t4859>His means do not allow it.</t4859> <t4860>But what does Lydia have, besides youth, health, and cheerfulness, that would make him ruin his chance of a good marriage for her sake?</t4860> <t4861>I don't know how the fear of losing reputation in the army could prevent him from eloping so disgracefully with Lydia; because I know nothing about the consequences of such a step.</t4861> <t4862>But as for your other objection, I'm not sure it will work.</t4862> <t4863>Lydia has no brothers to come forward; and Wickham might have concluded from my father's behavior, his laziness, and his apparent indifference to what happens in his family, that he would not trouble himself like any other father would in such a matter.</t4863><t4864>"</t4864>
<t4865>"But can you imagine that Lydia is so blindly in love that she would agree to live a life outside of marriage, not seeing anything else?</t4865><t4866>"</t4866>
<t4867>"It appears, quite bitterly," replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that one must accept that a sister's sense of virtue and honor is questionable at such a point.</t4867> <t4868>But I really don't know what to say.</t4868> <t4869>Perhaps I am not being fair to her.</t4869> <t4870>But she is very young; she was not taught to think about serious matters; for the last six months, even a year, she has been encouraged in nothing but pleasure and display.</t4870> <t4871>She was allowed to spend her time in the most idle and superficial manner, adopting every idea that came her way.</t4871> <t4872>Since the --------shire regiment settled in Meryton, nothing has occupied her mind but love, flirtation, and officers.</t4872> <t4873>She did everything she could to, how shall I say, further inflame her already lively feelings by thinking and talking about this subject.</t4873> <t4874>And we all know that Wickham's appearance and speech possess every charm to captivate a woman.</t4874><t4875>"</t4875>
<t4876>"But you see," said her aunt, "she doesn't think so badly of Jane Wickham, she doesn't believe she would attempt such a thing.</t4876><t4877>"</t4877>
<t4878>"Who would Jane think badly of?</t4878> <t4879>No matter what his past behavior was, who does she believe could attempt such a thing, until events prove otherwise?</t4879> <t4880>But Jane knows as well as I do what Wickham really is.</t4880> <t4881>We both know that he is a bad person in every sense of the word.</t4881> <t4882>That he knows neither honor nor integrity.</t4882> <t4883>That he is as deceitful as he is a liar and a fraud.</t4883><t4884>"</t4884>
<t4885>"Do you really know all this?" cried Mrs. Gardiner; her curiosity about where this information came from was thoroughly aroused.</t4885>
<t4886>"Of course I know," replied Elizabeth, blushing.</t4886> <t4887>"The other day I told you about the villainy he did to Mr. Darcy; you yourself heard how he spoke about the man who treated him so patiently and generously when he last came to Longbourn.</t4887> <t4888>There are also other incidents that I am not authorized to tell – I mean, not worth mentioning; but his lies about the entire Pemberley family are countless.</t4888> <t4889>From what he said about Miss Darcy, I was prepared to see a proud, cold, unpleasant girl.</t4889> <t4890>But he knew very well that the opposite was true.</t4890> <t4891>He knew that she was a pleasant and unassuming girl, as we found her to be.</t4891><t4892>"</t4892>
<t4893>"But doesn't Lydia know these things?"</t4893> <t4894>"How could she not know the things that you and Jane seem to know so well?"</t4894><t4895>"</t4895>
<t4896>"Ah yes! –and that's the worst part of it anyway.</t4896> <t4897>Until I went to Kent and got to know Mr. Darcy and his cousin Colonel Fitzwilliam well, I didn't know the truth either.</t4897> <t4898>When I returned home, the --------shire regiment was about to leave within a week or two.</t4898> <t4899>Given the situation, neither Jane nor I felt it necessary to explain these things to everyone; because what good would it do to shatter the positive opinions the whole community had of him? Even when it was decided that Lydia would go with Mrs. Forster, it didn't occur to me to warn her about his true nature.</t4899> <t4900>I never considered the possibility that she could be in danger of being deceived.</t4900> <t4901>Believe me, the thought of such an outcome never even crossed my mind.</t4901><t4902>"</t4902>
<t4903>"When they all went to Brighton together, there was no reason for you to think that they were interested in each other.</t4903><t4904>"</t4904>
<t4905>"There was no reason at all.</t4905> <t4906>I saw no sign of any intimacy on either side; you know that if I had sensed the slightest thing, our family is not one to overlook such matters.</t4906> <t4907>When Wickham first joined the regiment, Lydia was quite ready to admire him; but so were we all.</t4907> <t4908>Every girl in Meryton and the surrounding area was crazy about him for the first two months; but he showed no special interest in Lydia; eventually, after a brief period of exaggerated and wild admiration, she stopped dreaming about Wickham and began to occupy herself with other officers who paid her more attention.</t4908><t4909>"</t4909>
<t4910>-------------------------------</t4910>
<t4911>Although it could easily be anticipated that nothing new could be added by repeatedly talking about their fears, hopes, and wishes on this important matter, no other topic could distract them from it for long throughout the entire journey.</t4911> <t4912>It never left Elizabeth's thoughts.</t4912> <t4913>It had firmly settled there with all its torment and pangs of conscience, not allowing her a moment's peace or forgetfulness.</t4913>
<t4914>They traveled as fast as they could; they slept on the road one night and reached Longbourn the next day at mealtime.</t4914> <t4915>It comforted Elizabeth to think that Jane had not kept her eyes on the road for a long time.</t4915>
<t4916>When they saw the car, the little Gardiners, who had eagerly climbed the steps as the car entered the lawn, were waiting; as the car approached the door, the joyful astonishment that lit up their faces and spread through their entire bodies, making them jump and bounce, was the first sign of the excitement caused by their arrival.</t4916>
<t4917>Elizabeth rushed outside; after hastily kissing each one, she darted to the hall; Jane came running out of her mother's room and immediately greeted her.</t4917>
<t4918>As Elizabeth embraced him with love, while tears filled both of their eyes, she asked without losing a moment if there was any news about the fugitives.</t4918>
<t4919>"Not yet," Jane replied.</t4919> <t4920>"But now that my uncle is here, I hope everything will be alright."</t4920><t4921>"</t4921>
<t4922>"Is my father in the city?</t4922><t4923>"</t4923>
<t4924>"Yes, he went on Tuesday, while I was writing you a letter.</t4924><t4925>"</t4925>
<t4926>"Have you heard from him often?"</t4926><t4927>"</t4927>
<t4928>"I received it once.</t4928> <t4929>He wrote a few lines on Wednesday, saying he arrived safely, and gave his address, which I had specifically requested.</t4929> <t4930>He said he wouldn't write again unless he had something important to say.</t4930><t4931>"</t4931>
<t4932>"And my mother – How is she?</t4932> <t4933>How are you all?</t4933><t4934>"</t4934>
<t4935>"My mother is doing fairly well; her morale is very low though.</t4935> <t4936>She is upstairs; she will be happy to see you.</t4936> <t4937>She hasn't come out of her room yet.</t4937> <t4938>Mary and Kitty, thank goodness, are very well.</t4938><t4939>"</t4939>
<t4940>"Well, you – How are you?" cried Elizabeth.</t4940> <t4941>"You look pale.</t4941> <t4942>Who knows what you've been through!</t4942><t4943>"</t4943>
<t4944>However, her sister assured her that she was quite well; the conversation that was taking place among them ended as Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were occupied with their children and all approached together.</t4944> <t4945>Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, greeted them, and oscillating between tears and smiles, thanked them both.</t4945>
<t4946>When they gathered in the living room, the questions Elizabeth asked were naturally repeated by the others, and they saw that Jane had no news to share.</t4946> <t4947>Nevertheless, the hope inspired by the innocence in her heart had not yet abandoned her; she still hoped that everything would end well, that every morning would bring a letter either from Lydia or her father explaining what had happened and perhaps announcing the marriage.</t4947>
<t4948>After talking privately for a few minutes, they went up to Mrs. Bennet's room, where she received them exactly as expected: with tears of regret and pleas, curses directed at Wickham's vile behavior, complaints about her own suffering and misfortune, and blaming everyone except the one responsible for the neglect that was the main cause of her daughter's mistakes.</t4948>
<t4949>"If only I could," she said, "if I had carried out my plan to go to Brighton with my whole family, none of this would have happened; but there was no one to keep an eye on poor Lydia.</t4949> <t4950>Why did the Forsters take their eyes off her?</t4950> <t4951>I think they must have been greatly negligent in some way or another, otherwise Lydia is not the kind of girl to do such a thing; they did not keep a good eye on her, that's why this happened.</t4951> <t4952>I always knew they were not capable of taking responsibility for her, but who listens to me, when did they ever listen anyway.</t4952> <t4953>Oh, my poor girl! Now Mr. Bennet has gone; I know he will fight Wickham when he sees him, then he will be killed, and what will happen to us then?</t4953> <t4954>The Collinses will throw us out of the house before his body is even cold in the grave; if you don't reach out to us, brother, God knows what will become of us.</t4954><t4955>"</t4955>
<t4956>They all objected to such pessimistic thoughts in unison; after Mr. Gardiner expressed how fond he was of her and her entire family, he mentioned that he was considering going to London the next day and would assist Mr. Bennet in every way to find Lydia.</t4956>
<t4957>"Don't panic unnecessarily," he added, "it's right to be prepared for the worst, but there's no point in seeing it as a done deal.</t4957> <t4958>It hasn't even been a week since they left Brighton.</t4958> <t4959>Let's wait a few more days, we'll hear from them; until we learn that they haven't married and aren't planning to marry, let's not consider the matter lost.</t4959> <t4960>As soon as I get to the city, I'll find my uncle, take him to Gracechurch Street, to our house; then we'll sit down and discuss what we should do.</t4960><t4961>"</t4961>
<t4962>"Ah my dear brother," replied Mrs. Bennet, "I was just saying the same thing.</t4962> <t4963>When you go to the city, find them, wherever they are; if they haven't married, make them marry.</t4963> <t4964>They shouldn't wait for wedding dresses or anything; tell Lydia to just get married first, and then we can buy whatever dress she wants, no matter the cost.</t4964> <t4965>But most importantly, don't involve Mr. Bennet in any fights.</t4965> <t4966>Tell him how terribly I am, –say that I've lost my mind from fear, that I'm trembling, having convulsions, suffering from chest pains, headaches, my heart is pounding, and I'm in such a state that I have neither night nor day.</t4966> <t4967>Also tell my sweet Lydia not to get into the matter of clothes until she sees me because she doesn't know which shop is good.</t4967> <t4968>Oh brother, how kind you are!</t4968> <t4969>You can handle all of this.</t4969><t4970>"</t4970>
<t4971>Although Mr. Gardiner expressed that he would do his best for that purpose, he could not refrain from advising him to be moderate in both his fears and hopes; after talking to him in this way until dinner was served, they left his side so that he could vent all his emotions to the butler who had taken over his daughter's duties in her absence.</t4971>
<t4972>His brother and sister-in-law thought there was no reason to hide it from the family, but they did not try to oppose it either, because they knew he did not have the common sense to hold his tongue in front of the servants while waiting at the table, and they decided that it would be appropriate for just one person among the servants, the one they trusted the most, to witness his fears and concerns about the matter.</t4972>
<t4973>Mary and Kitty, who had been too busy to appear earlier in their own rooms, joined them in the dining room.</t4973> <t4974>One came from her books, the other from her dressing table.</t4974> <t4975>Both of their faces were quite calm; apart from the loss of their beloved sister or the unusual annoyance in Kitty's manner of speaking caused by the anger she had gathered because of it, there was no visible change.</t4975> <t4976>As for Mary, she was composed enough to whisper to Elizabeth with a face full of serious thought right after sitting at the table,</t4976>
<t4977>"A very unfortunate situation; it will probably be talked about a lot.</t4977> <t4978>But we must stop the winds of evil and apply the balm of brotherhood's consolation to each other's wounded chests.</t4978><t4979>"</t4979>
<t4980>Then, seeing that Elizabeth had no intention of replying, he added, "Although it is a grievous incident for Lydia, we must derive a useful lesson from it; a woman's loss of honor is irreparable – a single misstep can darken a woman's world – a woman's virtue is as beautiful as it is fragile – her behavior towards the worthless members of the opposite sex can never be too cautious."</t4980><t4981>"</t4981>
<t4982>Elizabeth raised her eyes in astonishment, but she was too distressed to respond.</t4982> <t4983>Nevertheless, Mary continued to occupy herself with making such moral inferences from the disaster ahead of them.</t4983>
<t4984>In the afternoon, the two eldest Miss Bennets managed to stay alone together for about half an hour; Elizabeth seized the opportunity and immediately asked many questions, and Jane answered with equal eagerness.</t4984> <t4985>According to Elizabeth, the only certain thing about this event was the dreadful conclusion that Miss Bennet could not quite deny as impossible. After lamenting over it together, Elizabeth continued: "Tell me everything about this that I haven't heard yet, one by one.</t4985> <t4986>Give me more details.</t4986> <t4987>What did Colonel Forster say?</t4987> <t4988>Didn't they notice anything before they ran away?</t4988> <t4989>They must have seen the two of them together all the time.</t4989><t4990>"</t4990>
<t4991>"Colonel Forster admitted that he often suspected from close proximity, especially regarding Lydia, but nothing had happened to alarm him.</t4991> <t4992>I felt very sorry for him.</t4992> <t4993>He behaved extremely close and concerned.</t4993> <t4994>He was coming to us to make sure of his interest before the idea that they hadn't gone to Scotland occurred to him, and that idea hastened his journey.</t4994><t4995>"</t4995>
<t4996>"So, you believe that Denny will not marry Wickham?</t4996> <t4997>Did he know that they were planning to elope?</t4997> <t4998>Did Colonel Forster see Denny himself?</t4998><t4999>"</t4999>
<t5000>"Yes; but when questioned, Denny denied knowing about the plans and did not reveal his true opinion on the matter.</t5000> <t5001>He did not repeat that he thought they would not marry – from this, I hope that he might have been previously misunderstood.</t5001><t5002>"</t5002>
<t5003>"Until Colonel Forster came in person, none of you really doubted that they would get married, did you?</t5003><t5004>"</t5004>
<t5005>"But how could such a thing even cross our minds!</t5005> <t5006>I was a bit uneasy – I was slightly afraid that she would marry him and be unhappy, because I knew that the man's behavior was not always proper.</t5006> <t5007>My parents didn't know this; they just thought it was an imprudent marriage.</t5007> <t5008>Then Kitty, with the rightful pride of knowing more than us, confessed in Lydia's last letter that she was preparing to take such a step.</t5008> <t5009>Apparently, she knew they had been in love for weeks.</t5009><t5010>"</t5010>
<t5011>"Not until I go to Brighton."</t5011><t5012>"</t5012>
<t5013>"No, I don't think so.</t5013><t5014>"</t5014>
<t5015>"Was Colonel Forster blaming Wickham?</t5015> <t5016>Does he know his true character?</t5016><t5017>"</t5017>
<t5018>"I must admit that I do not speak as well of Wickham as I used to.</t5018> <t5019>He is believed to be indifferent and frivolous.</t5019> <t5020>It is said that he left a lot of debt when he departed from Meryton since that unfortunate incident, but I hope it is not true.</t5020><t5021>"</t5021>
<t5022>"Ah Jane, if we had kept fewer secrets and told you what we knew about you, none of this might have happened.</t5022><t5023>"</t5023>
<t5024>"Maybe it would have been better," her sister replied.</t5024> <t5025>"But it might seem unjust to reveal a person's past mistakes without knowing their current feelings.</t5025> <t5026>We acted with good intentions.</t5026><t5027>"</t5027>
<t5028>"Did Colonel Forster explain the details of the letter he wrote to Lydia's wife?"</t5028><t5029>"</t5029>
<t5030>"He brought it along so we could see."</t5030><t5031>"</t5031>
<t5032>Jane took the letter out of her notebook and gave it to Elizabeth.</t5032> <t5033>The content of the letter was as follows:</t5033>
<t5034>"Dear Harriet,</t5034>
<t5035>When you learn that I have gone, you will laugh; I cannot help but laugh myself when I think of how surprised you will be when you cannot find me tomorrow.</t5035> <t5036>I am going to Gretna Green; if you cannot guess with whom, I will call you a fool, because there is only one man in the world that I love, and he is an angel.</t5036> <t5037>I can never be happy without him, so I see no harm in going.</t5037> <t5038>You need not inform those at Longbourn of my departure, if you do not wish to, because the surprise will be greater when I write to them and sign my name as Lydia Wickham.</t5038> <t5039>What a delightful joke it will be!</t5039> <t5040>I cannot write for laughing.</t5040> <t5041>Please make up something for Pratt on my behalf, as I cannot go to the dance with him tonight.</t5041> <t5042>Say that I hope he will forgive me when he learns everything, and also say that I will dance with him with great pleasure at the first ball when we meet again.</t5042> <t5043>When I go to Longbourn, I will send for my clothes; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend the large tear in my embroidered muslin dress before it is packed.</t5043> <t5044>Goodbye.</t5044> <t5045>Give my love to Colonel Forster; I hope you will raise a glass to wish us a good journey.</t5045>
<t5046>Your friend who loves you,</t5046>
<t5047>Lydia Bennet.</t5047><t5048>"</t5048>
<t5049>"Oh, foolish, foolish Lydia!" cried Elizabeth as she finished the letter.</t5049> <t5050>What a letter, to be written at such a time.</t5050> <t5051>But at least it shows she was serious about the journey.</t5051> <t5052>Whatever Wickham convinced her of later, Lydia did not have an immoral plan in mind.</t5052> <t5053>Poor father!</t5053> <t5054>Who knows how terrible he must feel!</t5054><t5055>"</t5055>
<t5056>"I have never seen anyone so shaken in my life.</t5056> <t5057>He couldn't say a single word for ten whole minutes.</t5057> <t5058>My mother immediately fainted, and the whole house was in chaos in an instant!</t5058><t5059>"</t5059>
<t5060>"Ah Jane," cried Elizabeth, "there is not a single servant left at home who hasn't learned the whole story by evening.</t5060><t5061>"</t5061>
<t5062>"I don't know.</t5062> <t5063>–I hope there is some left.</t5063> <t5064>–But it's very difficult to be cautious in such times.</t5064> <t5065>My mother had a nervous breakdown, and although I tried to help her in every way I could, I'm afraid I didn't do everything I could!</t5065> <t5066>But the horror of thinking about the worst possibilities also left me powerless.</t5066><t5067>"</t5067>
<t5068>"Taking care of her must have been very hard on you.</t5068> <t5069>You don't look well.</t5069> <t5070>I wish I could have been there; you carried all the worry and fatigue alone.</t5070><t5071>"</t5071>
<t5072>"Mary and Kitty were very understanding; they would share every fatigue, I'm sure, but I thought it wouldn't be right for them.</t5072> <t5073>Kitty is weak and delicate, and Mary reads too much, I didn't want their rest hours to be interrupted.</t5073> <t5074>After my father left, on Tuesday my Aunt Philips came to Longbourn; bless her, she stayed with me until Thursday.</t5074> <t5075>She was very helpful, she relieved us all a lot; Lady Lucas was also very kind, she walked here on Wednesday morning to comfort us, offering her and her daughters' help, in case there was anything they could do.</t5075><t5076>"</t5076>
<t5077>"I wish she had stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "she may have good intentions, but in the face of such misfortune, the less one sees their neighbors, the better.</t5077> <t5078>Helping is impossible, comforting is unbearable.</t5078> <t5079>Let them enjoy and be satisfied from afar.</t5079><t5080>"</t5080>
<t5081>Afterwards, he asked what kind of methods his father intended to follow in the city to find his daughter.</t5081>
<t5082>"I think his intention," Jane replied, "was to go to Epsom; they last changed horses there; he was going to see the drivers, to see if he could learn anything from them.</t5082> <t5083>His main goal was to find out the number of the carriage that brought them from Clapham.</t5083> <t5084>They had come from London with a passenger fare, and my father thought a lady and a gentleman changing carriages might have drawn attention, so he was going to investigate in Clapham.</t5084> <t5085>If he could find out in front of which house the driver dropped off the passengers, he would investigate there; he hoped it wouldn't be impossible to find the carriage's stand and number.</t5085> <t5086>I don't know what else he had in mind: but he was in such a hurry and so upset when he left that I could barely learn this much.</t5086><t5087>"</t5087>
<t5088>Chapter VI</t5088>
<t5089>The next morning, they all expected to receive a letter from Mr. Bennet; the mail arrived, but it did not bring a single line from him.</t5089> <t5090>The family knew that he was normally a negligent and lazy letter writer, but they hoped he would make some effort at such a time.</t5090> <t5091>They concluded that he had no good news to send, but they would have preferred to be certain even of that.</t5091> <t5092>Mr. Gardiner had only waited for the letters before setting off.</t5092>
<t5093>When he left, they knew at least they would receive regular updates about what was happening; their uncle, upon leaving, promised to persuade Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as possible, which greatly relieved his sister, who saw this as the only way to ensure her husband wouldn't die in the duel.</t5093>
<t5094>Mrs. Gardiner was going to stay in Hertfordshire for a few more days with the children, thinking that her presence might be beneficial to her nieces.</t5094> <t5095>While keeping an eye on Mrs. Bennet, she shared the burden of her nieces and greatly relieved them during their free hours.</t5095> <t5096>Their aunt also frequently visited them; according to her, she always came with the intention of cheering them up and encouraging them, but each time she brought some fresh news about Wickham's roguishness or mischief, leaving them more disheartened than she found them.</t5096>
<t5097>It seemed like all of Meryton was scrambling to defame the man, who just three months ago was regarded as an angel.</t5097> <t5098>It was said that he owed money to every tradesman in town, and his attempts, honored with the title of seduction, had extended to every tradesman's family.</t5098> <t5099>Everyone was saying he was the vilest man in the world, and everyone was beginning to realize that they had never trusted his appearance anyway.</t5099> <t5100>Even though Elizabeth did not believe more than half of what was said, she believed enough to further strengthen her conviction that her sister was ruined; even Jane, who believed even less of it, almost fell into despair, especially since the time had come when they should have heard from them if they had gone to Scotland, something she had never completely given up hope on before.</t5100>
<t5101>Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him, saying that he had found his brother-in-law as soon as he arrived and had persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street.</t5101> <t5102>Mr. Bennet had gone to Epsom and Clapham before his arrival but had not obtained any satisfactory information; he was now determined to search the principal hotels in the city, as Mr. Bennet thought they might have stayed at a hotel before renting an apartment upon arriving in London.</t5102> <t5103>Mr. Gardiner did not expect success from this endeavor on his own behalf, but he intended to help his brother-in-law because he was eager.</t5103> <t5104>He also added that Mr. Bennet did not seem inclined to leave London at the moment and promised to write again very soon.</t5104> <t5105>A note was also appended to the letter.</t5105>
<t5106>"I wrote to Colonel Forster and asked him to find out, if possible, whether there are any relatives or close friends in the regiment who might know where Wickham is hiding in the city.</t5106> <t5107>If there are such people who can be approached and provide a clue in this direction, it could be very useful.</t5107> <t5108>We still have nothing to guide us.</t5108> <t5109>I believe Colonel Forster will do his utmost to satisfy us on this matter.</t5109> <t5110>But, I think, maybe Lizzy can tell us better than anyone else which relatives he has alive.</t5110><t5111>"</t5111>
<t5112>Elizabeth was not surprised when she understood the reason her knowledge was sought; but she was not able to provide the information that the compliment deserved.</t5112>
<t5113>He had not heard of any relatives other than his father and mother, both of whom had died years ago.</t5113> <t5114>However, it was possible that some of his friends in the --------shire regiment could provide more information; he did not expect anything to come of it, but he was still curious about the response he would receive.</t5114>
<t5115>Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each day was the time when the mail was expected.</t5115> <t5116>The arrival of letters was the first great object of impatience every morning.</t5116> <t5117>Whatever good or bad there was to be told was conveyed through letters, and each succeeding day was expected to bring important news.</t5117>
<t5118>However, before they could hear back from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived from Mr. Collins to their father; since Jane had been instructed to open everything that came in her absence, she read the letter; knowing how peculiar his letters always were, Elizabeth read it over her sister's shoulder.</t5118> <t5119>It said:</t5119>
<t5120>"Dear Sir,</t5120>
<t5121>Due to our relationship and my position in life, I consider it my duty to console you in light of the grievous incident you are currently suffering from; we became aware of the incident through a letter that arrived from Hertfordshire yesterday.</t5121> <t5122>Rest assured, dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and I sincerely share in the sorrow of you and your esteemed family during this difficult time; your pain must be heart-wrenching, as it stems from a cause that time cannot erase.</t5122> <t5123>I am ready to do anything that might alleviate such a severe misfortune or comfort you in the face of a situation that would trouble a father's mind more than anything else.</t5123> <t5124>The death of your daughter would pale in comparison.</t5124> <t5125>Moreover, it is even more distressing because, according to what my dear Charlotte has told me, this behavior in your daughter has resulted from being excessively spoiled; but at the same time, to console you and Mrs. Bennet, I think it must also be due to her own naturally bad disposition, otherwise she could not have committed such a grave moral offense at such a young age.</t5125> <t5126>Either way, your situation is pitiable, and not only Mrs. Collins but also Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have explained the matter, share this view.</t5126> <t5127>They also agree with me in this regard, that a single misstep by one daughter will negatively affect the prospects of all the others, because, as Lady Catherine herself condescended to say, who would want to be related to such a family.</t5127> <t5128>This observation leads me to reflect with increasing satisfaction on a certain event that occurred last November, because otherwise, I would have had to share in all your sorrow and shame.</t5128> <t5129>Therefore, let me offer you this advice, dear sir: to console yourself as much as possible, erase your worthless child from your life forever, and let her reap what she has sown with her treacherous immorality.</t5129>
<t5130>Yours sincerely, etc. etc.</t5130><t5131>"</t5131>
<t5132>Mr. Gardiner did not write again until he received a reply from Colonel Forster; and the news he had to give then was not pleasant.</t5132> <t5133>Wickham was known to have no relatives with whom he maintained a relationship; it was certain that he had no living close kin.</t5133> <t5134>He had many old acquaintances, but since he had joined the army, he did not seem to have maintained friendships with any of them.</t5134> <t5135>Therefore, there was no one who could be pointed to as able to provide news about him.</t5135> <t5136>Moreover, in addition to the fear of being found by Lydia's relatives, he had strong reasons for secrecy due to the wretchedness of his financial situation, as it had recently come to light that he had left behind a significant amount of gambling debt.</t5136> <t5137>Colonel Forster estimated that it would take over a thousand pounds to clear his debts in Brighton.</t5137> <t5138>He also had many debts in town, but his debts of honor were more alarming.</t5138> <t5139>Mr. Gardiner did not try to hide these details from the Longbourn family; Jane learned them with horror.</t5139> <t5140>"A gambler!" she exclaimed.</t5140> <t5141>"This is something new.</t5141> <t5142>I had no idea.</t5142><t5143>"</t5143>
<t5144>Mr. Gardiner added in his letter that they could expect to see their father at home the next day, which was Saturday.</t5144> <t5145>The poor man, disheartened by the failure of his efforts, had acquiesced to his brother-in-law's suggestion to return to his family and leave to him what could be done to continue the search based on developments.</t5145> <t5146>When this was told to Mrs. Bennet, she did not seem as pleased as her children had expected, especially considering the worry she felt about him dying.</t5146>
<t5147>"No, he is coming home, and without Lydia!" he cried.</t5147> <t5148>"He cannot leave London without finding them.</t5148> <t5149>If he comes, who will fight Wickham, who will force him to marry?</t5149><t5150>"</t5150>
<t5151>When Mrs. Gardiner started to feel the desire to go home, it was decided that she would go to London with the children while Mr. Bennet was on his way.</t5151> <t5152>Upon this, the carriage took them to the meeting point and brought its owner back to Longbourn.</t5152>
<t5153>Mrs. Gardiner went to Elizabeth still as confused as ever about her friend from Derbyshire.</t5153> <t5154>His name had never been voluntarily mentioned in front of her by her nieces; the half-expectation that arose in Mrs. Gardiner was that she would write a letter after them, but it did not happen.</t5154> <t5155>Since Elizabeth arrived, she had not received a letter that might have come from Pemberley.</t5155>
<t5156>The family's current unhappy state made it unnecessary to seek other excuses for Elizabeth's low spirits; therefore, nothing definitive could be concluded from that matter. However, Elizabeth, who had understood her own feelings very well until then, was aware that if she had not known Darcy, she would have been able to endure the pain caused by Lydia's scandal better.</t5156> <t5157>It would have prevented her from staying awake until morning, she thought.</t5157>
<t5158>Mr. Bennet, when he arrived, was in his usual philosophical calmness.</t5158> <t5159>He spoke little, as was his custom; he did not mention the business that had taken him there, and it took some time for his daughters to muster the courage to talk about it.</t5159>
<t5160>In the end, she joined them for afternoon tea, and only then did Elizabeth dare to broach the subject; then, upon expressing her regrets about what he must have gone through, he said, "Don't talk about it.</t5160> <t5161>If I don't suffer, who will?</t5161> <t5162>It happened because of me, I must bear the punishment.</t5162><t5163>"</t5163>
<t5164>"You must not be so hard on yourself," replied Elizabeth.</t5164>
<t5165>"Of course, you can warn me against such a mistake.</t5165> <t5166>Human nature is so prone to making mistakes!</t5166> <t5167>No, Lizzy, let me feel how guilty I am for once in my life.</t5167> <t5168>I'm not afraid of succumbing to this feeling.</t5168> <t5169>It will pass soon.</t5169><t5170>"</t5170>
<t5171>"Do you think they are in London?</t5171><t5172>"</t5172>
<t5173>"Yes; where else could they hide so well?"</t5173><t5174>"</t5174>
<t5175>"Lydia always wanted to go to London," added Kitty.</t5175>
<t5176>"He must be happy then," said his father in a dry voice; "he will probably stay there for a while.</t5176><t5177>"</t5177>
<t5178>Then, after a brief silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I am not angry with you for being right in the advice you gave me last May; upon reflection, it shows how wise you are.</t5178><t5179>"</t5179>
<t5180>Their conversation was interrupted when Miss Bennet came to get her mother's tea.</t5180>
<t5181>"These antics," cried Mr. Bennet, "do one good; they add a touch of elegance to disaster!</t5181> <t5182>Tomorrow I shall do the same; I will sit in my library, wear my nightgown and powdering apron, and lament with all my might – or better yet, I'll postpone it until Kitty runs away.</t5182><t5183>"</t5183>
<t5184>"I won't run away, father," said Kitty, anxiously; "if I go to Brighton, I will behave more properly than Lydia.</t5184><t5185>"</t5185>
<t5186>"Go to Brighton!</t5186> <t5187>–Even if they gave you fifty pounds, I wouldn't trust you to go as far as East Bourne!</t5187> <t5188>No, Kitty, I've finally learned to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of this.</t5188> <t5189>No officer will ever enter my house again, or even pass through the village.</t5189> <t5190>Balls will be strictly forbidden; never without one of your sisters accompanying you.</t5190> <t5191>You can't step outside without proving you've spent ten minutes of each day sensibly.</t5191><t5192>"</t5192>
<t5193>Kitty, who took all these threats seriously, started to cry.</t5193>
<t5194>"Come on, come on," said Mr. Bennet, "don't worry.</t5194> <t5195>If you behave for the next ten years, then I'll take you to the parade.</t5195><t5196>"</t5196>
<t5197>Chapter VII</t5197>
<t5198>Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, while Jane and Elizabeth were walking in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them; thinking she was coming to call them to their mother's side, they went to meet her; but, as they approached her, instead of the expected summons, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon, madam, for disturbing you, but I took the liberty of coming to ask, hoping you might have received good news from town."</t5198><t5199>"</t5199>
<t5200>"What do you mean, Hill? We haven't heard from the city.</t5200><t5201>"</t5201>
<t5202>"Dear madam," cried Mrs. Hill in great astonishment, "don't you know that a courier has come for the gentleman from Mr. Gardiner?</t5202> <t5203>The man has been here for half an hour, and the gentleman has received a letter.</t5203><t5204>"</t5204>
<t5205>The girls ran, hurrying to find time to talk.</t5205> <t5206>They ran through the hall to the breakfast room, and from there to the library; their father was not in either place; they were about to look for him upstairs with their mother when they encountered the servant.</t5206>
<t5207>"If you are looking for the gentleman, madam, he is walking towards the small grove," said the servant.</t5207>
<t5208>Upon receiving this information, they ran once more through the hall and across the lawn towards their father; their father was walking determinedly towards the small forest on one side of the meadow.</t5208>
<t5209>Jane, who was lighter and not accustomed to running, soon fell behind, while her sister, out of breath, approached her father and asked curiously,</t5209>
<t5210>"Dad, is there news? is there news? did you get news from my uncle?</t5210><t5211>"</t5211>
<t5212>"Yes, I received a letter by courier."</t5212><t5213>"</t5213>
<t5214>"So, what's the news? Is it good or bad?"</t5214><t5215>"</t5215>
<t5216>"Is there something good to expect?" said his father, taking the letter out of his pocket; "but maybe you would like to read it.</t5216><t5217>"</t5217>
<t5218>Elizabeth impatiently took the letter from her hand.</t5218> <t5219>At that moment, Jane also arrived.</t5219>
<t5220>"Read it out loud," said his father, "I didn't fully understand what it is either.</t5220><t5221>"</t5221>
<t5222>"Gracechurch street, Monday,</t5222>
<t5223>August 2.</t5223>
<t5224>Dear Brother,</t5224>
<t5225>Finally, I can give you some news about my nephew that I hope will be pleasing to you.</t5225> <t5226>Right after you left on Saturday, luck smiled upon me and I found out where they are in London.</t5226> <t5227>I'm saving the details for our meeting.</t5227> <t5228>Knowing where they are is enough; I saw both of them–</t5228><t5229>"</t5229>
<t5230>"Then, as I have always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!</t5230><t5231>"</t5231>
<t5232>Elizabeth continued reading;</t5232>
<t5233>"I saw both of them.</t5233> <t5234>They are not married, and I have not seen any intention of them getting married; but if you agree to fulfill the commitments I am willing to make on your behalf, I hope it won't take long for them to marry.</t5234> <t5235>All that is expected from you is to guarantee your daughter her share of the five thousand pounds that will go to your children after your and my sister's death through a marriage settlement, and also to commit to giving your daughter a hundred pounds a year as long as you live.</t5235> <t5236>All things considered, I did not hesitate to accept these terms on your behalf, as I saw myself authorized to do so.</t5236> <t5237>I am sending this letter by courier, so we don't waste time until your response reaches me.</t5237> <t5238>From these details, you can easily deduce that Mr. Wickham's situation is not as hopeless as everyone thinks.</t5238> <t5239>People were mistaken in this regard; and I am happy to say that even after all his debts are paid, my nephew will have a little money left in addition to his own.</t5239> <t5240>If you give me full authority to act on your behalf until the end of this matter as I thought, I will immediately instruct Haggerston to prepare a suitable agreement.</t5240> <t5241>There will be no reason for you to come to the city again; so, sit quietly in Longbourn and trust in my diligence and attention.</t5241> <t5242>Send your response as quickly as possible and make sure to write clearly.</t5242> <t5243>We have decided that the best solution would be for my nephew to marry from this house, I hope you agree.</t5243> <t5244>He is coming to us today.</t5244> <t5245>If anything else is finalized, I will write again.</t5245>
<t5246>Edw.</t5246> <t5247>Gardiner</t5247>
<t5248>"Is it possible!" cried Elizabeth, when she finished the letter.</t5248> <t5249>"Could it be possible for him to marry Lydia?</t5249><t5250>"</t5250>
<t5251>"So Wickham isn't as terrible as we thought," said her sister.</t5251> <t5252>"Father, I congratulate you.</t5252><t5253>"</t5253>
<t5254>"Did you reply to the letter?" said Elizabeth.</t5254>
<t5255>"No, but it should be given immediately.</t5255><t5256>"</t5256>
<t5257>He pleaded with his father with all his might to write without wasting any time.</t5257>
<t5258>"Ah dear father," she cried, "come back and write immediately.</t5258> <t5259>Don't forget how important every moment is.</t5259><t5260>"</t5260>
<t5261>"Let me write it for you," said Jane, "if you don't want to bother.</t5261><t5262>"</t5262>
<t5263>"I don't want to get into trouble," his father replied; "but it must be written.</t5263><t5264>"</t5264>
<t5265>Saying this, he returned with them and walked towards the house.</t5265>
<t5266>"May I ask?" said Elizabeth, "the conditions must be met, right?</t5266><t5267>"</t5267>
<t5268>"Conditions!</t5268> <t5269>I'm ashamed for wanting so little.</t5269><t5270>"</t5270>
<t5271>"They need to get married!</t5271> <t5272>He's that kind of man!</t5272><t5273>"</t5273>
<t5274>"Yes, yes, they need to get married.</t5274> <t5275>There is no other choice.</t5275> <t5276>But there are two things I really want to know: –one, how much money your uncle spent to uncover these, and the other, how I will repay him this money.</t5276><t5277>"</t5277>
<t5278>"Money! To my uncle!" Jane shouted, "what do you mean, sir?</t5278><t5279>"</t5279>
<t5280>"What I mean is that no one in their right mind would marry Lydia for a flimsy reason like a hundred pounds a year while I'm alive, and fifty pounds a year after I'm gone.</t5280><t5281>"</t5281>
<t5282>"This is very true," said Elizabeth; "it hadn't occurred to me before.</t5282> <t5283>The debts will be paid off, and there will be something left over!</t5283> <t5284>Oh! It must be my uncle's doing!</t5284> <t5285>What a generous, kind-hearted man; I fear he has put himself in difficulty.</t5285> <t5286>These things couldn't have been done with little money.</t5286><t5287>"</t5287>
<t5288>"No," said her father, "I would say Wickham is a fool if he accepts the girl for less than ten thousand pounds.</t5288> <t5289>It would upset me to think so badly of him at the beginning of our relationship.</t5289><t5290>"</t5290>
<t5291>"Ten thousand pounds! God forbid!</t5291> <t5292>How can even half of such an amount be paid?</t5292><t5293>"</t5293>
<t5294>Mr. Bennet did not reply; each walked in silence, deep in thought, all the way home.</t5294> <t5295>Their father went to the library to write, and the girls went to the breakfast room.</t5295>
<t5296>"So they are really going to get married!" cried Elizabeth when they were alone.</t5296> <t5297>"How strange!</t5297> <t5298>Moreover, we have to be grateful for this.</t5298> <t5299>We have to be happy that they are getting married, even though their chances of happiness are low and the man's character is vile!</t5299> <t5300>Oh, Lydia!"</t5300>
<t5301>"This is how I comfort myself," replied Lydia, "if he didn't really feel close, he would never have married Lydia."</t5301> <t5302>"Even if our kind-hearted uncle did something to clear his debts, I can't believe that ten thousand pounds or something similar has been paid."</t5302> <t5303>"He has his own children, and there could be more."</t5303> <t5304>"How could he set aside even half of ten thousand pounds?"</t5304><t5305>"</t5305>
<t5306>"If we can find out how much debt Wickham has," said Elizabeth, "and how much was settled on his behalf by our uncle, we will know exactly what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham doesn't have a penny to his name.</t5306> <t5307>My uncle and aunt's kindness can never be repaid.</t5307> <t5308>Taking him into their home, giving him personal protection and support are such great sacrifices that years of thanks would not suffice.</t5308> <t5309>He is really with them right now!</t5309> <t5310>If such kindness doesn't make him feel terrible now, he will never deserve to be happy!</t5310> <t5311>How surprised he must have been when he first saw my aunt!</t5311><t5312>"</t5312>
<t5313>"We must try to forget what happened on both sides," said Jane: "Still, I believe and trust that they will be happy.</t5313> <t5314>Her agreeing to marry is, in my opinion, proof that she has started to think correctly.</t5314> <t5315>Their mutual love will put them in order; my belief is that they will settle down calmly and lead a sensible life, and time will make them forget their past mistakes.</t5315><t5316>"</t5316>
<t5317>"Your actions," replied Elizabeth, "can neither be forgotten by you, nor by me, nor by anyone else.</t5317> <t5318>It is useless to talk about it.</t5318><t5319>"</t5319>
<t5320>Then the girls realized that their mother was unaware of what had happened.</t5320> <t5321>So they went to the library and asked their father if he wanted to tell their mother about the development.</t5321> <t5322>Their father was writing and answered coldly without lifting his head,</t5322>
<t5323>"As you wish.</t5323><t5324>"</t5324>
<t5325>"Can we take my uncle's letter and read it to him?"</t5325><t5326>"</t5326>
<t5327>"Take whatever you want and leave."</t5327><t5328>"</t5328>
<t5329>Elizabeth took the letter from the writing desk and they went upstairs together.</t5329> <t5330>Mary and Kitty were with Mrs. Bennet: telling it once would be enough for everyone.</t5330> <t5331>After a brief preparation for the good news, the letter was read aloud.</t5331> <t5332>Mrs. Bennet could barely contain herself.</t5332> <t5333>As soon as Jane read Mr. Gardiner's hope that Lydia would soon be married, her joy overflowed, and every subsequent sentence added to her happiness.</t5333> <t5334>As much as she had been distressed by fear and anxiety, she was now intensely excited by pleasure.</t5334> <t5335>Knowing that her daughter would soon be married was enough.</t5335> <t5336>She no longer feared for her daughter's happiness, nor did recalling her daughter's mistakes dampen her spirits.</t5336>
<t5337>"Ah my dearest Lydia!" she exclaimed: "What delightful news!</t5337> <t5338>–She is going to get married!</t5338> <t5339>–I will see her again!</t5339> <t5340>–She will get married at sixteen!</t5340> <t5341>–Oh my kind-hearted sister!</t5341> <t5342>–I knew it would be like this –I knew you would sort everything out.</t5342> <t5343>How I long to see my daughter! And dear Wickham too!</t5343> <t5344>But the clothes, the wedding clothes!</t5344> <t5345>I must urgently write to my Aunt Gardiner about this.</t5345> <t5346>Lizzy, my dear, run to your father immediately, ask him how much he will give Lydia.</t5346> <t5347>Wait, wait, I'll go myself.</t5347> <t5348>Ring the bell, Kitty, let Hill come.</t5348> <t5349>Let me get dressed at once.</t5349> <t5350>Oh my dearest Lydia!</t5350> <t5351>–How happy we will all be when we are together!</t5351><t5352>"</t5352>
<t5353>The eldest daughter tried to somewhat reduce the intensity of these outbursts by drawing attention to Mr. Gardiner's behavior and the obligations it imposed on everyone.</t5353>
<t5354>"We owe this happy outcome," he added, "largely to his kindness.</t5354> <t5355>We believe he put himself forward by providing financial assistance to Mr. Wickham.</t5355><t5356>"</t5356>
<t5357>"Oh," cried her mother, "what's the big deal; isn't he her uncle, of course he will do it!</t5357> <t5358>If he didn't have his own family, all his money would have gone to my children; besides, this is the first time we're seeing something from him, except for a few gifts.</t5358> <t5359>Honestly, I'm quite happy.</t5359> <t5360>Very soon, I will have a married daughter.</t5360> <t5361>Mrs. Wickham! How nice it sounds.</t5361> <t5362>And she just turned sixteen last June.</t5362> <t5363>Jane dear, I'm so flustered that I can't write; I'll tell you, and you write.</t5363> <t5364>We'll sort out the money issue with your father later; right now there are things that need to be ordered urgently.</t5364><t5365>"</t5365>
<t5366>Then she started listing the details of linen, muslin, and calico, and was about to write down a full order when Jane, with difficulty, managed to convince her to wait for a suitable time to consult her father.</t5366> <t5367>One day's delay wouldn't matter, she said; her mother was too happy to be stubborn as usual.</t5367> <t5368>Other plans also came to her mind.</t5368>
<t5369>"I am going to Meryton," she said, "as soon as I am dressed; I will give my sister Philips the good news.</t5369> <t5370>On my way back, I will call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long.</t5370> <t5371>Kitty, go down and order the carriage.</t5371> <t5372>A little fresh air will do me a lot of good, I am sure.</t5372> <t5373>Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton?</t5373> <t5374>Oh, here comes Hill.</t5374> <t5375>Dear Hill, have you heard the good news?</t5375> <t5376>Miss Lydia is getting married, and you will make a bowl of punch and celebrate at the wedding.</t5376><t5377>"</t5377>
<t5378>Mrs. Hill immediately began to express her joy.</t5378> <t5379>Elizabeth accepted her congratulations among the others, then, overwhelmed by this foolishness, she retreated to her room to think comfortably.</t5379>
<t5380>Even at best, poor Lydia's situation must have been quite bad; but she should be grateful that it wasn't worse.</t5380> <t5381>She felt this way; looking ahead, neither a sensible happiness nor worldly prosperity could be hoped for her sister; but looking back, she felt all the goodness of what they had obtained compared to the things they had feared just two hours ago.</t5381>
<t5382>Chapter VIII</t5382>
<t5383>Mr. Bennet, before this period of his life, often wanted to set aside a sum of money each year to ensure a better life for his children and wife after his death, instead of spending all his income.</t5383> <t5384>He now wished he had done this more than ever.</t5384> <t5385>Had he fulfilled this duty, Lydia would not be indebted to her uncle for the respectability or credibility that could now be bought for her.</t5385> <t5386>The satisfaction of having persuaded one of the most worthless young men in England to be her husband could then be felt in the right place.</t5386>
<t5387>He was seriously upset that the entire cost of such a purpose, which was of little benefit to anyone, had fallen on his brother-in-law; if possible, he was determined to find out the amount of his help and to settle the debt at the first opportunity.</t5387>
<t5388>When Mr. Bennet first got married, saving money seemed utterly unnecessary; because surely they would have a son.</t5388> <t5389>This son, as soon as he came of age, would remove the mortgage, and his widow and younger children would not suffer from financial difficulties thanks to him.</t5389> <t5390>Five daughters came into the world one after another, but still no son; Mrs. Bennet was confident that a son would come even years after Lydia was born.</t5390> <t5391>When hope was finally lost for this event, it was too late to start saving.</t5391> <t5392>Mrs. Bennet had no understanding of saving, and it was only thanks to her husband's love of independence that they managed not to spend more than they earned.</t5392>
<t5393>As per the conditions of the marriage, five thousand pounds were allocated to Mrs. Bennet and the children.</t5393> <t5394>But the proportion of how the money would be divided among the children was to be decided by the parents.</t5394> <t5395>Now, at least regarding Lydia, this point needed to be resolved, and Mr. Bennet could not hesitate to accept the proposal before him.</t5395> <t5396>In terms of appreciating his brother-in-law's kindness, he acknowledged on paper, albeit briefly, that he fully approved of everything that had been done and agreed to fulfill the commitments made on his behalf.</t5396> <t5397>It had never occurred to him before that if Wickham could be persuaded to marry his daughter, it could be done without causing him any inconvenience, as stated in the agreement before him.</t5397> <t5398>The hundred pounds to be paid to them would either cost him ten pounds a year or not; because with her food, drink, pocket money, and the constant financial support from her mother, Lydia's expenses would only just be covered by that amount.</t5398>
<t5399>The fact that the matter was resolved with such an insignificant effort from his perspective was another pleasant surprise; his current main goal was to cause as few problems as possible in the matter.</t5399> <t5400>After the initial fits of anger that led him to go searching for him subsided, he naturally returned to his old occupations.</t5400> <t5401>The letter was sent immediately; although he was slow to start the task, he was quick to finish it.</t5401> <t5402>He also wanted to know in detail what he owed his brother-in-law; but he was so angry with Lydia that he did not send her any message.</t5402>
<t5403>The good news spread quickly at home; it spread around just as fast.</t5403> <t5404>The people around received the news reasonably.</t5404> <t5405>Of course, the gossip would have been more enjoyable if Miss Lydia Bennet had fallen into the city streets, or better yet, retreated to a distant farmhouse.</t5405> <t5406>But she was getting married, and there was still much to talk about; all the old ladies in Meryton who had previously wished her well did not lose any of their enthusiasm when the situation changed, because they knew that with such a husband, that girl would never reform.</t5406>
<t5407>It had been fifteen days since Mrs. Bennet had set foot on the ground floor, but on this happy day, she took her place at the head of the table once again, with a cheerfulness that would drive everyone crazy.</t5407> <t5408>No sense of shame could tarnish her victory in the slightest.</t5408> <t5409>Since Jane had turned sixteen, her greatest dream had been to marry off one of her daughters, and now she was on the verge of achieving it; all her thoughts and conversations revolved around elegant weddings, high-quality muslins, new carriages, and servants.</t5409> <t5410>She was looking for a suitable house in the vicinity for her daughter, turning her nose up at many because their size and location were not adequate, without knowing or caring what their income would be.</t5410>
<t5411>"It could be Haye-Park," he said, "if the Gouldings leave it; the large house at Stoke could also work, if the sitting room were larger; but Ashworth is too far!</t5411> <t5412>I can't bear it being more than ten miles away from me; as for Purvis Lodge, its attic is terrible.</t5412><t5413>"</t5413>
<t5414>He allowed her to speak without interference while the servants were there.</t5414> <t5415>When the servants withdrew, he said to her, "Mrs. Bennet, before you take any of these houses, or all of them, for your son or daughter, let us come to an agreement on one matter.</t5415> <t5416>They shall never enter a single house in this neighborhood.</t5416> <t5417>I will not reward their immorality by accepting them at Longbourn.</t5417><t5418>"</t5418>
<t5419>This statement was followed by a long dispute; but Mr. Bennet was resolute: another dispute ensued; Mrs. Bennet learned with astonishment and horror that her husband would not give a single penny for their daughter's dress.</t5419> <t5420>Mr. Bennet said he would not show the slightest sign of affection regarding the wedding.</t5420> <t5421>Mrs. Bennet could not comprehend these things.</t5421> <t5422>His refusal to do such a kindness for his daughter would take the wedding out of the realm of weddings; it was inconceivable that his anger had reached such an unimaginable point of resentment.</t5422> <t5423>Mrs. Bennet cared less about the shame of her daughter eloping and living with Wickham just fifteen days ago than she did about the new dresslessness staining the wedding.</t5423>
<t5424>Elizabeth was now very upset for having given in to the despair of the moment and told Mr. Darcy about the fears they had for his sister; they could hope to conceal the distressing beginning from everyone who was not present at that moment, as the matter of the elopement would soon be properly resolved.</t5424>
<t5425>He did not fear that the situation would spread further through Mr. Darcy.</t5425> <t5426>There were very few people whose confidentiality he could trust more than him; but at the same time, no one else's knowledge of his sister's weakness could upset him more.</t5426> <t5427>Not because he would be personally harmed by it; because, in any case, there seemed to be an insurmountable chasm between them.</t5427> <t5428>Even if Lydia's marriage had been handled in the most respectable manner, it was unimaginable that Mr. Darcy would want to be related to a family that added the closest and most intimate relationship with a man he rightfully despised to its other negative aspects.</t5428>
<t5429>There was nothing surprising in wanting to stay away from such a kinship.</t5429> <t5430>She had felt that she was trying to win his favor in Derbyshire, but after such a blow, no one in their right mind could expect her to continue.</t5430> <t5431>Elizabeth was humiliated, she was suffering; she was repenting, though she didn't know for what.</t5431> <t5432>She was jealous of his love, even though she could no longer hope to feel it.</t5432> <t5433>She wanted to hear from him, even though there was no way to reach him.</t5433> <t5434>She believed she could be happy with him, even though it now seemed impossible for them to be together.</t5434>
<t5435>How victorious he would have been, he often thought, if only he had known that the offers he had proudly rejected just four months ago would now be accepted with such great joy and gratitude!</t5435> <t5436>There was no doubt that he was a noble man, and one of the noblest at that.</t5436> <t5437>But at the same time, he was human and could feel a sense of victory.</t5437>
<t5438>Now she was beginning to realize that he was the most suitable man for her, with his personality and abilities.</t5438> <t5439>Even though his mind and nature were not similar to hers, he fulfilled all her wishes.</t5439> <t5440>This was a relationship that would make both of them happy; Elizabeth's ease and liveliness could soften his character and improve his behavior; his judgment, knowledge, and experience would teach Elizabeth more important things.</t5440>
<t5441>But such a happy marriage would not be able to teach the crowd around them what true marital happiness really was.</t5441> <t5442>A union of a different nature, which would eliminate the possibility of the other within their families, was about to be established.</t5442>
<t5443>Wickham could not imagine how Lydia and he would manage to live more or less independently.</t5443> <t5444>However, he could easily predict how little lasting happiness could be possible in the life of a couple who came together only because their passions were stronger than their virtues.</t5444>
<t5445>------------------------</t5445>
<t5446>Mr. Gardiner soon wrote back to his brother-in-law.</t5446> <t5447>He briefly acknowledged Mr. Bennet's thanks, expressed his readiness to ensure the well-being of every member of the family, and concluded by requesting that the matter not be mentioned to him again.</t5447> <t5448>The main purpose of his letter was to inform them that Wickham had decided to leave the Militia.</t5448>
<t5449>"Once the marriage is finalized," he added, "I wanted him to do so as well.</t5449> <t5450>I believe you will agree that it would be beneficial for both him and my niece to leave the regiment.</t5450> <t5451>Mr. Wickham's intention is to enlist in the regular army; there are still some of his old friends who are willing and able to support him in the army.</t5451> <t5452>He has been promised a corporal position in the unit of General ---------, who is currently stationed in the North.</t5452> <t5453>Being so far from this part of the kingdom is also an advantage.</t5453> <t5454>He promises reasonably; I hope they will act more prudently among different people where they can present themselves as new individuals.</t5454> <t5455>I wrote a letter to Colonel Forster informing him of our agreement, asking him to reassure Mr. Wickham's creditors in and around Brighton by promising quick payment under my personal guarantee.</t5455> <t5456>I also ask you to kindly give the same assurance to the creditors in Meryton; I will send you the list according to the information he provided me.</t5456> <t5457>He listed all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us.</t5457> <t5458>Haggerston has received our instructions; everything will be settled within a week.</t5458> <t5459>Then they will join their unit, unless they are invited to Longbourn beforehand; from what Mrs. Gardiner has told me, my niece is very eager to see you all before she leaves the South.</t5459> <t5460>She is well; she sends her love to you and your mother.</t5460>
<t5461>E.</t5461> <t5462>Gardiner.</t5462><t5463>"</t5463>
<t5464>Mr. Bennet and his daughters found Wickham's departure from the ---------shire regiment to be as favorable as Mr. Gardiner did.</t5464> <t5465>But Mrs. Bennet was not as pleased about it.</t5465> <t5466>Just when she was about to take great pleasure and pride in his presence, Lydia's move to the North was a heavy disappointment for her, because she had not yet given up on the plan of them living in Hertfordshire, and it was truly a pity that Lydia had to leave a regiment where she knew everyone and had many loved ones.</t5466>
<t5467>"She is very fond of Mrs. Forster," he said, "sending her away will be a complete shock!</t5467> <t5468>Besides, there are plenty of young people she likes very much there.</t5468> <t5469>It is impossible for the officers in General ---------'s unit to be so pleasant.</t5469><t5470>"</t5470>
<t5471>The request of her daughter to be accepted back into the family before going North, because she seemed to have made such a request, was initially met with absolute opposition.</t5471> <t5472>But for the sake of their sisters' feelings and reputation, Jane and Elizabeth, who accepted the request for her marriage to be recognized by their mother and father, so persistently but so wisely and moderately pressured Mr. Bennet to accept Lydia and her husband at Longbourn as soon as they got married that he was finally convinced to think like them and act as they wished.</t5472> <t5473>Thus, their mother was also pleased, thinking she could show her daughter around before she was exiled to the North.</t5473> <t5474>When Mr. Bennet wrote to his brother-in-law again, he thus allowed them to come; it was decided that they would proceed to Longbourn immediately after the ceremony.</t5474> <t5475>However, Elizabeth was surprised that Wickham consented to such a plan; if it were up to her, encountering Wickham would be the last thing she would want in life.</t5475>
<t5476>Chapter IX</t5476>
<t5477>The wedding day of their sisters arrived; Jane and Elizabeth were probably more anxious on her behalf than she was herself.</t5477> <t5478>A carriage was sent to meet them at ----------; they would have returned by mealtime.</t5478> <t5479>The elder Miss Bennets were gripped by the fear of their arrival; especially Jane, who was distressed thinking about what her sister had to endure, as she felt the emotions Lydia would have if she had been the one to make the mistake.</t5479>
<t5480>They arrived.</t5480> <t5481>The family gathered in the breakfast room to greet them.</t5481> <t5482>As the car approached the door, Mrs. Bennet's face lit up with smiles; her husband appeared impenetrably serious; their daughters were anxious, worried, and tense.</t5482>
<t5483>Lydia's voice was heard in the hallway; the door opened quickly and she ran into the room.</t5483> <t5484>Her mother stepped forward, embraced her, and greeted her warmly; with a loving smile, she gave her hand to Wickham, who was following his wife, and with an enthusiasm that left no doubt about their happiness, she wished them both eternal bliss.</t5484>
<t5485>Then they turned to Mr. Bennet; the reception they received from him was not very friendly.</t5485> <t5486>A cold expression settled on his face, and he hardly opened his mouth.</t5486> <t5487>The carefree ease of the young couple was enough to provoke him.</t5487> <t5488>Elizabeth was disgusted; even Miss Bennet was shaken.</t5488> <t5489>Lydia was still Lydia; mischievous, shameless, wild, boisterous, and fearless.</t5489> <t5490>She turned from one sister to another, demanding their congratulations; finally, when they all sat together, she looked around the room curiously, noticed a few changes, and laughingly said that a lot of time had passed since she was last there.</t5490>
<t5491>Wickham was not more troublesome than before, but his actions were so pleasant at every moment that if his personality and marriage were as they wished, his smile and easy conversation while expecting intimacy would give them all pleasure.</t5491> <t5492>Elizabeth had not previously believed that he could possess such confidence; but she sat down, resolving within herself that in the future she would set no limits to the shamelessness of a shameless man.</t5492> <t5493>Her face turned red, Jane's face turned red, but the color on the cheeks of the two people who upset them did not even flicker.</t5493>
<t5494>There was no lack of conversation.</t5494> <t5495>Both the bride and her mother kept talking; Wickham, who was sitting close to Elizabeth, began to ask about acquaintances in the area with a cheerful ease; Elizabeth felt that she was having quite a hard time responding in the same manner.</t5495> <t5496>Both seemed to possess the happiest memories in the world.</t5496> <t5497>Nothing from the past was remembered with pain; Lydia willingly brought up topics that her sisters would never want to be mentioned in the world.</t5497>
<t5498>"Just imagine," he exclaimed, "it’s only been three months since I left; yet it feels like fifteen days to me; but so much has happened in that time.</t5498> <t5499>Oh my God! When I left, the idea of getting married never crossed my mind until I returned! Still, I thought that if I got married, it would be a lot of fun.</t5499><t5500>"</t5500>
<t5501>Her father raised his eyes.</t5501> <t5502>Jane was bored, overwhelmed.</t5502> <t5503>Elizabeth looked meaningfully at Lydia; but Lydia, who preferred to be oblivious to the things she chose to ignore, continued cheerfully, "Oh, mother, do people know I got married today?</t5503> <t5504>I was afraid they might not know; we caught up with William Goulding on the road, in his carriage, I wanted him to see and find out, so I lowered the window on his side, took off my glove, and placed my hand on the window sill so he could see my ring, then I bowed my head and smiled calmly.</t5504><t5505>"</t5505>
<t5506>Elizabeth couldn't bear it any longer.</t5506> <t5507>She got up, ran out of the room, and didn't return until she heard them passing through the corridor to the dining room.</t5507> <t5508>Then she immediately went inside and, pretending to be worried, approached her mother on the right side and heard Lydia say to her eldest sister, "Well Jane, I'm taking your place now, your turn has passed, because I'm now a married woman."</t5508><t5509>"</t5509>
<t5510>It was inconceivable that time would give Lydia a sense of shame that she initially lacked.</t5510> <t5511>Her comfort and cheerfulness increased.</t5511> <t5512>She wanted to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all the other neighbors, to hear each of them call her "Mrs. Wickham"; meanwhile, after dinner, she went to show her ring and boast about being married to Mrs. Hill and the two servants.</t5512>
<t5513>"Honestly, mom," she said, as they all returned to the breakfast room, "what do you think about my husband?</t5513> <t5514>Isn't he a charming man?</t5514> <t5515>I'm sure all my sisters are jealous of me.</t5515> <t5516>I hope they are at least half as lucky as I am.</t5516> <t5517>They should all go to Brighton.</t5517> <t5518>That's the place to find a husband.</t5518> <t5519>It's a pity, mom, that we didn't all go together.</t5519><t5520>"</t5520>
<t5521>"You are absolutely right; if they listened to me, we would have gone.</t5521> <t5522>But my dear Lydia, I don't like you going so far away.</t5522> <t5523>Is it necessary?</t5523><t5524>"</t5524>
<t5525>"Oh my God! yes; –there's nothing wrong with that.</t5525> <t5526>I like it.</t5526> <t5527>You, my father, my sisters will come and see me.</t5527> <t5528>We will be in Newcastle all winter; I'm sure there will be balls, I will make sure to find good partners for all of them.</t5528><t5529>"</t5529>
<t5530>"I want it more than anything!" said her mother.</t5530>
<t5531>"And then, when you leave, you can leave a couple of my sisters with me; I'm sure I'll find them husbands before the winter ends."</t5531><t5532>"</t5532>
<t5533>"Thanks, I'll pass," said Elizabeth; "I don't quite like your way of finding a husband.</t5533><t5534>"</t5534>
<t5535>The guests would not stay with them for more than ten days.</t5535> <t5536>Mr. Wickham had received his assignment before leaving London and would join his unit in fifteen days.</t5536>
<t5537>No one but Mrs. Bennet was upset that they would stay so briefly; Mrs. Bennet made good use of the time, visiting friends and acquaintances with her daughter, and frequently hosting parties at home.</t5537> <t5538>These parties seemed reasonable to everyone; in fact, those troubled by family matters enjoyed escaping the family atmosphere more than those who were not troubled.</t5538>
<t5539>Wickham's interest in Lydia was exactly as Elizabeth had predicted; it was not equal to the interest Lydia showed him.</t5539> <t5540>It did not need to be confirmed that their elopement stemmed from the strength of Lydia's love rather than Wickham's; even though he did not have a strong desire for Lydia, he might have wondered why he agreed to run away with her if he were not sure that the hopelessness of his circumstances necessitated it; and even in that situation, he was not a man who could resist the opportunity to have a companion by his side.</t5540>
<t5541>Lydia was extremely fond of him.</t5541> <t5542>He was her dear Wickham in every situation; no one could compare to him.</t5542> <t5543>He did everything in the world better than anyone else; Lydia was sure he would kill more birds than anyone else in the village one September.</t5543>
<t5544>Shortly after their arrival, one morning while sitting with her two sisters, Elizabeth said,</t5544>
<t5545>"Lizzy, I don't think I told you about my wedding.</t5545> <t5546>You weren't there when I was telling my mom and others.</t5546> <t5547>Aren't you curious about how it was?</t5547><t5548>"</t5548>
<t5549>"I do not believe it," replied Elizabeth; "the less we know, the better."</t5549><t5550>"</t5550>
<t5551>"Oh my God! You are so strange!"</t5551> <t5552>"But I will tell you anyway."</t5552> <t5553>"As you know, we got married at St. Clement's because Wickham's house was in that neighborhood."</t5553> <t5554>"It was decided that everyone would be there by eleven o'clock."</t5554> <t5555>"My uncle, aunt, and I were going to go together; the others would meet us at the church."</t5555> <t5556>"Honestly, when Monday morning came, I panicked so much!"</t5556> <t5557>"I was so scared that something would come up and prevent it, and I would go crazy again."</t5557> <t5558>"Especially my aunt, while I was getting dressed, she kept preaching, talking continuously like she was reciting a prayer."</t5558> <t5559>"But I could only hear one out of ten of her words, because, you understand, my mind was on my dear Wickham."</t5559> <t5560>"I was wondering if he would wear his blue jacket at the wedding."</t5560>
<t5561>"Then, as usual, we had breakfast at ten; I thought it would never end because, you know, my uncle and aunt were terribly unpleasant while I was there.</t5561> <t5562>Believe it or not, I didn't even step outside the door, even though I stayed there for fifteen days.</t5562> <t5563>No parties, no plans, nothing.</t5563> <t5564>Although London was also dull, at least the Little Theater was open.</t5564> <t5565>Oh, just as the car was pulling up to the door, didn't that awful man, Mr. Stone, call my uncle for work.</t5565> <t5566>You know, when those two get together, it never ends.</t5566> <t5567>I was so scared I didn't know what to do because my uncle was supposed to give me away; moreover, if we missed the time, we couldn't get married all day.</t5567> <t5568>But luckily, he came back in ten minutes, and we all set off together.</t5568> <t5569>But then it occurred to me that even if he couldn't come, the wedding wouldn't have to be postponed because Mr. Darcy could also perform his duties.</t5569><t5570>"</t5570>
<t5571>"Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in horror.</t5571>
<t5572>"Oh yes! –he was going to come with Wickham.</t5572> <t5573>Oh my God! I completely forgot!</t5573> <t5574>I wasn't supposed to mention this.</t5574> <t5575>I had given them my word of honor!</t5575> <t5576>What will Wickham say now?</t5576> <t5577>It was supposed to remain a secret!</t5577><t5578>"</t5578>
<t5579>"If it was meant to remain a secret," said Jane, "don't say another word.</t5579> <t5580>You can be sure that I don't want to hear anything else.</t5580><t5581>"</t5581>
<t5582>"Oh, of course," said Elizabeth, even though she was burning with curiosity; "we won't ask you any questions.</t5582><t5583>"</t5583>
<t5584>"Thank you," said Lydia, "because if you had asked, I would have told you everything, and Wickham would have blushed.</t5584><t5585>"</t5585>
<t5586>Upon such an invitation to ask a question, Elizabeth ran outside and had to restrain herself.</t5586>
<t5587>However, it was impossible to live without knowing something about such a point; or at least, it was impossible not to try to gain information.</t5587> <t5588>Mr. Darcy had attended his sister's wedding.</t5588> <t5589>This was a scene and a group of people in which he had the least interest and the least desire to go.</t5589> <t5590>Quick and frantic guesses about its meaning swarmed his mind, but none were satisfactory.</t5590> <t5591>The ones he liked the most, that is, those which placed his behavior in the noblest light, seemed the most impossible.</t5591> <t5592>He could not bear this tension; he hastily took paper and pen and wrote a short letter to his aunt, asking for an explanation about the things Lydia had not mentioned, if the situation allowed for confidentiality.</t5592>
<t5593>"As you might imagine," he added, "I was extremely curious to see someone among you who has no ties to any of us, a stranger to our family (relatively speaking, I mean) at such a moment.</t5593> <t5594>Please write immediately so that I can understand – of course, if Lydia does not need to maintain secrecy for very credible reasons; in that case, I will have to try to live without knowing.</t5594><t5595>"</t5595>
<t5596>"But it won't be necessary, of course," he added to himself, as he finished the letter; "and, my dear aunt, if you don't explain it to me clearly, I will have no choice but to resort to some tricks to find out."</t5596><t5597>"</t5597>
<t5598>Jane's delicate sense of honor would not allow her to secretly discuss with Elizabeth what Lydia had let slip; Elizabeth was pleased with this; she preferred to be without a confidante until her questions were answered.</t5598>
<t5599>Chapter X</t5599>
<t5600>Elizabeth received a reply to her letter as quickly as possible.</t5600> <t5601>As soon as the letter reached her hands, she hurried to the small grove, the place where she would be least disturbed, sat on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; because the letter was too long to be dismissive.</t5601>
<t5602>"Gracechurch Street, September 6"</t5602>
<t5603>Dear Nephew,</t5603>
<t5604>I just received your letter; since I anticipate that a short writing will not suffice to explain everything I need to tell you, I will dedicate the entire morning to replying.</t5604><t5605>I must confess that I am surprised by your request; I did not expect this from you.</t5605><t5606>Do not think that I am angry, but I want you to know that I did not think you would need to ask such questions.</t5606><t5607>If you are having difficulty understanding me, please excuse my intervention.</t5607><t5608>Your uncle was as surprised as I was – he would never have acted this way if he believed you were aware of the matter.</t5608><t5609>But if you are truly unaware, then I must be more explicit.</t5609><t5610>The day I returned home from Longbourn, your uncle received an unexpected visitor.</t5610><t5611>Mr. Darcy came, and they locked themselves in a room for several hours.</t5611><t5612>Everything was over before I arrived; therefore, my curiosity was not as agonizing as yours.</t5612><t5613>Mr. Darcy came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, had seen them, had spoken with Wickham frequently, and with Lydia once.</t5613><t5614>As far as I can understand, he left Derbyshire a day after us and came to the city with the aim of finding them.</t5614><t5615>The reason for his action was that he felt responsible for the fact that Wickham's villainy was not sufficiently known; if it were known, it would be impossible for well-bred girls to love or trust him.</t5615><t5616>He found all the blame in his own faulty pride; he admitted that he did not consider it appropriate to reveal private matters to the public.</t5616><t5617>Therefore, he felt it his duty to come forward and make an effort to remedy a wrong he had caused.</t5617><t5618>If there is another reason, I am sure it is not one that would embarrass him.</t5618><t5619>He spent a few days in the city until he found them; unlike us, he knew where to direct his search; knowing this was another reason he decided to follow us.</t5619><t5620>It appears there is a lady, someone named Mrs. Younge, who was Miss Darcy's governess for a while; he did not say exactly what happened, but she was dismissed for some reason.</t5620><t5621>The lady then rented a large house on Edward Street and has been making a living by renting rooms since then.</t5621><t5622>He knew that Mrs. Younge was well acquainted with Wickham and went to her for information as soon as he arrived in the city.</t5622><t5623>But it took two or three days to get what he wanted from her.</t5623><t5624>Apparently, he had to bribe her to betray Wickham because she really knew where her friend was.</t5624><t5625>Wickham had actually gone to her first when he came to London; if she could have accommodated him, they would have stayed with her.</t5625><t5626>But in the end, our kind-hearted friend got the address he wanted.</t5626><t5627>They were on ------- street.</t5627><t5628>He saw Wickham and then insisted on seeing Lydia.</t5628><t5629>His initial aim regarding Lydia was to persuade her to end that disgraceful situation and return to her relatives, as soon as they were willing to accept her, and he offered to help as much as he could to achieve this.</t5629><t5630>But he saw that Lydia was determined to stay where she was.</t5630><t5631>She did not care about her relatives, did not want his help, and would not even hear of leaving Wickham.</t5631><t5632>At some point, she was sure they would marry, and the timing did not matter much.</t5632><t5633>Given her feelings, he thought the only thing left was to secure and hasten the marriage; in his first conversation with Wickham, he easily learned that he had no such intention.</t5633><t5634>Wickham himself admitted that he had to leave the regiment due to some urgent gambling debts; he did not hesitate to attribute all the bad consequences of Lydia's elopement solely to her foolishness.</t5634><t5635>He intended to leave the regiment immediately; he had no clear idea of what he would do in the future.</t5635><t5636>He had to go somewhere, but he did not know where; he also did not know how he would make a living.</t5636><t5637>Mr. Darcy asked him why he did not marry your sister immediately.</t5637><t5638>Although Mr. Bennet was not very wealthy, he could do something for him, and his situation could improve through marriage.</t5638><t5639>But in response to this question, Mr. Darcy learned that Wickham still held out hope of making a more substantial fortune through marriage in another region.</t5639><t5640>However, it was not easy for him to resist the temptation of immediate relief.</t5640><t5641>They met several times because there was much to discuss.</t5641><t5642>Of course, Wickham wanted more than he could get, but eventually, he agreed to a reasonable amount.</t5642><t5643>Once everything was settled between them, Mr. Darcy's next step was to inform your uncle of the situation; he visited Gracechurch Street the evening before my first arrival.</t5643><t5644>But Mr. Gardiner was not around; after doing some more research, Mr. Darcy learned that your father was with him but would leave the city the next day.</t5644><t5645>Thinking he could not speak as comfortably with your father as with your uncle, he postponed the meeting until your father left.</t5645><t5646>He did not leave his name; until the next day, all that was known was that a gentleman had called on business.</t5646><t5647>He came again on Saturday.</t5647><t5648>Your father was gone, your uncle was home, and as I said, they talked extensively in private.</t5648><t5649>They met again on Sunday, and that was when I saw him.</t5649><t5650>Everything was settled by Monday: a courier was immediately sent to Longbourn.</t5650><t5651>But our guest was very stubborn.</t5651><t5652>It seems to me, my dear Lizzy, that stubbornness is his true character flaw.</t5652><t5653>He has been found to have many faults at different times; but this is the real flaw.</t5653><t5654>He did not allow anything to be done that he did not do himself; yet I am sure (I am not saying this to expect thanks, so do not say anything) your uncle would have wholeheartedly handled the entire matter.</t5654><t5655>They struggled over this for a long time, much more than the gentleman or lady involved deserved.</t5655><t5656>But in the end, your uncle had to agree; he had to be content with the probable reputation of being truly helpful to his niece rather than actually being so, which he could not bear at all; therefore, I believe your letter this morning pleased him greatly because it asked for an explanation that would free your uncle from his borrowed crown and return the praise to where it belonged.</t5656><t5657>However, my dear Lizzy, no one should know about this except you and perhaps Jane.</t5657><t5658>I believe you know very well what was done for the young couple.</t5658><t5659>Wickham's debts, which I believe exceed a thousand pounds, will be paid, and another thousand will be added to Lydia's own money in her name, and Wickham's rank in the army will be purchased.</t5659><t5660>All this was done solely by him for the reason I mentioned above.</t5660><t5661>It was Mr. Darcy's fault, negligence, and thoughtlessness that Wickham's character was so misunderstood and consequently accepted by society.</t5661><t5662>There may be some truth in this; but I doubt that the reason was his or anyone else's negligence.</t5662><t5663>Nevertheless, despite all these fine words, my dear Lizzy, rest assured, your uncle would not have agreed if he did not think there was another reason related to this matter.</t5663><t5664>When all this was decided, Mr. Darcy returned to his friends still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he would come to London once more for the wedding; all financial matters would be finalized then.</t5664><t5665>I believe I have now told you everything.</t5665><t5666>You said this explanation would surprise you greatly; I hope at least it will not upset you.</t5666><t5667>Lydia came to us; Wickham was allowed to come and go as he pleased.</t5667><t5668>Wickham was just as he was when we knew him in Hertfordshire; I was not going to tell you how repulsive I found Lydia's behavior while she stayed with us, but from Jane's letter last Wednesday, I understand that her behavior when she arrived home was the same; so what I will now tell you will not cause you new pain.</t5668><t5669>I spoke to Lydia very seriously and repeatedly, explaining the immorality of what she had done and how much she had made her family unhappy.</t5669><t5670>If she heard me, it was by chance, because I am sure she did not listen.</t5670><t5671>Sometimes I felt like I was losing control, but then I remembered my dear Elizabeth and Jane and showed patience for their sake.</t5671><t5672>Mr. Darcy returned without delay and, as Lydia told you, attended the wedding.</t5672><t5673>He had dinner with us the next day; he was to leave the city again on Wednesday or Thursday.</t5673><t5674>If I take this opportunity to tell you how much I admire him (I had not found the courage to say this before), will you be angry with me, my dear Lizzy?</t5674><t5675>His behavior towards us was as pleasant in every way as it was in Derbyshire.</t5675><t5676>I like his intelligence and opinions; all he needs is a bit more liveliness, which, if he makes a wise marriage, his wife can teach him.</t5676><t5677>I found him very tight-lipped; – he hardly mentioned your name.</t5677><t5678>But being tight-lipped must be in fashion these days.</t5678><t5679>If I have been building castles in the air, please forgive me, or at least do not punish me so severely as to ban me from Pemberley.</t5679><t5680>I will never be happy until I thoroughly explore the grove.</t5680><t5681>A small carriage with a pair of beautiful ponies will suffice and more.</t5681><t5682>But I cannot continue any longer.</t5682><t5683>The children have been calling me for half an hour.</t5683><t5684>With my love,</t5684>
<t5685>M.</t5685> <t5686>Gardiner.</t5686><t5687>"</t5687>
<t5688>This letter's content threw Elizabeth into a tumultuous state of mind; it was difficult to decide whether joy or sorrow had the greater share.</t5688><t5689>The disturbing doubts caused by not being sure of all the actions Mr. Darcy might have taken to hasten his sister's marriage, which Elizabeth feared to believe because they were impossibly kind, and at the same time was horrified by the obligation they implied, all turned out to be true in the end!</t5689><t5690>He had deliberately followed them to the city, endured all the trouble and distress such an investigation could bring; he had to persuade a woman he despised, face, meet frequently, talk to, convince, and finally bribe a man he most wanted to avoid and couldn't even bear to hear the name of.</t5690><t5691>He had done all this for a girl he wouldn't even consider a person.</t5691><t5692>His heart told him he did it for Elizabeth.</t5692><t5693>But this hope was immediately tested by other concerns; soon, when Elizabeth felt the need to trust in Darcy's love for her, a woman who had once rejected him, even his pride couldn't make him believe that this love could overcome a natural feeling like the disgust of being related to Wickham.</t5693><t5694>Wickham's brother-in-law!</t5694><t5695>Such a relationship would provoke every sense of pride.</t5695><t5696>Of course, he had done a lot.</t5696><t5697>Elizabeth felt ashamed when she thought of how much he had done.</t5697><t5698>But he had given a reason for his intervention that was not so hard to believe.</t5698><t5699>It was understandable for him to feel guilty; he was generous and had the means to be generous; Elizabeth did not see herself as Darcy's main reason, but she could believe that perhaps a lingering feeling of affection might have helped him strive for a goal that also concerned her peace of mind.</t5699><t5700>They owed everything, including Lydia's regained respectability, to him.</t5700><t5701>Oh! how she suffered for every ungrateful feeling she had harbored towards him, for every harsh word she had directed at him!</t5701><t5702>For her part, she had learned her lesson; but she was proud of him.</t5702><t5703>She was proud that he had managed to overcome himself for the sake of compassion and honor.</t5703><t5704>She read over and over the parts where her aunt praised him.</t5704><t5705>It wasn't enough, but it pleased her.</t5705><t5706>When she saw how wholeheartedly her aunt and uncle believed in the love and affection between her and Mr. Darcy, she realized that she felt a certain pleasure, mixed with regret.</t5706>
<t5707>When she heard someone approaching, she got up from where she was sitting, shaking off her thoughts; before she could move to another path, Wickham caught up with her.</t5707>
<t5708>"I'm afraid I'm interrupting your walk, dear sister," he said as he came up to her.</t5708>
<t5709>"Of course you are interrupting," replied Elizabeth, "but that doesn't mean you are being bothersome.</t5709><t5710>"</t5710>
<t5711>"If that were the case, I would be truly sad.</t5711> <t5712>We have always been good friends, and now we are even closer.</t5712><t5713>"</t5713>
<t5714>"Correct.</t5714> <t5715>Are the others coming too?</t5715><t5716>"</t5716>
<t5717>"I don't know.</t5717> <t5718>Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going to Meryton by carriage.</t5718> <t5719>In the meantime, my dear sister, from what I have learned from our uncle and aunt, you have indeed seen Pemberley.</t5719><t5720>"</t5720>
<t5721>Elizabeth said she saw it.</t5721>
<t5722>"I can't say I wasn't envious of his privilege, but still, I think it would have been too much for me, otherwise I would have passed through there on my way to Newcastle.</t5722> <t5723>You must have seen the old butler, right?</t5723> <t5724>Poor Reynolds, he was always very fond of me.</t5724> <t5725>But of course, he wouldn't have mentioned me to you.</t5725><t5726>"</t5726>
<t5727>"He mentioned it.</t5727><t5728>"</t5728>
<t5729>"So, what did he say?"</t5729><t5730>"</t5730>
<t5731>"He fears that you joined the army because things are not going well.</t5731> <t5732>You know, from afar, news is often strangely misrepresented.</t5732><t5733>"</t5733>
<t5734>"Of course," she replied, biting her lips.</t5734> <t5735>Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him, but Wickham continued shortly after,</t5735>
<t5736>"I was surprised to see Darcy in the city last month.</t5736> <t5737>We passed by each other a few times.</t5737> <t5738>I wondered what he might be doing there.</t5738><t5739>"</t5739>
<t5740>"Maybe he is preparing for a marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said Elizabeth.</t5740> <t5741>"There must be a special reason for him to go there at this time of the year.</t5741><t5742>"</t5742>
<t5743>"Undoubtedly.</t5743> <t5744>Did you see him while you were at Lambton?</t5744> <t5745>From what I understand from the Gardiners, you did.</t5745><t5746>"</t5746>
<t5747>"Yes; he introduced us to his sister."</t5747><t5748>"</t5748>
<t5749>"So, did you like him?</t5749><t5750>"</t5750>
<t5751>"Very much so.</t5751><t5752>"</t5752>
<t5753>"Indeed, I heard that he has made extraordinary progress in the last couple of years.</t5753> <t5754>When I last saw him, he didn't seem very promising.</t5754> <t5755>I'm very glad that you like him.</t5755> <t5756>I hope he continues to improve.</t5756><t5757>"</t5757>
<t5758>"I'm sure he will improve; he has overcome the most difficult period."</t5758><t5759>"</t5759>
<t5760>"Did you go to the village of Kympton?</t5760><t5761>"</t5761>
<t5762>"I don't remember.</t5762><t5763>"</t5763>
<t5764>"I am talking about it because that is the church I should have taken.</t5764> <t5765>A marvelous place!</t5765> <t5766>–A perfect parsonage!</t5766> <t5767>In every way, it suited me very well.</t5767><t5768>"</t5768>
<t5769>"Would you like to give a sermon?</t5769><t5770>"</t5770>
<t5771>"Indeed, how so.</t5771> <t5772>I would consider it part of my duty, and the fatigue would quickly pass.</t5772> <t5773>One should not complain; –but of course, it would be something important for me!</t5773> <t5774>The tranquility and silence of such a life would answer all my dreams of happiness!</t5774> <t5775>But it didn't happen.</t5775> <t5776>Did you ever hear Darcy mention the matter while in Kent?</t5776><t5777>"</t5777>
<t5778>"I heard it from an authoritative source, which is equally acceptable to me, that it was left to you conditionally, dependent on the current owner's will.</t5778><t5779>"</t5779>
<t5780>"Is that so?</t5780> <t5781>Yes, there was something like that; I told you right from the beginning, you remember.</t5781><t5782>"</t5782>
<t5783>"I have also heard that there was a time when preaching did not bring you as much joy as it does now, and you had clearly stated that you decided not to take your clerical appointment, and the matter was settled accordingly.</t5783><t5784>"</t5784>
<t5785>"Is that so! It's not entirely baseless.</t5785> <t5786>You remember what I told you about that when we first talked.</t5786><t5787>"</t5787>
<t5788>They were now almost at the door of the house; Elizabeth had walked quickly to get rid of him; for the sake of her sister, she did not want to provoke him, so she replied with a meek smile and simply said,</t5788>
<t5789>"Come on, Mr. Wickham, we are now like siblings.</t5789> <t5790>Let's not fight because of the past.</t5790> <t5791>I hope we will always agree in the future.</t5791><t5792>"</t5792>
<t5793>She extended her hand; although Wickham did not know how to look at her, he kissed her hand with warm eagerness, and they entered the house.</t5793>
<t5794>Chapter XI</t5794>
<t5795>Mr. Wickham was so satisfied with this conversation that he never troubled himself again, nor did he provoke his dear sister Elizabeth by bringing up the subject; Elizabeth was pleased to see that he had spoken in a way that would shut his mouth.</t5795>
<t5796>The day they were to go with Lydia came quickly; since her husband did not agree to the plan of all going to Newcastle together, Mrs. Bennet had to resign herself to a separation that seemed to last at least twelve months.</t5796>
<t5797>"Oh my dear Lydia," he sighed, "when will we see each other again?</t5797><t5798>"</t5798>
<t5799>"Oh God, I don't know.</t5799> <t5800>Maybe we won't see each other for two or three years.</t5800><t5801>"</t5801>
<t5802>"Write to me often, my dear."</t5802><t5803>"</t5803>
<t5804>"I write at every opportunity.</t5804> <t5805>But you know, married women don't have much time to write letters.</t5805> <t5806>My sisters can write to me.</t5806> <t5807>They have no other work to do.</t5807><t5808>"</t5808>
<t5809>Mr. Wickham's farewell was much more amiable than his wife's.</t5809> <t5810>He smiled, looked pleasant, and said many sweet words.</t5810>
<t5811>"A charming man," said Mr. Bennet, as they left the house, "he lacks nothing.</t5811> <t5812>He smiles, grins, and wins us all over.</t5812> <t5813>I am exceedingly proud of him.</t5813> <t5814>I have even surpassed Sir William Lucas, for I have produced a more valuable son-in-law.</t5814><t5815>"</t5815>
<t5816>Losing her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very sorrowful for a few days.</t5816>
<t5817>"I often think," he said, "there is nothing worse than being separated from the ones you love.</t5817> <t5818>When your loved ones are not with you, you feel very strange.</t5818><t5819>"</t5819>
<t5820>"This is the result of marrying off a daughter, Madam," said Elizabeth.</t5820> <t5821>"The fact that your other four daughters are single should comfort you.</t5821><t5822>"</t5822>
<t5823>"It's not like that.</t5823> <t5824>Lydia didn't leave me because she got married; she left because her husband's regiment was far away.</t5824> <t5825>If it were nearby, she wouldn't have had to leave so quickly.</t5825><t5826>"</t5826>
<t5827>But the unpleasant mood that this event put her in passed quickly, and her mind was once again opened to the excitement of hope with news that had begun to circulate at that time.</t5827> <t5828>The housekeeper of Netherfield had received instructions to prepare for her master's arrival; he would be coming in a few days to hunt for a few weeks.</t5828> <t5829>Mrs. Bennet began to tremble with excitement.</t5829> <t5830>She looked at Jane, smiled, and kept nodding her head.</t5830>
<t5831>"Oh my, so Mr. Bingley is coming, sister," (Mrs. Philips brought the news because.</t5831><t5832>)</t5832> <t5833>"Well, that's very good.</t5833> <t5834>Not that I care, though.</t5834> <t5835>It doesn't mean anything to us, you know, I don't even think I want to see his face.</t5835> <t5836>However, it's a good thing he's coming to Netherfield, since he likes it.</t5836> <t5837>But who can know what will happen?</t5837> <t5838>But that doesn't concern us.</t5838> <t5839>You know, sister, we decided long ago not to talk about this again.</t5839> <t5840>So, is he definitely coming?</t5840><t5841>"</t5841>
<t5842>"You can be sure," the other replied, "because Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and I went out myself to learn the truth; she told me it was definitely true.</t5842> <t5843>He is coming no later than Thursday, probably on Wednesday.</t5843> <t5844>The woman was going to town, she said, to order meat for Wednesday, and she bought three pairs of ducks, just ready to be slaughtered.</t5844><t5845>"</t5845>
<t5846>Miss Bennet's face blushed upon hearing of Mr. Bingley's arrival.</t5846> <t5847>It had been months since Elizabeth had spoken of him; but now, as soon as they were alone, she said,</t5847>
<t5848>"When my aunt gave this news today, I saw you looking at me, Lizzy; I know I seemed disturbed.</t5848> <t5849>But don't think it was for a foolish reason.</t5849> <t5850>I was just confused for a moment because I felt like I was being watched.</t5850> <t5851>Be assured that the news neither brought me joy nor sorrow.</t5851> <t5852>I'm only pleased about one thing, that he is coming alone; then we will see him less.</t5852> <t5853>It's not that I'm afraid of myself, but I'm horrified by what others might say.</t5853><t5854>"</t5854>
<t5855>Elizabeth could not understand what to make of this.</t5855> <t5856>If she had not seen Bingley in Derbyshire, she might have believed that he came there with no other thought than what was said; but she still thought he was interested in Jane, and she was undecided between the possibility that he came there with his friend's permission, which was very likely, and the possibility that he came without his permission.</t5856>
<t5857>"Still," he thought from time to time, "how unfortunate that this poor man cannot come to a house he has officially rented without arousing so much suspicion!</t5857> <t5858>I will leave him to his own devices.</t5858><t5859>"</t5859>
<t5860>Despite what her sister had said about his arrival and what she believed to be her true feelings, Elizabeth could easily see that her mood was affected by it.</t5860> <t5861>Her mood became more uneasy, more changeable compared to before.</t5861>
<t5862>About twelve months ago, the topic that was heatedly discussed between his mother and father has now been brought up again.</t5862>
<t5863>"As soon as Mr. Bingley arrives, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "you must go visit him.</t5863><t5864>"</t5864>
<t5865>"No, no.</t5865> <t5866>Last year you forced me to visit and promised that if I went, you would marry one of my daughters.</t5866> <t5867>But nothing came of it; I won't go anywhere falling for such lies.</t5867><t5868>"</t5868>
<t5869>His wife explained to him that such an interest was absolutely necessary for the neighboring gentlemen if he were to return to Netherfield.</t5869>
<t5870>"A habit I despise," said Mr. Bennet.</t5870> <t5871>"If he wants our friendship, let him come and ask for it.</t5871> <t5872>Our place is well known.</t5872> <t5873>I will no longer waste my time running after my neighbors because they come and go.</t5873><t5874>"</t5874>
<t5875>"Well, all I know is that if you don't visit, it will be terribly rude.</t5875> <t5876>However, that doesn't prevent me from inviting him to dinner.</t5876> <t5877>I'm determined, I mean.</t5877> <t5878>We must also get Mrs. Long and the Gouldings right away.</t5878> <t5879>If we include ourselves, we become thirteen people, and there's only one spot left at the table for him.</t5879><t5880>"</t5880>
<t5881>"I start to feel sad when he is coming," said Jane to her sister.</t5881> <t5882>"It won't matter; I can remain quite indifferent to him, but I can't stand everyone talking about him.</t5882> <t5883>My mother is well-meaning, but she doesn't know, no one can know how much her words upset me.</t5883> <t5884>I will be genuinely happy when he leaves Netherfield!</t5884><t5885>"</t5885>
<t5886>"I wish I could say something to comfort you," Elizabeth replied; "but I can't.</t5886> <t5887>You must feel this; that familiar solace of urging patience to someone who is suffering has not been granted to me, because you already have so much of it.</t5887><t5888>"</t5888>
<t5889>Mr. Bingley arrived.</t5889> <t5890>Mrs. Bennet, with the help of the servants, managed to get the news as quickly as possible, regardless of how long her period of anxiety and distress would last.</t5890> <t5891>She counted the days that had to pass before the invitation could be sent, as she had no hope of seeing him earlier.</t5891> <t5892>But on the third morning of his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw from her bedroom window that he was entering the lawn on his horse and approaching the house.</t5892>
<t5893>The girls were invited to join in a flurry of excitement.</t5893> <t5894>Jane remained resolutely at her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to please her mother, went to the window – looked out – saw Mr. Darcy beside her, and sat down again next to her sister.</t5894>
<t5895>"There is a gentleman with her, mother," said Kitty; "who could it be?</t5895><t5896>"</t5896>
<t5897>"He might be a friend, darling; I don't know.</t5897><t5898>"</t5898>
<t5899>"Yo!" said Kitty, "he looks just like the man who used to be with you.</t5899> <t5900>Mr. something.</t5900> <t5901>That tall, proud man.</t5901><t5902>"</t5902>
<t5903>"Oh my God! Mr. Darcy! –I swear it's him.</t5903> <t5904>I mean, Mr. Bingley's friend is always welcome, but I must say I hate seeing this man.</t5904><t5905>"</t5905>
<t5906>Jane looked at Elizabeth with astonishment and concern.</t5906> <t5907>She didn't know much about their meeting in Derbyshire, so she felt the tension her sister must have experienced almost for the first time since receiving her explanatory letter.</t5907> <t5908>Both sisters were quite uncomfortable.</t5908> <t5909>They were excited both for each other and for themselves; meanwhile, their mother was berating Mr. Darcy, saying that the only reason she decided to be kind to him, without either of them hearing, was because he was Mr. Bingley's friend.</t5909> <t5910>But Elizabeth's discomfort had reasons that Jane could not guess; Elizabeth had not yet found the courage to show her Mrs. Gardiner's letter or to explain the change in her feelings towards Darcy.</t5910> <t5911>To Jane, he could only be a man whose proposal she had rejected and whose worth she had not appreciated; but Elizabeth knew well that he was the man to whom the whole family owed gratitude, and she felt a reasonable and justified affection for him, if not quite love, at least as much as Jane felt for Bingley.</t5911> <t5912>His arrival – his arrival at Netherfield, at Longbourn, and his voluntary search for her again – astonished her as much as when she first witnessed the change in his behavior in Derbyshire.</t5912>
<t5913>The color that had left her face returned half a minute later with an added brightness, and at that moment, thinking that Darcy's interest and dreams must still be alive, a smile of delight added a sparkle to her eyes.</t5913> <t5914>But she couldn't be sure.</t5914>
<t5915>"Let me first see how he behaves," he said; "it is still too early to hope for more.</t5915><t5916>"</t5916>
<t5917>She resolutely set to her crochet work, trying to appear busy, not daring to lift her eyes, until, as the servant approached the door, a curiosity filled with unease carried her eyes to her sister's face.</t5917> <t5918>Jane looked paler than usual, but calmer than Elizabeth had expected.</t5918> <t5919>When the gentlemen appeared, her color heightened, yet she greeted them quite comfortably, with a dignified demeanor that showed neither any sign of resentment nor unnecessary joy.</t5919>
<t5920>Elizabeth spoke to both of them only as much as politeness required and returned to her work with an attention that was not at all necessary for the task.</t5920> <t5921>She had dared to glance at Darcy only once.</t5921> <t5922>He looked as serious as ever; just as he appeared in Hertfordshire, she thought, rather than how he looked at Pemberley.</t5922> <t5923>But perhaps he couldn't be the same around his mother as he was around her uncle and aunt.</t5923> <t5924>It was a painful, but not impossible, conjecture.</t5924>
<t5925>She had also seen Bingley for a moment, and in that short time, she saw that he was both pleased and uncomfortable.</t5925> <t5926>They had been greeted by Mrs. Bennet with a politeness that embarrassed her two daughters, especially when compared to the cold and formal politeness in her curtsy and conversation with his friend.</t5926>
<t5927>Elizabeth, knowing that her mother owed Darcy for protecting her favorite daughter from an irreparable disgrace, was deeply hurt and ashamed by such a grave misjudgment.</t5927>
<t5928>After Darcy asked her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were and received a vague answer, he didn't say much.</t5928> <t5929>He wasn't sitting close to her; maybe that was the reason for his silence; but it hadn't been like this in Derbyshire.</t5929> <t5930>There, when he couldn't talk to her, he had talked to his friends.</t5930> <t5931>But now, a few minutes had passed without his voice being heard; occasionally, when she couldn't resist her curiosity and raised her eyes to his face, she found him looking at Jane as much as at herself, and often with his eyes cast down.</t5931> <t5932>It was clearly expressed that he was more thoughtful and less intent on pleasing than the last time they had met.</t5932> <t5933>Elizabeth was disappointed, and because she was disappointed, she was angry with herself.</t5933>
<t5934>"Could I have expected it to be any different!" he said.</t5934> <t5935>"But then why did he come?</t5935><t5936>"</t5936>
<t5937>He didn't feel like talking to anyone else, but he didn't have the courage to talk to him either.</t5937>
<t5938>He asked about his sister's well-being, but he couldn't do anything else.</t5938>
<t5939>"It's been a long time since you left, Mr. Bingley," said Mrs. Bennet.</t5939>
<t5940>Mr. Bingley immediately accepted this.</t5940>
<t5941>"I was afraid you wouldn't come back again.</t5941> <t5942>Everyone said so, that you were going to leave the house altogether by Michaelmas; but, nevertheless, I hope that is not true.</t5942> <t5943>Since you left, there have been many changes in our neighborhood.</t5943> <t5944>Miss Lucas got married and left.</t5944> <t5945>One of my daughters as well.</t5945> <t5946>I assume you have heard; of course, you must have read it in the newspapers.</t5946> <t5947>It was written in the Times and the Courier, but of course, they didn't give it the space it deserved.</t5947> <t5948>It merely said, ‘Recently, George Wickham and Miss Lydia Bennet,' without a single word about her father or where she was from or anything else.</t5948> <t5949>It was my brother Gardiner's announcement, moreover; I don't understand how he managed to do such a clumsy job.</t5949> <t5950>Did you see it?</t5950><t5951>"</t5951>
<t5952>Bingley said he saw it and offered his congratulations.</t5952> <t5953>Elizabeth did not dare to lift her eyes.</t5953> <t5954>Therefore, she could not understand how Mr. Darcy looked.</t5954>
<t5955>"It is a very nice thing for a girl to make a good marriage," her mother continued, "but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard for me that she has to go so far away.</t5955> <t5956>They went to Newcastle, which I believe is quite far north, who knows how long they will stay there.</t5956> <t5957>His regiment is there; because I suppose you have heard that he left the --------shire regiment and joined the regular army.</t5957> <t5958>Thank God! he has some friends, perhaps not as many as he deserves.</t5958><t5959>"</t5959>
<t5960>Knowing that this was directed at Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth was in such miserable shame that she could barely stay in her place.</t5960> <t5961>On the other hand, this forced her to speak, as nothing else could have had such an effect; she asked Bingley if he was planning to stay in the countryside for a long time.</t5961> <t5962>A few weeks, said Bingley.</t5962>
<t5963>"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," said his mother, "please come here and shoot as many birds as you like on Mr. Bennet's estate.</t5963> <t5964>I am sure he will be exceedingly happy to host you and will reserve all the best partridges for you.</t5964><t5965>"</t5965>
<t5966>In the face of such unnecessary, such absurd interest, Elizabeth's embarrassment increased even more!</t5966> <t5967>She believed that if the same good chance that had come their way a year ago were to arise now, everything would quickly lead to the same painful outcome.</t5967> <t5968>At that moment, she felt that even years of happiness would not be able to erase these bitter moments of shame for Jane and herself.</t5968>
<t5969>"My only wish," he said to himself, "is to no longer be near any of them.</t5969> <t5970>Their presence cannot provide the happiness to compensate for such shame!</t5970> <t5971>I don't want to see either of them ever again!</t5971><t5972>"</t5972>
<t5973>Nevertheless, the feeling that years of happiness could not compensate was considerably alleviated when she saw that her sister's beauty rekindled the admiration of her former lover.</t5973> <t5974>When Bingley first entered, he had spoken very little with her; but every five minutes, he seemed to pay her more attention.</t5974> <t5975>He found her as beautiful as last year, as harmonious and at ease; though perhaps not as talkative.</t5975> <t5976>Jane feared that Bingley would find no change in her and truly believed she was talking as much as ever.</t5976> <t5977>But her mind was so full that she was not always aware of her silence.</t5977>
<t5978>When the gentlemen rose, Mrs. Bennet remembered the courtesy she had planned; they were invited to dine at Longbourn and agreed on a date a few days later.</t5978>
<t5979>"You owe me a visit, Mr. Bingley," she added, "because when you went to the city last winter, you promised to have a family dinner with us as soon as you returned.</t5979> <t5980>You see, I haven't forgotten; and believe me, I was very hurt that you didn't keep your word when you came back.</t5980><t5981>"</t5981>
<t5982>Bingley was a bit dumbfounded by these words and complained about being hindered by work and such.</t5982> <t5983>Then they left.</t5983>
<t5984>Mrs. Bennet very much wanted to invite them to stay for dinner that day, but although her table was always quite good, she thought that less than two courses would not be enough to please a man about whom she had such enthusiastic plans or to satisfy the appetite and pride of another who earned ten thousand a year.</t5984>
<t5985>Chapter XII</t5985>
<t5986>As soon as the guests left, Elizabeth went outside to lift her spirits, or in other words, to think uninterruptedly about matters that would further dampen her mood.</t5986> <t5987>Mr. Darcy's behavior had upset and distressed her.</t5987>
<t5988>"If he only came to be silent, serious, indifferent," he said, "why did he come?</t5988><t5989>"</t5989>
<t5990>He couldn't give a response that would please him.</t5990>
<t5991>"While in the city, he was still polite and warm towards my uncle and aunt, so why isn't he like that towards me?</t5991> <t5992>If he's afraid of me, why did he come here?</t5992> <t5993>If he doesn't care about me, why did he sit down and stay quiet?</t5993> <t5994>What an exasperating man!</t5994> <t5995>I won't think about him anymore.</t5995><t5996>"</t5996>
<t5997>With her sister's arrival, she involuntarily adhered to her decision for a short while; Jane joined her with a cheerful demeanor that showed she was more pleased with the guests than Elizabeth.</t5997>
<t5998>"Now that I've gotten through this first encounter," he said, "I feel quite comfortable.</t5998> <t5999>I know my own strength; his arrival won't bother me anymore.</t5999> <t6000>I'm glad he's coming for dinner on Tuesday.</t6000> <t6001>Everyone will see, we both come together as ordinary, indifferent friends.</t6001><t6002>"</t6002>
<t6003>"Yes, quite indifferent," said Elizabeth, laughing.</t6003> <t6004>"Oh Jane, be careful.</t6004><t6005>"</t6005>
<t6006>"My dear Lizzy, you can't think I'm that weak, the danger has passed for me.</t6006><t6007>"</t6007>
<t6008>"I think you're in real danger now, you're making him fall in love with you again.</t6008><t6009>"</t6009>
<t6010>-------------------------</t6010>
<t6011>They did not see their gentlemen again until Tuesday; meanwhile, Mrs. Bennet once more indulged herself in all those happy dreams brought to life by Bingley's cheerfulness and indiscriminate politeness during his half-hour visit.</t6011>
<t6012>On Tuesday, a large gathering took place at Longbourn; the two most eagerly awaited individuals arrived right on time, not disappointing the confidence placed in their punctuality.</t6012> <t6013>As they moved to the dining room, Elizabeth watched with excitement to see if Bingley would sit in the place that used to be his during previous parties, next to her sister.</t6013> <t6014>Her shrewd mother, who had the same thought, restrained herself from inviting him to sit there.</t6014> <t6015>When Bingley entered the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane looked around and smiled: the decision was made.</t6015> <t6016>Bingley settled next to Jane.</t6016>
<t6017>Elizabeth looked at Bingley's friend with a sense of triumph.</t6017> <t6018>Darcy met this situation with noble indifference; Elizabeth would have thought that Bingley had received permission to be happy, but she saw that his eyes also turned towards Darcy, with an expression of semi-joking fear.</t6018>
<t6019>Bingley's behavior towards his sister throughout the meal was so full of admiration that Elizabeth, although more cautious than before, felt that if Bingley were left entirely to his own devices, Jane's happiness, and consequently her own, would be swiftly secured.</t6019><t6020>Even if she did not dare to be certain of the outcome, she took pleasure in observing Bingley's actions.</t6020><t6021>This lifted her spirits somewhat; for she had no cheerfulness.</t6021><t6022>Mr. Darcy was as far away from her as the table could separate them.</t6022><t6023>He was beside her mother.</t6023><t6024>Elizabeth knew that such a position would be unpleasant for both of them and would not even give them the opportunity to behave comfortably.</t6024><t6025>She was not close enough to hear their conversation, but she could see that they rarely spoke, and when they did, their manner was formal and cold.</t6025><t6026>Her mother's ingratitude made the sense of indebtedness to him even more painful for Elizabeth, and sometimes it seemed she would do anything to have the chance to say that not everyone in the family was unaware of or unappreciative of his kindness.</t6026>
<t6027>He held the hope that the evening would give them the opportunity to come together, that the entire visit would not end without providing a chance for conversation beyond the solemn greetings at the entrance.</t6027> <t6028>He was anxious and uncomfortable; the time spent in the living room before the gentlemen arrived was filled with a dullness and tedium that almost led to rudeness.</t6028> <t6029>He eagerly awaited their arrival as the turning point for all the happiness of the evening.</t6029>
<t6030>"If he doesn't come to me then," she said, "I will give up on him forever.</t6030><t6031>"</t6031>
<t6032>The gentlemen arrived; Elizabeth thought Darcy looked as if he might respond to her hopes; but where! The ladies had gathered so closely around the table where Miss Bennet was making tea and Elizabeth was serving coffee that there wasn't even enough space for a chair to fit around Elizabeth.</t6032> <t6033>Moreover, as the gentlemen approached, one of the girls moved even closer and whispered in her ear,</t6033>
<t6034>"Men cannot come between us and separate us; I am determined."</t6034> <t6035>"We don't want any of them, right?"</t6035><t6036>"</t6036>
<t6037>Darcy had walked to another corner of the room.</t6037> <t6038>Elizabeth followed him with her eyes, envied everyone he spoke to, found it hard to muster the patience to offer coffee to everyone, and then got very angry with herself for being so foolish!</t6038>
<t6039>"A man who has been rejected once!</t6039> <t6040>How could I be so foolish as to expect him to repeat his love?</t6040> <t6041>Is there a single man who would not resist the weakness of proposing to the same woman a second time?</t6041> <t6042>There is no other indignity that would hurt their feelings so much!</t6042><t6043>"</t6043>
<t6044>Still, his face brightened a bit when he brought the empty coffee cup himself, and he immediately seized the opportunity to speak:</t6044>
<t6045>"Is your sister still at Pemberley?</t6045><t6046>"</t6046>
<t6047>"Yes; he will stay there until Christmas"</t6047>
<t6048>"All alone?"</t6048> <t6049>"Have all his friends left?"</t6049><t6050>"</t6050>
<t6051>"Mrs. Annesley is with her.</t6051> <t6052>The others have gone to Scarborough for three weeks.</t6052><t6053>"</t6053>
<t6054>Nothing else came to mind to say; but if Darcy had wanted to chat with him, he could have been more successful.</t6054> <t6055>However, he stood silently beside her for a few minutes and finally walked away when the young lady whispered something in Elizabeth's ear.</t6055>
<t6056>When the tea trays were cleared away and the game tables were set up, all the ladies stood up; Elizabeth was expecting that she would come to her side immediately, but then saw that her mother had fallen prey to the whist players' hunt and, a few minutes later, had sat down at the table with the rest of the group, shattering all her hopes.</t6056> <t6057>Now she had lost all hope of happiness.</t6057> <t6058>They were confined to different tables throughout the evening, and aside from the frequent glances he cast her way, as if he wished her to be as unsuccessful in the game as he was, there was nothing left for her to hope for.</t6058>
<t6059>Mrs. Bennet had planned to detain the two gentlemen from Netherfield for dinner; but unfortunately, their carriage had been ordered earlier than the others, so she did not have the opportunity to keep them.</t6059>
<t6060>"Well, girls," she said as soon as they were alone.</t6060> <t6061>"What do you think of today?</t6061> <t6062>I think everything went extraordinarily well.</t6062> <t6063>The table was beautifully set.</t6063> <t6064>The venison was cooked to perfection – everyone said they had never seen such a well-fed leg.</t6064> <t6065>The soup was fifty times better than the one we had at the Lucases' last week; even Mr. Darcy said the partridges were marvelous, and he probably has two or three French chefs.</t6065> <t6066>Oh Jane, I have never seen you look so beautiful.</t6066> <t6067>Mrs. Long said the same, because I asked her how you looked.</t6067> <t6068>And do you know what else she said?</t6068> <t6069>‘Oh Mrs. Bennet, we will finally see her at Netherfield.' She really said that.</t6069> <t6070>I think Mrs. Long is the best person in the world – her nieces are very well-mannered girls, though they are not at all pretty, but I like them very much.</t6070><t6071>"</t6071>
<t6072>In short, Mrs. Bennet was extremely delighted; she had seen enough of Bingley's behavior towards Jane to be convinced that he would eventually win her over; her expectations regarding her family's happiness, especially when she was in high spirits, were so beyond reason that she was greatly disappointed when she saw that Bingley did not come to propose the next day.</t6072>
<t6073>"It was quite a successful day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.</t6073> <t6074>"The guests were well chosen, everyone was suitable for each other.</t6074> <t6075>I hope we gather often again.</t6075><t6076>"</t6076>
<t6077>Elizabeth smiled.</t6077>
<t6078>"Lizzy, you shouldn't do this.</t6078> <t6079>You shouldn't suspect me.</t6079> <t6080>It bothers me.</t6080> <t6081>I've learned to chat with Bingley like with a sensible young man, without imagining anything beyond that, believe me.</t6081> <t6082>I'm so pleased with his current behavior that he has never tried to win my love.</t6082> <t6083>It's just that he has a sweeter manner and a stronger desire to please others than anyone else.</t6083><t6084>"</t6084>
<t6085>"You are very cruel," said his sister, "you neither allow me to smile, nor do you stop provoking me to smile at every moment.</t6085><t6086>"</t6086>
<t6087>"Sometimes it is so difficult to be convincing!</t6087><t6088>"</t6088>
<t6089>"Most of the time, how impossible it is!</t6089><t6090>"</t6090>
<t6091>"But why do you want to convince me that I feel more than I say?"</t6091><t6092>"</t6092>
<t6093>"This is a question whose answer I do not know well either.</t6093> <t6094>We all love to give advice, but we can only manage to teach things that are not worth knowing.</t6094> <t6095>Forgive me; but if you insist on remaining indifferent, at least don't make me your confidant.</t6095><t6096>"</t6096>
<t6097>Chapter XIII</t6097>
<t6098>A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, alone.</t6098> <t6099>His friend had left him that morning to go to London, but he would return home within ten days.</t6099> <t6100>He sat with them for more than an hour; he was noticeably cheerful.</t6100> <t6101>Mrs. Bennet invited him to dinner, but with many expressions of regret, he confessed that he had another engagement.</t6101>
<t6102>"Next time you come," he said, "I hope we will be luckier.</t6102><t6103>"</t6103>
<t6104>Of course, he would be very happy, etc. etc.; but if he was allowed, he would come back to visit them at the first opportunity.</t6104>
<t6105>"Can you come tomorrow?</t6105><t6106>"</t6106>
<t6107>Yes, there was no promise for tomorrow; the invitation was accepted with pleasure.</t6107>
<t6108>He arrived; and he arrived at such a good time that none of the ladies had dressed yet.</t6108> <t6109>Mrs. Bennet, in her dressing gown, with her hair half done, burst into her daughter's room, screaming.</t6109>
<t6110>"My dear Jane, hurry up, come down quickly.</t6110> <t6111>He has arrived.</t6111> <t6112>–Mr. Bingley has arrived.</t6112> <t6113>–He has arrived, I swear.</t6113> <t6114>Quick, quick.</t6114> <t6115>Come on, Sarah, look after Miss Bennet, help with her dress.</t6115> <t6116>Forget about Miss Lizzy's hair.</t6116><t6117>"</t6117>
<t6118>"We will go down when we are ready," said Jane; "but I am sure Kitty is ahead of us, she went up half an hour ago.</t6118><t6119>"</t6119>
<t6120>"Aman, leave Kitty alone! What does she have to do with it?</t6120> <t6121>Hurry up, hurry up! Where is your belt, darling?</t6121><t6122>"</t6122>
<t6123>But when her mother left, Jane was unwilling to go downstairs without one of her sisters.</t6123>
<t6124>The effort to leave them alone became evident in the evening as well.</t6124> <t6125>After tea, Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library as was his custom, and Mary went upstairs to her piano.</t6125> <t6126>With two of the five obstacles thus removed, Mrs. Bennet began making facial gestures to Elizabeth and Catherine to seize the opportunity, but they did not notice.</t6126> <t6127>Elizabeth was not looking at her; finally, when Kitty saw her, she innocently said, "What is it, mother?</t6127> <t6128>Why do you keep winking at me?</t6128> <t6129>What am I supposed to do?</t6129><t6130>"</t6130>
<t6131>"Nothing, my child, nothing.</t6131> <t6132>I didn't wink at you."</t6132> <t6133>Then he sat motionless for another five minutes; but since he couldn't risk wasting such a valuable opportunity, he suddenly stood up and said to Kitty,</t6133>
<t6134>"Come on, my dear, I want to talk to you," he said and took her out of the room.</t6134> <t6135>Jane immediately gave Elizabeth a look that showed her distress at such a plan and asked her not to allow it.</t6135> <t6136>A few minutes later, Mrs. Bennet partially opened the door and called out,</t6136>
<t6137>"Lizzy, my dear, I want to talk to you.</t6137><t6138>"</t6138>
<t6139>Elizabeth had to leave.</t6139>
<t6140>"We should leave them alone," said her mother as soon as she stepped into the hall.</t6140> <t6141>"Kitty and I are going upstairs, we'll be sitting in my dressing room.</t6141><t6142>"</t6142>
<t6143>Elizabeth did not attempt to argue with her mother; she waited quietly in the hall until she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned to the sitting room.</t6143>
<t6144>Mrs. Bennet's plans for that day were ineffective.</t6144> <t6145>Bingley was delightful in every way, except as a potential suitor for her daughter.</t6145> <t6146>With his ease and cheerfulness, he was a wonderful guest for evening gatherings; he endured the mother's tedious meddling, listened to all her foolish remarks with patience and a dignified expression, and earned her daughter's great admiration.</t6146>
<t6147>He didn't even need to be invited to stay for dinner; before leaving, it was agreed, mostly through his and Mrs. Bennet's efforts, that he would come the next morning to go hunting with her husband.</t6147>
<t6148>After that day, Jane never spoke of her indifference again.</t6148> <t6149>Among the sisters, Bingley's name was not even mentioned; but Elizabeth went to bed with a happy belief that everything would be swiftly resolved if Mr. Darcy did not return on the stated date.</t6149> <t6150>Seriously, it was as if she believed all this was happening with that gentleman's consent.</t6150>
<t6151>Bingley arrived for his appointment right on time; he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together as planned.</t6151> <t6152>Mr. Bennet was much more agreeable than his hunting companion had expected.</t6152> <t6153>In Bingley, there was not the slightest hint of arrogance or foolishness to provoke his sense of mockery or to disgust him into silence; the other was more talkative and less self-absorbed than he had seen him before.</t6153> <t6154>Bingley, of course, returned with him for dinner; in the evening, Mrs. Bennet's wit once again began to work to keep everyone away from Bingley and her daughter.</t6154> <t6155>Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, withdrew to the breakfast room right after tea for this purpose; since the others were going to sit down for a card game, her mother's plans could not be opposed.</t6155>
<t6156>When the letter was finished and she returned to the living room, she saw with great astonishment that her mother had reason to fear she was too skillful for her.</t6156> <t6157>When she opened the door, she saw her sister and Bingley standing in front of the fireplace as if they were engaged in an excited conversation; even if this did not arouse suspicion, their faces as they hurriedly turned and moved away from each other would have been enough to tell everything.</t6157> <t6158>Their demeanor was quite strange; but Jane's condition seemed even worse.</t6158> <t6159>Neither of them said a word; Elizabeth was about to turn back and leave when Bingley, who was seated like the other, suddenly stood up, whispered a few words to her sister, and rushed out of the room.</t6159>
<t6160>She couldn't hide anything from Jane Elizabeth, especially when revealing her secret would bring joy; she immediately hugged her and, with vivid excitement, said that she was the happiest person in the world.</t6160>
<t6161>"This is too much!" he added, "really too much.</t6161> <t6162>I don't deserve this.</t6162> <t6163>Oh! why isn't everyone this happy?</t6163><t6164>"</t6164>
<t6165>Elizabeth sincerely, warmly, and joyfully expressed her congratulations, even if words fell short.</t6165> <t6166>Every kind sentence became a new source of happiness for Jane.</t6166> <t6167>But at that moment, she was not willing to stay with her sister and recount things superficially.</t6167>
<t6168>"I must go to my mother immediately;" she exclaimed.</t6168> <t6169>"I can never disregard her affectionate curiosity, nor can I allow her to hear the news from anyone but me.</t6169> <t6170>Bingley has already gone to my father.</t6170> <t6171>Oh, Lizzy, to know what great pleasure my news will bring to my dear family! How will I endure so much happiness?</t6171><t6172>"</t6172>
<t6173>Then he hurried to his mother; his mother had deliberately disrupted the card game and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.</t6173>
<t6174>Elizabeth, left to herself, smiled as she thought about how quickly and easily the matter that had left them in months of curiosity and tension was finally resolved.</t6174>
<t6175>"This," he said, "is the end of all those fear-filled objections of your friend, the end of all the lies and deceit of your sister! the happiest, the wisest, the most reasonable end!</t6175><t6176>"</t6176>
<t6177>A few minutes later, Bingley came over; his meeting with his father had been short and to the point.</t6177>
<t6178>"Where is your sister?" he said hurriedly, as he opened the door.</t6178>
<t6179>"Upstairs, next to my mother.</t6179> <t6180>I think she'll come down right away.</t6180><t6181>"</t6181>
<t6182>Then he closed the door, came to her, and asked for her good wishes and support as a sister.</t6182> <t6183>Elizabeth expressed her sincere and enthusiastic happiness about their relationship.</t6183> <t6184>They shook hands warmly; then, until her sister came down, she had to listen to what Bingley said about his own happiness and Jane's superior qualities; she was truly convinced that despite being in love, all his expectations of happiness were based on reason, because they were founded on Jane's perfect understanding, extraordinary nature, and the similarity of feelings and tastes between them.</t6184>
<t6185>It was an evening filled with exceptional happiness for all; the satisfaction in Miss Bennet's soul gave her face such a sweet glow of liveliness that it made her look more beautiful than ever.</t6185> <t6186>Kitty grinned, smiled, and wished for her turn to come quickly.</t6186> <t6187>Although Mrs. Bennet did not talk about anything else to Bingley for half an hour, she could not manage to give her consent or express her positive opinions in a manner warm enough to satisfy herself; when Mr. Bennet joined them at dinner, both his voice and actions showed how truly happy he was.</t6187>
<t6188>However, not a single hint about the matter came out of his mouth until the guests asked for permission to leave for the night; but when they left, he turned to his daughter and said,</t6188>
<t6189>"Jane, I congratulate you.</t6189> <t6190>You will be a very happy woman.</t6190><t6191>"</t6191>
<t6192>Jane went right up to him, kissed him, and thanked him for his kindness.</t6192>
<t6193>"You are a good girl," replied her father, "thinking that you will have such a happy marriage makes me very happy.</t6193> <t6194>I have no doubt that you will get along well.</t6194> <t6195>Your temperaments are not different.</t6195> <t6196>You are both so gentle that you will not insist on anything, so easygoing that every servant will deceive you, so generous that you will always spend more than your income.</t6196><t6197>"</t6197>
<t6198>"I hope we don't spend it.</t6198> <t6199>In matters of money, recklessness or thoughtlessness would be unforgivable from my perspective.</t6199><t6200>"</t6200>
<t6201>"Spending more than his income!"</t6201> <t6202>"Mr. Bennet, my dear," cried his wife, "what are you talking about?</t6202> <t6203>What do you mean, the child has four or five thousand a year, probably more."</t6203> <t6204>Then turning to her daughter, "Oh my dear Jane, I am so happy!</t6204> <t6205>I won't be able to sleep all night.</t6205> <t6206>I knew it would be like this.</t6206> <t6207>I always said it would end like this.</t6207> <t6208>You couldn't be this beautiful for nothing!</t6208> <t6209>I remember, when he first came to Hertfordshire last year, I knew as soon as I saw him that you would come together.</t6209> <t6210>Oh, the handsomest man that ever lived!</t6210><t6211>"</t6211>
<t6212>Wickham, Lydia, they were all forgotten.</t6212> <t6213>Jane was his indisputably favorite daughter.</t6213> <t6214>At that moment, no one else mattered to him.</t6214> <t6215>Soon, the youngest sisters began to coax him for the objects of happiness he could distribute in the future.</t6215>
<t6216>Mary asked for permission to use the library at Netherfield; Kitty also begged a lot to have a few balls every winter.</t6216>
<t6217>From that time on, Bingley naturally became a daily visitor at Longbourn; he often arrived before breakfast and always stayed until late at night, except on those few days when a merciless neighbor, whom it would be inadequate to call inconsiderate, invited him to dinner and he was obliged to accept.</t6217>
<t6218>Elizabeth no longer found much time to chat with her sister; with Bingley around, Jane had no inclination to pay attention to anyone else; but Elizabeth sometimes found that the hours of separation, which occasionally had to intervene, were quite beneficial to both of them.</t6218> <t6219>When Jane was not around, Bingley devoted himself to Elizabeth, because he enjoyed conversing with her; and when Bingley left, Jane felt the same need for relief.</t6219>
<t6220>"It made me so happy," said Jane one evening, "that he didn't know I was in the city last spring.</t6220> <t6221>It had never even occurred to me that this could be possible.</t6221><t6222>"</t6222>
<t6223>"I had suspected," replied Elizabeth.</t6223> <t6224>"But how did he explain it?</t6224><t6225>"</t6225>
<t6226>"His sisters must have a job.</t6226> <t6227>Of course, they didn't like him being friends with me, which doesn't surprise me, because in many ways he could have made a more advantageous choice.</t6227> <t6228>But when his sisters see that he is happy with me, which I am sure they will, they will learn to accept it and things will be good between us again; but we can never be as close as we used to be.</t6228><t6229>"</t6229>
<t6230>"This is the most intolerant speech I've heard from you," said Elizabeth.</t6230> <t6231>"Well done! I don't want to see you fooled by Miss Bingley's false interest again.</t6231><t6232>"</t6232>
<t6233>"Would you believe it, Lizzy, when he went to the city last November, he really loved me; he just didn't come back because he believed I was indifferent!"</t6233><t6234>"</t6234>
<t6235>"It seems he made a small mistake; but even this shows his humility."</t6235><t6236>"</t6236>
<t6237>This remark naturally led Jane to launch into a praise-filled speech about Bingley's modesty and his disregard for his own merits.</t6237>
<t6238>Elizabeth was glad that Bingley's friend's intervention was not revealed, because although Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew that this situation would make her prejudiced against Darcy.</t6238>
<t6239>"I am the luckiest person in the world!" Jane exclaimed.</t6239> <t6240>"Oh, Lizzy, why was I chosen from my family, why did fortune smile upon me!</t6240> <t6241>If only I could see you this happy!</t6241> <t6242>If only there were such a man for you!</t6242><t6243>"</t6243>
<t6244>"Even if you give me forty men, I cannot be as happy as you.</t6244> <t6245>Until I have your nature, your goodness, I cannot possess your happiness.</t6245> <t6246>No, no, I will take care of myself; perhaps, if luck is on my side, I may encounter another Mr. Collins in time.</t6246><t6247>"</t6247>
<t6248>The development in the Longbourn family could not remain a secret for long.</t6248> <t6249>Mrs. Bennet hinted the news to Mrs. Philips, who, without any permission, spread it to all her neighbors in Meryton.</t6249>
<t6250>The Bennets were quickly declared the luckiest family in the world, whereas just a few weeks ago, when Lydia first eloped, they were seen by everyone as the epitome of misfortune.</t6250>
<t6251>Chapter XIV</t6251>
<t6252>One morning, about a week after Bingley and Jane's engagement was broken off, while Bingley and the ladies of the family were sitting in the dining room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage; they saw a four-horse carriage coming up the lawn.</t6252> <t6253>It was an early hour for a visitor, and the carriage did not resemble that of any of their neighbors.</t6253> <t6254>The horses were rented; neither the carriage nor the uniform of the footman in front looked familiar.</t6254> <t6255>But since it was certain that someone had arrived, Bingley immediately persuaded Miss Bennet to walk with him in the grove to avoid being taken captive by such an uninvited guest.</t6255> <t6256>The two of them left; the other three continued to speculate, but they were not very successful until the door opened and the guest entered.</t6256> <t6257>The visitor was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.</t6257>
<t6258>They were all ready to be surprised, of course; but they were astonished more than they had ever expected; even though they did not know the lady at all, the astonishment felt by Mrs. Bennet and Kitty was mild compared to Elizabeth's.</t6258>
<t6259>He entered the room with a more arrogant air than usual, barely nodding in response to Elizabeth's greeting, and sat down without saying a word.</t6259> <t6260>Although no introduction had been requested, Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother upon the lady's entrance.</t6260>
<t6261>Mrs. Bennet, who was astonished, greeted the important guest with great courtesy, even though it flattered her pride to host such a significant visitor.</t6261> <t6262>After sitting in silence for a moment, she said to Elizabeth in a rather tense manner,</t6262>
<t6263>"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.</t6263> <t6264>This lady must be your mother.</t6264><t6265>"</t6265>
<t6266>Elizabeth briefly said that it was so.</t6266>
<t6267>"This must be one of your sisters, I suppose."</t6267><t6268>"</t6268>
<t6269>"Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, in the pleasure of speaking with the grand Lady Catherine.</t6269> <t6270>"The one just older than the youngest.</t6270> <t6271>My youngest just got married, and my eldest is somewhere around, on a walk with a young gentleman, who I believe will soon be part of the family.</t6271><t6272>"</t6272>
<t6273>"You have a small garden here," replied Lady Catherine after a brief silence.</t6273>
<t6274>"Compared to Rosings, it is indeed so, madam, certainly; but rest assured, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."</t6274><t6275>"</t6275>
<t6276>"This room is not suitable for sitting in on summer evenings; the windows face directly west.</t6276><t6277>"</t6277>
<t6278>Mrs. Bennet assured them that they did not sit there after dinner, then added,</t6278>
<t6279>"May I ask Ladyship if Mr. and Mrs. Collins were well when they parted?</t6279><t6280>"</t6280>
<t6281>"Yes, quite well.</t6281> <t6282>I saw them the previous night.</t6282><t6283>"</t6283>
<t6284>Elizabeth must have brought a letter from Charlotte to her, she thought she would take it out and give it to her, because that could be the only possible reason for her visit.</t6284> <t6285>But when no letter came out, she became even more confused.</t6285>
<t6286>Mrs. Bennet wanted to offer something to her ladyship with great politeness, but Lady Catherine very firmly and quite rudely refused to eat anything; then she stood up and said to Elizabeth,</t6286>
<t6287>"Miss Bennet, it seems you have a nice little wood on one side of your lawn.</t6287> <t6288>I would like to take a walk, if you would accompany me.</t6288><t6289>"</t6289>
<t6290>"Go, darling," cried her mother, "show the lady our walking paths.</t6290> <t6291>I believe she will like the hermit's hut.</t6291><t6292>"</t6292>
<t6293>Elizabeth agreed; she ran to her room, grabbed her umbrella, and accompanied the noble guest downstairs.</t6293> <t6294>As they walked through the corridor, Lady Catherine opened the doors of the dining room and the sitting room, and after a brief glance inside, declared them to be well-kept rooms and continued walking.</t6294>
<t6295>Her carriage was waiting at the door; Elizabeth saw that her maid was in the carriage.</t6295> <t6296>They proceeded silently along the gravel path leading to the grove; Elizabeth was determined not to attempt to converse with the woman, who was now more arrogant and repulsive than usual.</t6296>
<t6297>"How did I mistake him for my nephew?" he thought, while looking at his face.</t6297>
<t6298>As soon as they entered the grove, Lady Catherine began to speak:-</t6298>
<t6299>"You probably won't be surprised to learn why I came here, Miss Bennet.</t6299> <t6300>Your own heart, your own conscience should tell you why I came."</t6300><t6301>"</t6301>
<t6302>Elizabeth looked with emotionless astonishment.</t6302>
<t6303>"Believe me, you are mistaken, madam.</t6303> <t6304>I did not understand what I owe the honor of seeing you here.</t6304><t6305>"</t6305>
<t6306>"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship in an angry tone, "you must know that I am not to be trifled with.</t6306> <t6307>Even if you choose to be insincere, you will find that I am not.</t6307> <t6308>I am known for my frankness and honesty, and in a situation like this, I certainly will not abandon them.</t6308> <t6309>A very alarming rumor reached me two days ago.</t6309> <t6310>I was told that not only is your sister on the verge of making a very successful marriage, but you, Miss Elizabeth Bennet, are likely to follow her by uniting with my nephew, my only nephew, Mr. Darcy.</t6310> <t6311>Although I know this to be a dreadful falsehood, I would never wrong him by considering it possible, but I decided to come here immediately so that you may know my views.</t6311><t6312>"</t6312>
<t6313>"If you didn't believe it could be true," said Elizabeth, her face pale with astonishment and disgust, "I wonder why you bothered to come all this way.</t6313> <t6314>What is her ladyship trying to convey with this?</t6314><t6315>"</t6315>
<t6316>"Of course, to insist on denying such a rumor.</t6316><t6317>"</t6317>
<t6318>"Coming to Longbourn to see me and my family," said Elizabeth coldly, "will be more of a confirmation of this; that is, if such a rumor exists.</t6318><t6319>"</t6319>
<t6320>"So, you pretend as if you don't know.</t6320> <t6321>Wasn't this skillfully orchestrated by you?</t6321> <t6322>Don't you know that such a rumor has been spread around?</t6322><t6323>"</t6323>
<t6324>"I've never heard of it."</t6324><t6325>"</t6325>
<t6326>"Can you also say that this is unfounded in the same way?</t6326><t6327>"</t6327>
<t6328>"I will not pretend to have the same level of frankness as Her Ladyship.</t6328> <t6329>You may ask questions, but I will choose not to answer.</t6329><t6330>"</t6330>
<t6331>"It's unbearable.</t6331> <t6332>Miss Bennet, I insist on getting an answer.</t6332> <t6333>Did my nephew propose to you?</t6333><t6334>"</t6334>
<t6335>"The Lady expressed that this was impossible.</t6335><t6336>"</t6336>
<t6337>"It has to be that way; it must be that way, if he hasn't lost his mind.</t6337> <t6338>But your coquetries, your flirtations may have momentarily made him forget what he owes to himself and his entire family.</t6338> <t6339>You may have seduced him.</t6339><t6340>"</t6340>
<t6341>"If I did it, I would be the last person to admit it."</t6341><t6342>"</t6342>
<t6343>"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?</t6343> <t6344>I am not accustomed to this kind of language.</t6344> <t6345>I am almost the closest relative she has in the world and am entitled to know all her important matters.</t6345><t6346>"</t6346>
<t6347>"But you are not authorized to know mine; moreover, you cannot persuade me to be open with such an attitude."</t6347><t6348>"</t6348>
<t6349>"I must ensure that I am understood correctly.</t6349> <t6350>The union you dare to imagine can never happen.</t6350> <t6351>No, never.</t6351> <t6352>Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter.</t6352> <t6353>Now, let's see what you have to say?</t6353><t6354>"</t6354>
<t6355>"I will just say this; therefore, you have no reason to think that he will propose to me.</t6355><t6356>"</t6356>
<t6357>Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, then replied,</t6357>
<t6358>"Their engagement is of a special kind.</t6358> <t6359>They were promised to each other when they were still babies.</t6359> <t6360>That was the wish of his mother, and mine too.</t6360> <t6361>We planned this union while they were still in the cradle: but now, when the wishes of both families are about to be fulfilled, when both are about to marry, a young woman of lower status, with no importance in the world, and no family ties, is preventing this!</t6361> <t6362>Do you have no respect for the wishes of his relatives?</t6362> <t6363>What about his silent engagement to Miss de Bourgh?</t6363> <t6364>Have you lost all sense of shame and decency?</t6364> <t6365>Didn't you hear me say that he was promised to his cousin from birth?</t6365><t6366>"</t6366>
<t6367>"Yes, I heard what you said.</t6367> <t6368>But what does that matter to me?</t6368> <t6369>If there is no other obstacle to marrying your nephew, of course, I will not give up just because his mother and aunt Miss de Bourgh want him to marry someone else.</t6369> <t6370>You have done your best by planning the marriage.</t6370> <t6371>Its realization depends on others.</t6371> <t6372>If Mr. Darcy is not bound by honor or affection to his cousin, why shouldn't he make another choice?</t6372> <t6373>If that choice is me, why shouldn't I accept him?</t6373><t6374>"</t6374>
<t6375>"Because honor, decorum, common sense, and even interests forbid it.</t6375> <t6376>Yes, Miss Bennet, interests; because if you knowingly act against their preferences, do not expect to be accepted by his family and friends.</t6376> <t6377>You will be ostracized, scorned, and ignored by everyone associated with him.</t6377> <t6378>Your marriage will be a disgrace; your name will not be mentioned by any of us.</t6378><t6379>"</t6379>
<t6380>"These are grave misfortunes," replied Elizabeth.</t6380> <t6381>"But Mr. Darcy's wife would have such extraordinary sources of happiness from being with him that there would be no reason to be upset about these."</t6381><t6382>"</t6382>
<t6383>"Stubborn, headstrong girl!</t6383> <t6384>I am ashamed of you!</t6384> <t6385>Is this how you were going to thank me for the attention I showed you last spring?</t6385> <t6386>Don't you owe me since then?</t6386>
<t6387>"Let's sit down.</t6387> <t6388>You will understand, Miss Bennet, I came here determined to achieve my purpose; I will not give up.</t6388> <t6389>I have never bowed to anyone's whims in my life.</t6389> <t6390>I have never tolerated a no as an answer in my life.</t6390><t6391>"</t6391>
<t6392>"This lady's current situation makes it even more pitiable, but it cannot affect me.</t6392><t6393>"</t6393>
<t6394>"Do not interrupt me.</t6394> <t6395>Listen to me quietly.</t6395> <t6396>My daughter and my niece were considered for each other.</t6396> <t6397>They come from the same noble lineage on their mother's side, and from respectable, honorable, and old families on their father's side, even if without titles.</t6397> <t6398>Their wealth on both sides is immense.</t6398> <t6399>In the eyes of every member of both families, they belong to each other; so what will separate them?</t6399> <t6400>The arrogant dreams of a young woman without family, relatives, or wealth.</t6400> <t6401>Is this something to be endured!</t6401> <t6402>Absolutely not, and it will not be.</t6402> <t6403>If you thought of your own good, you would not want to leave the environment in which you grew up.</t6403><t6404>"</t6404>
<t6405>"I will not think that I have left that circle by marrying your nephew.</t6405> <t6406>He is a gentleman; I am also the daughter of a gentleman; in this respect, we are equal.</t6406><t6407>"</t6407>
<t6408>"Correct.</t6408> <t6409>You are a gentleman's daughter.</t6409> <t6410>But who is your mother?</t6410> <t6411>Who are your uncles and aunts?</t6411> <t6412>Don't think I'm unaware of them.</t6412><t6413>"</t6413>
<t6414>"Whoever my relatives may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they are none of your concern.</t6414><t6415>"</t6415>
<t6416>"Tell me honestly, are you engaged to her?</t6416><t6417>"</t6417>
<t6418>Actually, Elizabeth would not have answered this question to please Lady Catherine, but after thinking for a moment, she couldn't help but respond,</t6418>
<t6419>"No.</t6419><t6420>"</t6420>
<t6421>Lady Catherine seemed pleased.</t6421>
<t6422>"Well, will you promise me that you won't get engaged?"</t6422><t6423>"</t6423>
<t6424>"I cannot make such a promise.</t6424><t6425>"</t6425>
<t6426>"Miss Bennet, I am shocked, horrified.</t6426> <t6427>I thought I would find a more reasonable young woman.</t6427> <t6428>But do not deceive yourself into thinking I will give up.</t6428> <t6429>I will not leave here until you give me the guarantee I want.</t6429><t6430>"</t6430>
<t6431>"I will never give in.</t6431> <t6432>You cannot intimidate me into something so irrational.</t6432> <t6433>Lady, you want Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but will giving you the promise you seek make their marriage possible?</t6433> <t6434>Assuming he loves me, will my rejection of his proposal make him propose to your daughter?</t6434> <t6435>Let me tell you, Lady Catherine, the reasons supporting this extraordinary request are as absurd as the request itself.</t6435> <t6436>If you think I will be influenced by such words, you are greatly mistaken about my character.</t6436> <t6437>I do not know how much your nephew approves of your interference in his private affairs, but you have no right to interfere in mine.</t6437> <t6438>Therefore, I ask you, please do not prolong this matter any further.</t6438><t6439>"</t6439>
<t6440>"Not so fast.</t6440> <t6441>I'm not finished.</t6441> <t6442>There is one more thing I want to add to all the objections I have made.</t6442> <t6443>I am not unaware of the details of your youngest brother's disgraceful escape.</t6443> <t6444>I know everything; the young man's marriage to her was a hastily arranged affair, orchestrated by your father and uncle.</t6444> <t6445>Will such a girl become my nephew's sister-in-law?</t6445> <t6446>Will her husband, the son of her late father's steward, become his brother-in-law?</t6446> <t6447>God forbid! –what do you say to that?</t6447> <t6448>Will the shades of Pemberley be thus polluted?</t6448><t6449>"</t6449>
<t6450>"You can't say anything else now," he replied with distress.</t6450> <t6451>"You have insulted me in every possible way.</t6451> <t6452>With your permission, I am returning home.</t6452><t6453>"</t6453>
<t6454>He stood up while saying these words.</t6454> <t6455>Lady Catherine also stood up and they turned back.</t6455> <t6456>Her Ladyship was quite angry.</t6456>
<t6457>"So, you have no respect for my nephew's honor and dignity!</t6457> <t6458>Heartless, selfish girl!</t6458> <t6459>Don't you ever think that being involved with you will ruin his reputation in everyone's eyes?</t6459><t6460>"</t6460>
<t6461>"Lady Catherine, I have nothing more to say.</t6461> <t6462>You know my thoughts.</t6462><t6463>"</t6463>
<t6464>"So, you're going to marry him, is that right?</t6464><t6465>"</t6465>
<t6466>"I didn't say such a thing.</t6466> <t6467>According to my own view, I am determined to act only in a way that will make me happy; I don't care what you or others who have nothing to do with me say.</t6467><t6468>"</t6468>
<t6469>"Alright.</t6469> <t6470>So you refuse.</t6470> <t6471>You refuse to fulfill the requirements of duty, honor, and gratitude.</t6471> <t6472>You are determined to ruin him in the eyes of all his friends, to disgrace him before the world.</t6472><t6473>"</t6473>
<t6474>"Neither duty, nor honor, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "can influence me in such a situation.</t6474> <t6475>There is nothing in my marrying Mr. Darcy that violates these principles.</t6475> <t6476>As for offending the family or the world's disdain, if his family gets excited about marrying me, it wouldn't worry me for a moment – and the world knows better than to concern itself with such matters.</t6476><t6477>"</t6477>
<t6478>"So this is your true opinion!</t6478> <t6479>This is your final decision!</t6479> <t6480>Very well.</t6480> <t6481>I know what I will do.</t6481> <t6482>Do not think that Miss Bennet will reap the rewards of ambition.</t6482> <t6483>I came here to test you.</t6483> <t6484>I hoped to find you reasonable; but be assured, I will do what I have set my mind to.</t6484><t6485>"</t6485>
<t6486>Lady Catherine kept talking like this until they reached the car door; then she turned hastily and added these words,</t6486>
<t6487>"I am not asking for your permission, Miss Bennet.</t6487> <t6488>I am not sending my regards to your mother either.</t6488> <t6489>You do not deserve such attention.</t6489> <t6490>You have seriously annoyed me.</t6490><t6491>"</t6491>
<t6492>Elizabeth did not respond; without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return home, she quietly walked into the house on her own.</t6492> <t6493>As she was going upstairs, she heard the carriage driving away.</t6493> <t6494>Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room, asking why Lady Catherine had not come back in to rest.</t6494>
<t6495>"She didn't want to," said the girl.</t6495> <t6496>"She was going to leave."</t6496><t6497>"</t6497>
<t6498>"What a pleasant woman! It was extremely kind of her to visit us! because surely she came just to tell us that the Collinses are well.</t6498> <t6499>Obviously, she was going somewhere else and thought of stopping by to see you while passing through Meryton.</t6499> <t6500>She didn't have anything special to tell you, did she, Lizzy?</t6500><t6501>"</t6501>
<t6502>Elizabeth had to resort to a bit of lying at this point; because it was impossible to explain the subject of their conversations.</t6502>
<t6503>Chapter XV</t6503>
<t6504>It was not easy for Elizabeth to overcome the annoyance caused by this extraordinary visit; she could not manage to stop thinking about it for hours at a time.</t6504> <t6505>Lady Catherine had evidently gone to all the trouble of coming from Rosings to there just to break off her imaginary engagement with Mr. Darcy.</t6505> <t6506>It was indeed a clever plan! But Elizabeth had no idea where the rumor of their engagement could have originated; eventually, she thought that Darcy being Bingley's close friend, and him being Jane's brother, at a time when everyone was expecting one wedding, was enough to give rise to the idea of a second one.</t6506> <t6507>She had not forgotten that her sister's marriage would bring them together more frequently.</t6507> <t6508>So, their neighbors at Lucas Lodge (since they communicated with the Collinses, she concluded that the rumor had reached Lady Catherine through them) had conveyed what Elizabeth saw as a possibility for the future as if it were a done deal.</t6508>
<t6509>However, while contemplating Lady Catherine's statements, she couldn't help but feel a bit uneasy about the likely outcome of her insistence on this intervention.</t6509> <t6510>From what she said about her decision to prevent their marriage, Elizabeth thought she might be planning to make a request to her nephew; if she conveyed the same negatives of being related to him, Elizabeth dared not think how Darcy would respond.</t6510> <t6511>She did not know the exact degree of his attachment to his aunt or how much he valued her opinions, but it was natural for him to hold Lady Catherine in higher regard than Elizabeth could; moreover, it was certain that while listing the troubles of marrying someone whose close relatives were so inferior to his own, his aunt would be appealing to his weakest point.</t6511> <t6512>Darcy, with his views on nobility that Elizabeth found weak and ridiculous, would probably feel that these claims were reasonable and thoroughly considered.</t6512>
<t6513>If Darcy was undecided about what he should do until then, which often seemed to be the case, the suggestions and desires of such a close relative could dispel any doubt and lead him to happiness within the possibilities of unblemished nobility in an instant.</t6513> <t6514>In that case, he would not return.</t6514> <t6515>Lady Catherine could stop by to see him while going to the city; and the promise he made to Bingley to return to Netherfield would be forgotten.</t6515>
<t6516>"So, if instead of keeping the promise he made to his friend to return in a few days, he sends an apology letter," she added, "I know how to interpret that.</t6516> <t6517>Then I will put an end to every hope, every wish related to his commitment.</t6517> <t6518>If missing me will suffice for him when he could have my love and my yes, I will immediately stop missing him.</t6518><t6519>"</t6519>
<t6520>------------------------</t6520>
<t6521>The other family members were greatly surprised to hear who had come to visit; but they dispelled it with the same kind of assumption that satisfied Mrs. Bennet's curiosity, thus sparing Elizabeth from being pressed on the matter.</t6521>
<t6522>The next morning, while coming down the stairs, he encountered his father coming out of the library with a letter in his hand.</t6522>
<t6523>"Lizzy," said her father, "I was just about to look for you; come to my room."</t6523><t6524>"</t6524>
<t6525>Elizabeth entered after her father; her curiosity about what he had to say increased even more when she thought it might somehow be related to the letter in her hand.</t6525> <t6526>Suddenly, she thought the letter might have come from Lady Catherine, and she anxiously considered all the explanations that would entail.</t6526>
<t6527>He followed his father to the fireplace; they sat together.</t6527> <t6528>His father began to speak,</t6528>
<t6529>"This morning, I received a letter that surprised me greatly.</t6529> <t6530>It actually concerns you, so you have the right to know its contents.</t6530> <t6531>I did not know before that my two daughters were on the verge of marriage.</t6531> <t6532>Allow me to congratulate you on this very important achievement.</t6532><t6533>"</t6533>
<t6534>The belief that the letter was not from her aunt but from her niece caused blood to rush to Elizabeth's cheeks; she could not decide whether to be pleased that Darcy had finally expressed himself or to be offended that he had not written the letter to her; her father continued,</t6534>
<t6535>"It is understood that you know.</t6535> <t6536>Young ladies have strong intuitions about such matters; but I think I can even surpass your intelligence in discovering the name of your admirer.</t6536> <t6537>This letter is from Mr. Collins.</t6537><t6538>"</t6538>
<t6539>"From Mr. Collins! What could he possibly have to say?</t6539><t6540>"</t6540>
<t6541>"Something aimed at the purpose, of course.</t6541> <t6542>Obviously, he heard from the good-hearted, gossiping Lucases, starting by congratulating on my eldest daughter's upcoming wedding.</t6542> <t6543>I will not test your patience by reading what he said on that matter.</t6543> <t6544>Here's what he said about you.</t6544> <t6545>"After thus presenting the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me add a brief word on another matter we learned from the same source.</t6545> <t6546>Your daughter Elizabeth, it is said, will not bear the Bennet name for long after her sister leaves; her chosen life partner also deserves to be admired as one of the most magnificent personalities in this land.</t6546><t6547>"</t6547>
<t6548>"I suppose you can guess whom I mean, can't you, Lizzy?" "This young gentleman is specially blessed with everything mortal hearts might desire – a dazzling fortune, noble blood, and generous patronage.</t6548> <t6549>Yet despite all this charm, I must warn my cousin Elizabeth and yourself about the troubles you might face due to the sudden cancellation of this gentleman's proposals, which you would naturally wish to accept immediately.</t6549><t6550>"</t6550>
<t6551>"Do you have any idea who this gentleman is, Lizzy?</t6551> <t6552>But it is coming to light.</t6552><t6553>"</t6553>
<t6554>"The reason I am warning you is this.</t6554> <t6555>We have reasons to believe that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look favorably upon the marriage.</t6555><t6556>"</t6556>
<t6557>"Mr. Darcy, yes, our man is him!</t6557> <t6558>Now I must have surprised you, Lizzy.</t6558> <t6559>Could Mr. Collins or the Lucases find another man among our acquaintances whose name would make their lies so obvious?</t6559> <t6560>Mr. Darcy, a man who looks at women only to find faults, and who probably has never even looked at you in his life!</t6560> <t6561>They are magnificent, indeed!</t6561><t6562>"</t6562>
<t6563>Elizabeth wanted to join in her father's amusement, but she could only manage a very joyless smile.</t6563> <t6564>Her father's sarcasm had never seemed so unpleasant to her.</t6564>
<t6565>"Didn't you have fun?</t6565><t6566>"</t6566>
<t6567>"Ah yes.</t6567> <t6568>Please continue.</t6568><t6569>"</t6569>
<t6570>"After informing her ladyship of this marriage possibility last night, she immediately, as usual, condescended to express her feelings on the matter; it became clear that she would never consent to what she called a disgraceful union due to some objections related to my cousin's family.</t6570> <t6571>I considered it my duty to immediately inform my cousin of this, so that he and his noble admirer would know what they were up against, and not rush into a marriage that had not been properly sanctioned.</t6571> <t6572>Mr. Collins then adds, "I was genuinely very pleased that my cousin Lydia's unfortunate affair had been so well resolved; my only concern is that it is widely known they lived together before the marriage.</t6572> <t6573>However, I will not neglect my professional duties and will not refrain from expressing how surprised I was to hear that you accepted the young couple into your home as soon as the marriage was solemnized.</t6573> <t6574>You have rewarded immorality; if I were the vicar of Longbourn, I would have strongly opposed this.</t6574> <t6575>Of course, you must forgive them as a Christian, but you should never look them in the face again, nor allow their names to be mentioned."</t6575> <t6576>This is his definition of Christian tolerance!</t6576> <t6577>The rest of his letter is about his dear Charlotte's condition; she is expecting a child.</t6577> <t6578>But Lizzy, you seem displeased.</t6578> <t6579>I hope you are not offended; do not pretend to be upset by a silly letter.</t6579> <t6580>Because why do we live? To amuse ourselves with our neighbors, and to laugh at them when it is our turn."</t6580>
<t6581>"Yo," shouted Elizabeth, "I had a great time.</t6581> <t6582>But it's very strange.</t6582><t6583>"</t6583>
<t6584>"Yes, –that's why it's fun anyway.</t6584> <t6585>If they had chosen another man, it wouldn't have been effective; but his absolute indifference and your obvious hatred make the matter wonderfully absurd!</t6585> <t6586>I don't enjoy writing at all, but I wouldn't give up Mr. Collins' letters for any reason.</t6586> <t6587>In fact, when I read his letters, I can't help but find him more valuable than Wickham, even though I quite admire my son-in-law's baseness and deceitfulness.</t6587> <t6588>But please tell me, Lizzy, what did Lady Catherine say about this news?</t6588> <t6589>Did she come to withhold her consent?</t6589><t6590>"</t6590>
<t6591>Elizabeth answered this question with nothing but a laugh; she was not bothered by her father's repetition since the question had been asked without any doubt.</t6591> <t6592>She had never struggled so much to show her feelings differently before.</t6592> <t6593>She had to laugh, even though she preferred to cry.</t6593> <t6594>Her father had cruelly upset her with what he said about Mr. Darcy's indifference; faced with such a lack of understanding, she could do nothing but be surprised or perhaps fear the possibility that she was imagining too much rather than her father seeing too little.</t6594>
<t6595>Chapter XVI</t6595>
<t6596>As Elizabeth more or less expected, instead of receiving an apology letter from his friend, Bingley brought Darcy to Longbourn a few days after Lady Catherine's visit.</t6596> <t6597>The gentlemen arrived early; under the fearful gaze of her daughter, Mrs. Bennet was about to tell Mr. Darcy that they had seen his aunt, but she didn't get the chance because Bingley, wanting to be alone with Jane, suggested they all go for a walk.</t6597> <t6598>The suggestion was accepted.</t6598> <t6599>Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking, and Mary did not have the time, but the other five went out.</t6599> <t6600>Bingley and Jane allowed the others to pass them.</t6600> <t6601>The two of them lagged behind; Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.</t6601> <t6602>Neither of them spoke much; Kitty was too frightened of Darcy to speak; Elizabeth was inwardly reaching a hopeless conclusion, and perhaps Darcy was doing the same.</t6602>
<t6603>They walked towards the Lucases'; Kitty had wanted to visit Maria; without feeling the need to worry, Elizabeth continued to walk bravely alone with Darcy when Kitty left them.</t6603> <t6604>Now it was time to implement her decision, and while she still had her courage, she immediately said,</t6604>
<t6605>"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; I do not care how much I trouble you in order to ease my own feelings.</t6605> <t6606>I can no longer restrain myself; thank you for the unparalleled kindness you have shown to my poor sister.</t6606> <t6607>Since I learned of it, I have been eager to tell you how grateful I feel.</t6607> <t6608>If the other members of my family knew, I would not only express my own gratitude.</t6608><t6609>"</t6609>
<t6610>"I'm sorry, extremely sorry," answered Darcy, with a voice full of astonishment and excitement, "I wouldn't have wanted you to learn something that might disturb you from a faulty perspective.</t6610> <t6611>I didn't think Mrs. Gardiner was so unreliable.</t6611><t6612>"</t6612>
<t6613>"You must not blame my sister-in-law.</t6613> <t6614>It was Lydia's carelessness that first made me think you were involved in the matter; then, of course, I couldn't rest until I learned the details.</t6614> <t6615>On behalf of my entire family, I thank you again and again for your generous sacrifice, which caused you to go through so much trouble and endure so much hardship to find them.</t6615><t6616>"</t6616>
<t6617>"If you are to thank me," replied Darcy, "let it be for your sake alone.</t6617> <t6618>I will not attempt to deny that other motives were added to the wish of pleasing you.</t6618> <t6619>But your family owes me nothing.</t6619> <t6620>Though I respect them, I thought only of you.</t6620><t6621>"</t6621>
<t6622>Elizabeth was too embarrassed to say a single word.</t6622> <t6623>After a short silence, her companion continued, "You are too kind to play games with me.</t6623> <t6624>If your feelings are still the same as they were last April, tell me so at once.</t6624> <t6625>My feelings and wishes have not changed, but a single word from you will silence me on this matter forever.</t6625><t6626>"</t6626>
<t6627>Feeling the unusual strangeness and anxiety in Darcy's demeanor, Elizabeth forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, she made him understand that her feelings had undergone a great change since the time he mentioned, and that she accepted his recent words with gratitude and joy.</t6627> <t6628>The happiness created by this response was of a kind that Darcy had probably never felt before; he expressed himself sincerely and warmly, as might be expected from a man deeply in love.</t6628> <t6629>If Elizabeth had dared to look into his eyes, she could have seen how the expression of heartfelt joy spread across his face and how well it suited him; but, even though she couldn't look, she could listen, and while Darcy proved how important she was to him, he spoke of the feelings that made his love more precious with each passing moment.</t6629>
<t6630>They kept walking, not knowing which direction they were going.</t6630> <t6631>There were so many things to think about, to feel, to say that they couldn't pay attention to anything else.</t6631> <t6632>Elizabeth soon learned that they owed their current understanding to her aunt's efforts; her ladyship had visited while returning via London, where she had recounted her journey to Longbourn, her purpose, and the subject of her conversation with Elizabeth; her ladyship had insisted on every expression that, in her opinion, clearly demonstrated Elizabeth's perversity and impudence, thinking that such a complaint would help in her effort to obtain the promise that Elizabeth had refused to give.</t6632> <t6633>But, contrary to her ladyship's expectations, these had the opposite effect.</t6633>
<t6634>"This taught me to hope," said Darcy; "I had not allowed myself to hope before.</t6634> <t6635>If you had been absolutely, irrevocably determined against me, I knew you well enough to be certain that you would have told Lady Catherine so openly and sincerely.</t6635><t6636>"</t6636>
<t6637>Elizabeth blushed; she laughed while replying, "Yes, you know my frankness well enough to believe that I could do this.</t6637> <t6638>After speaking so ill of you to your face, I would not hesitate to speak ill of you to your relatives.</t6638><t6639>"</t6639>
<t6640>"What did you say to me that I didn't deserve?</t6640> <t6641>Your accusations were baseless, built on faulty assumptions, but my behavior towards you at that time deserved the harshest condemnation.</t6641> <t6642>It was unforgivable.</t6642> <t6643>I can't remember it without feeling ashamed.</t6643><t6644>"</t6644>
<t6645>"Let's not argue about who was more at fault that evening," said Elizabeth.</t6645> <t6646>"Neither of our behaviors was entirely blameless, if we think about it carefully; but since then, I hope, we have both made progress in terms of politeness.</t6646><t6647>"</t6647>
<t6648>"I can't make peace with myself that easily.</t6648> <t6649>Recalling my words, actions, attitudes, and expressions from back then, which was months ago, gives me indescribable pain.</t6649> <t6650>I will never forget the very proper scolding I received from you: ‘if only you had behaved more gentlemanly.'</t6650> <t6651>Those were your words.</t6651> <t6652>You have no idea how they tortured me, you can't even imagine; –still, I admit, it took me some time to accept that they were right.</t6652><t6653>"</t6653>
<t6654>"I really didn't expect them to have such a strong impact.</t6654> <t6655>It never even crossed my mind that you would feel that way.</t6655><t6656>"</t6656>
<t6657>"I believe this.</t6657> <t6658>At that time, you thought I was emotionless, I'm sure.</t6658> <t6659>I will never forget the look on your face when you said it was impossible for you to accept me even if I made my offer in a different way.</t6659><t6660>"</t6660>
<t6661>"Ah, then don't repeat what I said.</t6661> <t6662>Remembering these won't be of any use.</t6662> <t6663>Believe me, I've been ashamed of them for a long time too.</t6663><t6664>"</t6664>
<t6665>Darcy mentioned his letter.</t6665> <t6666>"The letter," he said, "did it have a quick effect on you thinking better of me?</t6666> <t6667>Did you find the things described there believable when you read it?</t6667><t6668>"</t6668>
<t6669>Elizabeth explained the effect of the letter and how her old prejudices gradually faded away.</t6669>
<t6670>"I knew," he said, "what I wrote would cause you pain, but it was necessary.</t6670> <t6671>I hope you have destroyed the letter.</t6671> <t6672>There was one part in particular, the introduction, that I would be horrified if you had the chance to read again.</t6672> <t6673>I recall some expressions that might justifiably cause you to hate me.</t6673><t6674>"</t6674>
<t6675>"The letter will certainly be burned, if you deem it necessary for the preservation of my admiration; but, although we both have reasons to think that my views are not entirely unchangeable, I hope they do not change as easily as this statement claims."</t6675><t6676>"</t6676>
<t6677>"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed I was extremely calm and composed, but since then I think it was written in a feeling of terrible rebellion.</t6677><t6678>"</t6678>
<t6679>"The letter may have started with rebellion, but it didn't end that way.</t6679> <t6680>Your farewell itself was the epitome of magnanimity.</t6680> <t6681>But let's not think about the letter anymore.</t6681> <t6682>The feelings of the writer and the recipient are now so different from back then that all the unpleasant events associated with it need to be forgotten.</t6682> <t6683>You should learn a bit of my philosophy.</t6683> <t6684>Think only of as much of the past as you enjoy remembering.</t6684><t6685>"</t6685>
<t6686>"I can't believe you have such a philosophy.</t6686> <t6687>Your view of the past is so far from the possibility of regret that the sense of peace arising from those memories can be explained not by philosophy, but even better, by ignorance.</t6687> <t6688>But it's not the same for me.</t6688> <t6689>Painful memories always remind themselves and it is not possible, nor should it be, to forget them.</t6689> <t6690>Though not in my principles, in my actions I have been a selfish person all my life.</t6690> <t6691>As a child, I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temperament.</t6691> <t6692>I acquired good principles, but I was left to follow them with pride and arrogance.</t6692> <t6693>Unfortunately, as the only son (and for years the only child), I was spoiled by my parents; they themselves were good (especially my father, a man full of love and care), but they gave me permission, encouragement, almost education to be selfish and domineering, to not care about anyone outside my family circle, to despise the rest of humanity, or at least to want to diminish their feelings and values compared to mine.</t6693> <t6694>I was like this from the age of eight to twenty-eight, and I might still be, my beautiful, dear Elizabeth, if it weren't for you!</t6694> <t6695>I owe you so much!</t6695> <t6696>You gave me a lesson that was hard at first, but then very beneficial.</t6696> <t6697>Thanks to you, my feet are on the ground.</t6697> <t6698>I came to you without doubting that I would be accepted.</t6698> <t6699>And you taught me how insufficient all my pride was to make a woman who deserves to be happy, happy.</t6699><t6700>"</t6700>
<t6701>"Did you believe I would accept it then?</t6701><t6702>"</t6702>
<t6703>"Of course.</t6703> <t6704>What about my pride?</t6704> <t6705>I believed that you wanted and were waiting for me to make an offer to you.</t6705><t6706>"</t6706>
<t6707>"My actions may have been wrong, but believe me, they were not intentional.</t6707> <t6708>I never thought of deceiving you, but my impulsiveness often leads me astray.</t6708> <t6709>How much you must have hated me after that evening.</t6709><t6710>"</t6710>
<t6711>"Hate you! </t6711><t6712>Maybe I was angry at first, but my anger soon began to take the right direction.</t6712><t6713>"</t6713>
<t6714>"I am a little hesitant to ask what you thought of me when we met at Pemberley.</t6714> <t6715>Did you blame me for coming?</t6715><t6716>"</t6716>
<t6717>"No, never; I was surprised, that's all.</t6717><t6718>"</t6718>
<t6719>"You would have seen the real surprise on me when I got caught by you.</t6719> <t6720>My conscience was telling me that I had no right to expect any extraordinary kindness; I confess that I was not expecting to see more than I deserved.</t6720><t6721>"</t6721>
<t6722>"At that time my aim," answered Darcy, "was to show you with all my might that I was not narrow-minded enough to regret the past; to earn your forgiveness, to reduce your negative thoughts, and to make you see that your scoldings were taken into account.</t6722> <t6723>I'm not exactly sure when other dreams emerged, but I think it was about half an hour after I saw you.</t6723><t6724>"</t6724>
<t6725>Then, she explained how happy Georgiana was to have met him and how saddened she was by his sudden departure, which naturally led to the reason for that departure; Elizabeth soon learned that Darcy had decided to follow him from Derbyshire to find his sister before leaving the inn, and that his distracted, thoughtful demeanor there was not due to any other struggle but solely to the obstacles in the way of such a purpose.</t6725>
<t6726>He expressed his gratitude again, but it was a subject too painful to be prolonged any further for both of them.</t6726>
<t6727>After walking a few miles aimlessly and preoccupied to the point of not noticing anything, they finally looked at their watches and saw that it was time to go home.</t6727>
<t6728>"What will Mr. Bingley and Jane do, I wonder!" This question brought their relationship to light.</t6728> <t6729>Darcy was quite pleased with their engagement; his friend had informed him of it immediately.</t6729>
<t6730>"May I ask if you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.</t6730>
<t6731>"Not at all.</t6731> <t6732>I knew you would be close when you left.</t6732><t6733>"</t6733>
<t6734>"So you had given permission.</t6734> <t6735>That's what I had assumed."</t6735> <t6736>Although Darcy objected to this statement, Elizabeth understood that it was more or less the case.</t6736>
<t6737>"The night before going to London," said Darcy, "I made a confession to her, which I should have done much earlier.</t6737> <t6738>I told her all those events that made my previous interference in her affairs seem unnecessary and foolish.</t6738> <t6739>She was very surprised.</t6739> <t6740>She hadn't had the slightest suspicion.</t6740> <t6741>I also told her that I believed I was wrong in saying that your sister was indifferent to her; it was very clear that her feelings for your sister had not changed, so I had no doubt they would be happy together.</t6741><t6742>"</t6742>
<t6743>Elizabeth couldn't help but smile at her friend's ease in giving directions.</t6743>
<t6744>"When you said that my brother loved her," he said, "did you say it based on your own observation, or based on what I told you last spring?</t6744><t6745>"</t6745>
<t6746>"The first one.</t6746> <t6747>During my two recent trips here, I observed him from a distance and believed in his love.</t6747><t6748>"</t6748>
<t6749>"Your certainty must have immediately instilled belief in him."</t6749><t6750>"</t6750>
<t6751>"Indeed.</t6751> <t6752>Bingley is genuinely humble.</t6752> <t6753>His shyness prevented him from trusting his own instincts on such an important matter, but trusting me made things easier.</t6753> <t6754>However, there was something I had to admit that, for a while, and justifiably, upset him.</t6754> <t6755>It wouldn't have sat well with me not to tell him that I knew your sister stayed in the city for three months last winter and deliberately kept it from him.</t6755> <t6756>Of course, he was angry.</t6756> <t6757>But his anger didn't last longer than his doubt about your sister's feelings.</t6757> <t6758>He has now completely forgiven me.</t6758><t6759>"</t6759>
<t6760>Elizabeth wanted to say that Mr. Bingley was a sweet friend, and that his being very easy to manage made him very valuable, but she restrained herself.</t6760> <t6761>She remembered that Darcy still needed to learn to be teased, but it was a bit early to start.</t6761> <t6762>Darcy continued the conversation until they got home, imagining Bingley's happiness as pale in comparison to his own.</t6762> <t6763>They parted in the hall.</t6763>
<t6764>Chapter XVII</t6764>
<t6765>"My dear Lizzy, where could you have walked?" This was the question Jane asked Elizabeth as soon as she entered the room, and the same question was posed by all the others when they sat down at the table.</t6765> <t6766>She could only say that they had been walking, without looking at where they were going.</t6766> <t6767>Her face turned red as she spoke; but neither this nor anything else raised any doubts about the truth.</t6767>
<t6768>The evening passed quietly, without anything unusual happening.</t6768> <t6769>The accepted lovers talked and laughed, while the unaccepted ones were silent.</t6769> <t6770>Darcy was not someone who overflowed with joy when he was happy; the excited and bewildered Elizabeth knew she was happy, more than she felt it; because in addition to the current anxiety, there were other obstacles ahead of her.</t6770> <t6771>She could predict what the family would feel when the situation was known; she knew that no one except Jane liked Darcy; she even feared that despite all his wealth and power, the others might hate him.</t6771>
<t6772>He confided in Jane at night.</t6772> <t6773>Although doubt was not Miss Bennet's usual habit, she was definitely unwilling to believe it.</t6773>
<t6774>"You're joking, Lizzy.</t6774> <t6775>It can't be! –You're engaged to Mr. Darcy!</t6775> <t6776>No, no, you can't fool me.</t6776> <t6777>I know it's impossible.</t6777><t6778>"</t6778>
<t6779>"It really was a terrible start!</t6779> <t6780>I only trusted you; if you don't believe me, no one will.</t6780> <t6781>Still, I'm telling the truth.</t6781> <t6782>I'm telling nothing but the truth.</t6782> <t6783>He still loves me; we got engaged.</t6783><t6784>"</t6784>
<t6785>Jane looked at her with suspicion.</t6785> <t6786>"Oh Lizzy! It can't be.</t6786> <t6787>I know how much you hate him.</t6787><t6788>"</t6788>
<t6789>"You know nothing.</t6789> <t6790>These things will be forgotten.</t6790> <t6791>Maybe I never loved him as much as I do now.</t6791> <t6792>But in such situations, having a good memory is not a forgivable thing.</t6792> <t6793>This will be my last remembrance as well.</t6793><t6794>"</t6794>
<t6795>Miss Bennet was still left in a state of astonishment.</t6795> <t6796>Elizabeth tried to convince her again, and this time more seriously.</t6796>
<t6797>"Oh my God! Could it really be true!</t6797> <t6798>But I have to believe you," cried Jane.</t6798> <t6799>"My dear Lizzy, I congratulate you – but are you sure? Forgive my question – I mean, are you absolutely sure you can be happy with him?</t6799><t6800>"</t6800>
<t6801>"I have no doubt.</t6801> <t6802>We have decided among ourselves, we will be the happiest couple in the world.</t6802> <t6803>Are you happy, Jane?</t6803> <t6804>Would you like to have such a brother-in-law?</t6804><t6805>"</t6805>
<t6806>"Indeed, very much.</t6806> <t6807>Nothing could make Bingley or me happier.</t6807> <t6808>But we thought about it and discussed that it was impossible.</t6808> <t6809>So do you really love him very much?</t6809> <t6810>Oh, Lizzy! Whatever you do, don't marry a man you don't love.</t6810> <t6811>Are you sure you love him enough?</t6811><t6812>"</t6812>
<t6813>"Ah yes! When I tell you everything, you will understand that I love you even more.</t6813><t6814>"</t6814>
<t6815>"What do you mean?</t6815><t6816>"</t6816>
<t6817>"I must confess that I love him more than Bingley.</t6817> <t6818>I fear you will be angry about this.</t6818><t6819>"</t6819>
<t6820>"Dear brother, be serious though.</t6820> <t6821>I want to talk seriously.</t6821> <t6822>Tell me everything I need to know right away.</t6822> <t6823>Come on, since when have you been in love with her?</t6823><t6824>"</t6824>
<t6825>"It happened so gradually that I don't even know exactly when it started.</t6825> <t6826>But I guess it dates back to the time when I first saw those magnificent gardens at Pemberley.</t6826><t6827>"</t6827>
<t6828>The renewed request for seriousness had the desired effect; Elizabeth soon convinced Jane of the sincerity of her affection.</t6828> <t6829>Once convinced on this matter, Miss Bennet had no other wish.</t6829>
<t6830>"Now I am very happy," she said, "because you will be as happy as I am.</t6830> <t6831>I have always valued him.</t6831> <t6832>Even just because he loves you, I would always respect him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, he is as valuable to me as both of you.</t6832> <t6833>But Lizzy, you have been very tight-lipped and very cautious with me.</t6833> <t6834>How little you told me about what happened at Pemberley and Lambton!</t6834> <t6835>All I know, I learned not from you, but from someone else.</t6835><t6836>"</t6836>
<t6837>Elizabeth explained the reasons for her secrecy.</t6837> <t6838>She was reluctant to talk about Bingley; the unsettled state of her own feelings similarly prevented her from mentioning her lover's name.</t6838> <t6839>But she would no longer hide her role in Lydia's marriage from him.</t6839> <t6840>Everything was told, and half the night was spent in conversation.</t6840>
<t6841>----------------------</t6841>
<t6842>"My God!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as soon as she went to the window the next morning, "isn't that disagreeable Mr. Darcy coming here again with our dear Bingley!</t6842> <t6843>What could he mean by coming here so often?</t6843> <t6844>Wasn't he supposed to go hunting and leave us in peace?</t6844> <t6845>What are we going to do with him?</t6845> <t6846>Lizzy, go for a walk with him again, so he doesn't get in Bingley's way.</t6846><t6847>"</t6847>
<t6848>Elizabeth could hardly suppress her laughter in the face of such an appropriate offer; nevertheless, her mother's talking back and forth about her was truly upsetting.</t6848>
<t6849>The moment they entered the room, Bingley gave her a meaningful look and shook her hand so warmly that it was clear he knew; immediately after, he called out, "Mr. Bennet, is there no other path around here where Lizzy might lose her way today?"</t6849><t6850>"</t6850>
<t6851>"Mr. Darcy, I recommend that Lizzy and Kitty walk to Oakham Mountain this morning," said Mrs. Bennet.</t6851> <t6852>"It is a long, pleasant road; and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view."</t6852><t6853>"</t6853>
<t6854>"It might be good for others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but I'm sure it will seem too long for Kitty.</t6854> <t6855>Isn't that right, Kitty?</t6855><t6856>"</t6856>
<t6857>Kitty said that she preferred to stay at home.</t6857> <t6858>Darcy said he was eager to see the view from the mountain, and Elizabeth silently agreed.</t6858> <t6859>As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her and said,</t6859>
<t6860>"I'm very sorry, Lizzy, that I had to leave you alone with that grumpy man.</t6860> <t6861>But I hope you don't mind: it's all for Jane's sake, really; you don't need to engage in conversation, just say a few things now and then.</t6861> <t6862>So, don't stress yourself.</t6862><t6863>"</t6863>
<t6864>During the walk, it was decided to obtain Mr. Bennet's consent in the evening.</t6864> <t6865>Elizabeth reserved the task of seeking her mother's consent for herself.</t6865> <t6866>She couldn't decide how her mother would react; sometimes she doubted whether all his wealth and splendor would be enough to overcome her coldness towards the man.</t6866> <t6867>But whether she fiercely opposed the marriage or rejoiced intensely, it was certain that her actions would be equally far from common sense; she couldn't bear for Mr. Darcy to hear either the first excitement of her joy or the initial turmoil of her objection.</t6867>
<t6868>--------------------------</t6868>
<t6869>In the evening, just after Mr. Bennet had withdrawn to the library, he saw Mr. Darcy get up and follow him, and at that moment he felt a great excitement.</t6869> <t6870>He was not afraid that his father would object, but the thought that his father's favorite daughter would upset him with her choice, that sending her off would leave him in tears and regret, was a painful one, and Elizabeth sat in agony until Mr. Darcy returned; seeing the smile on Mr. Darcy's face relieved her a little.</t6870> <t6871>A few minutes later, Mr. Darcy approached the table where Kitty was sitting; pretending to look at the crochet work in his hand, he whispered in her ear, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library."</t6871> <t6872>Elizabeth went immediately.</t6872>
<t6873>Her father was pacing up and down the room, looking serious and worried.</t6873> <t6874>"Lizzy," he said, "what are you doing?</t6874> <t6875>Have you lost your mind to accept this man?</t6875> <t6876>Didn't you always hate him?</t6876><t6877>"</t6877>
<t6878>Oh, how sincerely Elizabeth wished that her previous views and statements had been more moderate!</t6878> <t6879>She wouldn't have had to make extremely disturbing explanations; but now they were necessary, and Elizabeth, albeit with some haste, convinced her father that she loved Mr. Darcy.</t6879>
<t6880>"So, in other words, you are determined to accept it.</t6880> <t6881>Wealthy, of course; you will have more beautiful dresses and more luxurious cars than Jane.</t6881> <t6882>But will these make you happy?</t6882><t6883>"</t6883>
<t6884>"Do you have any objections other than thinking that I'm not interested?"</t6884><t6885>"</t6885>
<t6886>"Not at all.</t6886> <t6887>We all know that he is a proud, repulsive man; but if you really like him, it doesn't matter at all.</t6887><t6888>"</t6888>
<t6889>"Yes, I like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him.</t6889> <t6890>In fact, he has no undue pride.</t6890> <t6891>He is quite friendly.</t6891> <t6892>You don't know him well; so please don't talk about him like that and upset me.</t6892><t6893>"</t6893>
<t6894>"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent.</t6894> <t6895>He is not the kind of man I would dare to refuse anything he condescends to ask for.</t6895> <t6896>If you are determined to accept him, I now give you my consent as well.</t6896> <t6897>But I advise you to think carefully.</t6897> <t6898>I know your character, Lizzy.</t6898> <t6899>I know that if you do not truly love your husband, if you do not feel that he is superior to you, you can neither be happy nor at peace.</t6899> <t6900>Your cheerful disposition would put you in great danger in a marriage that is not conducive to it.</t6900> <t6901>You cannot avoid losing faith and becoming distressed.</t6901> <t6902>My child, do not cause me the pain of seeing that you do not respect your life partner.</t6902> <t6903>You do not know what awaits you.</t6903><t6904>"</t6904>
<t6905>Now, feeling even more emotional, Elizabeth responded in a serious and dignified manner; in the end, by reiterating that she truly liked Mr. Darcy, explaining that her opinion of him had gradually changed, assuring that his love was not a matter of a single day but had been tested by months of waiting, and listing all his good qualities in one go, she dispelled her father's doubts and secured his approval of the marriage.</t6905>
<t6906>"Well, my dear," he said, when Elizabeth had finished her words, "I have nothing more to say.</t6906> <t6907>If that is the case, it means he deserves you.</t6907> <t6908>I wouldn't give you to someone less worthy, my dear Lizzy.</t6908><t6909>"</t6909>
<t6910>To complete the good impression he had created, he told his father about what Mr. Darcy had done for Lydia on his own.</t6910> <t6911>His father listened to these in astonishment.</t6911>
<t6912>"This evening is truly an evening of miracles!</t6912> <t6913>So Darcy did everything; arranged the wedding, paid the money, settled the man's debts, found a job!</t6913> <t6914>It couldn't have been better.</t6914> <t6915>He will save me from a world of trouble and expense.</t6915> <t6916>If my uncle had done it, I would have had to pay him and I would have; but these wild young lovers do everything as they know best.</t6916> <t6917>Tomorrow I will offer to pay him; he will fume, rage, talk about his love for you, and the matter will be closed like that.</t6917><t6918>"</t6918>
<t6919>Then, he remembered how uncomfortable Elizabeth was while reading Mr. Collins' letter a few days ago; after laughing at Elizabeth for a while, he finally allowed her to leave – and as she was leaving the room, he said, "If there are any young men coming for Mary and Kitty, send them in too, while I have nothing else to do."</t6919><t6920>"</t6920>
<t6921>A very heavy burden was thus lifted from Elizabeth; after calmly thinking in her room for about half an hour, she managed to join the others with a reasonable calmness.</t6921> <t6922>Everything was too new to be cheerful, but the evening passed quite peacefully; there was nothing significant left to worry about; the pleasure of comfort and familiarity would come with time.</t6922>
<t6923>When her mother went up to the dressing room at night, Elizabeth followed her and gave her the important news.</t6923> <t6924>The effect of the news was extraordinary; at first, Mrs. Bennet sat motionless, unable to utter a single word.</t6924> <t6925>It took minutes for her to grasp what she had heard; nevertheless, she did not refrain from concluding that she had heard something beneficial for her family or that one of her daughters had received a proposal.</t6925> <t6926>Eventually, she began to recover, stirred in her chair, stood up, sat down again, marveled, and kept talking to herself.</t6926>
<t6927>"Oh my God! What has happened to me! Just think about it! Oh my!</t6927> <t6928>Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought!</t6928> <t6929>But seriously, is it true?</t6929> <t6930>Oh! My dearest Lizzy! How rich and powerful you will be! What allowance, what jewelry, what carriages you will have!</t6930> <t6931>Jane's are nothing in comparison –really nothing.</t6931> <t6932>How delighted I am –how happy I am.</t6932> <t6933>What a charming man! –so handsome! –so tall!</t6933> <t6934>–Oh my dearest Lizzy!</t6934> <t6935>Please apologize on my behalf for never liking him before.</t6935> <t6936>But I hope he doesn't mind.</t6936> <t6937>My sweet Lizzy.</t6937> <t6938>A house in the city! Everything is so classy!</t6938> <t6939>Three of my daughters are married!</t6939> <t6940>Ten thousand pounds a year! Oh God! Something is happening to me.</t6940> <t6941>I am going to lose my mind.</t6941><t6942>"</t6942>
<t6943>These were enough to prove that there could be no doubt about her consent: Elizabeth, who was happy just because she had heard such a storm herself, soon left the place.</t6943> <t6944>But she had not spent even three minutes in her own room when her mother came after her.</t6944>
<t6945>"My dearest child," she exclaimed, "I can't think of anything else!</t6945> <t6946>Ten thousand a year, maybe even more!</t6946> <t6947>Worthy of lords!</t6947> <t6948>And a private wedding.</t6948> <t6949>You will have a marriage certificate from the Archbishop himself, as you should.</t6949> <t6950>But my dearest child, now tell me, what is Mr. Darcy's favorite dish, so we can prepare it for him tomorrow.</t6950><t6951>"</t6951>
<t6952>These words gave troubling hints about how her mother might behave towards the gentleman; although Elizabeth knew she had Darcy's sincere love and her family's consent, she still saw that something was missing.</t6952> <t6953>But the next morning went much better than expected; because Mrs. Bennet, thankfully, looked at her future son-in-law with such admiration that she did not attempt to speak to him, except to show as much interest as she could or to indicate her agreement with his views.</t6953>
<t6954>Elizabeth was pleased to see that her father had taken the trouble to get to know him; soon after, Mr. Bennet reassured Elizabeth by saying that his esteem for him was increasing by the moment.</t6954>
<t6955>"I like all three of my sons-in-law very much," she said.</t6955> <t6956>"Wickham, I think, is my favorite; but it seems I will love your husband as much as Jane's."</t6956><t6957>"</t6957>
<t6958>Chapter XVIII</t6958>
<t6959>When Elizabeth's spirits quickly regained their former liveliness, she asked Mr. Darcy to tell her how he had fallen in love with her.</t6959> <t6960>"How did it begin?" she said.</t6960> <t6961>"I can imagine that once it started, it continued sweetly; but what first moved you?"</t6961><t6962>"</t6962>
<t6963>"I cannot distinguish the hour, or the place, or the look, or the words that started it all.</t6963> <t6964>It was a long time ago.</t6964> <t6965>I found myself in the middle of it before I realized it had begun.</t6965><t6966>"</t6966>
<t6967>"At first, you resisted my beauty, and as for my behavior – my attitude towards you was always on the edge of rudeness, and I never spoke to you without a desire to hurt you.</t6967> <t6968>Now let's be honest; did you love me for my arrogance?</t6968><t6969>"</t6969>
<t6970>"I loved it for the vitality of its soul."</t6970><t6971>"</t6971>
<t6972>"You could also call this arrogance.</t6972> <t6973>It was on the verge of becoming so.</t6973> <t6974>The truth is, you were tired of politeness, meekness, and unpretentious closeness.</t6974> <t6975>You were fed up with women who spoke, looked, and thought just to please you.</t6975> <t6976>I warned you, I caught your interest, because I was nothing like them.</t6976> <t6977>If you weren't truly friendly, you would have hated me for this; but despite the troubles you went through to hide yourself, your feelings were always noble and fair; deep down, you despised those who courted you with such care.</t6977> <t6978>Look – I saved you the trouble of explaining; really, upon thorough reflection, I am starting to find this quite reasonable.</t6978> <t6979>In fact, you never saw any good in me – but when one is in love, no one thinks about that.</t6979><t6980>"</t6980>
<t6981>Was there no kindness in the attention you showed Jane while she was ill at Netherfield?</t6981><t6982>"</t6982>
<t6983>"Dearest Jane! Who could have done less for her?</t6983> <t6984>But still, consider it a virtue.</t6984> <t6985>My good qualities are under your protection, and you exaggerate them as much as possible; it falls to me to find a reason to argue with you again, to make you angry; well, I will start by asking you directly, why were you so reluctant to get to the point?</t6985> <t6986>What was it that embarrassed you so much about me when you first came and dined here?</t6986> <t6987>Especially, why did you act as if you didn't care about me when you arrived?</t6987><t6988>"</t6988>
<t6989>"Because you were serious and silent; you did not give me courage.</t6989><t6990>"</t6990>
<t6991>"But I was tense.</t6991><t6992>"</t6992>
<t6993>"Me too.</t6993><t6994>"</t6994>
<t6995>"When you came to dinner, you could have talked to me more."</t6995><t6996>"</t6996>
<t6997>"Someone who feels less could have spoken."</t6997><t6998>"</t6998>
<t6999>"What a misfortune to have a reasonable answer for everything; and it's another misfortune that I am reasonable enough to accept it!</t6999> <t7000>But, I wonder how much longer you would have continued if you were left on your own.</t7000> <t7001>When would you have spoken if I hadn't asked you?</t7001> <t7002>My decision to thank you for the kindness you showed to Lydia certainly had a great impact.</t7002> <t7003>Too great an impact, I'm afraid; but, if our happiness is born from the breaking of a promise, where is morality? because I had to avoid mentioning that subject.</t7003> <t7004>No, this won't do.</t7004><t7005>"</t7005>
<t7006>"There is no need for you to strain yourself.</t7006> <t7007>Morality is in its place.</t7007> <t7008>Lady Catherine's unacceptable actions to separate us helped dispel all my doubts.</t7008> <t7009>I do not owe my current happiness to your desire to express gratitude.</t7009> <t7010>I couldn't wait for you to bring up the subject.</t7010> <t7011>What my aunt told me gave me hope, so I decided to learn everything as soon as possible.</t7011><t7012>"</t7012>
<t7013>"Lady Catherine has been of great benefit, which is something to be glad about, because she loves to be useful.</t7013> <t7014>But tell me, why did you come to Netherfield?</t7014> <t7015>Was it to ride all the way to Longbourn and be inconvenienced, or did you have more serious intentions?</t7015><t7016>"</t7016>
<t7017>"My true purpose was to see you, and of course, to understand if there could be any hope of making you love me.</t7017> <t7018>The purpose I expressed, or the one I expressed to myself, was to see if your sister still had feelings for Bingley and, if she did, to tell Bingley the truth, which I already did.</t7018><t7019>"</t7019>
<t7020>"Do you have the courage to tell Lady Catherine what awaits her?"</t7020><t7021>"</t7021>
<t7022>"It seems like I need more time than courage, Elizabeth.</t7022> <t7023>On the other hand, it needs to be told; give me paper, I'll tell it right away.</t7023><t7024>"</t7024>
<t7025>"Even if I didn't have a letter to write, I would sit beside you and admire the neatness of your writing, just like another young lady once did.</t7025> <t7026>But I also have an aunt who should not be neglected any longer.</t7026><t7027>"</t7027>
<t7028>Due to her reluctance to admit how much her closeness with Mr. Darcy had been exaggerated, Elizabeth had not yet responded to Mrs. Gardiner's long letter, but now that she had something very pleasing to tell, she felt ashamed that her uncle and aunt had already lost three happy days and immediately wrote the following letter:</t7028>
<t7029>"I should have thanked you earlier, my dear aunt, for enlightening me in such a long, understanding, and satisfactory manner about the details, but to be honest, I was too astonished to write.</t7029> <t7030>You have assumed more than what is actually the case.</t7030> <t7031>But now you can assume whatever you wish; let your dreams run wild; let your imagination soar as far as it can, and if you do not believe that I am truly married, you could not be more mistaken.</t7031> <t7032>Write again at the first opportunity and praise him even more than you did last time.</t7032> <t7033>Thank you repeatedly for not going to the Lake District.</t7033> <t7034>How could I have been so foolish as to want to go there!</t7034> <t7035>Your idea of a pony is marvelous.</t7035> <t7036>We will walk around the grove every day.</t7036> <t7037>I am the happiest person in the world.</t7037> <t7038>Perhaps others have said this before, but none have been so right.</t7038> <t7039>I am even happier than Jane; she merely smiles while I laugh out loud.</t7039> <t7040>Mr. Darcy sends you his endless love, of course, whatever he can spare from me.</t7040> <t7041>You will all come to Pemberley for Christmas.</t7041> <t7042>Yours...</t7042><t7043>"</t7043>
<t7044>The letter Mr. Darcy wrote to Lady Catherine had a different tone; but what was truly distinct was the letter Mr. Bennet wrote in response to Mr. Collins' last letter.</t7044>
<t7045>"Dear Sir,</t7045>
<t7046>I have to once again offer my congratulations to you.</t7046> <t7047>Elizabeth will soon be Mr. Darcy's wife.</t7047> <t7048>Console Lady Catherine as much as you can.</t7048> <t7049>But, if I were you, I would get close to the nephew.</t7049> <t7050>He has much more to offer.</t7050>
<t7051>Yours sincerely.</t7051><t7052>"</t7052>
<t7053>Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother on his impending marriage were full of sweetness and insincerity.</t7053> <t7054>She even wrote to Jane because of the marriage, expressed her joy, and repeated all her former displays of affection.</t7054> <t7055>Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; although she did not trust her, she could not help but write a much kinder response than she knew was deserved.</t7055>
<t7056>The joy Miss Darcy expressed upon receiving the same news was as sincere as the joy of her brother who sent the news.</t7056> <t7057>Two pages, front and back, were not enough to convey her satisfaction and her desire to be loved by her sister-in-law.</t7057>
<t7058>Before receiving a reply from Mr. Collins or congratulations from his wife to Elizabeth, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses would personally come to Lucas Lodge.</t7058> <t7059>The reason for this sudden departure was soon understood.</t7059> <t7060>Lady Catherine was so enraged by the contents of her nephew's letter that Charlotte, who was genuinely happy about the marriage news, wanted to stay away until the storm passed.</t7060> <t7061>The arrival of her friend at such a moment sincerely delighted Elizabeth; however, when they came together, she must have thought that this joy came at a heavy price upon seeing Mr. Darcy subjected to all the noisy and slavish politeness of her friend's husband.</t7061> <t7062>Nevertheless, Mr. Darcy endured these with admirable calmness.</t7062> <t7063>He even listened with a very dignified manner to Sir William Lucas, who complimented him on taking away the brightest jewel of the neighborhood and expressed his hope of meeting frequently at St. James's.</t7063> <t7064>When he was about to shrug, he waited until Sir William was out of sight.</t7064>
<t7065>Mrs. Philips's wildness, however, became another source of distress that truly tested her patience; like her sister, Mrs. Philips was so intimidated by her that she couldn't speak to her with the ease they derived from Bingley's good nature, but when she did speak, she became even wilder.</t7065> <t7066>Although her respect for her led to speaking less, it did not make her more graceful.</t7066> <t7067>Elizabeth did her utmost to shield Mr. Darcy from the frequent attentions of both, staying vigilant to keep him reserved for herself and the family members who could be spoken of without shame; although the discomfort arising from all this took away much of the pleasure of the courting season, it contributed to the hope for the future; Elizabeth began to eagerly anticipate the time when they would escape that tedious company and enjoy the comfort and elegance of family life at Pemberley.</t7067>
<t7068>Chapter XIX</t7068>
<t7069>The happiest day of all maternal feelings was the day Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most virtuous daughters.</t7069> <t7070>It can be imagined that she then visited Mrs. Bingley with delightful pride and spoke of Mrs. Darcy.</t7070> <t7071>I wish I could say that, for the sake of her family, the success she achieved in her passion for marrying off her children made her a reasonable, charming, and sensible woman for the rest of her life; yet, perhaps, her continuing to be occasionally nervous and always foolish was fortunate for her husband, who might not have appreciated an extraordinary familial happiness.</t7071>
<t7072>Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter immensely; his love for her caused him to be away from home more frequently than anything else could.</t7072> <t7073>He enjoyed going to Pemberley, especially at the most unexpected times.</t7073>
<t7074>Mr. Bingley and Jane stayed at Netherfield for only twelve months.</t7074> <t7075>Living so close to Jane's mother and relatives in Meryton was too much for both Mr. Bingley's easy-going nature and Jane's loving heart.</t7075> <t7076>Then the greatest wish of the two sisters came true; Mr. Bingley purchased an estate in a county adjacent to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, came within thirty miles of each other.</t7076>
<t7077>Kitty wisely spent most of her time with her two elder sisters.</t7077> <t7078>She made great progress within a society far superior to the one she had previously known.</t7078> <t7079>Her nature was not as headstrong as Lydia's, and with Lydia's example removed from her view, and with the necessary attention and guidance, she became less troublesome, less ignorant, and less tiresome.</t7079> <t7080>She was carefully kept away from Lydia's companionship to avoid any harm; although Mrs. Wickham often invited her to stay with promises of balls and young men, her father did not allow her to go.</t7080>
<t7081>Mary was the only girl left at home; she withdrew from the struggle for success because Mrs. Bennet could not be left alone.</t7081> <t7082>She had to be more involved with the world, but did not neglect to pontificate about her morning visits; her father thought she submitted to the change without much resistance since she was no longer vexed by the comparison of beauty among her sisters.</t7082>
<t7083>As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters underwent no change due to their sister's marriage.</t7083> <t7084>Wickham steadfastly endured the belief that Elizabeth must now have learned of his ingratitude and deceit, which she had previously been unaware of; but despite everything, he did not entirely lose hope that Darcy could be persuaded to give him his inheritance.</t7084> <t7085>The congratulatory letter Lydia sent to Elizabeth due to her marriage indicated that this hope, if not Wickham's own, was kept alive by his wife.</t7085> <t7086>The letter was as follows:</t7086>
<t7087>"My dear Lizzy,</t7087>
<t7088>I wish you joy.</t7088> <t7089>If you love Mr. Darcy half as much as I love my Wickham, you must be very happy.</t7089> <t7090>It is a great comfort to think that you are so wealthy; I hope you will think of us when you have nothing else to do.</t7090> <t7091>I am sure Wickham would love to have a position at the palace; I don't think we will have enough money to live without some help.</t7091> <t7092>Any position with an annual income of three or four hundred would do; still, don't mention this to Mr. Darcy if you don't want to.</t7092>
<t7093>With my love.</t7093><t7094>"</t7094>
<t7095>Since Elizabeth did not want it at all, she tried to cut off any such requests and expectations in her response.</t7095> <t7096>But the help she could afford, she saved up by economizing on her personal expenses and frequently sent it to them.</t7096> <t7097>She knew from the beginning that two people with such expensive desires, incapable of thinking about tomorrow, could not manage with such a small income; whenever they changed cities, they would either turn to Jane or her with a small request for help to pay the bills.</t7097> <t7098>Even when peace was signed and they were brought home, their lifestyle was extremely chaotic.</t7098> <t7099>They were always moving from place to place in search of a cheaper house and always spending more than they earned.</t7099> <t7100>Wickham's love for Lydia soon turned into indifference; Lydia's lasted a bit longer; despite her youth and temperament, she maintained all the privileges that her marriage provided her.</t7100>
<t7101>Darcy never accepted Wickham at Pemberley; nevertheless, for Elizabeth's sake, he helped him advance in his profession.</t7101> <t7102>Lydia occasionally came to visit there when her husband went to London or Bath for pleasure; but the two of them stayed so long at the Bingleys' so often that even Bingley's patience ran out, and he went so far as to mention that he might hint at them to leave.</t7102>
<t7103>Miss Bingley was extremely upset about Darcy's marriage; but she wisely decided to forgo her resentment in order to retain the right to visit Pemberley, showed even more affection towards Georgiana, continued to behave as attentively as ever towards Darcy, and fulfilled all her duties of courtesy towards Elizabeth without fail.</t7103>
<t7104>Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; the sister-in-law and sisterly love was exactly as Darcy had hoped to see.</t7104> <t7105>They managed to love each other as much as they initially wanted.</t7105> <t7106>Georgiana was the person who admired Elizabeth the most in the world, even though at first she often listened to her lively, playful way of speaking with her brother with a surprise that bordered on fear.</t7106> <t7107>She now saw her brother, who had always inspired a respect that almost overwhelmed her affection, as an open object of jest.</t7107> <t7108>Her mind was filling with information she had never encountered before.</t7108> <t7109>Under Elizabeth's guidance, she was beginning to understand that a woman could behave comfortably with her husband, which was not always a comfort an older brother could grant to a sister ten years his junior.</t7109>
<t7110>Lady Catherine was extremely angry about her nephew's marriage; in response to the letter announcing the marriage, she unleashed the most genuine bluntness of her character and sent Darcy such an insulting letter, especially about Elizabeth, that all communication between them ceased for a while.</t7110> <t7111>But eventually, through Elizabeth's efforts, Darcy was persuaded to ignore the insult and seek reconciliation; after some resistance, his aunt, either due to her love for him or curiosity about how his wife was managing, set aside her resentment and graciously visited them at Pemberley, even though the woods were tainted not only by the presence of such a bride but also by the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.</t7111>
<t7112>They were always very close with the Gardiners.</t7112> <t7113>Darcy loved them as much as Elizabeth did; both always felt a warm gratitude for the people who brought Elizabeth to Derbyshire and facilitated their union.</t7113>
