<t0>Chapter I</t0>
<t1>YOU WON'T KNOW WHO I AM if you haven't read a book titled The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, but it doesn't matter.</t1> <t2>That book was written by Mr. Mark Twain and he told the truth, most of the time.</t2> <t3>Some things he exaggerated, but most of the time he told the truth.</t3> <t4>That is nothing.</t4> <t5>I've never seen anyone who didn't lie at some point, except Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.</t5> <t6>About Aunt Polly — she is Tom's Aunt Polly — and Mary and Widow Douglas, everything is told in that book, which is mostly true, with some exaggerations, as I said before.</t6>
<t7>Well, the book ends like this: Tom and I found the money that the thieves had hidden in the cave and we became rich.</t7> <t8>We each got six thousand dollars: all in gold.</t8> <t9>The truth is, it was impressive to see all that money piled up.</t9> <t10>Well, Judge Thatcher took charge of it and invested it at interest and gave us a dollar a day, all year long: so much that one wouldn't know what to spend it on.</t10> <t11>Widow Douglas adopted me as her son and said she was going to civilize me, but it was hard to live in the house all the time, because the widow was horribly normal and respectable in everything she did, so when I couldn't take it anymore, I put on my old clothes again and took my sugar skin and felt free and happy.</t11> <t12>But Tom Sawyer came looking for me and said he was going to organize a band of thieves and that I could join if I went back to the widow and was respectable.</t12> <t13>So I went back.</t13>
<t14>The widow started crying when she saw me and told me I was a poor little lamb and called me a bunch of other things, but without any bad intention.</t14> <t15>She put the new clothes back on me and all I could do was sweat and sweat and feel tight in them.</t15> <t16>Then the same thing happened as before.</t16> <t17>The widow rang a bell at dinner time and you had to be on time.</t17> <t18>When you got to the table, you couldn't just start eating, you had to wait for the widow to bow her head and mumble something over the food, although there was nothing wrong with it; well, except that everything was cooked separately.</t18> <t19>When everything is put together, the flavors mix and the juices combine and things taste better.</t19>
<t20>After dinner, he would take out the book and tell me the story of Moses and the reeds, and I was eager to learn all about that story, but eventually, he let slip that Moses had been dead for many years, so I no longer cared, because I am not interested in the dead.</t20>
<t21>Then I would feel like smoking and would ask the widow for permission.</t21> <t22>But she wouldn't give it to me.</t22> <t23>She said it was an ugly and dirty habit and that I had to try to quit.</t23> <t24>That's what happens to some people.</t24> <t25>They have a grudge against things they know nothing about.</t25> <t26>As for her, she was very interested in Moses, who wasn't even a relative of hers, and who was of no use to anyone because he was already dead, right? But she thought it was very bad that I did something I liked.</t26> <t27>And besides, she took snuff; of course, that seemed fine to her because she was the one taking it.</t27>
<t28>Her sister, Miss Watson, was a rather skinny spinster who wore glasses, had just come to live with her, and had gotten it into her head to teach me the alphabet.</t28> <t29>She made me work quite hard for an hour and then the widow would tell her that was enough.</t29> <t30>I couldn't stand it any longer.</t30> <t31>Then I would spend an unbearably boring hour and I would get nervous.</t31> <t32>Miss Watson would say, "Don't put your feet there, Huckleberry" and "Don't slouch like that, Huckleberry; sit up straight," and then she would say, "Don't yawn and stretch like that, Huckleberry; why don't you try to behave?"</t32> <t33>Then she would tell me all the details about the bad place and say she wished I were there.</t33> <t34>It was because she got angry, but I didn't mean to offend.</t34> <t35>All I wanted was to go somewhere, to get a change of scenery.</t35> <t36>I didn't care where.</t36> <t37>She said that what I said was bad; she said she wouldn't say it for anything in the world; she was going to live to go to the good place.</t37> <t38>Well, I didn't see any advantage in going where she was, so I decided not to even try.</t38> <t39>But I never said it because it would only create problems and it wouldn't be worth it.</t39>
<t40>Then she would start telling me all about the good place.</t40> <t41>She said that the only thing they did there was spend the day singing with a harp, always the same thing.</t41> <t42>So it didn't seem like a big deal to me.</t42> <t43>But I didn't say anything.</t43> <t44>I asked her if she thought Tom Sawyer would go there and she said not at all, and I was glad, because I wanted to be in the same place as him.</t44>
<t45>One day Miss Watson wouldn't stop picking on me, and I started to get tired and feel lonely.</t45> <t46>Then they called the slaves to say prayers and everyone went to bed.</t46> <t47>I went to my room with a piece of candle and put it on the table.</t47> <t48>Then I sat in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it was useless.</t48> <t49>I felt so lonely that I almost wanted to die.</t49> <t50>The stars were shining and the leaves of the trees were rustling with a very sad sound; far away an owl was hooting because someone had died and a whippoorwill and a dog were crying that someone else was going to die, and the wind was trying to tell me something and I couldn't understand what it was, so I got chills.</t50> <t51>Then, out in the forest, I heard that noise ghosts make when they want to say something they're thinking and can't make themselves understood, so they can't rest in the grave and have to stay up all night.</t51> <t52>I felt so discouraged and scared that I wanted company.</t52> <t53>Then a spider climbed up my shoulder and I brushed it off and it fell into the candle, and before I could reach out, it was already all burned up.</t53> <t54>No one needed to tell me that this was very bad luck and that it was going to bring me misfortune, so I got scared and almost tore my clothes off.</t54> <t55>I got up and walked three circles making the sign of the cross each time, and then I tied a lock of my hair with a thread so that witches wouldn't come near me.</t55> <t56>But I wasn't sure at all.</t56> <t57>That's what you do when you've lost a horseshoe you found, instead of nailing it above the door, but I had never heard anyone say it was the way to keep bad luck away when you had killed a spider.</t57>
<t58>I sat down again, all trembling, and took out the pipe to smoke, because the house was now quieter than a tomb, so the widow wouldn't find out.</t58> <t59>Well, after a long time I heard the town clock start to chime: boom... boom... boom... twelve strokes and everything remained just as calm, quieter than ever.</t59> <t60>Shortly after, I heard a branch snap in the darkness among the trees: something was moving.</t60> <t61>I straightened up and listened.</t61> <t62>Soon I barely heard a "meow! meow!" down there.</t62> <t63>Great! I went and said "meow! meow!" as low as I could and then turned off the light and climbed down the window to the shed.</t63> <t64>Then I dropped to the ground and crawled among the trees, and of course, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.</t64>
<t65>Chapter 2</t65>
<t66>WE TIPTOED along a path between the trees at the end of the widow's garden, bending down so the branches wouldn't hit our heads.</t66> <t67>When we passed by the kitchen, I tripped over a root and made a noise.</t67> <t68>We crouched down and stayed silent.</t68> <t69>Miss Watson's big black man, named Jim, was sitting at the kitchen door; we could see him very clearly because he had the light behind him.</t69> <t70>He stood up, stretched his neck for a minute listening, and then said:</t70>
<t71>—Who is it?</t71>
<t72>He stayed listening for a while; then he tiptoed out and stood between the two of us; we could almost have touched him.</t72> <t73>Well, I bet minutes and minutes passed without a sound being heard, even though we were very close together.</t73> <t74>My ankle started to itch, but I didn't dare scratch it, and then my ear started to itch, and then my back, right between my shoulders.</t74> <t75>I thought I was going to die if I didn't scratch.</t75> <t76>Since then I've noticed it many times.</t76> <t77>If you're with refined people, or at a funeral, or trying to fall asleep when you're not sleepy, if you're anywhere where it's not appropriate to scratch, then you itch all over, in more than a thousand places.</t77> <t78>And then Jim goes and says:</t78>
<t79>—Hey, who is it? Where are you?</t79> <t80>May I die if I didn't hear something.</t80> <t81>Well, I know what I'm going to do: I'm going to sit here and listen to see if I hear it again.</t81>
<t82>So he sat on the ground between Tom and me.</t82> <t83>He leaned his back against a tree and stretched his legs until one of them almost touched me.</t83> <t84>My nose started to itch.</t84> <t85>It itched so much that tears came to my eyes.</t85> <t86>But I didn't dare scratch it.</t86> <t87>Then it started to itch inside.</t87> <t88>Then below.</t88> <t89>I didn't know how to keep sitting without doing anything.</t89> <t90>That torture lasted at least six or seven minutes, but it seemed much longer.</t90> <t91>Now I was itching in eleven different places.</t91> <t92>I thought I couldn't stand it for another minute, but I gritted my teeth and prepared to try.</t92> <t93>Just then Jim started breathing very regularly, and I immediately felt comfortable again.</t93>
<t94>Tom made a signal to me —a sort of little noise with his mouth— and we started crawling on all fours.</t94> <t95>When we were about ten feet away, Tom whispered to me that it would be fun to tie Jim to the tree.</t95> <t96>But I told him no; he could wake up and make a racket, and then they would see that I wasn't at home.</t96> <t97>Tom said that he didn't have enough candles and that he was going to sneak into the kitchen to get more.</t97> <t98>I didn't want him to try.</t98> <t99>I said that Jim could wake up and come in.</t99> <t100>But Tom preferred to take the risk, so we crawled in and took three candles, and Tom left five cents on the table to pay for them.</t100> <t101>Then we went out, and I was dying to leave, but Tom was determined that he had to crawl over to where Jim was and play a prank on him first.</t101> <t102>I waited and it seemed like a long time passed, with everything so quiet and so lonely.</t102>
<t103>As soon as Tom returned, we started running down the path, rounded the fence, and finally reached the top of the hill on the other side of the house.</t103> <t104>Tom said he had taken Jim's hat and hung it on a branch above his head, and that Jim had moved a little but hadn't woken up.</t104> <t105>Later, Jim would say that the witches had enchanted him and put him in a trance, and that they had ridden him all over the state and then placed him back under the trees and hung his hat on a branch to show who had done it.</t105> <t106>And the next time he told it, Jim said they had taken him to New Orleans, and each time he told it, he lengthened the journey, until finally he said they had made him travel the whole world and almost killed him from exhaustion, and that his back was covered with boils.</t106> <t107>Jim was so proud that he hardly paid attention to the other blacks.</t107> <t108>There were blacks who traveled miles and miles to hear what he had to say, and they respected him more than any other black in the area.</t108> <t109>There were blacks who came from afar and stood with their mouths open, staring at him as if he were a wonder.</t109> <t110>Blacks spend their lives talking about witches in the dark, by the fireplace, but when one of them started talking and suggested that he knew a lot about these things, Jim would come and say: "Well! And what do you know about witches?" and that black was done for and had to keep quiet.</t110> <t111>Jim always wore that five-cent coin tied with a string around his neck and said it was a talisman given to him by the devil himself, telling him that he could cure anyone with it and call the witches whenever he wanted if he said some words, but he never told what he had to say.</t111> <t112>Blacks from all around would come and give Jim whatever they had, just to see that five-cent coin, but they didn't want to touch it because the devil had held it in his hands.</t112> <t113>Jim was practically no longer useful as a servant because he was too proud of having seen the devil and of the witches having ridden him.</t113>
<t114>Well, when Tom and I reached the edge of the hill, we looked down from up there towards the town and saw three or four lights flickering, where there might have been sick people, and above the stars shone wonderfully, and next to the town ran the river, which was a whole mile wide and flowed grandly in silence.</t114> <t115>We came down from the hill and met up with Joe Harper and Ben Rogers and two or three more boys, who were hiding in the old tanneries.</t115> <t116>So we untied a boat and went two and a half miles down the river, where the great gap between the hills was, and disembarked.</t116>
<t117>We went to a thicket of bushes and Tom made everyone swear to keep the secret, and then he showed them a hole in the hill, right in the middle of the thickest part of the bushes.</t117> <t118>Then, we lit the candles and crawled in on all fours.</t118> <t119>We went about two hundred yards and then the cave opened up.</t119> <t120>Tom studied the passages and immediately went under a wall where it wasn't noticeable that there was a hole.</t120> <t121>We passed through a very narrow spot and came out into a sort of room, all damp, sweaty, and cold, and there we stopped.</t121> <t122>Then Tom goes and says:</t122>
<t123>—Now we are going to form a band of thieves that will be called Tom Sawyer's Gang.</t123> <t124>Anyone who wants to join has to take an oath and write their name in blood.</t124>
<t125>Everyone wanted to.</t125> <t126>Then Tom took out a sheet of paper on which he had written the oath and read it aloud.</t126> <t127>Each of the boys swore to be loyal to the gang and never to reveal any of its secrets, and if someone did something to any boy in the gang, the boy who was ordered to kill that person and their family had to do it, and could not eat or sleep until he had killed them all and marked a cross on their chest with a knife, which was the gang's symbol.</t127> <t128>No one who did not belong to the gang could use that symbol, and if they did, they had to be reported, and if they did it again, they had to be killed.</t128> <t129>And if someone who belonged to the gang revealed the secrets, their throat had to be cut and then their body burned, the ashes scattered everywhere, and their name erased from the list with blood, and no one in the gang could ever mention their name again, as they would be cursed and had to be forgotten forever.</t129>
<t130>Everyone said it was a great oath and asked Tom if he had come up with it himself.</t130> <t131>He said that only part of it, but the rest he had taken from pirate and thief books and that all high-class gangs had an oath.</t131>
<t132>Some thought it would be fine to kill the families of the boys who told the secrets.</t132> <t133>Tom said it was a good idea, so he took out a pencil and wrote it down.</t133> <t134>Then Ben Rogers goes and says:</t134>
<t135>—But there's Huck Finn, who has no family; what would we do with him?</t135>
<t136>—Well, doesn't he have a father? —asked Tom Sawyer.</t136>
<t137>—Yes, he has a father, but lately no one can find him.</t137> <t138>He used to always be drunk with the pigs in the tanneries, but no one has seen him for a year or more.</t138> <t139>They continued talking about the matter, and they were going to leave me out of the gang because they said that each boy had to have a family or someone to kill, otherwise it wouldn't be fair to the others.</t139> <t140>Well, no one could think of anything to do; everyone was quiet and thoughtful.</t140> <t141>I was about to start crying, but then I quickly thought of a way out and offered Miss Watson: they could kill her.</t141> <t142>Everyone said:</t142>
<t143>—Ah, great.</t143> <t144>That's very good.</t144> <t145>Huck can enter.</t145>
<t146>Afterwards, everyone pricked a finger with a pin to draw blood for the signature, and I left my mark on the paper.</t146>
<t147>—Well —Ben Rogers goes and says—, what is this band going to do?</t147>
<t148>—Nothing but thefts and murders —said Tom.</t148>
<t149>—But, what are we going to steal?</t149> <t150>Houses or livestock, or...</t150>
<t151>—Bah! Stealing cattle and those things isn't real stealing; those are rustlers —says Tom Sawyer—.</t151> <t152>We are not rustlers.</t152> <t153>That's not elegant.</t153> <t154>We are highwaymen.</t154> <t155>We stop stagecoaches and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill people and take their watches and money.</t155>
<t156>—Do people always have to be killed?</t156>
<t157>—Well, of course.</t157> <t158>It's the best.</t158> <t159>Some authorities do not agree, but in general it is considered best to kill them all... except for a few that can be brought here to the cave and kept until they are rescued.</t159>
<t160>—Rescued? What is that?</t160>
<t161>—I don't know.</t161> <t162>But that's what they do.</t162> <t163>I've seen it in books, so of course that's what we have to do.</t163>
<t164>—But how are we going to do it if we don't know what it is?</t164>
<t165>—Well, damn it, we have to do it.</t165> <t166>Haven't I told you it's in the books?</t166> <t167>Do you want to do it differently from the books and have everything turn out wrong?</t167>
<t168>—Well, Tom Sawyer, that's all very well to say, but how the devil are those guys going to get rescued if we don't know how it's done?</t168> <t169>That's what I would like to know.</t169> <t170>What do you think it is?</t170>
<t171>—Well, I don't know.</t171> <t172>But maybe if we stay with them until they are rescued, it means we have to stay with them until they have died.</t172>
<t173>—Well, something is something, it's an answer.</t173> <t174>Why couldn't you have said it before?</t174> <t175>We keep them until they die from a rescue, and what a nuisance they are going to be: eating everything and trying to escape all the time.</t175>
<t176>—What things you say, Ben Rogers.</t176> <t177>How are they going to escape when there's a guard watching them, ready to shoot them if they move a finger?</t177>
<t178>—A guard!</t178> <t179>That's a good one.</t179> <t180>So someone has to sit all night without sleeping at all, just to watch over them.</t180> <t181>It seems foolish to me.</t181> <t182>Why can't we just knock them out and have them rescued as soon as we bring them?</t182>
<t183>—Because it's not what the books say, that's why.</t183> <t184>Come on, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things right or not?</t184> <t185>That's what it's about.</t185> <t186>Don't you think the people who wrote the books know what is right to do?</t186> <t187>Do you think you're going to teach them something?</t187> <t188>Not at all.</t188> <t189>No, sir, we're going to rescue them as it's supposed to be done.</t189>
<t190>—Alright.</t190> <t191>I don't care; but anyway, I say it's nonsense.</t191> <t192>Hey, should we kill the women too?</t192>
<t193>—Look, Ben Rogers, if I were as ignorant as you, I would try to hide it.</t193> <t194>Kill the women?</t194> <t195>No; no one has seen anything like that in the books.</t195> <t196>You bring them to the cave and treat them in the finest manner possible, and little by little they fall in love with you and no longer want to return to their homes.</t196>
<t197>—Well, if that's the case, I agree, but it doesn't tell me much either.</t197> <t198>Soon we will have the cave so full of women and guys waiting to be rescued that there won't be any room left for the thieves.</t198> <t199>But go ahead, I have nothing to say.</t199>
<t200>Little Tommy Barnes had already fallen asleep, and when they woke him up, he was scared, started crying, and said he wanted to go back home to his mom and that he didn't want to be a bandit anymore.</t200>
<t201>So everyone laughed at him a lot, and when they called him a crybaby, he got angry and said he was going to tell all the secrets.</t201> <t202>But Tom went and gave him five cents to keep quiet and said that we were all going home and would meet next week to rob someone and kill some people.</t202>
<t203>Ben Rogers said he couldn't go out much, only on Sundays, so he wanted to start next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be very bad to do it on Sunday, and the discussion ended.</t203> <t204>They decided to meet to determine the date as soon as they could and then we chose Tom Sawyer as first captain and Joe Harper as second captain of the band and went home.</t204>
<t205>I crawled up the shed to my window just before dawn.</t205> <t206>My new clothes were all covered in mud stains, and I was as tired as a dog.</t206>
<t207>Chapter 3</t207>
<t208>WELL, in the morning old Miss Watson gave me a good scolding about the clothes, but the widow didn't scold me, she just cleaned the stains and mud, and she seemed so sad that I thought if I could, I would behave well for a while.</t208> <t209>Then Miss Watson took me to the parlor to pray, but nothing happened.</t209> <t210>She told me to pray every day and that everything I asked for would be given to me.</t210> <t211>But it wasn't true.</t211> <t212>I tried.</t212> <t213>Once I got a fishing line, but without hooks.</t213> <t214>Without hooks it was useless to me.</t214> <t215>I tried to get the hooks three or four times, but I don't know why it didn't work.</t215> <t216>So one day I asked Miss Watson to try for me, but she said I was silly.</t216> <t217>She never explained why and I could never understand it.</t217>
<t218>Once I went to sit in the forest to think it over calmly.</t218> <t219>I said to myself: "If one can get everything they ask for when they pray, why don't they return to Deacon Winn the money he lost with the pigs?</t219> <t220>Why don't they return to the widow the silver snuffbox that was stolen from her?</t220> <t221>Why can't Miss Watson get fat? No, I said to myself, all that doesn't make sense."</t221> <t222>I went and told the widow, and she said that what could be obtained through prayer were "spiritual goods."</t222> <t223>That was too much for me, but she explained what it meant: I had to help other people and do everything I could for them and always take care of others and never think of myself.</t223> <t224>It seemed to me that included Miss Watson.</t224> <t225>I went to the forest and thought about it for a long time, but I didn't see the advantage, except for other people; so finally I figured I wasn't going to worry about it anymore, but would forget it.</t225> <t226>Sometimes the widow would take me with her and talk to me about Providence in a way that made one's mouth water, but maybe the next day Miss Watson would undo it all again.</t226> <t227>It seemed to me that there might be two Providences and that one, poor fellow, would do very well with the widow's Providence, but if it was Miss Watson's, there was nothing to be done.</t227> <t228>I thought it all over and figured that if she wanted, I would go with the widow's, although I didn't see what she would gain by having me on her side that she didn't have before, given how ignorant and insignificant and ordinary I was.</t228>
<t229>It had been over a year since anyone had seen my father, and I was so happy; I didn't want to see him again.</t229> <t230>He always hit me when he was sober and could get his hands on me, although when he was around, I usually ran off to the woods.</t230> <t231>Well, around that time they found him drowned in the river, about twelve miles upstream from the town, people said.</t231> <t232>At least, they believed it was him; they said that the drowned man was the same height as him and was dressed in rags and had very long hair, just like my father, but they couldn't tell by the face, because he had been in the water so long that it didn't look like a face at all.</t232> <t233>They said he was floating on his back in the water.</t233> <t234>They took him out and buried him on the riverbank.</t234> <t235>But I didn't stay calm for long, because something occurred to me.</t235> <t236>I knew very well that a drowned person doesn't float on their back, but on their face.</t236> <t237>So then I realized that it wasn't my father, but a woman dressed as a man.</t237> <t238>And I got nervous again.</t238> <t239>I thought the old man would show up someday, although I hoped he wouldn't.</t239>
<t240>We played bandits for a month, off and on, and then I quit.</t240> <t241>All the boys did the same.</t241> <t242>We hadn't robbed anyone, we hadn't killed anyone, we had only pretended.</t242> <t243>We would jump out of the woods and charge at the pig herders and the women who were taking their garden produce to market in carts, but we never did anything to them.</t243> <t244>Tom Sawyer called the pigs "ingots" and the turnips and such "jewels," and we would go to the cave and talk about what we had done and how many people we had killed and marked with our sign.</t244> <t245>But I didn't see any advantage in it.</t245> <t246>Once Tom sent a boy running through the town with a burning stick that he said was a "signal" (a sign that the gang had to meet) and then said that his spies had sent him secret news that the next day a bunch of rich Spanish and Arab merchants were going to camp at the Mouth of the Cave with two hundred elephants and six hundred camels and more than a thousand pack mules, all carrying diamonds, and that they only had a guard of four hundred soldiers, so we had to ambush them and kill them all.</t246> <t247>He said we should prepare the swords and shotguns and be ready.</t247> <t248>He could never even get a cart of turnips, but he insisted that the swords and shotguns be all clean, although, since they were just wooden slats and broomsticks, you could clean them until you died of boredom and they wouldn't be worth a cent more than before.</t248> <t249>I didn't believe we could defeat so many Spaniards and Arabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so the next day, which was Saturday, I showed up for the ambush, and when he gave the order we ran out of the woods and down the hill.</t249> <t250>But there were no Spaniards or Arabs or camels or elephants.</t250> <t251>There was only a Sunday school picnic, and on top of that, it was the first graders.</t251> <t252>We scattered them and chased the kids down the hill, but we only got some jam and a few donuts, although Ben Rogers took a rag doll and Joe Harper a hymn book and a propaganda pamphlet, and then the teacher came running and made us leave everything and run away.</t252> <t253>I didn't see any diamonds, and I told Tom Sawyer.</t253> <t254>He replied that there were plenty of them anyway and that there were also Arabs and elephants and things.</t254> <t255>Then I asked him why we couldn't see them.</t255> <t256>He told me that if I weren't so ignorant and had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking.</t256> <t257>He said they did everything by magic.</t257> <t258>He said there were hundreds of soldiers and elephants and treasures and all that, but that we had enemies he called magicians who had turned everything into a Sunday school picnic for kids, just out of spite.</t258> <t259>Then I said that well, what we had to do was attack the magicians.</t259> <t260>Tom Sawyer called me a clodhopper.</t260>
<t261>—Man —he said—, a wizard can summon a bunch of genies, who could mince you in half a minute.</t261> <t262>They are as tall as trees and as square as three-door wardrobes.</t262>
<t263>—Well —I say—, so what happens if we get some of those geniuses to help us?</t263> <t264>Couldn't we then defeat the others?</t264>
<t265>—How are you going to achieve it?</t265>
<t266>—I don't know.</t266> <t267>How do they manage it?</t267>
<t268>—Well, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies arrive, accompanied by thunder and lightning and all the smoke in the world, and they go and do everything they are told to do.</t268> <t269>It's extremely easy for them to tear a tower out by the roots and hit a Sunday school superintendent, or anyone else, on the head with it.</t269>
<t270>—Who forces you to do all that?</t270>
<t271>—Man, the one who rubs the lamp or the ring.</t271> <t272>They belong to the one who rubs the lamp or the ring and have to do whatever they are told.</t272> <t273>If they are told to build a palace forty miles long out of diamonds and fill it with chewing gum, or whatever you want, and to bring the daughter of an emperor of China to marry you, they have to do it, and moreover before the next day dawns.</t273> <t274>And on top of that, they have to transport that palace across the country whenever they are told, do you understand?</t274>
<t275>—Well —I said—, I think they are idiots for not keeping the palace, instead of doing all that nonsense.</t275> <t276>And besides, if it were me, I would go to the ends of the earth before leaving what I was doing to do what some guy rubbing an old tin lamp told me to do.</t276>
<t277>—What things you say, Huck Finn.</t277> <t278>But you would have to go when she rubbed it, whether you wanted to or not.</t278>
<t279>—What!</t279> <t280>If I were as tall as a tree and square like a three-door wardrobe?</t280> <t281>Well, okay; I would go, but I bet you that man would have to climb the tallest tree in the whole country.</t281>
<t282>—Darn, it's just impossible to talk to you, Huck Finn.</t282> <t283>It's like you don't know anything at all, like a complete idiot.</t283>
<t284>I kept thinking about all that for two or three days and then decided to try, to see if it was true or not.</t284> <t285>I took an old tin lamp and an iron ring to the forest and started rubbing until I was sweating like an Indian, figuring I would build a palace to sell it; but nothing, no genie came.</t285> <t286>Then I thought that all that was just one of Tow Sawyer's lies.</t286> <t287>I supposed he believed in the Arabs and the elephants, but I don't think the same as him.</t287> <t288>That seemed like a Sunday school thing.</t288>
<t289>Chapter 4</t289>
<t290>WELL, three or four months passed and it was already deep into winter.</t290> <t291>I had gone to school almost all the time, I knew the letters and could read and write a little and I knew the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five, and I thought I would never get beyond that even if I lived forever.</t291> <t292>Anyway, I don't like math very much.</t292>
<t293>At first, school annoyed me, but little by little I learned to endure it.</t293> <t294>When I got too tired, I would skip school, and the beating I got the next day felt good and cheered me up.</t294> <t295>So the more time I spent at school, the easier it became for me.</t295> <t296>I was also starting to get used to the widow's ways, which didn't bother me as much anymore.</t296> <t297>Living in a house and sleeping in a bed was almost always bothersome to me, but before it got cold, I would usually sneak away to sleep in the forest, which served as a break for me.</t297> <t298>I liked the old ways better, but I was also starting to like the new ones a little.</t298> <t299>The widow said I was progressing slowly but surely and that I was doing very well.</t299> <t300>She said she wasn't ashamed of me.</t300>
<t301>One morning by chance I knocked over the salt shaker at breakfast time.</t301> <t302>I grabbed some salt as soon as I could to throw it over my left shoulder and ward off bad luck, but Miss Watson got ahead of me to stop me.</t302> <t303>She goes and says to me: "Get those hands away, Huckleberry; you spend your life making everything dirty!"</t303> <t304>The widow tried to excuse me, but that wasn't going to ward off the bad luck, and I knew it.</t304> <t305>After breakfast, I left, worried and trembling, wondering where it was going to hit me and what I was going to do.</t305> <t306>There are ways to escape some types of bad luck, but this wasn't one of them, so I didn't try to do anything, but just kept going, very discouraged and alert to what was happening.</t306>
<t307>I went down the front garden and jumped over the small gate where the tall fence is crossed.</t307> <t308>There was an inch of freshly fallen snow on the ground and I saw someone's footprints.</t308> <t309>They came from the quarry, stopped at the gate, and then went around the garden fence.</t309> <t310>It was curious that they hadn't passed through after stopping there.</t310> <t311>I didn't understand it.</t311> <t312>In any case, it was strange.</t312> <t313>I was going to follow them, but first I stopped to examine them.</t313> <t314>At first, I saw nothing; then I did.</t314> <t315>On the heel of the left boot, there was a cross made with nails to keep the devil away.</t315>
<t316>In a second I got up and ran down the hill.</t316> <t317>From time to time I looked over my shoulder, but I didn't see anyone.</t317> <t318>I reached Judge Thatcher's house as soon as I could.</t318> <t319>He said to me:</t319>
<t320>—But, boy, you're out of breath.</t320> <t321>Have you come to collect the interest?</t321>
<t322>—No, sir —I replied—; do you have them for me?</t322>
<t323>—Ah, yes, last night the semester's money arrived: more than one hundred and fifty dollars.</t323> <t324>For you, quite a fortune.</t324> <t325>You better let me invest it with your six thousand, because if I give it to you, you'll spend it.</t325>
<t326>—No, sir —I said—.</t326> <t327>I don't want to spend them.</t327> <t328>I don't want them for anything; and neither the six thousand.</t328> <t329>I want you to keep them; I want to give them to you: the six thousand and everything.</t329>
<t330>He seemed surprised.</t330> <t331>It was as if he couldn't understand it.</t331> <t332>He goes and says:</t332>
<t333>—But, what do you mean, boy?</t333>
<t334>And I go and tell him:</t334>
<t335>—Please, don't ask me anything.</t335> <t336>You will keep it; right?</t336>
<t337>And he goes and says:</t337>
<t338>—Well, I don't know what to do.</t338> <t339>Is something wrong?</t339>
<t340>—Please, keep it and don't ask me anything... that way I won't have to tell lies.</t340>
<t341>He thought about it for a while and then said:</t341>
<t342>—Ah, ah! I think I understand now.</t342> <t343>You want to sell me all your goods; not give them to me.</t343> <t344>That is correct.</t344>
<t345>Then he wrote something on a piece of paper, which he read to me and which said:</t345>
<t346>—Look; you'll see it says "for the agreed sum."</t346> <t347>That means I bought it from you and I paid for it.</t347> <t348>Here's a dollar.</t348> <t349>Now sign it.</t349>
<t350>So I signed it and left.</t350>
<t351>Jim, Miss Watson's black man, had a hairball the size of a fist that had been taken from the fourth stomach of an ox, and he did magic things with it.</t351> <t352>He said that inside there was a spirit that knew everything.</t352> <t353>So that night I went to see him and told him that my father had returned, because I had seen his footprints in the snow.</t353> <t354>What I wanted to know was what he was going to do and where he planned to sleep.</t354> <t355>Jim took out his hairball and said something over it, then he lifted it and let it fall to the ground.</t355> <t356>It fell with a single thud and didn't roll more than an inch.</t356> <t357>Jim tried again and again, always the same result.</t357> <t358>He knelt down and put his ear close to listen.</t358> <t359>But nothing; it didn't want to talk.</t359> <t360>Jim said it wouldn't talk unless we gave it money.</t360> <t361>I told him I had an old, smooth, fake quarter dollar that was worthless because you could see a bit of the copper underneath the silver, and no one would accept it, even if you couldn't see the copper, because it was so smooth it would slip and everyone would notice (I thought not to tell him about the dollar the judge had given me).</t361> <t362>I told him it was very bad money, but maybe the hairball would accept it because it might not understand the difference.</t362> <t363>Jim smelled it, bit it, rubbed it, and said he would make the hairball believe it was good by cutting a raw Irish potato in half and putting the coin in the middle and leaving it there all night, so that by the next morning you wouldn't be able to see the copper and it wouldn't be so slippery, so anyone in town would accept it, let alone a hairball.</t363> <t364>Well, I already knew that potatoes were good for that, but I had forgotten.</t364>
<t365>Jim placed the coin under the hairball, bent down, and listened again.</t365> <t366>This time he said the hairball was fine.</t366> <t367>He said he would tell my fortune if I wanted.</t367> <t368>I go and tell him to go ahead.</t368> <t369>Then the hairball spoke to Jim, and Jim told me about it.</t369> <t370>He goes and says:</t370>
<t371>—Your father still doesn't know what he's going to do.</t371> <t372>Sometimes he thinks he's going to leave and then he thinks he's going to stay.</t372> <t373>The best thing is to leave things be and let the old man do what he wants.</t373> <t374>There are two angels circling around him.</t374> <t375>One of them is white and radiant and the other is black.</t375> <t376>The white one makes him go down the right path for a while and then the black one comes and messes everything up.</t376> <t377>It's impossible to know which one will be the last to catch him.</t377> <t378>But you will be fine.</t378> <t379>You will have many problems in life and many joys.</t379> <t380>Sometimes you will have a hard time and sometimes you will get sick, but each time you will get better.</t380> <t381>There are two women who matter in your life.</t381> <t382>One is fair and the other is dark.</t382> <t383>One is rich and the other is poor.</t383> <t384>You will marry the poor one first and then the rich one.</t384> <t385>You have to be very careful with water and not have adventures, because it is written that you will be hanged.</t385>
<t386>That night, when I lit the candle and went up to my room, there was father, in person!</t386>
<t387>Chapter 5</t387>
<t388>I HAD closed the door.</t388> <t389>Then I turned around and there it was.</t389> <t390>Before, I was afraid of it because it used to hit me all the time.</t390> <t391>I thought I would still be afraid of it now, but after a minute I realized I was wrong, that is, after the initial shock, so to speak, when I was left breathless because I wasn't expecting it at all; but immediately I realized that I wasn't as afraid of it.</t391>
<t392>He was almost fifty years old and he looked it.</t392> <t393>He had long, tangled, greasy hair that hung down to his neck, and through it, his eyes shone as if he were hiding behind a vine.</t393> <t394>It was all black, without any gray; just like his long, disheveled beard.</t394> <t395>There was no color in his face, where it was visible; it was all white, not like other men, but a white that was disgusting, a white that made you itch, a white like a tree frog, like a fish's belly.</t395> <t396>And his clothes: rags and nothing more.</t396> <t397>He had one ankle resting on the other knee; the boot on that foot was torn and two of his toes were visible, which he moved from time to time.</t397> <t398>He had left his hat on the floor: an old slouch hat with the crown all caved in, like a lid.</t398>
<t399>I stayed looking at him; he remained seated looking at me, with the chair tilted back a little.</t399> <t400>I placed the candle on the floor.</t400> <t401>I saw that the window was open, so he had climbed up through the shed.</t401> <t402>He did nothing but look at me.</t402> <t403>After a while, he goes and says:</t403>
<t404>—You wear good clothes, very good.</t404> <t405>You must think you're a big shot, don't you?</t405>
<t406>—Maybe yes and maybe no —I replied.</t406>
<t407>—Don't get cocky —he goes and says—.</t407> <t408>Since I left, you've been putting on airs.</t408> <t409>I'll bring you down a peg before I'm done with you.</t409> <t410>And I've been told you're educated: that you know how to read and write.</t410> <t411>You think you're worth more than your father now, don't you? Just because he doesn't know how.</t411> <t412>I'll show you.</t412> <t413>Who told you to go around acting all high and mighty?</t413> <t414>Who gave you permission?</t414>
<t415>—The widow.</t415> <t416>She told me.</t416>
<t417>—The widow, huh? And, who has come to give the widow a candle at this funeral?</t417>
<t418>—Nobody has given it to her.</t418>
<t419>—Well, I'm going to teach him to mind his own business.</t419> <t420>And listen to what I'm telling you: stop going to school, got it?</t420> <t421>I'm going to teach them to educate a boy so that he doesn't put on airs in front of his own father and act like he's better than him.</t421> <t422>Don't let me catch you near that school again, got it?</t422> <t423>Your mother didn't know how to read or write, and she died peacefully.</t423> <t424>Nobody in the family learned to read before they died.</t424> <t425>I don't know how, and there you are putting on airs.</t425> <t426>And I'm not the kind of man to put up with that, got it?</t426> <t427>Hey, let's see how you read.</t427>
<t428>I took out a book and started reading something that talked about General Washington and the wars.</t428> <t429>When I had been reading for about half a minute, he suddenly snatched the book from me and threw it to the other side of the room.</t429> <t430>And then he says:</t430>
<t431>—It's true.</t431> <t432>You really do know.</t432> <t433>I had my doubts when you told me.</t433> <t434>Well, look, stop with the airs.</t434> <t435>I'm not going to put up with it.</t435> <t436>I'll be very watchful, smart aleck, and if I catch you at that school, I'll give you a beating.</t436> <t437>If you keep this up, the nun will also give you one.</t437> <t438>I've never seen a boy like you.</t438>
<t439>He grabbed a blue and yellow trading card with some cows and a boy, and then he says:</t439>
<t440>—What is this?</t440>
<t441>—They gave it to me because I knew the lesson well.</t441>
<t442>He broke it and then says:</t442>
<t443>—I'm going to give you something better: I'm going to give you a good thrashing.</t443>
<t444>He remained seated, murmuring and grumbling for a while, and then he goes and says:</t444>
<t445>—But you're quite the dandy, aren't you?</t445> <t446>Bed and sheets, mirror and your carpet on the floor, while your own father has to sleep with the pigs in the tanneries.</t446> <t447>I've never seen a boy like this.</t447> <t448>I'm sure you'll have fewer airs when I'm done with you.</t448> <t449>But you just keep putting on airs...</t449> <t450>I've been told you're rich.</t450> <t451>Eh?...</t451> <t452>How did that happen?</t452>
<t453>—It's a lie... that's how it happened.</t453>
<t454>—Look, be careful how you talk to me.</t454> <t455>I've been tolerating you too much already, so don't get insolent.</t455> <t456>I've been in the village for two days and the only thing everyone has told me is that you're rich.</t456> <t457>And I've also heard it said by the river.</t457> <t458>That's why I came.</t458> <t459>Tomorrow you bring me that money: I want it.</t459>
<t460>—I don't have any money.</t460>
<t461>—Liar.</t461> <t462>Judge Thatcher has it.</t462> <t463>Yes, you have it.</t463> <t464>And I want it.</t464>
<t465>—I don't have any money.</t465> <t466>I'm telling you.</t466> <t467>Ask Judge Thatcher and he'll tell you the same.</t467>
<t468>—Very well.</t468> <t469>I'm going to ask him and make him cough up, and if not, I'll find out why.</t469> <t470>Hey, how much do you have in your pocket? Give it to me.</t470>
<t471>—I only have a dollar and I want it for...</t471>
<t472>—It doesn't matter what you want it for... Just give it to me and that's it.</t472>
<t473>I gave it to him and he bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was going to the town center to have a whiskey; that he hadn't drunk all day.</t473> <t474>When he went out to the shed, he stuck his head back through the window and cursed me for having airs and trying to be better than him, and when I thought he had already left, he stuck his head back through the window and told me to be careful with that school, because he would be very watchful and would thrash me if I didn't stop going.</t474>
<t475>The next day he was drunk and went to see Judge Thatcher, to bother him trying to get him to give him the money, but he didn't succeed, and then he swore he was going to make the law force him.</t475>
<t476>The judge and the widow went to court to have the custody taken away and for one of them to become my guardian, but a new judge had arrived and he didn't know my old one, so he said that the courts should not intervene to separate families if they could avoid it; he said he preferred not to separate a child from his father.</t476> <t477>So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to give up the matter.</t477>
<t478>The old man was happier than a clam.</t478> <t479>He said he was going to keep beating me until I was covered in bruises if I didn't get him some money.</t479> <t480>I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and father took them, got drunk, and caused a ruckus everywhere with his swearing, shouting, and scandals, and he kept at it throughout the town, banging on a pan until almost midnight; then they jailed him and the next day took him to court and put him back in jail for a week.</t480> <t481>But he said he was happy, that he was the one in charge of his son, and that he would settle the score with me.</t481>
<t482>When he left, the new judge said he was going to turn him into another man.</t482> <t483>So he took him to his house, gave him good and clean clothes, and invited him to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner with the family, and he behaved like a brother to him, so to speak.</t483> <t484>And after dinner, he talked to him about temperance and things like that until the old man started to cry and said he had been an idiot and had wasted his life on foolishness, but now he was going to change completely and be a man that no one would be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge would help him and not despise him.</t484> <t485>The judge said that made him want to hug him, and even he and his wife started to cry; father said he had been a man whom no one had understood until then, and the judge said he believed it.</t485> <t486>The old man said that what a fallen man needed was solidarity, and the judge said that was true; so they started crying again.</t486> <t487>And when it was time to go to bed, the old man got up, extended his hand, and said:</t487>
<t488>—Look at it, ladies and gentlemen; take it in yours, give them yours.</t488> <t489>This hand used to be a pig's, but it is no longer; it is the hand of a man who has started a new life and who will die before returning to the old one.</t489> <t490>Remember these words: do not forget that I have said them.</t490> <t491>Now it is a clean hand; give me yours, do not be afraid.</t491>
<t492>So everyone shook his hand, one after another, and cried.</t492> <t493>The judge's wife kissed it.</t493> <t494>Then the old man signed a promise: he made his mark.</t494> <t495>The judge said it was the most sacred moment he could remember, or something like that.</t495> <t496>Then they made the old man lie down in a very nice room, which was the guest room, and that same night, a while later, he got very thirsty and climbed down the porch roof, down one of the columns, and traded his new jacket for a jug of rat poison whiskey and went back to the room and had a great time, and towards dawn he went out again, drunk as a skunk, and rolled down the porch roof and broke his left arm in two places, and had almost frozen to death when someone found him after the sun came up.</t496> <t497>And when they went in to see what was in that guest room, they had to find a pilot to show them the way.</t497>
<t498>The judge felt a bit bitter.</t498> <t499>He said that he figured someone might be able to reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but that he didn't know any other way.</t499>
<t500>Chapter 6</t500>
<t501>WELL, the old man soon recovered and then he got involved with Judge Thatcher in the courts to force him to give him that money, and then with me for not stopping going to school.</t501> <t502>He grabbed me a couple of times and thrashed me, but anyway I kept going to school and most of the time I either hid from him or outran him.</t502> <t503>Before, I didn't have much desire to go to school.</t503> <t504>But now I thought I would go just to spite my father.</t504> <t505>The lawsuit was going very slowly: it seemed like it was never going to start; so from time to time I borrowed two or three dollars from the judge to give to him and avoid a beating.</t505> <t506>Every time he had money he got drunk, and every time he got drunk he caused a commotion in town, and every time he caused a commotion they put him in jail.</t506> <t507>And he was so happy: that kind of life was what he liked.</t507>
<t508>He started spending too much time hanging around the widow's house, so she finally told him that if he didn't stop hanging around there, he was going to get into some trouble.</t508> <t509>Man, did he get mad.</t509> <t510>He said he was going to show who was in charge of Huck Finn.</t510> <t511>So one day he waited for me at the spring, grabbed me, and took me three miles upriver in a boat and crossed over to the Illinois side, where there were forests and no houses except for an old log cabin in a place with so many trees that you couldn't find it unless you already knew the way.</t511>
<t512>He always took me with him and I never had the chance to escape.</t512> <t513>We lived in that cabin and he always locked the door; at night, he would go to bed with the key under his pillow.</t513>
<t514>He had a shotgun that I think he had stolen and he would take me fishing and hunting, which is what we lived on.</t514> <t515>From time to time he would leave me locked up and go to the store, which was three miles away, where the ferry passed, and he would trade fish and game for whiskey, and he would bring it home and get drunk, have a great time, and give me a beating.</t515> <t516>The widow found out where I was and after a while sent a man to try to take me away, but father chased him off with the shotgun and it didn't take long for me to get used to being where I was, and I liked it... except for the beatings part.</t516>
<t517>Everything was very peaceful and it was enjoyable, lying around all day, smoking and fishing, without books or studies.</t517> <t518>Two months or more passed and all my clothes became tattered and dirty, and I didn't understand how I had liked being at the widow's house, where you had to wash yourself and eat from a plate and comb your hair and go to bed and get up at fixed times and spend your life with a boring book while old Miss Watson was always nagging at you.</t518> <t519>I no longer wanted to go back.</t519> <t520>I had stopped cursing because the widow didn't like it, but now I started cursing again because father didn't see anything wrong with it.</t520> <t521>All things considered, I had a pretty good time there in the forest.</t521>
<t522>But little by little, father started to get too fond of beating me, and I couldn't take it anymore.</t522> <t523>I was covered in bruises.</t523> <t524>He also started spending a lot of time away, and he would leave me locked up.</t524> <t525>Once he locked me up and disappeared for three whole days.</t525> <t526>I felt horribly alone.</t526> <t527>I thought he had drowned and that I would never get out of there again.</t527> <t528>I was scared.</t528> <t529>I decided to find a way to leave.</t529> <t530>I had tried to leave that cabin many times, but I couldn't find a way.</t530> <t531>There wasn't a window big enough for even a dog to get through.</t531> <t532>I couldn't go out through the chimney because it was too narrow.</t532> <t533>The door was thick, made of solid oak planks.</t533> <t534>Father was very careful and never left a knife or anything in the cabin when he left; I suppose I had searched around there at least a hundred times; well, the truth was that I spent all my time looking, because it was the only way to keep myself entertained.</t534> <t535>But once, I finally found something; I found an old rusty saw without a handle; it was stuck between a beam and the tiles above.</t535> <t536>I cleaned it and got to work.</t536> <t537>There was a horse blanket nailed to the logs at one end of the cabin, behind the table, so the wind wouldn't come through the cracks and blow out the candle.</t537> <t538>I got under the table, lifted the blanket, and started sawing a section of the big log below, big enough for me to fit through.</t538> <t539>Well, it took me a long time but I was almost finished when I heard father's shotgun in the forest.</t539> <t540>I hid the traces of my work, let the blanket and the saw fall, and father arrived immediately.</t540>
<t541>Father was not in a good mood, which is to say, he was as usual.</t541> <t542>He said he had gone to the town center and that everything was going badly for him.</t542> <t543>His lawyer had told him that he estimated he would win the lawsuit and get the money if the trial ever started, but that there were always ways to keep postponing it, and Judge Thatcher knew all of them.</t543> <t544>He said that according to people, there was going to be another trial to separate me from him and make the widow my guardian, and they estimated that this time she would win.</t544> <t545>That made me very nervous, because I no longer wanted to go back to the widow’s house and to so much discipline and civilization, as they called it.</t545> <t546>Then the old man started cursing everything and everyone he could think of, and then cursed them again to make sure he hadn't forgotten anyone, and ended with a sort of general curse against everyone, even a bunch of people whose names he didn’t know, so when he got to them he would say whatever their name is, and kept on cursing.</t546>
<t547>He said he would like to see how the widow would take me away.</t547> <t548>He said he was going to be watchful and that if they tried to pull that trick on him, he knew a place six or seven miles away where he could hide me, and where they could search until they dropped dead without finding me.</t548> <t549>That made me nervous again, but only for a minute; I figured that by then I wouldn't be around there anymore.</t549>
<t550>The old man made me go to the boat to fetch what he had brought.</t550> <t551>There was a fifty-pound sack of corn oats and a quarter of streaky bacon, ammunition, a four-gallon jug of whiskey, an old book and two newspapers to fill gaps, as well as some tow.</t551> <t552>I carried a load and then went back to sit at the bow of the boat to rest.</t552> <t553>I thought it all over again and decided to escape with the shotgun and some fishing lines, and when I escaped I would go to the woods.</t553> <t554>I thought I wouldn't stay in one fixed place, but rather go from one side of the country to the other, mostly at night, hunting and fishing for food, until I got so far that neither the old man nor the widow could ever find me.</t554> <t555>I figured I could finish sawing and leave that night if father got drunk enough, as I supposed he would.</t555> <t556>I got so excited that I didn't realize how much time had passed until the old man started shouting and asked if I had fallen asleep or drowned.</t556>
<t557>I took all the things to the cabin and then it got dark.</t557> <t558>While I was cooking dinner, the old man had a couple of drinks to warm up and started making a fuss again.</t558> <t559>He had already gotten drunk in town and spent the night in the ditch, and he was truly a sight to see.</t559> <t560>Anyone would think he was Adam: you couldn't see anything of him but mud.</t560> <t561>When he was quite drunk, he almost always picked on the government.</t561> <t562>That time he goes and says:</t562>
<t563>—And they call this a government! Just look around to see what it really is.</t563> <t564>They make a law to take a man's son away from him: his own son, with all the work, worries, and expenses it took to raise him.</t564> <t565>Yes, and just when that man has finally raised his son to the age where he can start working and doing something for him so he can rest, the law comes and takes him away.</t565> <t566>And they call that a government!</t566> <t567>And that's not all.</t567> <t568>The law sides with that old Judge Thatcher and helps him take away my property.</t568> <t569>Look at what the law does: the law grabs a man who has six thousand dollars or more and locks him up in an old cabin like this and lets him wear clothes that aren't even fit for a pig.</t569> <t570>And they call that a government!</t570> <t571>With a government like that, there's no way a man can have rights.</t571> <t572>Sometimes I'm tempted to leave the country for good.</t572> <t573>Yes, and I've said it; I've said it to old Thatcher's face.</t573> <t574>Lots of people heard me, and they can say I said it.</t574> <t575>I go and say: "For two cents I'd leave this damned country and never come back even if they paid me."</t575> <t576>That's exactly what I said; "Look at this hat—if you can even call it a hat—it lifts up at the top and falls down until it slips under my chin and it's not even a hat anymore, but more like they stuck my head in a chimney pipe.</t576> <t577>Look at it," I go and say: "What a hat for a guy like me, one of the richest men in this town if my rights were recognized."</t577>
<t578>»Ah, yes, this government is wonderful, wonderful and you just have to see it.</t578> <t579>I saw a free black man from Ohio: a mulatto, almost as white as a white man.</t579> <t580>He wore the whitest shirt you've ever seen in your life and the shiniest hat, and in the whole town, there's no one who has clothes as good as his, and he carried a gold watch with its chain and a cane with a silver handle: he was the most impressive white-haired nabob in the state.</t580> <t581>And, what do you think?»</t581> <t582>They said he was a university professor, and that he spoke lots of languages and knew everything.</t582> <t583>And that's not the worst part.</t583> <t584>They said that in his state he could vote.</t584> <t585>That was already too much.</t585> <t586>I say: «What's happening with this country?</t586> <t587>If it were election day and I thought about going to vote if I wasn't too drunk to get there, when they told me that there was a state in this country where they let that black man vote, I wouldn't go».</t587> <t588>And I go and say: «I'm not going to vote again».</t588> <t589>That's what I said, word for word; everyone heard me, and as far as I'm concerned, the country can rot: I'm not going to vote again in my life.</t589> <t590>And the airs that black man gave himself: but if he didn't get out of the way, I would have given him a shove.</t590> <t591>And I go and tell people: «Why don't they auction off this black man and sell him? I'd like to know».</t591> <t592>And, do you know what they said?</t592> <t593>Well, they said he couldn't be sold until he had been in the state for six months and he hadn't been there that long yet.</t593> <t594>But anyway, just so you see.</t594> <t595>And they call that a government when you can't sell a free black man until he's been in the state for six months.</t595> <t596>Well, what a government that says it's a government and acts like it's a government and believes it's a government and then has to stay calm for a whole six months before laying hands on a free black man who's lurking around, stealing, infernal, with his white shirts, and... »</t596>
<t597>Father was so angry that he didn't realize where his legs were taking him, so he tripped over the barrel of salted pork and skinned his ankles, and the rest of his speech was a series of the most terrible insults, mostly against the black man and the government, although he also directed some at the barrel, interspersed from time to time.</t597> <t598>He was jumping around the cabin like a madman, first on one leg and then on the other, grabbing first one ankle and then the other, and finally he suddenly kicked the barrel with his left foot.</t598> <t599>But he didn't do it right, because he hit it with the boot through which two of his toes were sticking out, so he started screaming in a way that made one's hair stand on end, and he fell to the ground, rolling around grabbing his toes and uttering worse curses than all the previous ones.</t599> <t600>He himself said later: he had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his good times and claimed that he had surpassed him, but it seems to me that he might have been exaggerating a bit.</t600>
<t601>After dinner, father handed him the jug, saying that there was enough whiskey for two drunks and a delirium tremens.</t601> <t602>It was what he always said.</t602> <t603>I thought he would be completely drunk within an hour, and then I would either steal the key or escape, one of the two things.</t603> <t604>He kept drinking and drinking, and after a while, he lay down on top of the blankets; but I had no luck.</t604> <t605>He didn't fall completely asleep, but woke up from time to time.</t605> <t606>He spent a long time moaning and complaining and tossing and turning.</t606> <t607>Finally, I got so sleepy that I couldn't keep my eyes open, and without realizing it, I fell completely asleep, with the candle still lit.</t607>
<t608>I don't know how long I had been asleep, but suddenly a horrible scream sounded and I woke up.</t608> <t609>It was father, who seemed crazy and was jumping from one place to another, shouting that there were snakes there.</t609> <t610>He said they were crawling up his legs, and then he would jump and scream and say that one had bitten him on the cheek, but I didn't see any snakes.</t610> <t611>He started running around the cabin, shouting: "Get it off me!</t611> <t612>Get it off me! It's biting my neck!"</t612> <t613>I've never seen anyone with such a crazy look.</t613> <t614>He quickly got exhausted and fell to the ground panting; then he started spinning around at full speed, kicking everywhere and hitting the air and grabbing it with his hands, shouting and saying that the devils were taking him away.</t614> <t615>Little by little he began to tire and stayed quiet for a while, moaning.</t615> <t616>Then he stayed still and didn't make a sound.</t616> <t617>In the distance, in the forest, you could hear the owls and the wolves and everything seemed to be in a terrible silence.</t617> <t618>He was lying in a corner.</t618> <t619>After a while, he partially got up to listen, with his head tilted to one side.</t619> <t620>And then he says, in a very low voice:</t620>
<t621>—Boom... Boom... Boom...; it's the dead, boom... boom...; they come to get me, but I'm not going.</t621> <t622>Ah, there they are!</t622> <t623>Don't touch me... no!</t623> <t624>Get those hands off... they are cold; let go of me.</t624> <t625>Leave this poor devil alone!</t625>
<t626>Then he got on all fours and crawled away, asking them to leave him alone, and wrapped himself in the blanket and got under the pine table as best as he could, while he kept begging them, and then he started to cry.</t626> <t627>You could hear him from under the blanket.</t627>
<t628>Then he rolled out and jumped to his feet with a crazed look, saw me, and lunged at me.</t628><t629>He chased me all over the cabin with a switchblade, calling himself the Angel of Death and saying he was going to kill me, and I wouldn't be able to come back for him anymore.</t629><t630>I begged him; I told him I was just Huck, but he laughed with a screeching laugh and didn't stop roaring, cursing, and chasing me.</t630><t631>Once, when I stopped suddenly and was about to dodge under his arm, he grabbed me by the jacket between the shoulders, and I thought that was the end of me, but I quickly slipped out of the jacket like lightning and saved myself.</t631><t632>He soon got exhausted again and collapsed backward against the door, saying he was going to rest for a moment before killing me.</t632><t633>He hid the knife where he was sitting and said he was going to sleep to regain his strength, and then we would see who was who.</t633>
<t634>So he fell asleep very quickly.</t634> <t635>Then I took out the old chair that had the broken seat and climbed onto it very calmly, so as not to make any noise, and took down the shotgun.</t635> <t636>I inserted the ramrod to make sure it was loaded and then placed it on top of the barrel of turnips, pointing at father, and sat behind it until he moved.</t636> <t637>And time passed very slowly, always in silence.</t637>
<t638>Chapter 7</t638>
<t639>—GET UP! What are you doing?</t639>
<t640>I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to see where I was.</t640> <t641>The sun had already risen and I had slept like a log.</t641> <t642>Father was standing next to me, with a sour face and looking like he felt unwell.</t642> <t643>He goes and says:</t643>
<t644>—What are you doing with that shotgun?</t644>
<t645>I thought he didn't know anything about what had happened, so I went and told him:</t645>
<t646>—Someone tried to get in, so I was keeping watch.</t646>
<t647>—Why didn't you wake me up?</t647>
<t648>—Well, I tried, but I couldn't; you didn't notice.</t648>
<t649>—Alright.</t649> <t650>Don't stay there chatting all day, go outside and see if there's any fish on the line for breakfast.</t650> <t651>I'll go in a moment.</t651>
<t652>He opened the door and I went out to the riverbank.</t652> <t653>I saw pieces of branches and other things floating downstream and some tree bark, so I understood that the river had started to rise.</t653> <t654>I thought that if I had been in town, I would have had a great time.</t654> <t655>The June flood always brought me luck, because as soon as that flood arrives, cut logs and pieces of log rafts come down: sometimes a dozen logs together; so you just have to collect them and sell them to the sawmill and the carpenters.</t655>
<t656>I climbed up the shore with one eye on father and the other on what the rising water might bring.</t656> <t657>Then suddenly a canoe arrives; and moreover, a splendid one, about thirteen or fourteen feet long, sailing very stiffly like a duck.</t657> <t658>I jumped headfirst into the water like a frog, clothes and all, and swam towards the canoe.</t658> <t659>I imagined there might be someone inside, because that's what some people do to trick others, and when someone is about to pull a boat to shore, they stand up and start laughing.</t659> <t660>But not this time.</t660> <t661>It was a canoe truly drifting, and I got into it and took it to the shore.</t661> <t662>I thought the old man would be happy when he saw it: it would be worth ten dollars.</t662> <t663>But when I reached the shore, father was still not in sight, and as I was taking it into a half-hidden stream, all covered with willows and vines, another idea occurred to me: I thought of hiding it well and then, instead of going into the woods when I escaped, I would go down the river about fifty miles and camp in a place forever, without the trouble of wandering around on foot.</t663>
<t664>That was very close to the hut and all the time it seemed to me that I heard the old man arriving, but I managed to hide it and then went out and looked through a group of willows and saw the old man down the path, aiming at a bird with the shotgun.</t664> <t665>So he hadn't seen anything.</t665>
<t666>When he arrived, I was pulling with all my strength on a line set to drag.</t666> <t667>He insulted me a bit for being so slow, but I told him that I had fallen into the river and that's why I had taken so long.</t667> <t668>I knew he would notice that I was wet and then he would start asking questions.</t668> <t669>We pulled five catfish from the drag and went home.</t669>
<t670>When we took a nap after breakfast, because we were both exhausted, I started thinking that if I could manage to prevent either my father or the widow from trying to follow me, I would be safer than if I relied on luck to get very far before they missed me; you know, thousands of things could happen.</t670>
<t671>Well, for a while nothing came to mind, but then father got up for a moment to drink another barrel of water, and he goes and says:</t671>
<t672>—If another man comes to spy on us here, wake me up, do you understand?</t672> <t673>That man hasn't come for anything good.</t673> <t674>I would have shot him.</t674> <t675>Next time, wake me up, do you understand?</t675>
<t676>Then he lay down and went back to sleep; what he had said gave me the exact idea I wanted, so I said to myself: "I can arrange it so that no one thinks of following me."</t676>
<t677>By midday we got up and went up the riverbank.</t677> <t678>The river was rising quickly and lots of things were floating down with the water.</t678> <t679>After a while, a piece of a raft appeared: nine logs tied together.</t679> <t680>We went out with the boat and brought it to shore.</t680> <t681>Then we ate.</t681> <t682>Anyone who wasn't father would have waited to see what happened that day to bring us more things, but that wasn't his style.</t682> <t683>With nine logs he had enough for one time; he had to go to town immediately to sell them.</t683> <t684>So around three-thirty he locked me up and left with the boat and started towing the raft.</t684> <t685>I figured he wouldn't come back that night.</t685> <t686>I waited until I thought he was far enough away and then took out the saw and went back to working on that log.</t686> <t687>Before he finished crossing the river, I was already out through the hole; he and his raft were just a speck in the water, far away.</t687> <t688>I grabbed the sack of cornmeal, took it to where the canoe was hidden, moved the vine leaves and branches aside, and put it in; then I did the same with the quarter of smoked bacon, and then with the jug of whiskey.</t688> <t689>I took all the coffee and sugar there was, and all the ammunition.</t689> <t690>I took the stuffing paper, the bucket, and the canteen; I took out a pot, a metal cup, my old saw, and two blankets, the frying pan, and the coffee pot.</t690> <t691>I grabbed the fishing lines, the matches, and other things: everything that was worth something.</t691> <t692>I emptied the cabin.</t692> <t693>I needed an axe but there was only the one in the woodpile and I knew why I was going to leave it there.</t693> <t694>I took out the shotgun and finished.</t694>
<t695>I had left all the ground packed down with the exit of the hole and with the transport of so many things.</t695> <t696>So I fixed it as best as I could, throwing dirt on top, which disguised the packed part and the sawdust that had fallen.</t696> <t697>Then I put the piece of log back in its place and put two stones underneath it and another one on the side so it wouldn't fall, because that part was irregular and didn't quite touch the ground.</t697> <t698>If one stayed four or five feet away, without knowing it was sawed, it couldn't be seen, and besides, that was the back of the cabin and it wasn't likely that anyone would look around there.</t698>
<t699>Until reaching the canoe, there was nothing but grass, so no tracks were left.</t699> <t700>I took a walk around to be sure.</t700> <t701>I stayed on the riverbank and looked upstream and downstream.</t701> <t702>There was no danger.</t702> <t703>So I grabbed the shotgun and went a little into the forest.</t703> <t704>I was looking for birds to hunt when I saw a wild pig; the pigs would quickly go wild around that area when they escaped from the prairie farms.</t704> <t705>I shot this one and took it to the camp.</t705>
<t706>I grabbed the axe and jumped over the door.</t706> <t707>I smashed it as much as I could.</t707> <t708>I brought the pig inside and dragged it almost to the table, then I cut its throat with the axe and left it on the ground to bleed; I say on the ground because it was dirt: compacted and without floorboards.</t708> <t709>Then I took an old sack and filled it with large stones —all that I could drag—, starting where the pig was, and dragged it to the door and through the woods to the river, where I threw it; it sank and disappeared.</t709> <t710>It was easy to see that something had been dragged across the ground.</t710> <t711>I thought that I wished Tom Sawyer had been there; I knew he was interested in these things and that he would add the precise details.</t711> <t712>Nobody knew how to embellish things like Tom Sawyer in a matter like this.</t712>
<t713>Well, the last thing I did was pull out some of my hair, stain the axe with blood, and leave it in the back, thrown in a corner.</t713> <t714>Then I grabbed the pig and covered it against my chest with the jacket (so it wouldn't drip) until I got far away from the house, and I threw it into the river.</t714> <t715>Then I thought of something else.</t715> <t716>So I went to take the sack of flour and the old saw from the canoe and brought them to the house.</t716> <t717>I left the sack where it usually was and made a hole in the bottom with the saw, because there were no knives or forks there: father cooked everything with the pocket knife.</t717> <t718>Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards through the grass, among the willows, to the east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five miles wide and full of reeds and also ducks when it was the season.</t718> <t719>There was a stream or a brook that came out from there on the other side and ran for miles and miles, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river.</t719> <t720>The flour kept moving and leaving a small trail all the way to the lake.</t720> <t721>There I also threw father's sharpening stone, to make it look like something accidental.</t721> <t722>Then I closed the hole in the sack of flour with a string so that no more would fall out and took it back with the saw to the canoe.</t722>
<t723>It was almost dark, so I left the canoe downstream covered by some willows that hung over the bank and waited for the moon to come out.</t723> <t724>I tied the canoe to a willow; then I ate something and after a while, I lay down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and make a plan.</t724> <t725>And I go and tell myself: "They are going to follow the trail of that sack of stones to the shore and then they will drag the river to look for me.</t725> <t726>They will follow the flour trail to the lake, search the stream that comes out of it to find the thieves who killed me and took my things.</t726> <t727>They are only going to search the river for my corpse.</t727> <t728>Then they will soon get tired and won't worry about me anymore.</t728> <t729>Very well, I can stay wherever I please.</t729> <t730>Jackson's Island is enough for me; I know it very well and no one ever comes here.</t730> <t731>And then I can go to town at night, look around and take what I need.</t731> <t732>Jackson's Island is fine."</t732>
<t733>I was quite tired and without realizing it, I fell asleep.</t733> <t734>When I woke up, I didn't know for a moment where I was.</t734> <t735>I sat up and looked around, a little scared.</t735> <t736>Then I remembered.</t736> <t737>The river seemed to be miles and miles wide.</t737> <t738>The moon shone so brightly that you could count the logs drifting down, black and silent, hundreds of yards from the shore.</t738> <t739>Everything was in total silence and it seemed to be late, it smelled like it was late.</t739> <t740>You know what I mean...</t740> <t741>I don't know with what words to say it.</t741>
<t742>I yawned and stretched comfortably, and I was about to untie to set off when I heard a noise in the water.</t742> <t743>I listened.</t743> <t744>Immediately I understood what it was.</t744> <t745>It was that rhythmic and muffled noise that oars make in the oarlocks in the silence of the night.</t745> <t746>I looked through the branches of the willows and there it was: a boat on the river.</t746> <t747>I couldn't see how many people it carried.</t747> <t748>It kept getting closer, and when it reached in front of me it only had one man.</t748> <t749>And I go and think: "Maybe it's father," even though I wasn't expecting him.</t749> <t750>It went downstream with the current and after a while it reached the shore, where the water was calm, and passed so close that I could have touched it by extending the shotgun.</t750> <t751>Well, it was indeed father, and moreover calm, by the way he left the oars.</t751>
<t752>I didn't waste any time.</t752> <t753>The next moment, I was going downstream, silently but quickly, in the shadow of the riverbank.</t753> <t754>I covered two and a half miles and then moved a quarter of a mile more towards the center of the river, because I was about to pass by the ferry landing and people could see me and call out to me.</t754> <t755>I got among the drifting logs and then lay down at the bottom of the canoe and let it float on its own.</t755> <t756>There I stayed, rested well, and smoked a pipe, gazing at the sky; there wasn't a single cloud.</t756> <t757>The sky always seems so deep when you lie on your back in the moonlight; I had never noticed it until then.</t757> <t758>And how many things you can hear from afar on nights like that!</t758> <t759>I heard people talking at the landing.</t759> <t760>And I heard what they were saying: every single word.</t760> <t761>One man remarked that the long days and short nights were coming.</t761> <t762>The other said that this wasn't one of the short ones, he guessed, and then they laughed and said it again and again and laughed again; then they woke up another person and told him, laughing, but he didn't laugh; he said something very grumpily and they left him alone.</t762> <t763>The first one said he would surely tell his old lady because she would find it very funny, but he said that was nothing compared to the things he had said in his time.</t763> <t764>I heard a man say it was almost three o'clock and he hoped daylight wouldn't take more than a week to arrive.</t764> <t765>Then the conversation gradually faded away, and I could no longer distinguish the words, but I could still hear the noise and occasionally a laugh, only now everything seemed very far away.</t765>
<t766>The ferry had already passed.</t766> <t767>I got up and there was Jackson Island, about two and a half miles downstream, full of trees and rising in the middle of the river, big, dark, and solid, like a steamboat without any lights.</t767> <t768>There wasn't a single sign on the tip bar: now all that was submerged.</t768>
<t769>It didn't take me long to get there.</t769> <t770>I passed by the point at great speed, given the swiftness of the current, and then I reached the calm waters and disembarked on the side facing the Illinois shore.</t770> <t771>I put the canoe into a deep crevice in the bank that I had seen before.</t771> <t772>I had to part the willow branches to get in, and when I tied it up, no one could see it from outside.</t772>
<t773>I climbed up and sat on a log at the tip of the island to contemplate the great river and the lumber that was passing by, and the town, three miles away, where three or four lights could be seen blinking.</t773> <t774>There was a huge raft of logs floating a mile upstream, coming down with a lit lantern in the middle.</t774> <t775>I watched as it slowly approached, and when it was almost in front of me, I heard a man say, "Ahoy, stern oars! Turn the bow to starboard!"</t775> <t776>I heard him just as clearly as if that man had been right next to me.</t776>
<t777>Now there was already some gray in the sky and I went into the forest and took a nap before breakfast.</t777>
<t778>Chapter 8</t778>
<t779>THE SUN WAS already so high when I woke up that I thought it would be after eight.</t779> <t780>I lay in the grass in the cool shade, thinking about things and feeling rested and very comfortable and satisfied.</t780> <t781>The sun could be seen through one or two holes, but mostly there were large trees everywhere and among them many shadows.</t781> <t782>There were dappled spots on the ground where the light filtered through the leaves, and the dappled spots changed a bit, which showed that there was a slight breeze blowing.</t782> <t783>A couple of squirrels sat on a branch and chattered at me in a very friendly manner.</t783>
<t784>I felt very lazy and comfortable: I didn't want to get up to make breakfast.</t784> <t785>Well, I was about to go back to sleep when it seemed to me that I heard a "boom!" in the distance, upriver.</t785> <t786>I wake up and prop myself on my elbow and listen; immediately I hear it again.</t786> <t787>I jumped up and went to look through a gap between the leaves, and I see a lot of smoke above the water, very far upriver: approximately in front of the ferry.</t787> <t788>And there was the ferry, full of people, floating down.</t788> <t789>Then I understood what was happening.</t789> <t790>"Boom!"</t790> <t791>I saw the white smoke coming out of the side of the ferry.</t791> <t792>So, they were firing the cannon over the water, trying to make my corpse surface.</t792>
<t793>I was quite hungry, but it was better not to make a fire, because they might see the smoke.</t793> <t794>So I sat there watching the smoke from the cannon and listening to the "boom."</t794> <t795>The river was a mile wide there and it always looks very beautiful on a summer morning, so I had a pretty good time watching them search for my remains, and all I was missing was something to eat.</t795> <t796>Well, then it occurred to me that they always put mercury in loaves of bread and let them float, because they usually go straight to where the drowned body is and stay there.</t796> <t797>So I said to myself, "I'll keep an eye out, and if one of them floats by close to me, I'll give it a try."</t797> <t798>I moved to the side of the island facing Illinois to see how lucky I would be, and it didn't go badly.</t798> <t799>A big loaf floated by and I almost grabbed it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and it kept floating.</t799> <t800>Of course, I was where the current came closest to the shore, because I knew that was the best spot.</t800> <t801>But after a while, another one came by, and this time I hooked it.</t801> <t802>I took out the plug to remove the little piece of mercury and took a bite.</t802> <t803>It was "baker's bread": the kind that fine people eat; not cheap corn bread.</t803>
<t804>I found myself a good spot among the leaves and sat on a log, chewing the bread and watching the ferry, very happy.</t804> <t805>And then something occurred to me.</t805> <t806>I go and say: "Now I suppose the widow or the parson or someone has prayed for this bread to find me, and that's what happened.</t806> <t807>So there's no doubt that there's some truth to that story: that there's some truth when someone like the widow or the parson prays, but it doesn't work with me, and I suppose it only works with certain people."</t807>
<t808>I lit a pipe and spent a good while smoking while I continued watching.</t808> <t809>The ferry floated downstream and I thought I would have a chance to see who was on board when it got closer, because it would stay almost beside me, just like the bread had done.</t809> <t810>When they got close enough to me, I put out the pipe and went to where I had hooked the bread and hid behind a log on the riverbank in a small clearing.</t810> <t811>I could look through the part where the log forked.</t811>
<t812>After a while they arrived, and the boat came so close that they could have laid down a plank to get ashore.</t812> <t813>Almost everyone was on the boat: father and Judge Thatcher and Becky Thatcher, and Joe Harper, and Tom Sawyer and his old Aunt Polly and Sid and Mary and many more.</t813> <t814>Everyone was talking about the murder, but the captain goes and interrupts them and says:</t814>
<t815>—Pay attention now; this is where the current comes closest and maybe it has floated to the shore and is tangled in the weeds at the water's edge.</t815> <t816>At least, that's what I hope.</t816>
<t817>I did not expect it.</t817> <t818>They all crowded together to look over the railing, and they almost hit me in the face, and they did nothing but look, look with all their might.</t818> <t819>I could see them perfectly, but they couldn't see me.</t819> <t820>Then the captain shouted: "Move aside!", and the cannon fired such a blast right next to me that it left me deaf from the noise and almost blind from the smoke, and I thought I was going to die.</t820> <t821>If they had put some charge in it, I reckon they would have gotten the corpse they were looking for.</t821> <t822>Well, I saw that I wasn't injured, thank God.</t822> <t823>The ship kept floating and disappeared around the tip of the island.</t823> <t824>From time to time I heard the cannon shots, getting farther and farther away, and after a while, about an hour or so, I couldn't hear them anymore.</t824> <t825>The island was three miles long.</t825> <t826>I thought they had reached the end and were giving up; but not yet.</t826> <t827>They circled the island and steamed up the river on the Missouri side, firing cannon shots now and then as they went.</t827> <t828>I went to that side and watched them.</t828> <t829>When they reached the other end of the island, they stopped firing and headed towards the Missouri shore and returned to the town.</t829>
<t830>Now I understood that I was already safe.</t830> <t831>Nobody was going to come looking for me.</t831> <t832>I took the traps out of the canoe and set up a good camp in the middle of the forest.</t832> <t833>I made a sort of tent with the blankets to put my things under it so they wouldn't get wet from the rain.</t833> <t834>I caught a catfish, opened it with the saw, and towards dusk, I lit my fire and had dinner.</t834> <t835>Then I cast a line to catch something for breakfast.</t835>
<t836>When it got completely dark, I sat by the campfire, smoking, and felt very satisfied; but after a while, I started to feel lonely, so I went to sit by the riverbank to listen to the splashing of the water. I counted the stars and the logs drifting by and the rafts, and then I lay down; there is no better way to pass the time when one feels lonely; you can't continue like that, and after a while, it passes.</t836>
<t837>And so three days and nights passed.</t837> <t838>No change: always the same.</t838> <t839>But the next day I went to explore the whole island.</t839> <t840>I was the master; everything was mine, so to speak, and I wanted to know it entirely, but above all, I wanted to pass the time.</t840> <t841>I found heaps of strawberries, ripe and wonderful, and green summer grapes and green blackberries, and the blackberries were just starting to come out.</t841> <t842>I thought everything would come in very handy in time.</t842>
<t843>Well, I was entertaining myself inside the forest until it seemed to me that I was not far from the tip of the island.</t843> <t844>I had taken my shotgun, but I hadn't shot at anything; it was for protection; I thought I would find something to hunt near home.</t844> <t845>Then I almost stepped on a good-sized snake, which went slithering through the grass and flowers, and I went after it, trying to shoot it.</t845> <t846>I was making good progress when suddenly I came across the ashes of a campfire that was still smoking.</t846>
<t847>My heart jumped between my lungs.</t847> <t848>I didn't wait to keep looking further; instead, I assembled the shotgun and tiptoed as fast as I could in silence.</t848> <t849>From time to time, I would stop for a moment among the leaves and listen, but I was breathing so hard that I couldn't hear anything else.</t849> <t850>I kept moving forward a bit and listened again, and so on, over and over.</t850> <t851>If I saw a stump, I thought it was a man; if I stepped on a twig and broke it, I felt as if someone had cut my breath in two and I was left with only half, and the shorter half at that.</t851>
<t852>When I arrived at the camp, I didn't feel very calm or very brave, but I went and said: "This is no time to fool around."</t852> <t853>So I put all my traps back in the canoe so no one could see them, put out the campfire and scattered the ashes around to make it look like an old camp from last year, and then I climbed up a tree.</t853>
<t854>I think I spent two hours in the tree, but I didn't see anything.</t854> <t855>I didn't hear anything; it just seemed to me that I had heard and seen at least a thousand things.</t855> <t856>Well, I couldn't stay there forever either, so I finally got down, but I remained in the center of the forest and alert the whole time.</t856> <t857>I couldn't eat anything but blackberries and what was left of breakfast.</t857>
<t858>When it got really dark, I was quite hungry, so when it was completely dark, I silently slipped into the water before the moon came out and paddled to the Illinois shore: about a quarter of a mile.</t858> <t859>I went into the woods, cooked myself something for dinner, and had practically decided to spend the whole night there when I heard a clip-clop and thought that horses were coming; and then I heard people's voices.</t859> <t860>I put everything in the canoe as quickly as I could and crawled through the woods to see if I could find out anything.</t860> <t861>I hadn't gone far when I heard someone say:</t861>
<t862>—We better camp here if we find a good spot; the horses are very tired.</t862> <t863>Let's take a look.</t863> <t864>I didn't wait, but moved away and began to leave silently.</t864> <t865>I went back to tie up at the previous spot and figured I would sleep in the canoe.</t865>
<t866>I didn't sleep much.</t866> <t867>I don't know why, but I couldn't, because I was thinking.</t867> <t868>And every time I woke up, I thought someone was grabbing me by the neck.</t868> <t869>So the sleep was of no use to me.</t869> <t870>After a while, I go and tell myself: "I can't keep living like this; I'm going to find out who is on the island with me; either I find out or I die."</t870> <t871>Well, I immediately felt better.</t871>
<t872>So I grabbed the paddle and went down just one or two steps from the shore, and then let the canoe drift into the shadows on its own.</t872> <t873>The moon was shining, and where there was no shadow it was almost like daylight.</t873> <t874>I was searching for almost an hour, in a silence like a tomb, while everything slept.</t874> <t875>Well, by then I had almost reached the tip of the island.</t875> <t876>A gentle, rippling, and fresh breeze started to blow, which meant that the night was about to end.</t876> <t877>I gave a stroke of the paddle and brought the canoe to the shore; then I took out the shotgun and slipped to the edge of the forest.</t877> <t878>There I sat on a log, looking through the leaves.</t878> <t879>I saw that the moon was finishing its shift and that the river was starting to get dark.</t879> <t880>But after a while, I saw a pale strip above the trees and knew that day was coming.</t880> <t881>So I took out the shotgun and advanced to where I had found that campfire, stopping to listen every minute or two.</t881> <t882>But I don't know why I wasn't lucky; it was as if I couldn't find the place.</t882> <t883>But after a while, finally, I saw a remnant of the fire's glow among the trees.</t883> <t884>I went towards it, very carefully and calmly.</t884> <t885>Soon after, I was close enough to take a look, and there was a man lying on the ground.</t885> <t886>It almost gave me a fit.</t886> <t887>He had his head wrapped in a blanket, right next to the fire.</t887> <t888>I sat next to some bushes about six feet from him, staring at him.</t888> <t889>It was already starting to get light with the gray of dawn.</t889> <t890>Soon after, he yawned, stretched, and took off the blanket, and it was Jim, Miss Watson's Jim!</t890> <t891>Boy, was I glad to see him!</t891> <t892>I go and say:</t892>
<t893>—Hi, Jim! —and I jumped out.</t893>
<t894>He stood up abruptly and looked at me with wide eyes.</t894> <t895>Then he dropped to his knees, clasped his hands, and said:</t895>
<t896>—Don't hurt me, please!</t896> <t897>I've never harmed a ghost.</t897> <t898>I've always been a friend to the dead and done what I could for them.</t898> <t899>Go back to the river again, which is your place, and don't do anything to old Jim, who has always been your friend.</t899>
<t900>Well, it didn't take long for me to make him understand that I wasn't dead.</t900> <t901>He was very happy to see Jim.</t901> <t902>I no longer felt alone.</t902> <t903>I told him that I wasn't afraid of him telling people where he had seen me.</t903> <t904>I kept talking, but he continued sitting there, looking at me, without saying a single word.</t904> <t905>Then I go and say:</t905>
<t906>—It's already daytime.</t906> <t907>Let's go look for breakfast.</t907> <t908>Stoke the fire well.</t908>
<t909>—What good is it to stoke the fire to cook strawberries and things like that?</t909> <t910>But you have a shotgun, don't you?</t910> <t911>That way we can eat something better than strawberries.</t911>
<t912>—Strawberries and things like that —I go and say—.</t912> <t913>Are you living off that?</t913>
<t914>—It's the only thing I can find —he says.</t914>
<t915>—But, how long have you been on the island, Jim?</t915>
<t916>—The night comes after they killed you.</t916>
<t917>—How, so long?</t917>
<t918>—Yes, sir.</t918>
<t919>—And you haven't eaten anything other than those things?</t919>
<t920>—No, sir; nothing else.</t920>
<t921>—Well, you must be starving, right?</t921>
<t922>—I reckon I could devour a horse.</t922> <t923>Really, I could.</t923> <t924>How long have you been on the island?</t924>
<t925>—Since the night they killed me.</t925>
<t926>—No! And, what have you lived on?</t926> <t927>But you have a shotgun.</t927> <t928>Ah, yes, you have a shotgun.</t928> <t929>That's very good.</t929> <t930>Now you kill something and I'll make a fire.</t930>
<t931>So we went to where the canoe was, and while he was setting up the bonfire in a clearing in the grass among the trees, I went to get flour and bacon and coffee, and a coffee pot and a pan and sugar and some tin cups, and the black man was very astonished, because he thought I did everything by witchcraft.</t931> <t932>I also caught a good catfish and Jim cleaned it with his knife and fried it.</t932>
<t933>When breakfast was ready, we lay down on the grass and ate it while it was still warm.</t933> <t934>Jim started eating with great appetite, as he was half dead from hunger.</t934> <t935>When we were full, we rested and lay down.</t935>
<t936>Shortly after, Jim goes and says:</t936>
<t937>—But, hey, Huck, who did they kill in the cabin if it wasn't you?</t937>
<t938>Then I told him the whole story and he said that I had been very clever.</t938> <t939>He said that Tom Sawyer couldn't come up with a better plan than mine.</t939> <t940>Then I go and say:</t940>
<t941>—And how is it that you're here, Jim, how did you get here?</t941> <t942>He seemed to get nervous and didn't say anything for a minute.</t942> <t943>Then he goes and says:</t943>
<t944>—Maybe it's better if I don't tell you.</t944>
<t945>—Why, Jim?</t945>
<t946>—Well, there are reasons.</t946> <t947>But you wouldn't snitch if I told you, would you, Huck?</t947>
<t948>—Not by these, Jim.</t948>
<t949>—Well, I believe you, Huck.</t949> <t950>I... I have escaped.</t950>
<t951>—Jim!</t951>
<t952>—But remember you said you wouldn't tell... you know you said you wouldn't tell, Huck.</t952>
<t953>—Well, it's true.</t953> <t954>I said no and I stand by it.</t954> <t955>Really, truly.</t955> <t956>People will call me a damn abolitionist and despise me for not saying anything, but I don't care.</t956> <t957>I'm not going to accuse you and anyway, I'm never going back there.</t957> <t958>So now tell me everything.</t958>
<t959>—Well, look, it happened like this.</t959> <t960>The old maid, that is, Miss Watson, spends her time picking on me and treats me very badly, but she always said she wouldn't sell me in Orleans.</t960> <t961>But I noticed that there was a slave trader who spent a lot of time around the house, and I started to get nervous.</t961> <t962>Well, one night I go up to the door very late, and the door wasn't completely closed, and I hear the old maid telling the widow that she's going to sell me in Orleans, even though she didn't want to, but that she could get eight hundred dollars for me, and it was so much money that she couldn't resist.</t962> <t963>The widow tried to make her promise not to, but I didn't wait to hear the rest.</t963> <t964>I assure you, I left as fast as I could.</t964>
<t965>»I dashed downhill, hoping to steal a boat on the shore somewhere upstream from the town, but there were still people awake, so I hid in the old cooper's workshop, which is half-collapsed on the shore, to wait for everyone to leave.</t965> <t966>Well, I spent the night there.</t966> <t967>There was always someone around.</t967> <t968>Around six in the morning, boats started passing by, and by eight or nine, all the boats that passed were saying that your father had come to town to say you had been killed.</t968> <t969>The last boats were full of ladies and gentlemen who were going to see the place.</t969> <t970>Sometimes they would tie up at the shore to rest before starting the crossing, and I found out about your death from what they were saying.</t970> <t971>I felt very sorry that you had been killed, Huck, but not anymore.</t971>
<t972>"I stayed hidden there all day, under the shavings and sawdust.</t972> <t973>I was hungry, but not scared, because I knew the old maid and the widow were going to the camp sermon shortly after breakfast and would be gone all day, and they knew I went out with the cattle at dawn, so they wouldn't expect to see me around the house and wouldn't miss me until after dark.</t973> <t974>The other servants wouldn't either, because they were going to go partying as soon as the old women were out of the house.</t974>
<t975>"Well, when it got dark, I went up the river road, about two miles or more until there were no more houses."</t975> <t976>"I had decided what I was going to do."</t976> <t977>"I mean, if I tried to escape on foot, the dogs would find me; if I stole a boat to cross, it would be missed, you understand, and they would know I was going to the other side and where to look for my trail."</t977> <t978>"So I say: 'What I need is a raft; that leaves no tracks.'"</t978>
<t979>"I saw a light passing by the tip, so I got in and pushed a log in front of me and swam more than half of the river and got in among the timber that was floating down, with my head low, and kind of swam upstream until the raft appeared."</t979> <t980>"Then I swam to the stern to grab on."</t980> <t981>"Clouds came and it was dark for a while."</t981> <t982>"So I climbed up to lie down on the planks."</t982> <t983>"The men were all in the middle, where the lantern was."</t983> <t984>"The river was rising and there was a good current, so I thought that by four in the morning I would be twenty-five miles downstream and then I would get back into the water before swimming again and getting into the woods on the Illinois side."</t984>
<t985>"But I wasn't lucky."</t985> <t986>"When we had almost reached the tip of the island, a man started coming aft with the lantern."</t986> <t987>"I saw that it was useless to wait, so I let myself fall and swam to the island."</t987> <t988>"Well, I thought I could touch the bottom almost anywhere, but no; the shore was too steep."</t988> <t989>"I had to go almost to the end of the island before finding a good spot."</t989> <t990>"I went into the forest and thought I wouldn't get on any more rafts while they kept walking around with the lantern."</t990> <t991>"I had the pipe and a bit of tobacco in my cap that hadn't gotten wet, so there was no problem."</t991>
<t992>—So you haven't eaten either meat or bread all this time?</t992> <t993>Why didn't you look for river turtles?</t993>
<t994>—And how was I supposed to catch them?</t994> <t995>You can't just pounce on them and grab them; and, how are you supposed to kill them with a stone? How do you do that at night?</t995> <t996>And I wasn't going to let them see me on the shore during the day.</t996>
<t997>—Well, it's true.</t997> <t998>Of course, you had to stay in the forest the whole time.</t998> <t999>Did you hear how they fired the cannon?</t999>
<t1000>—Ah, yes.</t1000> <t1001>I knew they were looking for you.</t1001> <t1002>I saw them pass by here... I watched them through the bushes.</t1002>
<t1003>Some little birds passed by, flying a yard or two each time and then landing again.</t1003> <t1004>Jim said it was a sign that it was going to rain.</t1004> <t1005>He said that it meant the same thing when chicks did it, so he thought it was the same when little birds did it.</t1005> <t1006>I was going to hunt some, but Jim didn't let me.</t1006> <t1007>He said it brought death.</t1007> <t1008>He said that his father got very sick once and someone in his family caught a bird and his grandmother said that his father would die and that's what happened.</t1008>
<t1009>And Jim said that one shouldn't talk about the things one was going to cook for dinner, because it brought bad luck.</t1009> <t1010>The same as if one shook the tablecloth after nightfall.</t1010> <t1011>And he said that if a man had a beehive and that man died, one had to tell the bees before the sun rose again the next morning, because if not, the bees would get sick and stop working and die.</t1011> <t1012>Jim said that bees didn't sting idiots, but I didn't believe it, because I had messed with them dozens of times and they never stung me.</t1012>
<t1013>Some of those things I had already heard before, but not all of them.</t1013> <t1014>Jim knew a bunch of those signs.</t1014> <t1015>He said he knew almost all of them.</t1015> <t1016>I said that it seemed to me that all the signs brought bad luck, so I asked him if there was any sign of good luck.</t1016> <t1017>And he goes and says:</t1017>
<t1018>—Very few, and they are of no use to anyone.</t1018> <t1019>Why do you want to know when good luck is coming?</t1019> <t1020>Do you want it not to come? —and he added—:</t1020> <t1021>If you have hairy arms and a hairy chest, it's a sign that you are going to be rich.</t1021> <t1022>Well, that is worth something, because it is always for a long time in the future.</t1022> <t1023>You know, maybe you have to be poor for a long time first, and then you might get discouraged and kill yourself, if you didn't know from that sign that in time you are going to be rich.</t1023>
<t1024>—Do you have hair on your arms and chest?</t1024>
<t1025>—And why are you asking me that?</t1025> <t1026>Can't you see that I am?</t1026>
<t1027>—Well, are you rich?</t1027>
<t1028>—No, but I was rich once and I will be again.</t1028> <t1029>Once I had fourteen dollars, but I got into speculating and ruined myself.</t1029>
<t1030>—What did you speculate on, Jim?</t1030>
<t1031>—Well, I started with stocks.</t1031>
<t1032>—What kind of values?</t1032>
<t1033>—Well, real assets: you know, livestock.</t1033> <t1034>I invested ten dollars in a cow.</t1034> <t1035>But I won't risk money on assets again.</t1035> <t1036>The cow went and died on me.</t1036>
<t1037>—So, you lost the ten dollars.</t1037>
<t1038>—No, I didn't lose them all.</t1038> <t1039>Just about nine.</t1039> <t1040>I sold the skin and the tail for a dollar and ten cents.</t1040>
<t1041>—You had five dollars and ten cents left.</t1041> <t1042>Did you keep speculating?</t1042>
<t1043>—Yes.</t1043> <t1044>Do you remember that black man of old Mr. Bradish who only has one leg?</t1044> <t1045>Well, he set up a bank and said that anyone who deposited a dollar would receive four more dollars at the end of the year.</t1045> <t1046>Well, all the black people deposited, but they didn't have much.</t1046> <t1047>I was the only one who had it.</t1047> <t1048>So I deposited more than four dollars and said that if he didn't give me what I was owed, I would open my own bank.</t1048> <t1049>Well, of course that black man didn't want me to compete with him, because he said there wasn't enough business for two banks, so he says I could put in my five dollars and he would pay me thirty-five at the end of the year.</t1049>
<t1050>»So that's what I did.</t1050> <t1051>Then I thought I would invest the thirty-five dollars to keep things moving.</t1051> <t1052>There was a black man named Bob who had a flatboat and his master didn't know about it, and I bought it from him and told him I would give him the thirty-five dollars at the end of the year; but someone stole the boat that night and the next day the lame black man said the bank had failed, so we all ended up without the money.</t1052>
<t1053>—What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?</t1053>
<t1054>—Well, I was going to spend it, but I had a dream and the dream told me to give it to a black man named Balum, who they call Balum's Donkey; you know, one of those half-wits, but they say he's lucky, and it was already clear that I wasn't.</t1054> <t1055>The dream says that Balum should invest the ten cents and make them grow.</t1055> <t1056>Well, Balum took the money, and when he was in church, he heard the preacher say that whoever gives to the poor lends to the Lord and in time would receive the money multiplied by a hundred.</t1056> <t1057>So Balum goes and gives the ten cents to the poor and waits to see what happens.</t1057>
<t1058>—Well, and, what happened, Jim?</t1058>
<t1059>—Nothing happened.</t1059> <t1060>I couldn't get him to return that money to me at all, and neither could Balum.</t1060> <t1061>I'm not going to lend any more money until they give me a guarantee.</t1061> <t1062>And the preacher said they would return the money to you a hundred times over!</t1062> <t1063>If he returned the ten cents to me, we would be even and I would be so happy.</t1063>
<t1064>—Well, Jim, it doesn't matter anyway, if you're going to be rich again sooner or later.</t1064>
<t1065>—Yes, and I'm already rich if you think about it.</t1065> <t1066>I own myself and I'm worth eight hundred dollars.</t1066> <t1067>I wish I had the money; I wouldn't want anything more.</t1067>
<t1068>Chapter 9</t1068>
<t1069>I FELT LIKE GOING to find a place that was towards the center of the island and that I had seen when I was exploring, so we set off and soon arrived, because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide.</t1069>
<t1070>That place was a rather long and steep hill, about forty feet high.</t1070> <t1071>It was hard for us to get to the top, as the sides were steep and the trees were thick.</t1071> <t1072>We searched everywhere and finally found a good cave in the rock, almost at the very top, on the side facing Illinois.</t1072> <t1073>The cave was as big as two or three rooms together, and Jim could stand up without hitting the ceiling.</t1073> <t1074>It was cool.</t1074> <t1075>Jim was in favor of storing our traps there immediately, but I told him it wouldn't be convenient to keep going up and down all the time.</t1075>
<t1076>Jim said that if we had the canoe hidden in a good spot and had all the traps in the cave, we could hide in it quickly if someone came to the island, and that without dogs they would never find us.</t1076> <t1077>And, besides, he said that the little birds had said it was going to rain and, did I want all our things to get wet?</t1077>
<t1078>So we went back, took out the canoe, and arrived in front of where the cave was and brought all the traps there.</t1078> <t1079>Then we looked for a place nearby to hide the canoe, among the large willows.</t1079> <t1080>Some fish had bitten on the lines; we caught them, rebaited the hooks, and started preparing for dinner.</t1080>
<t1081>The entrance of the cave was large enough to fit a barrel, and on one side of the entrance, the floor was a bit higher and smooth, meaning it was a good spot to light a fire.</t1081> <t1082>So we lit it there and prepared dinner.</t1082>
<t1083>Inside, we spread the blankets to serve as a carpet and to eat there.</t1083> <t1084>We placed everything else within reach at the back of the cave.</t1084> <t1085>Soon after, it got dark and started to thunder and lightning, meaning the birds were right.</t1085> <t1086>Immediately after, it began to rain heavily, and I have never seen the wind blow like that.</t1086> <t1087>It was one of those good summer storms.</t1087> <t1088>It was so dark that outside everything seemed a beautiful blue-black, and the rain fell so densely that the trees a short distance away looked like cobweb-like shadows, and gusts of wind came that bent the trees and made the leaves lift from the pale underside, and then came a fierce gust that made the branches wave their arms as if they had gone mad, and then, when it was at its bluest and blackest, whoosh!</t1088> <t1089>There was a glow like glory and the treetops swaying in the distance in the middle of the storm, hundreds of yards farther than what could be seen before; they turned black as sin in a second and then the thunder returned with a terrifying drumroll that continued growling, rolling, and staggering across the sky to the other side of the world, as if barrels were being rolled down stairs, you know, very long stairs where the barrels bounce a lot.</t1089>
<t1090>—Jim, this is very good —I said—.</t1090> <t1091>I wouldn't want to be anywhere else in the world.</t1091> <t1092>Give me another piece of fish and some hot cornbread.</t1092>
<t1093>—Well, you wouldn't be here if it weren't for Jim.</t1093> <t1094>You'd be out there in the forest and almost drowned; I assure you, my boy.</t1094> <t1095>Chickens know when it's going to rain and birds do too, boy.</t1095>
<t1096>The river kept rising for ten or twelve days until it began to flood the banks.</t1096> <t1097>The water was three or four feet deep on the island in the low-lying areas and on the Illinois shore.</t1097> <t1098>In that part, it measured many miles in width, but on the Missouri side, it was the same distance as always —half a mile— because the Missouri shore was like a wall of cliffs.</t1098>
<t1099>During the day, we would paddle around the island in the canoe.</t1099> <t1100>In the middle of the forest, it was very cool and there was always shade, even if outside the sun was burning us.</t1100> <t1101>We would go winding between the trees, and sometimes the vines were so thick that we had to backtrack and find another path.</t1101> <t1102>Well, in every old hollow tree, you could see rabbits and snakes and such things, and when the island had been flooded for one or two days, they were so tame from hunger that you could approach them and pet them if you wanted, but not the snakes or the turtles, which would slip away into the water.</t1102> <t1103>The hill where our cave was located was full of them.</t1103> <t1104>We could have had plenty of pets if we had wanted to.</t1104>
<t1105>One night we took a piece of a log raft: good pine logs.</t1105> <t1106>It measured twelve feet wide and fifteen or sixteen feet long, and the highest part was six or seven inches above the water: a solid and level surface.</t1106> <t1107>Sometimes we saw sawn logs passing by in the daylight, but we let them pass, because we never went out during the day.</t1107>
<t1108>Another night, when we were at the tip of the island, just before dawn, a wooden house appeared on the west side.</t1108> <t1109>It had two floors and was very tilted.</t1109> <t1110>We rowed over and climbed aboard: we got in through one of the upstairs windows.</t1110> <t1111>But it was still too dark to see, so we tied up the canoe and sat waiting for dawn.</t1111>
<t1112>The light began to arrive before we reached the other end of the island.</t1112> <t1113>Then we looked out the window.</t1113> <t1114>We saw a bed and a table and two old chairs and piles of things scattered on the floor, and there were clothes hanging next to the wall.</t1114> <t1115>In the farthest corner of the floor, there was something that looked like a man.</t1115> <t1116>So Jim says:</t1116>
<t1117>—Hey, you!</t1117>
<t1118>But he did not move.</t1118> <t1119>So I shouted again, and then Jim says:</t1119>
<t1120>—That one is not asleep: he is dead.</t1120> <t1121>You stay there, I'm going to check.</t1121>
<t1122>He approached, bent down to look, and said:</t1122>
<t1123>—He is dead.</t1123> <t1124>Yes, sir; and naked.</t1124> <t1125>He has been shot in the back.</t1125> <t1126>I estimate he has been dead for two or three days.</t1126> <t1127>Come, Huck, but don't look at his face.</t1127> <t1128>It's too horrible.</t1128>
<t1129>I didn't look at all.</t1129> <t1130>Jim threw some old rags over it, but it wasn't necessary; I didn't want to see it.</t1130> <t1131>All over the floor were scattered piles of old, greasy playing cards, old whiskey bottles, and a couple of masks made of black cloth, and the walls were full of the clumsiest signs and drawings, made with charcoal.</t1131> <t1132>There were two old dresses made of dirty calico and a bonnet and some women's underwear hanging next to the wall, and also men's clothing.</t1132> <t1133>We put everything in the canoe: it might be useful.</t1133> <t1134>On the floor, I found an old straw hat for a boy; I picked it up too.</t1134> <t1135>And there was also a bottle with milk and a cloth stopper for a baby to suck on.</t1135> <t1136>We would have taken the bottle, but it was broken.</t1136> <t1137>There was an old, damaged dresser and an old trunk with broken locks.</t1137> <t1138>They were open, but there was nothing left worth taking.</t1138> <t1139>From the way things were scattered, we figured that the people had left in a hurry, without time to take most of their belongings.</t1139>
<t1140>We took an old tin lantern and a butcher knife without a handle and a brand-new Barlow knife that would be worth twenty-five cents in any store and a bunch of tallow candles; a tin candlestick and a canteen; a tin cup and an old frayed bed quilt; a sewing kit with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all those things; an axe and some nails and a fishing line as thick as my little finger with some huge hooks; a roll of buckskin and a leather dog collar and a lock and many medicine bottles that had no labels, and when we were leaving I found a pretty good currycomb and Jim an old worn-out violin bow and a wooden leg.</t1140> <t1141>The suspenders had fallen off, but other than that it was a pretty good leg, although too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find the other one, even though we searched everywhere.</t1141>
<t1142>So, overall, we got a good load.</t1142> <t1143>When we were ready to leave, we were already a quarter of a mile below the island and it was broad daylight, so I had Jim lie down in the canoe and cover himself with the quilt, because if he sat up, people could see from afar that he was black.</t1143> <t1144>I paddled to the Illinois side and meanwhile gained half a mile drifting.</t1144> <t1145>I went up the still waters under the bank and had no accidents nor hurt anyone.</t1145> <t1146>We got home safe and sound.</t1146>
<t1147>Chapter 10</t1147>
<t1148>AFTER BREAKFAST I wanted to talk about the dead man and speculate on how he might have been killed, but Jim didn't want to.</t1148> <t1149>He said it brought bad luck, and besides, he said, it could come to haunt us, because a man who wasn't buried had more chances of going around as a ghost than one well planted and comfortable.</t1149> <t1150>That seemed quite reasonable, so I didn't say more, but I couldn't stop thinking about it or wanting to know who had shot that man and why.</t1150>
<t1151>We searched through the clothes we had taken with us and found eight dollars in coins sewn into the lining of an old overcoat.</t1151> <t1152>Jim said that he thought the people in the house had stolen the overcoat, because if they had known the money was there, they wouldn't have left it.</t1152> <t1153>I said that surely they had also killed him, but Jim didn't want to talk about that.</t1153> <t1154>I go and say:</t1154>
<t1155>—Well, you think it brings bad luck, but what did you say when I brought the snake skin I found on the hill yesterday?</t1155> <t1156>You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake skin with your hands.</t1156> <t1157>Well, look at the bad luck!</t1157> <t1158>We have brought all this and on top of that eight dollars.</t1158> <t1159>I wish we had such bad luck every day, Jim.</t1159>
<t1160>—Don't think anymore, my child, don't think anymore.</t1160> <t1161>Don't get too excited.</t1161> <t1162>It will come.</t1162> <t1163>Remember what I tell you, it will come.</t1163>
<t1164>And yes, it did arrive.</t1164> <t1165>It was a Tuesday when we talked about it.</t1165> <t1166>Well, on Friday after lunch we were lying on the grass at the top of the hill and we ran out of tobacco.</t1166> <t1167>I went to the cave to look for something and I came across a rattlesnake.</t1167> <t1168>I killed it and coiled it at the foot of Jim's blanket, very naturally, thinking how much fun it would be when Jim found it.</t1168> <t1169>Well, at night I forgot about the snake, and when Jim lay down on the blanket while I was lighting a lantern, there was the snake's mate and it bit him.</t1169>
<t1170>He jumped and screamed, and the first thing we saw in the light was the creature coiled and ready to strike again.</t1170> <t1171>I killed it in a second with a stick and Jim grabbed father's jug of whiskey and began to pour it.</t1171>
<t1172>He was barefoot and the snake had bitten him on the heel.</t1172> <t1173>And all that because I had been so stupid that I didn't remember that whenever you kill a snake, its mate always appears and coils around it.</t1173> <t1174>Jim told me to cut off the snake's head and throw it away, then skin the body and roast a piece.</t1174> <t1175>That's what I did, and he ate it and said it would help cure him.</t1175> <t1176>He made me remove the rattles and tie them to his wrist.</t1176> <t1177>He said that would also relieve him.</t1177> <t1178>Then I went out quietly and threw the snakes far away into the bushes, because I wasn't going to let Jim find out that it was all my fault if I could help it.</t1178>
<t1179>Jim sucked and sucked from the demijohn and occasionally he would get furious and writhe, screaming, but every time he came to, he would suck from the jug again.</t1179> <t1180>His foot swelled up a lot and the same happened to his leg.</t1180> <t1181>But after a while, he started to get drunk, so I thought he was okay, although I would have preferred to be bitten by a snake than to have my father's whiskey.</t1181>
<t1182>Jim lay down for four days and nights.</t1182> <t1183>Then the swelling disappeared, and he started walking again.</t1183> <t1184>I decided that I would never again touch a snake skin with my hands, now that I had seen what happened.</t1184> <t1185>Jim said he figured that next time I would believe him because touching snake skins brought so much bad luck that it might not even be over yet.</t1185> <t1186>He said he would rather see the new moon over his left shoulder a thousand times than touch a snake skin with his hand.</t1186> <t1187>Well, I was also beginning to think the same, although I have always thought that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the silliest and most absurd things you can do.</t1187> <t1188>Old Hank Bunker did it once and bragged a lot about it, and less than two years later he got drunk, fell from the water tower, and was so flattened that he looked like a sheet, so to speak, and they had to put him sideways between two barn doors instead of a coffin and buried him that way, they say, but I don't believe it.</t1188> <t1189>My father told me, but anyway, that's what happens when you look at the moon like that, like an idiot.</t1189>
<t1190>Well, the days went by and the river flowed again between its banks, and one of the first things we did was bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and cast it, and we caught a catfish as big as a man, because it measured six feet and two inches and weighed more than two hundred pounds.</t1190> <t1191>Of course, we couldn't pull it in, because it would have dragged us to Illinois.</t1191> <t1192>We sat watching it thrash and struggle until it drowned.</t1192> <t1193>In its stomach, we found a copper button, a round ball, and lots of other things.</t1193> <t1194>We split the ball with the axe and inside there was a spool.</t1194> <t1195>Jim said it had swallowed it a long time ago and that's why it had formed a ball around it.</t1195> <t1196>It was one of the biggest fish ever caught in the Mississippi, I think.</t1196> <t1197>Jim said he had never seen a bigger one.</t1197> <t1198>In town, it would have been worth a lot of money.</t1198> <t1199>They sell those fish by the pound at the market; everyone buys some; their skin is as white as snow and they taste very good when fried.</t1199>
<t1200>The next morning I said that everything was getting very boring and that I wanted to see some action.</t1200> <t1201>I said that I thought I was going to cross the river to see what was happening.</t1201> <t1202>Jim liked the idea; but he said I had to go at night and be very careful.</t1202> <t1203>Then he kept thinking and added that I could put on some of the clothes we had and dress as a girl.</t1203> <t1204>That was also a good idea.</t1204> <t1205>So we shortened one of the calico dresses and I rolled up the legs of my pants to my knees and put it on.</t1205> <t1206>Jim fastened it at the back with the hooks, and it fit me well.</t1206> <t1207>I put on the bonnet and tied it under my chin, and if someone looked at me and saw my face it was like looking through a chimney pipe.</t1207> <t1208>Jim said no one would recognize me, not even during the day.</t1208> <t1209>I spent the whole day training to get used to it, and after a while it fit me quite well, only Jim said I didn't walk like girls, and that I had to stop lifting my skirts to put my hands in my pockets.</t1209> <t1210>I listened to him and it fit better.</t1210>
<t1211>I went to the Illinois side in the canoe just after dark.</t1211>
<t1212>I went towards the town from a little below the ferry landing and the current drifted me to the edge of the town.</t1212> <t1213>I moored and started walking along the shore.</t1213> <t1214>There was a light on in a cabin where no one had lived for a long time and I wondered who might be there.</t1214> <t1215>I approached to look through the window.</t1215> <t1216>There was a woman of about forty years old knitting by the light of a candle placed on a pine table.</t1216> <t1217>I had never seen her before; she was a stranger, because in that town there wasn't a single face I didn't know.</t1217> <t1218>That was fortunate, because I was starting to have doubts.</t1218> <t1219>I was beginning to get scared that I had come; people might recognize me by my voice.</t1219> <t1220>But if that woman had been in such a small town for only two days, she could tell me everything I wanted to know, so I knocked on the door and decided not to forget that I was a girl.</t1220>
<t1221>Chapter 11</t1221>
<t1222>—COME IN —said the woman, and I obeyed—.</t1222> <t1223>Sit down.</t1223>
<t1224>I sat down.</t1224> <t1225>She looked at me very attentively with bright little eyes, and then she says:</t1225>
<t1226>—And, what's your name?</t1226>
<t1227>—Sarah Williams.</t1227>
<t1228>—Where do you live? Around here?</t1228>
<t1229>—No, ma'am.</t1229> <t1230>In Hookerville, seven miles down.</t1230> <t1231>I walked all the way and I am very tired.</t1231>
<t1232>—And I bet you're hungry.</t1232> <t1233>I'm going to get something.</t1233>
<t1234>—No, ma'am.</t1234> <t1235>I'm not hungry.</t1235> <t1236>I was so hungry that I had to stop two miles down from here at a farm, so I'm not hungry anymore.</t1236> <t1237>That's why I'm so late.</t1237> <t1238>My mother is sick and has run out of money and everything, and I've come to tell my uncle Abner Moore.</t1238> <t1239>He lives in the upper part of town, my mother told me.</t1239> <t1240>I've never been here before.</t1240> <t1241>Do you know him?</t1241>
<t1242>—No, but I still don't know everyone yet.</t1242> <t1243>I haven't even been here for two weeks.</t1243> <t1244>It's a long way from here to the upper part of the village.</t1244> <t1245>You'd better spend the night here.</t1245> <t1246>Take off your hat.</t1246>
<t1247>—No —I said—; I'm just going to rest for a while and then continue.</t1247> <t1248>The darkness doesn't scare me.</t1248>
<t1249>She said she wouldn't let me leave alone but that her husband would arrive later, maybe in an hour and a half, and he would tell her to accompany me.</t1249> <t1250>Then she started talking about her husband and her relatives upstream and her relatives downstream and how they used to live much better and that they didn't know if they had made a mistake by coming to our town, instead of settling for staying as they were, and so on, until I feared I had been wrong in thinking that she was going to give me news about what was happening in the town, but then she started talking about father and the murder and there I was indeed willing to let her keep on talking.</t1250> <t1251>She told me how Tom Sawyer and I had found the twelve thousand dollars (only she said it was twenty) and the whole story about father, and how bad he was and how bad I was and finally she got to the part where I was murdered, and I said:</t1251>
<t1252>—Who was it?</t1252> <t1253>In Hookerville, there has been much talk about all those things, but we don't know who it was that killed Huck Finn.</t1253>
<t1254>—Well, I suppose there are lots of people here who would want to know who killed him.</t1254> <t1255>Some say it was old Finn himself.</t1255>
<t1256>—No ... do they say that?</t1256>
<t1257>—At first, that's what everyone believed.</t1257> <t1258>He will never know how close he came to being lynched.</t1258> <t1259>But soon they changed their minds and decided it was done by a runaway Black man named Jim.</t1259>
<t1260>—But if he...</t1260>
<t1261>I kept quiet.</t1261> <t1262>I figured it was better not to say anything.</t1262> <t1263>She kept talking and didn't realize that I had interrupted her:</t1263>
<t1264>—The black man escaped the same night Huck Finn died.</t1264> <t1265>So now they are offering a reward for him: three hundred dollars.</t1265> <t1266>There is also a reward for old Finn: two hundred dollars.</t1266> <t1267>Notice that he came to town the morning after the murder and reported it, and went with the others to search for him on the ferry and immediately left.</t1267> <t1268>Right away they wanted to lynch him, but notice that he had already disappeared.</t1268> <t1269>Well, the next day they found out that the black man had fled and that no one had seen him since ten o'clock on the night of the murder.</t1269> <t1270>So then they offered a reward for him, you understand, and when everyone was convinced the next day, old Finn came back and went crying to Judge Thatcher to ask for money to search for the black man all over Illinois.</t1270> <t1271>The judge gave him some and that night he got drunk and stayed until after midnight with two very shady-looking strangers and then left with them.</t1271> <t1272>Well, since then he hasn't returned and they don't expect him until this blows over a bit, because now people think he killed his son and arranged things so everyone would believe it was done by some robbers and that way he could take Huck's money without having to bother with a lawsuit for too long.</t1272> <t1273>People say it wouldn't be surprising of him.</t1273> <t1274>Well, I reckon he's very clever.</t1274> <t1275>If he doesn't come back in a year, nothing will happen to him.</t1275> <t1276>Nothing can be proven against him, you know; by then things will have calmed down and he can leave with Huck's money without any problem.</t1276>
<t1277>—Yes, I suppose so, ma'am.</t1277> <t1278>I don't think there will be any problems.</t1278> <t1279>Do people no longer believe that the black man did it?</t1279>
<t1280>—Ah, no, not everyone.</t1280> <t1281>Many believe it was him.</t1281> <t1282>But they will catch the black guy very soon and they might scare him into telling the truth.</t1282>
<t1283>—But, are they still looking for him?</t1283>
<t1284>—Well, you really are innocent!</t1284> <t1285>Do you think three hundred dollars grow on trees every day?</t1285> <t1286>Some believe the black man hasn't gone very far.</t1286> <t1287>And neither do I...</t1287> <t1288>But I haven't told anyone.</t1288> <t1289>A few days ago, I was talking with a couple of old folks who live next door in the log cabin, and they said that almost no one goes to that island over there called Jackson Island.</t1289> <t1290>“And no one lives there?” I asked.</t1290> <t1291>“No, no one,” they said.</t1291> <t1292>I didn't say anything more, but I've been thinking about it.</t1292> <t1293>I was almost sure I had seen smoke over there, towards the tip of the island, a day or two ago, so I said to myself: “Maybe the black man is hiding there; in any case,” I said, “it's worth searching that island.”</t1293> <t1294>Since then, I haven't seen any more smoke, so maybe he's gone, if it was him; but my husband is going to check it out, with another person.</t1294> <t1295>He had to go upriver, but he came back today, and I told him as soon as he arrived two hours ago.</t1295>
<t1296>I had gotten so nervous that I couldn't stay still.</t1296> <t1297>I had to do something with my hands, so I took a needle from the table and started threading it.</t1297> <t1298>My hands were shaking and I did it very poorly.</t1298> <t1299>When the woman stopped talking, I looked up and she was looking at me very curiously and smiling a little.</t1299> <t1300>I put down the needle and thread and put on an interested face —and the truth is, I was interested— and I go and say:</t1300>
<t1301>—Three hundred dollars is a lot of money.</t1301> <t1302>I wish my mother had it.</t1302> <t1303>Is her husband going there tonight?</t1303>
<t1304>—Ah, yes.</t1304> <t1305>He has gone to the upper part of the town with the man I told you about, to look for a boat and see if they can borrow another shotgun.</t1305> <t1306>They are going to cross after midnight.</t1306>
<t1307>—Wouldn't they see better if they waited until it was daytime?</t1307>
<t1308>—Yes.</t1308> <t1309>And, wouldn't he also see better in the dark?</t1309> <t1310>After midnight, he is most likely asleep, and they can go through the forest and look for his campfire better if it's dark, if he has a campfire.</t1310>
<t1311>—It hadn't occurred to me.</t1311>
<t1312>The woman kept looking at me very curiously and I didn't feel comfortable at all.</t1312> <t1313>And after a moment she goes and asks:</t1313>
<t1314>—How did you say your name was, beautiful?</t1314>
<t1315>—M ... Mary Williams.</t1315>
<t1316>I don't know why, but it didn't seem to me that I had said it was Mary before, so I didn't look up...</t1316> <t1317>It seemed to me that I had said it was Sarah, so I felt cornered and was afraid that maybe it would show.</t1317> <t1318>I wanted the woman to say something else; the longer she stayed silent, the more uncomfortable I felt.</t1318> <t1319>But then she goes and says:</t1319>
<t1320>—Beautiful, I thought you said your name was Sarah when you arrived.</t1320>
<t1321>—Oh, yes, ma'am, it's true.</t1321> <t1322>Sarah Mary Williams.</t1322> <t1323>They called me Sarah as a first name.</t1323> <t1324>Some call me Sarah and others Mary.</t1324>
<t1325>—Ah, is that what's happening?</t1325>
<t1326>—Yes, ma'am.</t1326>
<t1327>I was already feeling better, but I still wanted to leave there anyway.</t1327> <t1328>I still didn't dare to lift my gaze.</t1328>
<t1329>Well, the woman started talking about how difficult times were and how poor they were and how rats were running everywhere, as if the house belonged to them, and about this and that, and I began to feel calmer.</t1329> <t1330>She was right about the rats.</t1330> <t1331>Every now and then you could see one poking its snout out of a hole in a corner.</t1331> <t1332>She said she had to have things on hand to throw at them when she was alone, because otherwise, they wouldn't leave her in peace.</t1332> <t1333>She showed me a twisted lead bar shaped like a knot and said that she generally had good aim, but that a day or two ago she had dislocated an arm and didn't know if she could aim well now.</t1333> <t1334>She waited for an opportunity and immediately threw the bar at a rat, but missed by a lot and said, "Oh!", that her arm hurt a lot.</t1334> <t1335>Then she asked me to try with the next one.</t1335> <t1336>I wanted to leave before her old man came back, but of course, I didn't say that.</t1336> <t1337>I grabbed the bar and threw it at the first rat that poked its snout out, and if it had stayed where it was, it wouldn't have felt very good.</t1337> <t1338>She said I threw very well and that she figured I would hit the next one.</t1338> <t1339>She got up to fetch the bar and brought it back along with a skein of yarn with which she wanted me to help her.</t1339> <t1340>I raised both hands and she placed the skein on them and continued talking about her things and her husband.</t1340> <t1341>But she interrupted herself to say:</t1341>
<t1342>—Stay alert for the rats.</t1342> <t1343>You better keep the bar handy, on your lap.</t1343>
<t1344>So she threw the piece of lead into my lap right at that moment and I squeezed my legs to catch it and she kept talking.</t1344> <t1345>But only for a minute or so.</t1345> <t1346>Then she took the skein from me and looked me in the eyes and said very kindly:</t1346>
<t1347>—Come on, now tell me what your real name is.</t1347>
<t1348>—Whaaat? What, ma'am?</t1348>
<t1349>—What is your real name?</t1349> <t1350>Is it Bill or Tom, or Bob? What is your name?</t1350>
<t1351>I think I started trembling like a leaf, not knowing what to do.</t1351> <t1352>But I said:</t1352>
<t1353>—Please, do not laugh at a poor girl like me, ma'am.</t1353> <t1354>If I bother you, I...</t1354>
<t1355>—No, nothing like that.</t1355> <t1356>Sit down and stay where you are.</t1356> <t1357>I'm not going to do anything to you nor will I betray you.</t1357> <t1358>You tell me your secret and trust me.</t1358> <t1359>I'll keep it, and what's more, I'll help you.</t1359> <t1360>My man, the same, if you want.</t1360> <t1361>I understand that you are an apprentice and you have run away and nothing more.</t1361> <t1362>It's nothing.</t1362> <t1363>There's nothing wrong with it.</t1363> <t1364>They have treated you badly and you have decided to run away.</t1364> <t1365>My son, I wouldn't betray you.</t1365> <t1366>Now tell me everything, be a good boy.</t1366>
<t1367>So I said that there was no point in continuing to pretend and that I would stop lying and tell him everything, but he had to keep his promise.</t1367> <t1368>Then I told him that my father and mother had died and that the law had assigned me to an old and mean farmer who lived at least thirty miles from the river and treated me so badly that I couldn't stand it anymore; he had gone away for a couple of days and I took the opportunity to steal an old dress from his daughter and run away, and it had taken me three nights to cover the thirty miles.</t1368> <t1369>I traveled at night and hid to sleep during the day, and the bag of bread and meat I had taken with me had lasted the whole way, and I still had some left.</t1369> <t1370>I said that I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me and that was why I had come to this town of Goshen.</t1370>
<t1371>—Goshen, kid?</t1371> <t1372>This is not Goshen.</t1372> <t1373>This is Saint Petersburg.</t1373> <t1374>Goshen is ten miles upriver.</t1374> <t1375>Who told you this was Goshen?</t1375>
<t1376>—Well, a man I met at dawn this morning, just as I was about to go into the forest to sleep, as always.</t1376> <t1377>He told me that the roads split and that I should follow the one on the right and after five miles I would be in Goshen.</t1377>
<t1378>—He must have been drunk.</t1378> <t1379>He told you exactly the opposite of what it is.</t1379>
<t1380>—Well, he did seem drunk, but it doesn't matter anymore.</t1380> <t1381>I have to keep going.</t1381> <t1382>I'll reach Goshen before dawn.</t1382>
<t1383>—Wait a moment.</t1383> <t1384>I'm going to give you something to eat.</t1384> <t1385>Maybe you need it.</t1385>
<t1386>So he prepared something for me to eat and said:</t1386>
<t1387>—Hey, when a cow lies down, which part does it get up from?</t1387> <t1388>Answer quickly, come on; don't stop to think about it.</t1388> <t1389>Which side does it get up from?</t1389>
<t1390>—Through the back, ma'am.</t1390>
<t1391>—Well, how about a horse?</t1391>
<t1392>—Through the front one, ma'am.</t1392>
<t1393>—On which side of a tree does moss grow?</t1393>
<t1394>—From the north.</t1394>
<t1395>—If there are fifteen cows grazing on a slope, how many of them eat with their heads facing the same direction?</t1395>
<t1396>—Three o'clock, ma'am.</t1396>
<t1397>—Well, I suppose it's true that you've lived in the countryside.</t1397> <t1398>I thought maybe you were trying to deceive me again.</t1398> <t1399>And what's your real name?</t1399>
<t1400>—George Peters, ma'am.</t1400>
<t1401>—Well, George, try to remember it.</t1401> <t1402>Don't forget and tell me it's Elexander before you leave and then try to fix it by saying it's George Elexander when I catch you.</t1402> <t1403>And don't go near women with that old dress.</t1403> <t1404>You do a pretty bad job as a girl, but maybe you can fool the men.</t1404> <t1405>And remember, son, when you start threading a needle, you don't have to hold the thread still and bring the needle to it: keep the needle still and pass the thread through it; that's how practically all women do it, but men always do it the other way around.</t1405> <t1406>And when you throw something at a rat or something like that, remember that you have to stand on tiptoe and raise your hand above your head as clumsily as you can and miss the rat by six or seven feet.</t1406> <t1407>Throw with a stiff arm from the shoulder, as if you had an axis, like girls do, and not with the wrist and elbow with the arm to the side, like boys do.</t1407> <t1408>And remember that when a girl tries to pick something up in her lap, she spreads her knees apart, not together like you did when I threw the lead bar at you.</t1408> <t1409>But man, I knew you were a boy as soon as you started threading the needle, and the other things I did to be sure.</t1409> <t1410>Now, run along to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into any trouble, send a message to Mrs. Judith Loftus, who is me, and I'll do what I can to get you out of it.</t1410> <t1411>Always follow the river road, and next time you set out, wear shoes and socks.</t1411> <t1412>The river road has a lot of stones, and I figure your feet will be worn out by the time you get to Goshen.</t1412>
<t1413>I went along the riverbank for about fifty yards and then retraced my steps to return to where my canoe was, quite far below the house.</t1413> <t1414>I jumped in and started running.</t1414> <t1415>I went upstream far enough to reach the tip of the island, and then I started to cross.</t1415> <t1416>I took off my bonnet, because I didn't want to go as if with earmuffs.</t1416> <t1417>When I was about halfway across, I heard the clock start to chime, so I stopped to listen; the sound was faint over the water, but clear: eleven o'clock.</t1417> <t1418>When I reached the tip of the island, I didn't stop to rest, even though I was out of breath; instead, I went straight to where my old camp was and lit a good fire, in a high and dry place.</t1418>
<t1419>Then I jumped into the canoe and went to our spot, a mile and a half downstream, as fast as I could.</t1419> <t1420>I disembarked and moved through the trees to the hill and reached the cave.</t1420> <t1421>There was Jim, sleeping like a log on the ground.</t1421> <t1422>I woke him up and said to him:</t1422>
<t1423>—Get up and get ready, Jim!</t1423> <t1424>There isn't a minute to lose.</t1424> <t1425>They're looking for us!</t1425>
<t1426>Jim didn't ask any questions or say a word; but from the way he worked the next half hour, it was clear that he was terrified.</t1426> <t1427>By then, we had everything we owned in the raft and were ready to take it out from among the willows where it was hidden.</t1427> <t1428>The first thing we did was put out the fire in the cave, and after that, we didn't light even a candle.</t1428>
<t1429>I moved the canoe away from the shore a little and started to look; but if there was a boat around there, I couldn't see it, because the stars and shadows aren't good for seeing much.</t1429> <t1430>Then we took out the raft and went down among the shadows, to the foot of the island in total silence, without saying a word.</t1430>
<t1431>Chapter 12</t1431>
<t1432>IT MUST HAVE BEEN almost one o'clock when we finally passed the end of the island and the raft seemed to move very slowly.</t1432> <t1433>If a boat came near, the plan was to get into the canoe and head towards the Illinois shore, and it's a good thing none did, because it hadn't occurred to us to put the shotgun in the canoe, nor a fishing line, nor anything to eat.</t1433> <t1434>We were in too much of a hurry to think of so many things.</t1434> <t1435>It hadn't been very smart to put everything on the raft.</t1435>
<t1436>If the men went to the island, I suppose they would find the bonfire I had made and would wait all night for Jim to arrive.</t1436> <t1437>In any case, they did not come near us, and if that bonfire did not deceive them, it was not my fault.</t1437> <t1438>I had done everything possible to mislead them.</t1438>
<t1439>When the first light of day began to appear, we moored to a sandbar that was in a large curve on the Illinois side, cut cottonwood branches with the axe, and covered the raft with them so that it would look like there had been a landslide along that shore.</t1439> <t1440>On those sandbars, the cottonwoods are as tightly packed as the teeth of a rake.</t1440>
<t1441>We saw mountains on the Missouri side and a lot of forest on the Illinois side, and the channel, on that part, ran on the Missouri side, so we weren't afraid of running into anyone.</t1441> <t1442>We stayed there all day watching the rafts and steamboats going down the Missouri side and the steamboats going upriver fighting against the current in the center.</t1442> <t1443>I told Jim everything that had happened when I was talking to the woman and Jim said she was very smart and that if she were the one looking for us, she wouldn't just sit by a fire; no, sir, she would go with a dog.</t1443> <t1444>Well, then, I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to get a dog?</t1444> <t1445>Jim said that she would surely think of it when the men set out, and he supposed she must have gone to the upper part of the town to get a dog, so they had lost all that time, or else we wouldn't be there on the sandbar sixteen or seventeen miles below the town; no, sir, we would be back in town.</t1445> <t1446>So I said I didn't care why they weren't coming, as long as they didn't come.</t1446>
<t1447>When it started to get dark, we poked our heads out among the poplars and looked up and down and to the sides but saw nothing, so Jim took some of the logs off the top of the raft and built a very comfortable wigwam for us to take shelter in when it got very hot or rained and to keep things dry.</t1447> <t1448>Jim made a floor for the wigwam and raised it a foot above the level of the raft, so that the blankets and traps were out of reach of the steamboat waves.</t1448> <t1449>Right in the middle of the wigwam, we put a layer of dirt five or six inches thick and surrounded it with a frame to keep it from spilling out; it was for making a fire when it rained or got cold; with the wigwam, it wouldn't be visible.</t1449> <t1450>We also prepared a spare rudder, because one of the ones we had could break or get caught or whatever.</t1450> <t1451>We set up a pole with a fork to hang the old lantern from, because we would always have to light it when we saw a steamboat coming downstream, so it wouldn't miss us, but we didn't have to light it for the ones going upstream unless we found ourselves in what they call "between currents," because the river was still very high and the low banks were still submerged, so the boats going upstream didn't always go through the channel but looked for easier waters.</t1451>
<t1452>The second night we sailed for seven or eight hours, with a current that went more than four miles per hour.</t1452> <t1453>We fished and chatted and occasionally went for a swim to avoid falling asleep.</t1453> <t1454>It was quite solemn to drift down the great silent river, lying on our backs and looking at the stars, and we didn't feel like speaking loudly or laughing much, just an occasional low chuckle.</t1454> <t1455>Overall, we had very good weather and nothing happened to us, neither that night nor the next nor the one after.</t1455>
<t1456>Every night we passed by villages, some of them far away on black hills, without seeing anything more than the glow of a few lights, and not a single house.</t1456> <t1457>On the fifth night we passed by Saint Louis and it was as if the entire world was illuminated.</t1457> <t1458>In Saint Petersburg, they said that Saint Louis had twenty or thirty thousand inhabitants, but I never believed it until I saw that wonderful amount of lights at two on a silent night.</t1458> <t1459>Not a sound was heard: everyone was asleep.</t1459>
<t1460>Every night I would go to the shore near some village and buy ten or fifteen cents worth of flour or salted bacon or other things to eat, and sometimes I would borrow a chicken that did not seem to feel comfortable.</t1460> <t1461>Father always said that you should take a chicken when you have the chance, because if you don't want it, it's easy to find someone who does, and a good deed is never forgotten.</t1461> <t1462>I never saw a single time that father didn't want it, but in any case, that's what he said.</t1462>
<t1463>In the mornings, before dawn, I would go into the cornfields and borrow a watermelon, or a melon, or a pumpkin, some new corn or things like that.</t1463> <t1464>Father always said that there was nothing wrong with borrowing things if you intended to pay for them someday; but the widow said that it was nothing but stealing, no matter how you dressed it up with words, and that decent people didn't do it.</t1464> <t1465>Jim said he figured the widow was partly right and dad was partly right, so the best thing would be to pick two or three things from the list and not borrow them again, and then he figured it wouldn't be wrong to borrow the others.</t1465> <t1466>So we spent a whole night talking about it, while we went down the river, trying to decide whether to eliminate the watermelons, the cantaloupes, the melons, or what.</t1466> <t1467>But by dawn we had everything satisfactorily resolved and concluded that we would eliminate the reinettes and the persimmons.</t1467> <t1468>We hadn't felt quite right before, but now we were at ease.</t1468> <t1469>I was glad we resolved it that way, because reinettes are never good and the persimmons wouldn't be ripe for another two or three months.</t1469>
<t1470>Every now and then we would kill a waterfowl that got up too early in the mornings or didn't go to bed early enough in the evenings.</t1470> <t1471>Overall, we lived very well.</t1471>
<t1472>The fifth night, downstream from Saint Louis, there was a great storm after midnight, with lots of thunder and lightning, and the rain fell like a sheet.</t1472> <t1473>We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft steer itself.</t1473> <t1474>When the lightning flashed, we saw the huge and straight river ahead and great cliffs on both sides.</t1474> <t1475>And once I go and say:</t1475>
<t1476>—Wow, Jim, look over there!</t1476>
<t1477>It was a steamboat that had wrecked against a rock.</t1477> <t1478>We were heading straight towards it.</t1478> <t1479>With the lightning, it was very clear.</t1479> <t1480>It was all listed, with part of the upper deck above the water, and you could see each of the chimney cables very clearly and a chair next to the big bell, with an old hat hanging on the backrest, when the lightning struck.</t1480>
<t1481>Well, since it was so late, there was that storm, and everything seemed so mysterious, I thought the same thing any other boy would when I saw that ship stranded so sad and lonely in the middle of the river.</t1481> <t1482>I wanted to board it and explore a bit to see what was inside.</t1482> <t1483>So I said:</t1483>
<t1484>—Let's tackle it, Jim.</t1484>
<t1485>But at first Jim was totally against it.</t1485> <t1486>He goes and says:</t1486>
<t1487>—I don't want to go poking my nose into a dead ship.</t1487> <t1488>We're doing very well, and it's better to let it stay that way, as the Book says.</t1488> <t1489>I'm sure there's a watchman on that ship.</t1489>
<t1490>—Watchman, your grandma —I said—; there's nothing to watch over except the wheelhouse and the upper cabins, and do you think anyone is going to risk their life for a wheelhouse and some cabins on a night like this, when it's most likely to break in two and go down the river at any moment?</t1490>
<t1491>Jim couldn't respond to that, so he didn't try.</t1491>
<t1492>—And besides —I said—, we could borrow something worthwhile from the captain's cabin.</t1492> <t1493>I'm sure there are cigars, the kind that cost five cents each in hard cash.</t1493> <t1494>Steamboat captains are always rich and earn sixty dollars a month, and they don't care what things cost, you know, if they feel like it.</t1494> <t1495>Put a candle in your pocket, Jim; I can't wait until we've searched it.</t1495> <t1496>Do you think Tom Sawyer would just leave a place like this?</t1496> <t1497>No way.</t1497> <t1498>He would say it was an adventure, that's what he would say, and he would board that ship even if it was the last thing he did in his life.</t1498> <t1499>And he would surely do it in style; don't you think he would organize a great one?</t1499> <t1500>Man, you would think he was Christopher Columbus discovering the New World.</t1500> <t1501>I wish Tom Sawyer were here.</t1501>
<t1502>Jim grumbled a bit, but he gave in.</t1502> <t1503>He said we didn't have to talk more than necessary, and that in a very low voice.</t1503> <t1504>The lightning showed us the wrecked ship just in time again, and we grabbed the starboard davit and tied up there.</t1504>
<t1505>The deck was very high on that side.</t1505> <t1506>We slowly descended the slope towards port, in the darkness, towards the high cabins, feeling our way very slowly with our feet and with our arms wide open to push aside the ropes, because it was so dark that we couldn't see anything.</t1506> <t1507>Soon we reached the front part of the skylight and climbed onto it, and with the next step we found ourselves in front of the captain's door, which was open, and, what the devil, at the other end of the cabins we saw a light!</t1507> <t1508>And at the same moment, it seemed that we heard low voices in the distance!</t1508>
<t1509>Jim whispered to me that he felt very bad and told me that we should leave.</t1509> <t1510>I said okay, and we were about to return to the raft when I heard a whining voice saying:</t1510>
<t1511>—Oh, please, no, guys!</t1511> <t1512>I swear I will never say it!</t1512>
<t1513>Another voice said, very loudly:</t1513>
<t1514>—It's a lie, Jim Turner.</t1514> <t1515>You've done the same thing before now.</t1515> <t1516>You always want more than your share of the loot, and you've always taken it, because you swore that if not, you would betray us.</t1516> <t1517>But now you've said it one time too many.</t1517> <t1518>You are the most disgusting and treacherous dog in this country.</t1518>
<t1519>By then, Jim had gone to the raft.</t1519> <t1520>I was boiling with curiosity.</t1520> <t1521>And I told myself that Tom Sawyer wouldn't back down now, so neither would I, and that I was going to see what was happening.</t1521> <t1522>So I got down on all fours in the hallway and moved forward in the dark until there was only one cabin between the cross-section of the cabins and me.</t1522> <t1523>Then I saw a man lying on the floor, tied hand and foot, and two others over him, one of them holding a dark lantern and the other with a gun.</t1523> <t1524>The latter kept pointing the gun at the head of the one on the floor and said:</t1524>
<t1525>—I would like to, and that's what I should do, you filthy snitch!</t1525>
<t1526>The man on the ground was shrinking, saying:</t1526>
<t1527>—Oh, please, no, Bill; I will never betray you.</t1527>
<t1528>And every time he said that, the man with the lantern laughed and said:</t1528>
<t1529>—Of course not!</t1529> <t1530>In your life, you have never spoken a greater truth, I assure you —and once he said—: Listen to how he begs!</t1530> <t1531>But if we didn't have him subdued and tied up, he would have killed us both.</t1531> <t1532>And why?</t1532> <t1533>For nothing.</t1533> <t1534>Just because we defended our rights, that's why.</t1534> <t1535>But I bet you, Jim Turner, that you won't threaten anyone again.</t1535> <t1536>Put down that gun, Bill.</t1536>
<t1537>Bill says:</t1537>
<t1538>—I don't feel like it, Jake Packard.</t1538> <t1539>I'm okay with killing him, didn't he kill old Hatfield like that, and doesn't he deserve it?</t1539>
<t1540>—But I don't want to kill him, and I have my reasons.</t1540>
<t1541>—Bless you for those words, Jake Packard!</t1541> <t1542>I won't forget them as long as I live! —says the man on the ground, as if stuttering.</t1542>
<t1543>Packard paid no attention, but hung the lantern on a nail and advanced towards where I was in the darkness and gestured to Bill to come closer.</t1543> <t1544>I retreated about two yards as quickly as I could, but the ship was so tilted that I couldn't go very fast, so to avoid him stumbling upon me and catching me, I hid in a cabin on the upper part.</t1544> <t1545>The man groped in the darkness, and when Packard reached my cabin he said:</t1545>
<t1546>—Here, come here.</t1546>
<t1547>And there he went in, with Bill behind him.</t1547> <t1548>But before they entered, I had climbed up to the top bunk, cornered and regretting having gone.</t1548> <t1549>Then they stayed there with their hands on the edge of the bunk, talking.</t1549> <t1550>I couldn't see them, but I knew where they were by the smell of the whisky they had drunk.</t1550> <t1551>I was glad I didn't drink whisky, although it wouldn't have mattered much, because it was almost impossible for them to smell me since I wasn't breathing.</t1551> <t1552>I was too scared.</t1552> <t1553>And besides, one couldn't breathe while listening to that.</t1553> <t1554>They spoke in low voices and very seriously.</t1554> <t1555>Bill wanted to kill Turner.</t1555> <t1556>He says:</t1556>
<t1557>—He said he would betray us, and he will.</t1557> <t1558>If we gave him our shares now, it wouldn't matter after the fight and what we've done to him.</t1558> <t1559>You can be sure he would testify against us; now, listen to me.</t1559> <t1560>I'm in favor of removing his troubles forever.</t1560>
<t1561>—And me too —said Packard, very calmly.</t1561>
<t1562>—Damn it, I had started to believe it wasn't going to happen.</t1562> <t1563>Well, then there's no problem.</t1563> <t1564>Let's go with it.</t1564>
<t1565>—Wait a moment; I haven't said my part yet.</t1565> <t1566>Listen to me.</t1566> <t1567>It's fine to shoot him, but there are more discreet ways if it needs to be done.</t1567> <t1568>But what I'm saying is this: there's no point in looking to get a noose around our necks when we can achieve the same thing without any risk.</t1568> <t1569>Isn't that right?</t1569>
<t1570>—Surely yes.</t1570> <t1571>But, how are you going to manage this time?</t1571>
<t1572>—Well, I've thought of the following: we search everywhere and gather what we might have forgotten in the cabins, we go to the shore and hide the loot.</t1572> <t1573>Then we wait.</t1573> <t1574>I say it won't be more than two hours before this wreck splits in two and floats down the river.</t1574> <t1575>Do you understand?</t1575> <t1576>He will drown and won't be able to report anyone.</t1576> <t1577>I think it's much better than killing him.</t1577> <t1578>I'm not in favor of killing someone if it can be avoided; it doesn't make sense and it's not moral.</t1578> <t1579>Am I right or not?</t1579>
<t1580>—I suppose so.</t1580> <t1581>But, what if it doesn't break and floats down?</t1581>
<t1582>—Well, anyway, we can wait two hours to see what happens, right?</t1582>
<t1583>—Alright; let's go.</t1583>
<t1584>So they set off and I took off, drenched in cold sweat, staggering to the bow.</t1584> <t1585>It was pitch dark but I said in a sort of hoarse whisper: "Jim!"</t1585> <t1586>He responded right next to me with a sort of groan and I said:</t1586>
<t1587>—Quick, Jim, there's no time to waste with complaints; there's a gang of murderers over there, and if we don't find their boat and push it into the river so they can't leave the ship, one of them is going to be in big trouble.</t1587> <t1588>But if we find the boat, we can leave them all in big trouble: the sheriff will find them.</t1588> <t1589>Quick... hurry!</t1589> <t1590>I'll search the port side and you search the starboard side.</t1590> <t1591>Start with the raft, and...</t1591>
<t1592>—Oh, my lord, my lord.</t1592> <t1593>Raft?</t1593> <t1594>There is no raft left.</t1594> <t1595>It has broken or disappeared!</t1595> <t1596>And we are here!</t1596>
<t1597>Chapter 13</t1597>
<t1598>WELL, I jumped and fainted.</t1598> <t1599>Trapped on a shipwreck with a band of murderers!</t1599> <t1600>But there was no time for whining.</t1600> <t1601>Now we had to find the boat and take it for ourselves.</t1601> <t1602>We went down trembling and shivering on the starboard side and it took a long time: it seemed like a week passed before we reached the stern.</t1602> <t1603>There was no sign of the boat.</t1603> <t1604>Jim said he didn't think he had the strength to go on: he was so scared he couldn't take it anymore, he said.</t1604> <t1605>But I told him: "Come on, if we stay here, we're sure to have a bad time."</t1605> <t1606>So we kept looking.</t1606> <t1607>We went to the stern of the upper deck and found it; then we climbed up through the skylight as best we could, grabbing onto every iron, because the edge of the skylight was already in the water.</t1607> <t1608>When we were quite close to the lobby, we found the boat, at last!</t1608> <t1609>I barely saw it.</t1609> <t1610>I felt very happy.</t1610> <t1611>One more second and I would have boarded, but just then the door opened.</t1611> <t1612>One of the men stuck his head out just a couple of feet from me and I thought my final hour had come, but he pulled it back in and said:</t1612>
<t1613>—Bill, hide that damn lantern!</t1613>
<t1614>He threw a sack with something into the boat and then got in and sat down.</t1614> <t1615>It was Packard.</t1615> <t1616>Then Bill came out and got into the boat.</t1616> <t1617>Packard goes and says:</t1617>
<t1618>—Ready... push!</t1618>
<t1619>I could barely hold onto the bars, I felt so weak.</t1619> <t1620>But Bill goes and says:</t1620>
<t1621>—Wait... have you searched him?</t1621>
<t1622>—No.</t1622> <t1623>And you?</t1623>
<t1624>—No.</t1624> <t1625>So, he still has his share of the money.</t1625>
<t1626>—Alright, let's go then.</t1626> <t1627>It doesn't make sense to take the things and leave the money.</t1627>
<t1628>—Hey, do you think he suspects what we're preparing?</t1628>
<t1629>—Maybe not.</t1629>
<t1630>So they disembarked and went back in.</t1630> <t1631>The door slammed shut because it was on the tilted side, and half a second later I found myself in the boat and Jim stumbled in behind me.</t1631> <t1632>I took out the knife, cut the rope, and we were off!</t1632>
<t1633>We did not touch a single oar nor did we speak or whisper, and we almost didn't even breathe.</t1633> <t1634>We slid down very quickly, in total silence, past the drum of the wheel and the stern, and then, in a second or two more, we were a hundred yards below the ship and the darkness hid it without a trace; we were safe and we knew it.</t1634>
<t1635>When we were three or four hundred yards downstream, we saw the lantern like a little spark at the door of the upper deck for a second and knew from that that the bandits had seen that they were left without the boat and were beginning to understand that they themselves had as much trouble as Jim Turner.</t1635>
<t1636>Then Jim took to the oars and we started looking for our raft.</t1636> <t1637>It was then that I began to worry about the men: I guess I hadn't had time before.</t1637> <t1638>I started to think how terrible it was, even for murderers, to be in such a situation.</t1638> <t1639>I told myself that I didn't know if I would ever become a murderer and then how I would feel about it.</t1639> <t1640>So I go and say to Jim:</t1640>
<t1641>—The first light we see, we disembark a hundred yards below or above it, in a place where you and the boat can hide well, and then I'll go and tell them some story and get someone to go fetch that gang and get them out of their situation, so they can be hanged when the time comes.</t1641>
<t1642>But the idea failed, because the storm started again immediately, and this time worse than before.</t1642> <t1643>The rain was pouring down in torrents and not a light was to be seen; I guess everyone was in bed.</t1643> <t1644>We went down the river looking for lights and keeping an eye on our raft.</t1644> <t1645>After a long while, the rain stopped but it remained cloudy and lightning continued to flash, and one of them showed us something black floating ahead, so we headed there.</t1645>
<t1646>It was the raft, and we were very happy to get back on it.</t1646> <t1647>Then we saw a light down on the shore, to the right.</t1647> <t1648>So I said we should go there.</t1648> <t1649>The boat was half full of the loot that the gang had stolen from the wrecked ship.</t1649> <t1650>We piled it all onto the raft and I told Jim to drift downstream and light a signal when he thought he had gone two miles and to keep it lit until I arrived; then I took the oars and headed towards the light.</t1650> <t1651>When I got closer, I saw three or four more lights on a hill.</t1651> <t1652>It was a town.</t1652> <t1653>I went straight to the light on the shore, stopped rowing, and kept floating.</t1653> <t1654>As I passed, I saw it was a lantern hanging from the mast of a double-hulled ferry.</t1654> <t1655>I started looking for the watchman, wondering where he might be sleeping, and after a while, I saw him leaning against the bow bitt, with his head resting on his knees.</t1655> <t1656>I gave him two or three taps on the shoulder and started to cry.</t1656>
<t1657>He started to stretch as if alarmed, but when he saw it was only me, he yawned and stretched well, and then said:</t1657>
<t1658>—Hey, what's wrong?</t1658> <t1659>Don't cry, boy.</t1659> <t1660>What's happening to you?</t1660>
<t1661>And I say:</t1661>
<t1662>—Father and mother and my little sister...</t1662>
<t1663>And I started crying again.</t1663> <t1664>Then he goes and says:</t1664>
<t1665>—Come on, damn it, don't be like that; we all have our problems and this one will get sorted out.</t1665> <t1666>What's wrong with them?</t1666>
<t1667>—They... they... are you the ship's watchman?</t1667>
<t1668>—Yes —he says, with a very satisfied air—.</t1668> <t1669>I am the captain and the owner and the second mate and the pilot and the lookout and the chief sailor, and sometimes I am the cargo and the passengers.</t1669> <t1670>I am not as rich as Jim Hornback and I can't be as generous with everyone and throw money around like him, but I have told him many times that I wouldn't trade places with him; because, I say, mine is the life of a sailor, and hang me if I would live two miles from town, where nothing ever happens, with all his money and much more he might have.</t1670> <t1671>I say...</t1671>
<t1672>I interrupt him and say:</t1672>
<t1673>—They are in a horrible situation, and...</t1673>
<t1674>—Who?</t1674>
<t1675>—Well, father and mother and my little sister and Miss Hooker, and if you were there with your ferry...</t1675>
<t1676>—Where? Where are they?</t1676>
<t1677>—On the ship that has wrecked.</t1677>
<t1678>—What ship?</t1678>
<t1679>—Well, it's the only one there is.</t1679>
<t1680>—What? You don't mean Walter Scott, do you?</t1680>
<t1681>—Yes.</t1681>
<t1682>—Heavens! What are they doing there, for the love of God?</t1682>
<t1683>—Well, they weren't on purpose.</t1683>
<t1684>—Surely not!</t1684> <t1685>But, my God, they don't have a chance if they don't leave at full speed!</t1685> <t1686>But, how on earth did they get into that?</t1686>
<t1687>—It's very easy.</t1687> <t1688>Miss Hooker was visiting there in the town...</t1688>
<t1689>—Yes, at Booth's landing... go on.</t1689>
<t1690>—She was there visiting Booth's landing and right in the middle of the afternoon she set off with her black woman on the horse ferry to spend the night at her friend's house, Miss whatever her name is—I don't remember—and they lost the rudder and started spinning around and floated down, stern first, and got caught on the wrecked ship, and the ferry guy, the black woman, and the horses were lost, but Miss Hooker grabbed on and climbed onto the ship.</t1690> <t1691>Well, about an hour later we arrived in our goods barge and it was so dark that we didn't see the ship until we crashed into it and got stuck, but we all survived except Bill Whipple, as good as he was... I almost would have preferred it to be me, really.</t1691>
<t1692>—By God!</t1692> <t1693>That's the strangest thing I've ever heard in my life.</t1693> <t1694>And then, what did you do?</t1694>
<t1695>—Well, we shouted and made a lot of noise, but the river is so wide there that no one could hear us.</t1695> <t1696>So father said that someone had to go to the shore to get help.</t1696> <t1697>I was the only one who knew how to swim, so I came, and Miss Hooker said that if I couldn't find help sooner, I should come here to find her uncle, who would sort everything out.</t1697> <t1698>I reached the shore a mile downstream and have been walking since then, trying to get people to do something, but everyone says: "What? On a night like this and with this current? It makes no sense; go get the steam ferry."</t1698> <t1699>If you would like to go and...</t1699>
<t1700>—By God, I would like to, and darn it, I don't know if I'm going to go, but, who the devil is going to pay for it?</t1700> <t1701>Do you think your dad...?</t1701>
<t1702>—Bah, that's settled.</t1702> <t1703>Miss Hooker said that her uncle Hornback...</t1703>
<t1704>—Damn! Is that your uncle?</t1704> <t1705>Look, go to that light you see over there and turn west when you get there, and about a quarter of a mile later you'll reach the tavern; tell them to take you quickly to Jim Hornback's house and that he will pay for everything.</t1705> <t1706>And don't waste time, because he will want to have the news.</t1706> <t1707>Tell him that I will have his niece safe before he can get to town.</t1707> <t1708>Now go quickly; I'm going around the corner to wake up my engineer.</t1708>
<t1709>I went out into the light, but as soon as he turned around, I stepped back, got into the boat, bailed out the water, and then entered the calm part of the river about six hundred yards away and hid among some wooden boats, because I couldn't relax until I saw the ferry start moving.</t1709> <t1710>But, overall, I felt pretty good for having cared so much about the gang, even though many people wouldn't have.</t1710> <t1711>I wish the widow had known.</t1711> <t1712>I thought she would be proud of me for helping those scoundrels, because scoundrels and cheats are the people the widow and good folks care about the most.</t1712>
<t1713>Well, soon the shipwrecked boat appeared, all dark and lifeless, drifting along.</t1713> <t1714>A cold sweat ran through my body and I headed towards it.</t1714> <t1715>It was very sunken, and after a moment I saw that there weren't many chances that anyone was still alive on board.</t1715> <t1716>I circled it completely and shouted a bit, but no one responded; there was a sepulchral silence.</t1716> <t1717>I felt a bit sad for the crew, although not much, since I figured that if they could endure it, so could I.</t1717>
<t1718>Then the ferry appears, so I went to the middle of the river, in a long drift downstream, and when it seemed to me that I could no longer be seen, I lifted the oars to look back and saw that the ferry was circling and searching around the boat for the remains of Miss Hooker, because the captain would know that her uncle Hornback would want to see them, and then immediately the ferry gave up and headed to the shore; I got to my work and sped down the river.</t1718>
<t1719>It seemed to me that an enormous amount of time passed before I saw Jim's light, and when it finally appeared, it felt like it was a thousand miles away.</t1719> <t1720>When I arrived, the sky was starting to turn a bit gray towards the east, so we headed to an island and hid the raft, sank the boat, lay down, and fell asleep like logs.</t1720>
<t1721>Chapter 14</t1721>
<t1722>AFTERWARDS, when we got up, we looked at what the loot that the gang had stolen from the wrecked ship consisted of and found boots and blankets and clothes and all kinds of different things, a bunch of books and a spyglass and three boxes of cigars.</t1722> <t1723>Neither of us had ever been this rich in our lives.</t1723> <t1724>The cigars were top-notch.</t1724> <t1725>We spent the whole early afternoon in the woods, chatting, and I reading the books and generally having a good time.</t1725> <t1726>I told Jim everything that had happened on the ship and on the ferry and he said those things were adventures, but he didn't want any more.</t1726> <t1727>He said that when I got onto the upper deck and he crawled back to the raft and saw that it had disappeared, he almost died, because he thought that whatever happened, it was all over for him, because if he didn't save himself, he would drown, and if he did save himself, whoever saw him would take him back home to collect the reward and then Miss Watson would surely sell him in the South.</t1727> <t1728>Well, he was right; he was almost always right; he had the most reasonable head for a black man.</t1728>
<t1729>I read to Jim many things about kings and dukes and counts and all that, and how well they dressed and how elegant they looked and how they called each other "your majesty," "your lordship," "your excellency," and all that, instead of "mister," and Jim's eyes were wide open and he was very interested.</t1729> <t1730>He goes and says:</t1730>
<t1731>—I didn't know there were so many.</t1731> <t1732>I had almost never heard of them, except for that old one of King Solomon, not counting the kings in the deck of cards.</t1732> <t1733>How much does a king earn?</t1733>
<t1734>—Get paid? —I say—; well, at least a thousand dollars a month if they want; they can take whatever they want; everything is theirs.</t1734>
<t1735>—Great, isn't it?</t1735> <t1736>And what do they have to do, Huck?</t1736>
<t1737>—They do nothing!</t1737> <t1738>What things you say!</t1738> <t1739>They are there and nothing more.</t1739>
<t1740>—No; really?</t1740>
<t1741>—Well, of course.</t1741> <t1742>They do nothing but stay there, except maybe when there's a war; then they go to war, or if not, they go hunting.</t1742> <t1743>Yes, with falcons and all that... Shhh! Didn't you hear a noise?</t1743>
<t1744>We came out of the forest to look, but there was nothing except the paddling of a steamboat's wheel in the distance, rounding the point, so we went back.</t1744>
<t1745>—Yes —I said—, and other times, when things are boring, they mess with Parliament, and if they don't do things the way they want, they cut off their heads.</t1745> <t1746>But where they spend the most time is in the harem.</t1746>
<t1747>—In what?</t1747>
<t1748>—In the harem.</t1748>
<t1749>—What is the harem?</t1749>
<t1750>—Where they keep their women.</t1750> <t1751>Don't you know what a harem is?</t1751> <t1752>Solomon had one with at least a million women.</t1752>
<t1753>—Well, it's true; I... I had forgotten.</t1753> <t1754>A harem is a boarding house, I suppose.</t1754> <t1755>I'm sure there's a lot of commotion in the children's room.</t1755> <t1756>And I'm sure the women fight a lot, so there's even more commotion.</t1756> <t1757>But they say that Solomon was the wisest man who ever lived.</t1757> <t1758>I can't quite believe it, because why would such a wise guy want to live in the middle of all that racket?</t1758> <t1759>No... definitely not.</t1759> <t1760>A wise man would have a boiler factory built and then he could shut everything down whenever he wanted to rest.</t1760>
<t1761>—Well, but in any case he was the wisest man in the world, because the widow told me so, no less.</t1761>
<t1762>—I don't care what the widow said; he wasn't that wise.</t1762> <t1763>He came up with some of the strangest ideas I've ever heard in my life.</t1763> <t1764>Do you know about the child he wanted to split in two?</t1764>
<t1765>—Yes, the widow told me.</t1765>
<t1766>—Well then!</t1766> <t1767>Don't you think it's the most idiotic idea in the world?</t1767> <t1768>You just need to think about it for half a minute.</t1768> <t1769>That log over there, that's one of the women; that's you, the other log; I am Solomon, and that one-dollar bill is the child.</t1769> <t1770>Both of you want it.</t1770> <t1771>What do I do?</t1771> <t1772>Do I go around the neighbors to see whose bill it is and give it to the rightful owner, as is normal, as anyone with the slightest sense would do?</t1772> <t1773>No; I go and tear the bill in two and give you one half and the other half to the woman.</t1773> <t1774>That's what Solomon was going to do with the child.</t1774> <t1775>And what I'm telling you: What's the use of half a bill to anyone?</t1775> <t1776>You can't buy anything with that.</t1776> <t1777>What's the use of half a child?</t1777> <t1778>I wouldn't give anything for a million half children.</t1778>
<t1779>—But, damn it, Jim, you don't understand anything...</t1779> <t1780>Damn it, you just don't get it.</t1780>
<t1781>—Who? Me? Come on.</t1781> <t1782>Don't come telling me that I don't understand it.</t1782> <t1783>I think I understand what common sense is and what it isn't.</t1783> <t1784>And doing something like that doesn't make sense.</t1784> <t1785>The fight wasn't over half a child; the fight was over a whole child, and the man who thinks he can solve a fight over a whole child with half a child doesn't know what life is.</t1785> <t1786>Don't talk to me about that Solomon, Huck.</t1786> <t1787>I've seen plenty like him.</t1787>
<t1788>—But I tell you that you don't understand it.</t1788>
<t1789>—There you go again with "I don't understand it!"</t1789> <t1790>I understand what I understand.</t1790> <t1791>And, get this, what you really need to understand is more complicated; much more complicated.</t1791> <t1792>It's how Salamón was raised.</t1792> <t1793>Think about it: a man has only one or two children; is that man going to go around splitting them in half?</t1793> <t1794>No, no way; he can't afford to.</t1794> <t1795>He knows how to appreciate them.</t1795> <t1796>But a man who has five million children all over the house, that's different.</t1796> <t1797>To him, splitting a child in half is the same as splitting a cat in half.</t1797> <t1798>There are plenty more.</t1798> <t1799>One or two more or less children didn't matter at all to Salamón, damn him!</t1799>
<t1800>I've never seen a black man like that.</t1800> <t1801>Once he got something into his head, there was no way to get it out.</t1801> <t1802>I've never seen a black man who had such a grudge against Solomon.</t1802> <t1803>So I started talking about other kings and left that one alone.</t1803> <t1804>I told him about Louis XVI, who was beheaded in France a long time ago, and about his young son, the dauphin, who would have been king, but they took him away and put him in prison, and some say he died there.</t1804>
<t1805>—Poor thing.</t1805>
<t1806>—But others say that he escaped and came to America.</t1806>
<t1807>—That's good!</t1807> <t1808>But he will feel very lonely...</t1808> <t1809>There are no kings here, right, Huck?</t1809>
<t1810>—No.</t1810>
<t1811>—Then he can't get a job.</t1811> <t1812>What is he going to do?</t1812>
<t1813>—Well, I don't know.</t1813> <t1814>Some become police officers and others teach people to speak French.</t1814>
<t1815>—But, Huck, don't the French speak like us?</t1815>
<t1816>—No, Jim; you wouldn't understand a single word of what they're saying... not a single word.</t1816>
<t1817>—Well, hang me! Why?</t1817>
<t1818>—I don't know, but it's true.</t1818> <t1819>I've seen some of the things they say in a book.</t1819> <t1820>Imagine a man comes up to you and says "parlé vu fransé"; what would you think?</t1820>
<t1821>—I wouldn't think anything; I would break his face; well, if he wasn't white.</t1821> <t1822>I wouldn't let a black person call me that.</t1822>
<t1823>—Damn, I wouldn't be calling you anything.</t1823> <t1824>I would just be asking if you know how to speak French.</t1824>
<t1825>—Well, then, why don't you say it?</t1825>
<t1826>—But that's what he's saying.</t1826> <t1827>That's how the French say it.</t1827>
<t1828>—Well, it's a ridiculous way of saying it and I don't want to keep talking about it.</t1828> <t1829>It doesn't make sense.</t1829>
<t1830>—Look, Jim; do cats speak the same way we do?</t1830>
<t1831>—No, not the cats.</t1831>
<t1832>—Well, what about the cows?</t1832>
<t1833>—No, not the cows either.</t1833>
<t1834>—Do cats speak the same as cows or do cows speak the same as cats?</t1834>
<t1835>—No.</t1835>
<t1836>—The natural and normal thing is that they speak differently, right?</t1836>
<t1837>—Of course.</t1837>
<t1838>—And isn't it natural and normal that cats and cows speak differently from us?</t1838>
<t1839>—Man, of course.</t1839>
<t1840>—Well, then, why isn't it natural and normal for a French person to speak differently from us?</t1840> <t1841>Answer me that.</t1841>
<t1842>—Huck, are cats the same as men?</t1842>
<t1843>—No.</t1843>
<t1844>—Well, then, it doesn't make sense for cats to talk the same way as men.</t1844> <t1845>Are cows the same as men? Or are cows the same as cats?</t1845>
<t1846>—No, neither of the two things.</t1846>
<t1847>—Well, then they don't have to talk like men or cats.</t1847> <t1848>Are the French men?</t1848>
<t1849>—Yes.</t1849>
<t1850>—Well then!</t1850> <t1851>Damn it, why don't they speak the same as men?</t1851> <t1852>You answer me that one.</t1852>
<t1853>I saw that it made no sense to keep wasting my breath: you can't teach black people to argue.</t1853> <t1854>So I gave up.</t1854>
<t1855>Chapter 15</t1855>
<t1856>WE CALCULATED THAT in three nights we would arrive in Cairo, at the end of Illinois, where the waters of the Ohio River meet, and that was what we were looking for.</t1856> <t1857>We would sell the raft and take a steamboat up the Ohio to the free states, and there we would no longer have any problems.</t1857>
<t1858>Well, around the second night, the fog started to come down, and we went to look for a sandbar to moor because it was useless to go on with the fog; but when I went ahead with the canoe, rowing with the rope to tie up, there were only some small logs.</t1858> <t1859>I threw the rope to one of them, right next to the edge of the shore, but the current was so strong there that the raft was moving so fast it uprooted it and kept going.</t1859> <t1860>I saw the fog getting denser and felt so bad and scared that I couldn't move for almost half a minute, or so it seemed to me, and then the raft was no longer visible; you couldn't see beyond twenty yards.</t1860> <t1861>I jumped into the canoe and ran to the stern, grabbed the paddle, and gave a stroke, but it didn't move.</t1861> <t1862>I was in such a hurry that I hadn't untied it.</t1862> <t1863>I stood up and tried to untie it, but I was so nervous that my hands were trembling so much I could hardly do anything with them.</t1863>
<t1864>As soon as I managed to get going, I started chasing the raft at full speed, directly towards the sandbar.</t1864> <t1865>That was well thought out, but the bar wouldn't measure even sixty yards long, and as soon as I left it behind, I got into the middle of that white and dense fog without having the slightest idea of where I was going.</t1865>
<t1866>I thought it wasn't worth rowing; I knew that at the first sign of trouble I would run aground on the shore or on a sandbar or something like that; I stayed still letting the canoe drift, but one gets very nervous when they have nothing to do with their hands in a moment like that.</t1866> <t1867>I shouted and listened.</t1867> <t1868>In the distance, I don't know where, I heard another muffled shout and I felt somewhat encouraged.</t1868> <t1869>I went there at full speed, listening carefully in case I heard it again.</t1869> <t1870>The next time I heard it, I saw that I wasn't heading towards it, but to its right, and the next time to its left, and I wasn't making much progress either, because I was going around in circles, while that voice was going straight down the whole time.</t1870>
<t1871>What I wanted was for the very fool to think of starting to bang repeatedly on a pan, but he didn't think of it, or maybe he did, and what worried me were the silences between the screams.</t1871> <t1872>Well, I kept going and immediately heard the scream behind me.</t1872> <t1873>Now I was really confused.</t1873> <t1874>Either there was another person screaming or I had turned all the way around.</t1874>
<t1875>I put down the oar.</t1875> <t1876>I heard the shout again; it was still behind me, but in a different place; it sounded over and over and always changed location, and I kept responding, until finally it was ahead of me again, and I realized that the current had turned the canoe around as it moved downstream and that I was going the right way if it was Jim and not another raftsman shouting.</t1876> <t1877>I couldn't understand any of the voices in the fog, because in a fog nothing seems or sounds natural.</t1877>
<t1878>The screams continued and after a minute or so I found myself rushing down at full speed in front of a steep bank filled with blurry ghosts of large trees, and the current threw me to the left and kept going, dragging a bunch of logs that thundered down, due to the speed at which the current broke them.</t1878> <t1879>After one or two seconds, nothing could be seen but a white mass, and everything had fallen silent.</t1879> <t1880>Then I sat still, completely motionless, listening to the beats of my heart, and I think I didn't breathe even once in a hundred beats.</t1880>
<t1881>Then I gave up.</t1881> <t1882>I knew what was happening.</t1882> <t1883>That steep shore was an island, and Jim had crossed to the other side of it.</t1883> <t1884>It wasn't like a sandbar that you could cross in ten minutes.</t1884> <t1885>It had big trees like a normal island; it could be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide.</t1885>
<t1886>I remained silent, with my ear attentive, for about fifteen minutes, I estimate.</t1886> <t1887>Naturally, I kept floating downstream at four or five miles per hour, but one never thinks about that.</t1887> <t1888>No, one believes they are completely still in the water, and if some sticks pass by, one doesn't think about how fast they are going, but rather takes a breath and says: "Wow! How fast those sticks are going."</t1888> <t1889>If anyone thinks that being alone at night in the middle of such a fog is not one of the saddest and most terrible things, let them try it just once and they will find out.</t1889>
<t1890>Afterward, for about half an hour or so, I kept shouting from time to time, until I finally heard a response far away, and I tried to follow it, but I couldn't, and immediately I thought I had gotten myself into the middle of a labyrinth of sandbars, because I saw them blurry on both sides: sometimes with only a narrow channel in the middle, and other times I couldn't see them but knew they were there because I heard the current crashing against old dry logs and debris on the banks.</t1890> <t1891>Well, it didn't take long before I stopped hearing the shouts among the sandbars and only tried to follow them for a little while, in any case, because it was worse than chasing a will-o'-the-wisp.</t1891> <t1892>In my life, I had never heard a noise so difficult to follow nor that changed places so many times and so quickly.</t1892>
<t1893>Four or five times I had to push myself away from the shore to avoid bumping into it, so I figured that the raft must be hitting the shore from time to time, because otherwise, it would keep moving and you wouldn't be able to hear it anymore; it was floating a bit faster than I was.</t1893>
<t1894>Well, after a while it seemed like I was in open river again, but there wasn't a sound anywhere.</t1894> <t1895>I figured that maybe Jim had gotten caught on a log and that it was all over for him.</t1895> <t1896>I was extremely tired, so I lay down at the bottom of the canoe and said I wasn't going to bother anymore.</t1896> <t1897>Of course, I didn't want to fall asleep, but I was so sleepy that I couldn't help it, so I thought I would just take a little nap.</t1897>
<t1898>But I figure it was more than a nap, because when I woke up the stars were shining brightly, the fog had disappeared, and I was drifting backward down a large bend of the river.</t1898> <t1899>At first, I didn't know where I was.</t1899> <t1900>I thought I was dreaming, and when I started to remember things, it seemed like everything had happened a week ago.</t1900>
<t1901>There the river was monstrously large, with very tall and tightly packed trees on both banks; like a solid wall, as far as one could see by the light of the stars.</t1901> <t1902>I looked downstream and saw a black spot in the water.</t1902> <t1903>I went towards it, but when I got there it was nothing more than a couple of tied logs.</t1903> <t1904>Then I saw another spot and chased it; then another, and that time I was right: it was the raft.</t1904>
<t1905>When I arrived, Jim was sitting with his head between his knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering oar.</t1905> <t1906>The oar had broken and the raft was full of leaves, branches, and dirt.</t1906> <t1907>So he had had a hard time.</t1907>
<t1908>I moored and lay down on the raft right next to Jim, and I started yawning and stretching my arms beside him, and I go and say:</t1908>
<t1909>—Hello, Jim, did I fall asleep? Why didn't you wake me up?</t1909>
<t1910>—My holy God, is it you, Huck?</t1910> <t1911>And you haven't died, you haven't drowned, have you come back?</t1911> <t1912>It's too beautiful to be true, my boy, it's too beautiful to be true.</t1912> <t1913>Let me look at you, boy, let me touch you.</t1913> <t1914>No, no, you haven't died!</t1914> <t1915>You have come back again, safe and sound, the same Huck as always... the same Huck as always, thank God!</t1915>
<t1916>—What’s wrong, Jim? Have you been drinking?</t1916>
<t1917>—Drunk? Have I been drinking?</t1917> <t1918>Have I had even a moment to drink?</t1918>
<t1919>—Well, then, why do you say such strange things?</t1919>
<t1920>—What strange things do I say?</t1920>
<t1921>—Which ones?</t1921> <t1922>But you keep talking about how I've come back and all that, as if I had left...</t1922>
<t1923>—Huck... Huck Finn, look me in the eyes, look me in the eyes.</t1923> <t1924>Haven't you left?</t1924>
<t1925>—Me? Gone?</t1925> <t1926>But, what the devil are you talking about?</t1926> <t1927>I haven't gone anywhere, where would I go?</t1927>
<t1928>—Well, look, boss, something's going on here.</t1928> <t1929>Am I me, or who am I?</t1929> <t1930>Am I here, or who is the one that is here?</t1930> <t1931>That's what I want to know.</t1931>
<t1932>—Well, I think you're here, no doubt, but I think you're an old crackpot.</t1932>
<t1933>—Ah, so you did?</t1933> <t1934>Well, answer me this: didn't you take the end of the canoe to tie it to the sandbar?</t1934> <t1935>—No.</t1935> <t1936>What sandbar?</t1936> <t1937>I haven't seen any sandbar.</t1937>
<t1938>—Haven't you seen any sandbars?</t1938> <t1939>Look, didn't the raft's cable come loose and go buzzing down the river, leaving you in the canoe behind, in the fog?</t1939>
<t1940>—What fog?</t1940>
<t1941>—Well, the fog!</t1941> <t1942>The fog we've had all night.</t1942> <t1943>And weren't you shouting and I was too, until we stumbled upon one of the islands and one of us got lost and the other as if he were lost, because he didn't know where he was?</t1943> <t1944>And wasn't I looking through a bunch of those islands and had a terrible time and almost drowned?</t1944> <t1945>Tell me it's not true, boss, isn't it?</t1945> <t1946>Answer me that.</t1946>
<t1947>—Well, this is too much for me, Jim.</t1947> <t1948>I haven't seen any fog, nor any island, nor had any problem, nor anything.</t1948> <t1949>I've been sitting talking with you all night until you fell asleep about ten minutes ago and I think I did too.</t1949> <t1950>In that time you couldn't have gotten drunk, so what happened is that you were dreaming.</t1950>
<t1951>—Damn it, how am I going to dream all that in ten minutes?</t1951> <t1952>—Well, we're in trouble, but you did dream it, because none of that happened.</t1952>
<t1953>—But, Huck, I see it as clearly as...</t1953>
<t1954>—It doesn't matter that you see it clearly; that's not what happened.</t1954> <t1955>I know because I've been here the whole time.</t1955>
<t1956>Jim didn't say anything for about five minutes, but just sat there thinking about it.</t1956> <t1957>Then he goes and says: —Well, then, I reckon I dreamed it, Huck; but hang me if it wasn't the most real dream I've ever seen in my life.</t1957> <t1958>And I've never had a dream that left me as tired as this one.</t1958>
<t1959>—Well, it's normal, because sometimes dreams tire you out like the devil.</t1959> <t1960>But this has been a scary dream; tell me the whole thing, Jim.</t1960>
<t1961>So Jim set to the task and told me everything from beginning to end, just as it had happened, only he embellished it a lot.</t1961> <t1962>Then he said he had to "interpret it," because it was a warning.</t1962> <t1963>He said that the first sandbar represented a man who would try to do us some good, but the current was another man who wanted to keep us away from him.</t1963> <t1964>The shouts were warnings that would come to us from time to time, and if we didn't try with all our might to understand them, then they would bring us bad luck instead of keeping us away from it.</t1964> <t1965>The maze of sandbars was for problems we were going to have with ill-tempered people and all kinds of bad people, but if we minded our own business and didn't respond to them or make them angry, then we would get through and free ourselves from the fog and enter the big, clear river, which were the free states, and we would no longer have any problems.</t1965>
<t1966>After my return to the raft, it had gotten very dark, but now it was getting light again.</t1966>
<t1967>—Well, now everything is interpreted until the end, Jim —I say—, but what do those things represent?</t1967>
<t1968>They were the leaves and the remnants that were on the raft and the broken oar.</t1968> <t1969>Now they could be seen perfectly.</t1969>
<t1970>Jim looked at that trash and then looked at me and then back at the trash again.</t1970> <t1971>He was already so convinced that it had been a dream that he couldn't seem to free himself from it and put things back in their place.</t1971> <t1972>But when he finally understood what reality was, he looked at me very intently without smiling at all and said:</t1972>
<t1973>—What do they represent?</t1973> <t1974>I'm going to tell you.</t1974> <t1975>When I got exhausted from working so much and calling out to you and I fell asleep, my heart almost broke because you were lost and I no longer cared what happened to me on the raft.</t1975> <t1976>And when I woke up and saw you again, safe and sound, tears came to my eyes and I could have gotten on my knees and kissed your feet, I felt so grateful.</t1976> <t1977>And all you could think of was how to make old Jim look ridiculous with a lie.</t1977> <t1978>What you see there is trash, and trash is what people are who put stupid ideas in their friends' heads and make them feel ashamed.</t1978>
<t1979>Then he got up very slowly and went towards the wigwam and entered it without saying more.</t1979> <t1980>But that was enough.</t1980> <t1981>It made me feel so mean that I almost could have kissed his feet to make him change his mind.</t1981>
<t1982>It took me fifteen minutes to decide to humble myself before a black man, but I did it and I never regretted it afterwards.</t1982> <t1983>I kept playing tricks on him, and I wouldn't have played that one if I had known he would feel that way.</t1983>
<t1984>Chapter 16</t1984>
<t1985>WE SPENT ALMOST the entire day sleeping and set off at night, a little behind a monstrously long raft that took as long to pass as a procession.</t1985> <t1986>It had four long oars at each end, so we thought that probably no fewer than thirty men would travel on it.</t1986> <t1987>It had five large wigwams on board and an open fire in the center, with a large flagpole at each end.</t1987> <t1988>It was very elegant.</t1988> <t1989>Being a rafter on such a vessel meant something.</t1989>
<t1990>We drifted down a large curve, the night became cloudy and it started to get very hot.</t1990> <t1991>The river was very wide and was surrounded by very dense forests on both sides; there was not a clearing or even a light to be seen in them.</t1991> <t1992>We talked about Cairo and wondered if we would recognize it when we arrived.</t1992> <t1993>I said no, because I had heard that there were only about a dozen houses, and if they didn't have lights, how would we know we were passing by a town?</t1993> <t1994>Jim said that if the two great rivers met there, that would indicate it to us.</t1994> <t1995>But I replied that we might think we were passing by the end of an island and returning to the same river as always.</t1995> <t1996>That worried Jim, and me too.</t1996> <t1997>So the question was, what to do?</t1997> <t1998>I said to row, row to the shore as soon as we saw the first light and tell them that father was coming behind in a merchant skiff, and that he was a novice at these things and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo.</t1998> <t1999>Jim thought it was a good idea, so we started smoking to celebrate it and set about waiting.</t1999>
<t2000>Now there was nothing left to do but be very attentive to the town and not pass by without seeing it.</t2000> <t2001>Jim said he was absolutely sure he would see it, because as soon as he saw it, he would be a free man, but if he didn't see it, it meant he was back in the zone of slavery and would never reach freedom.</t2001> <t2002>At every moment he would jump to his feet and shout:</t2002>
<t2003>—There it is!</t2003>
<t2004>But he wasn't there.</t2004> <t2005>They were will-o'-the-wisps or fireflies, so he sat back down and watched just like before.</t2005> <t2006>Jim said that being so close to freedom made him tremble and feel feverish.</t2006> <t2007>Well, I can say that listening to him made me tremble and feel feverish too, because I was starting to realize that I was almost free, and who was to blame?</t2007> <t2008>Well, me.</t2008> <t2009>I couldn't get it off my conscience, no matter what I did.</t2009> <t2010>It worried me so much that I couldn't rest; I couldn't stay calm in one place.</t2010> <t2011>Until then, I had never realized what I was doing.</t2011> <t2012>But now I did, and I couldn't stop thinking about it and it irritated me more and more.</t2012> <t2013>I tried to convince myself that it wasn't my fault because I wasn't the one who made Jim escape from his rightful owner, but it was no use, because my conscience kept coming back and saying every time: "But you knew he was running away in search of freedom and you could have rowed to the shore and told someone."</t2013> <t2014>It was true: there was no way to deny it.</t2014> <t2015>That's where it hurt.</t2015> <t2016>My conscience said to me: "What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you saw her negro escape right in front of you and didn't say a single word?</t2016> <t2017>What had that poor old woman done to you to treat her so badly?</t2017> <t2018>Well, she had tried to get you to learn your book, she had tried to teach you manners, she had tried to make you good by all the means she knew.</t2018> <t2019>That's what she had done."</t2019>
<t2020>I felt so bad and so miserable that I almost wished I had died.</t2020> <t2021>I paced up and down the raft, cursing myself inwardly, and Jim paced up and down in front of me.</t2021> <t2022>Neither of us could stay still.</t2022> <t2023>Every time he jumped and said, "That's Cairo!" it was like getting shot, and I thought that if it was Cairo, I was going to die of horror.</t2023>
<t2024>Jim spoke out loud all the time while I spoke alone.</t2024> <t2025>According to him, the first thing he would do when he reached a free state would be to save money and not spend a cent, and when he had enough, he would buy his wife, who was a slave on a farm near where Miss Watson lived, and then they would both work to buy their two children, and if the owner of the children didn't want to sell them, they would get an abolitionist to steal them.</t2025>
<t2026>Hearing those things almost froze my blood.</t2026> <t2027>Before, he would never have dared to say all that.</t2027> <t2028>That's how he had changed as soon as he thought he was almost free.</t2028> <t2029>It's like the saying goes: "Give an inch and they'll take a mile."</t2029> <t2030>I thought: "This is what happens to me for not thinking."</t2030> <t2031>There he was, that black man, whom I had practically helped to escape, saying with a straight face that he was going to steal children: children who belonged to a man I didn't even know; a man who had never done me any harm.</t2031>
<t2032>I regretted hearing that from him, because he was lowering himself.</t2032> <t2033>My conscience started to hurt more than ever until I finally said to him: "Leave me alone... it's not too late yet; as soon as day breaks, I'll go ashore and tell."</t2033> <t2034>Immediately, I felt calm and happy and light as a feather.</t2034> <t2035>All my problems had disappeared.</t2035> <t2036>I looked again very carefully to see if there was a light, humming to myself.</t2036> <t2037>After a while, one appeared.</t2037> <t2038>Jim shouted:</t2038>
<t2039>—We are safe, Huck, we are safe!</t2039> <t2040>Get up and jump for joy!</t2040> <t2041>At last, it's Cairo, I'm sure!</t2041>
<t2042>And I go and say:</t2042>
<t2043>—Well, I'm going to go check with the canoe.</t2043> <t2044>You know, maybe it isn't.</t2044>
<t2045>With a leap, he prepared the canoe and placed his old cloak at the bottom for me to sit on, handed me the paddle, and as I left, he said to me:</t2045>
<t2046>—Soon I will be shouting with joy and I will say that it is all thanks to Huck; I am a free man and I never could have been if it hadn't been for Huck; it was Huck.</t2046> <t2047>Jim will never forget it, Huck; you are the best friend Jim has ever had in his life and you are the only friend old Jim has now.</t2047>
<t2048>I was rowing as fast as I could to betray him; but when he said that, it seemed to take all my strength away.</t2048> <t2049>I started to go slower and wasn't very sure I felt so happy about having set out.</t2049> <t2050>When I was five hundred yards away, Jim goes and says:</t2050>
<t2051>—There goes my faithful Huck; the only white gentleman who has kept his promises to old Jim.</t2051>
<t2052>Well, I almost got sick.</t2052> <t2053>But I told myself: "I have to do it; I can't stop doing it."</t2053> <t2054>Just then a boat appeared with two men carrying shotguns, and they stopped, and so did I.</t2054> <t2055>One of them goes and says:</t2055>
<t2056>—What is that over there?</t2056>
<t2057>—Well, a raft —I replied.</t2057>
<t2058>—Are you going on it?</t2058>
<t2059>—Yes, sir.</t2059>
<t2060>—And are there men in it?</t2060>
<t2061>—Only one, sir.</t2061>
<t2062>—Well, there are five black men who escaped tonight from up there, where the curve is.</t2062> <t2063>Your man, is he white or black?</t2063>
<t2064>I did not respond immediately.</t2064> <t2065>I tried, but the words wouldn't come out.</t2065> <t2066>I struggled for a second or two to muster the strength and say it, but I wasn't man enough: I was more cowardly than a rabbit.</t2066> <t2067>I saw that I didn't have the strength, so I stopped trying, and I go and say:</t2067>
<t2068>—It's white.</t2068>
<t2069>—I think we are going to see it ourselves.</t2069>
<t2070>—I hope so —I said—, because it's my father who is there and maybe you can help me tow the raft to the shore where that light is.</t2070> <t2071>He's sick, and the same goes for mother and Mary Ann.</t2071>
<t2072>—What the hell!</t2072> <t2073>We're in a hurry, kid.</t2073> <t2074>But I suppose it's our duty.</t2074> <t2075>Come on, grab the oar and let's go.</t2075> <t2076>I grabbed the paddle and they grabbed their oars.</t2076> <t2077>After a couple of strokes, I said to them:</t2077>
<t2078>—Father will be very grateful to you, that's for sure.</t2078> <t2079>When I ask someone to help me tow the raft to shore, everyone leaves and I can't do it alone.</t2079>
<t2080>—Well, what a bunch of mean people; but, how strange.</t2080> <t2081>Hey, kid, what's wrong with your father?</t2081>
<t2082>—It... uh... well, it's nothing serious.</t2082>
<t2083>They stopped rowing.</t2083> <t2084>We were already very close to the raft.</t2084> <t2085>One goes and says:</t2085>
<t2086>—Kid, you're lying.</t2086> <t2087>What's wrong with your father?</t2087> <t2088>Answer truthfully, it's in your best interest.</t2088>
<t2089>—Yes, sir, really..., but please don't abandon us.</t2089> <t2090>It's the... theee... gentlemen, if you come a little closer and let me throw you the rope, you don't have to come near the raft; please.</t2090>
<t2091>—Let's go back, John, let's go back! —said one of them.</t2091> <t2092>They retreated—.</t2092> <t2093>Don't get close, boy; stay downwind.</t2093> <t2094>Damn it, the last thing we need is for the wind to have brought it to us.</t2094> <t2095>Your father has smallpox and you know it well.</t2095> <t2096>Why didn't you say it from the start?</t2096> <t2097>Do you want everyone to get infected?</t2097>
<t2098>—Well —I replied, whining—, it's what I've told everyone before and they left and abandoned us.</t2098>
<t2099>—Poor devil, you are not wrong.</t2099> <t2100>We are very sorry for you, but... well, damn it, we don't want to catch smallpox, understand?</t2100> <t2101>Look, I'm going to tell you what you can do.</t2101> <t2102>Don't try to dock alone or you'll ruin everything.</t2102> <t2103>Keep floating downstream about twenty miles and you'll reach a town on the left side of the river.</t2103> <t2104>By then it will be fully daylight, and when you ask for help, tell them your entire family has chills and fever.</t2104> <t2105>Don't be foolish again and let people guess what's going on.</t2105> <t2106>We are trying to do you a favor, so be good and go twenty miles further.</t2106> <t2107>It wouldn't do you any good to dock where the light is: it's just a sawmill.</t2107> <t2108>Hey, I figure your father is poor and certainly having bad luck.</t2108> <t2109>Look, I'm going to put a twenty-dollar gold coin on this board and when it floats to you, pick it up.</t2109> <t2110>It's not that I like leaving you, but what the hell!, you don't mess around with smallpox, understand?</t2110>
<t2111>—Wait, Parker —said the other—, take another twenty to put on the board as well.</t2111> <t2112>Goodbye, kid; do what Mr. Parker told you and everything will surely go well for you.</t2112>
<t2113>—Exactly, boy; goodbye, goodbye.</t2113> <t2114>If you see runaway slaves, find someone to help you catch them and you'll make some money.</t2114>
<t2115>—Goodbye, sir —I replied—; I will not let any runaway slave escape if I can help it.</t2115>
<t2116>They left, and I got back on the raft, feeling bad and traitorous, because I knew very well that I had done wrong, and I saw that it was useless to try to learn to do things right; when someone doesn't start off well when they are young, there's nothing to be done: when the time comes, they have nothing to lean on and support them, so they always lose.</t2116> <t2117>Then I thought about it for a minute and said to myself: "Wait a minute; suppose you had done right and turned Jim in, would you feel better than now? No," I said to myself, "I would feel bad, I would feel just as I do now.</t2117> <t2118>Well, then," I said to myself, "what's the use of learning to do things right when you have problems if you do them right and no problems if you do them wrong and the result is always the same?" I was trapped.</t2118> <t2119>I couldn't answer that.</t2119> <t2120>So I thought I wouldn't worry about it anymore, and from then on, I always do what seems best to me at the moment.</t2120>
<t2121>I entered the wigwam; Jim was not there.</t2121> <t2122>I looked around and did not see him anywhere.</t2122> <t2123>I shouted:</t2123>
<t2124>—Jim!</t2124>
<t2125>—Here I am, Huck.</t2125> <t2126>Can you still see them?</t2126> <t2127>Don't speak loudly.</t2127>
<t2128>He was in the water, under the bow oar, with only his nose out.</t2128> <t2129>I told him that they couldn't be seen anymore, so he climbed aboard.</t2129> <t2130>He told me:</t2130>
<t2131>—I was listening to that conversation and I got into the water and was going to go to the shore if they came up.</t2131> <t2132>Then I was going to return to the raft when they had left.</t2132> <t2133>But, sir, how you fooled them, Huck!</t2133> <t2134>You were so clever!</t2134> <t2135>I tell you, boy, I'm sure you've saved old Jim...</t2135> <t2136>Old Jim will never forget it, my boy.</t2136>
<t2137>Then we talked about the money.</t2137> <t2138>It wasn't bad at all: twenty dollars each.</t2138> <t2139>Jim said that now we could take deck passage on a steamboat and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free states.</t2139> <t2140>He said that twenty more miles wasn't much distance for the raft, but he wished we had already arrived.</t2140>
<t2141>Towards dawn, we moored and Jim acted very carefully to hide the raft well.</t2141> <t2142>Afterwards, he worked all day organizing things into packages and preparing everything to move forward without the raft.</t2142>
<t2143>That night, around ten, we came within sight of the lights of a village on a curve to the left side.</t2143>
<t2144>I went in the canoe to ask.</t2144> <t2145>Immediately, I met a man who had gone out to the river with a boat and was preparing some fishing lines.</t2145> <t2146>I approached him and asked:</t2146>
<t2147>—Sir, is that town Cairo?</t2147>
<t2148>—Cairo? No.</t2148> <t2149>You must be a complete idiot.</t2149>
<t2150>—What is the name of that town, sir?</t2150>
<t2151>—If you want to find out, go ask about it.</t2151> <t2152>If you stay here bothering me for half a minute more, you're going to get a slap.</t2152>
<t2153>I rowed back to the raft.</t2153> <t2154>Jim felt very disappointed, but I told him it didn't matter, that according to my calculations, Cairo would be the next town.</t2154>
<t2155>We passed another town before dawn, and I was going to ask again, but it was very high, so I didn't go out.</t2155> <t2156>"Cairo is not high," said Jim.</t2156> <t2157>I had forgotten.</t2157> <t2158>We stayed the whole day on a grassy islet quite close to the left shore.</t2158> <t2159>I began to suspect something.</t2159> <t2160>Jim did too.</t2160> <t2161>I said:</t2161>
<t2162>—Maybe we passed by Cairo that foggy night.</t2162>
<t2163>And he replied:</t2163>
<t2164>—Let's not talk about that, Huck.</t2164> <t2165>We poor Black folks never have luck.</t2165> <t2166>I've always suspected that rattlesnake skin hadn't finished its work.</t2166>
<t2167>—I wish I had never seen that snake skin, Jim... I wish I had never laid eyes on it.</t2167>
<t2168>—It's not your fault, Huck; you didn't know.</t2168> <t2169>Don't blame yourself for that.</t2169>
<t2170>When dawn broke, we saw the clear water of the Ohio next to the shore, without a doubt, and beside it came the great river as always.</t2170> <t2171>So nothing to do with Cairo.</t2171>
<t2172>We talked about the matter.</t2172> <t2173>It was pointless to go ashore; naturally, we couldn't take the raft upstream.</t2173> <t2174>There was nothing to do but wait until nightfall, return with the canoe, and see if we got lucky.</t2174> <t2175>So we spent the day sleeping among the cottonwoods, to be rested for the work, and when we returned to the raft at dusk, the canoe had disappeared.</t2175>
<t2176>We didn't say a word for a good while.</t2176> <t2177>There was nothing to say.</t2177> <t2178>We both knew perfectly well that it was once again about the rattlesnake skin, so what was the point of talking about it?</t2178> <t2179>That would just be like looking for something to blame, and it would undoubtedly bring us even more bad luck, and it would keep bringing it until we understood that the best thing was not to talk about it.</t2179>
<t2180>After a while, we talked about what we would have to do and saw that there was no other choice but to continue with the raft until we could buy a canoe to retrace our steps in it.</t2180> <t2181>We were not going to borrow it when no one was around, as father would do, because then someone might chase us.</t2181>
<t2182>So after it got dark, we went out on the raft.</t2182>
<t2183>And anyone who still doesn't believe that it's foolish to handle snake skins after everything that snake skin did to us will believe it now if they keep reading and see what it continued to do to us.</t2183>
<t2184>The place to buy canoes is where there are rafts docked on the riverbank.</t2184> <t2185>But we didn't see any docked rafts, so we continued on for three hours or more.</t2185> <t2186>Well, the night turned gray and the air became very dense, which is the worst thing that can happen after fog.</t2186> <t2187>You can't see the shape of the river or gauge the distance.</t2187> <t2188>It got very late in the midst of the silence, and then, suddenly, a steamboat appeared upstream.</t2188> <t2189>We lit the lantern and thought it would see us.</t2189> <t2190>The boats going upstream generally didn't come close to us; they were looking for sandbars in search of easy water under the reefs; but on nights like this, they go up the middle of the channel facing the entire river.</t2190>
<t2191>We could hear its engine, but we didn't see it clearly until it got closer.</t2191> <t2192>It was coming straight towards us.</t2192> <t2193>Many times they do that and try to see how close they can get without touching you; sometimes the wheel rips off a plank, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, thinking he's very clever.</t2193> <t2194>Well, here it comes, and we decided it was going to try to shave us, but it didn't seem to veer off even a little.</t2194> <t2195>It was big and coming at full speed, like a black cloud with rows of fireflies on the sides; but suddenly it came fully into view, enormous and frightening, with a long row of open furnace doors glowing like red-hot teeth and with monstrous sides and railings right above us.</t2195> <t2196>Someone shouted at us, and there was a sound of bells to stop the engines, a bunch of curses and the hiss of steam, and just as Jim jumped to one side and I to the other, it crashed into the raft and smashed it to pieces.</t2196>
<t2197>I jumped and aimed to reach the bottom, because a thirty-foot wheel was going to pass over me and I wanted to have plenty of room.</t2197> <t2198>I have always been able to hold my breath underwater for a minute; I think that time I held it for a minute and a half.</t2198> <t2199>Then I quickly surfaced, because I was about to burst.</t2199> <t2200>I stuck my head out quite a bit and blew the water out of my nose, panting a little.</t2200> <t2201>Naturally, there was a huge current, and naturally that ship started up again ten seconds after stopping the engines, because they never cared much about the rafters, so I kept paddling upstream, invisible in the midst of that dense air, although you could still hear the noise it made.</t2201>
<t2202>I called Jim half a dozen times, but without receiving a response; so I grabbed a plank that came my way while I was pedaling in the water and headed towards land, holding on to it tightly.</t2202> <t2203>But I managed to see that the current was carrying towards the left bank, which meant that I was in the middle of a cross current, so I changed course and followed that way.</t2203>
<t2204>It was one of those long, regular crossings of two miles; so it took me a long time to get through it.</t2204> <t2205>I made it to land safely and climbed up the shore.</t2205> <t2206>I could only see a very short distance, but I groped my way over rocky ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I stumbled upon one of those old-fashioned log houses that I had never seen before.</t2206> <t2207>I was about to run far away from there, but a pack of dogs came out and started howling and barking at me, and I realized it was better not to move.</t2207>
<t2208>Chapter 17</t2208>
<t2209>AFTER A minute someone said through the window, without sticking their head out:</t2209>
<t2210>—Enough, kids! Who's going?</t2210>
<t2211>And I replied:</t2211>
<t2212>—It's me.</t2212>
<t2213>—Who am I?</t2213>
<t2214>—George Jackson, gentleman.</t2214>
<t2215>—What do you want?</t2215>
<t2216>—I don't want anything, sir.</t2216> <t2217>I was just passing by, but the dogs won't let me.</t2217>
<t2218>—And what are you doing lurking around here at this hour of the night, huh?</t2218>
<t2219>—I wasn't lurking, sir; I fell off the steamboat.</t2219>
<t2220>—Really?</t2220> <t2221>Don't tell me!</t2221> <t2222>Can someone turn on a light, what did you say your name was?</t2222>
<t2223>—George Jackson, gentleman.</t2223> <t2224>I am a boy.</t2224>
<t2225>—Look, if you tell the truth, you have nothing to fear: no one is going to do anything to you.</t2225> <t2226>But don't try to move; stay where you are.</t2226> <t2227>Someone wake up Bob and Tom and bring the weapons.</t2227> <t2228>George Jackson, is there anyone with you?</t2228>
<t2229>—No, sir, no one.</t2229>
<t2230>Now I could hear people moving around the house and I saw a light.</t2230> <t2231>The man shouted:</t2231>
<t2232>—Move that light, Betsy, you old fool... don't you have any common sense?</t2232> <t2233>Put it on the floor behind the front door.</t2233> <t2234>Bob, if you and Tom are ready, to your positions.</t2234>
<t2235>—Ready.</t2235>
<t2236>—And now, George Jackson, do you know who the Shepherdsons are?</t2236>
<t2237>—No, sir, I have never heard of them.</t2237>
<t2238>—Well, maybe you're telling the truth and maybe you're lying.</t2238> <t2239>Now, everyone get ready.</t2239> <t2240>Take a step forward, George Jackson.</t2240> <t2241>And be careful, no rush... very slowly.</t2241> <t2242>If there's someone with you, they should stay there; if we see them, we'll shoot them.</t2242> <t2243>Now, go ahead.</t2243> <t2244>Come slowly; open the door yourself.</t2244> <t2245>... just enough to get in, do you hear me?</t2245>
<t2246>I didn't run; I couldn't even if I had wanted to.</t2246> <t2247>I took one slow step after another and there wasn't a sound, only that it seemed to me that I could hear the beating of my heart.</t2247> <t2248>The dogs were as quiet as the people, but they were on my heels.</t2248> <t2249>When I reached the three log steps, I heard them removing the bolt and the bar from the door.</t2249> <t2250>I put my hand on the door, pushed a little and then a little more until someone said: "Okay, that's enough; show us your head."</t2250> <t2251>I did it, but thinking they were going to tear it off.</t2251>
<t2252>The candle was on the floor, and there they all were, looking at me, and I at them, and we stayed like that for a quarter of a minute: three big men pointing their weapons at me, which I assure you gave me chills; the oldest was gray-haired and about sixty years old, and the other two were thirty or older (all of them very refined and very handsome) and an elderly lady with gray hair and the kindest appearance, who had behind her two young women whom I couldn't see well.</t2252> <t2253>The older gentleman said:</t2253>
<t2254>—Okay; I suppose it's fine.</t2254> <t2255>Come in.</t2255>
<t2256>As soon as I entered, the elderly gentleman closed the door and bolted and barred it, told the young men to come in with their shotguns, and everyone went to the large living room that had a new cloth carpet and gathered in a corner away from the front windows: there were none on the sides.</t2256> <t2257>They grabbed the candle, looked at me closely, and all said: "Well, he's not a Shepherdson, no; he doesn't have anything of a Shepherdson."</t2257> <t2258>Then the old man said he hoped I wouldn't mind if they searched me to see if I was carrying any weapons, because they didn't mean any harm; it was just to be sure.</t2258> <t2259>So he didn't put his hands in my pockets, but only touched my sides with his hands and assured that everything was fine.</t2259> <t2260>He told me to make myself comfortable and feel at home and to tell them about myself, but the old lady said:</t2260>
<t2261>—But, man, Saul, poor thing; he's soaked to the bone and, don't you think he might be hungry?</t2261>
<t2262>—You're right, Rachel; I forgot.</t2262>
<t2263>So the old woman says:</t2263>
<t2264>—Betsy (she was a black woman), run and bring something to eat quickly, poor thing; and one of you girls, go wake up Buck and tell him... ah, here he comes.</t2264> <t2265>Buck, take this little boy and remove his wet clothes and give him something of yours that is dry to wear.</t2265>
<t2266>Buck seemed to be about the same age as me: thirteen or fourteen years old, although he was a bit taller.</t2266> <t2267>He was only wearing a shirt, and his hair was all messy.</t2267> <t2268>He arrived yawning and rubbing his eyes with one hand, holding a shotgun in the other.</t2268> <t2269>He replied:</t2269>
<t2270>—Is there no Shepherdson around here?</t2270>
<t2271>They said no, that it was a false alarm.</t2271>
<t2272>—Well —he says—, if they had come, I surely would have taken one down.</t2272>
<t2273>Everyone burst out laughing, and Bob says:</t2273>
<t2274>—But Buck, they could have scalped all of us with how long it took you to get here.</t2274>
<t2275>—Well, it's just that no one has informed me, and that's not right.</t2275> <t2276>You never tell me anything; you don't let me do anything.</t2276> <t2277>—It doesn't matter, Buck, my son —says the old man—, you will be able to do enough in due time, don't worry about that.</t2277> <t2278>Now go do what your mother told you.</t2278>
<t2279>When we climbed the stairs to his room, he gave me a thick shirt, a jacket, and some pants, and I put everything on.</t2279> <t2280>Meanwhile, he asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him, he started to tell me that the day before yesterday he had caught a starling and a little rabbit in the forest and asked me where Moses was when the candle went out.</t2280> <t2281>I said I didn't know; I had never heard it before, really.</t2281>
<t2282>—Well, then suppose —he suggested.</t2282>
<t2283>—How am I supposed to guess —I replied— when no one has ever told me before?</t2283>
<t2284>—But you can guess, can't you?</t2284> <t2285>It's just as easy.</t2285>
<t2286>—What candle? —I asked.</t2286>
<t2287>—Well, any candle —he replied.</t2287>
<t2288>—I don't know where I was —I replied—; where was I?</t2288>
<t2289>—Man, I was in darkness!</t2289> <t2290>That's where I was!</t2290>
<t2291>—Well, if you already knew where it was, why are you asking me?</t2291>
<t2292>—But man, it's a riddle, don't you understand?</t2292> <t2293>Hey, how long are you going to stay?</t2293> <t2294>You have to stay forever.</t2294> <t2295>We can have a great time...</t2295> <t2296>There's no school now.</t2296> <t2297>Do you have a dog?</t2297> <t2298>I have a dog that knows how to go into the river to fetch the things you throw.</t2298> <t2299>Do you like that stuff about combing your hair on Sundays and all those silly things?</t2299> <t2300>I assure you I don't, but mother makes me.</t2300> <t2301>Darn pants!</t2301> <t2302>I suppose I'll have to wear them, but I'd rather not, with this heat.</t2302> <t2303>Are you ready? Okay.</t2303> <t2304>Come down with me, buddy.</t2304>
<t2305>Cold cornbread, cold salted meat, butter, and milk with plenty of cream: that's what they had prepared for me downstairs, and I've never eaten anything better in my life.</t2305> <t2306>Buck and his mother and everyone else were smoking corn cob pipes, except for the black woman, who had left, and the two young women.</t2306> <t2307>Everyone was smoking and talking, and I was eating and talking.</t2307> <t2308>The two young women were wrapped in quilts and had their hair down.</t2308> <t2309>Everyone was asking me questions, and I told them that father and I and the whole family lived on a small farm over on the other side of Arkansas and that my sister Mary Ann had run away to get married and we hadn't heard from her again, and that Bill went to look for them and we hadn't heard from him either, and that Tom and Mort had died and there was no one left but me and father, and that he had wasted away with so many troubles, so when he died I took what was left, because the farm wasn't ours, and I started up the river with deck passage and had fallen overboard and that's why I was there.</t2309> <t2310>Then they told me that I had a home there as long as I wanted.</t2310> <t2311>Then it was almost daylight and everyone went to bed and I went with Buck, and when I woke up in the morning, damn it, I had forgotten what my name was.</t2311> <t2312>So I lay there for an hour trying to think of it, and when Buck woke up I asked him:</t2312>
<t2313>—Are you good at spelling, Buck?</t2313>
<t2314>—Yes —he replied.</t2314>
<t2315>—I'm sure you don't know how to write my name —I told him.</t2315>
<t2316>—I bet you anything that it will —he replied.</t2316>
<t2317>—Okay —I said—; let's go see it.</t2317>
<t2318>—G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n, just so you know —he said.</t2318>
<t2319>—Okay —I replied—, you did know it, but I didn't believe it.</t2319> <t2320>Don't think it's an easy name to write just like that, without studying it.</t2320>
<t2321>I wrote it down secretly, because maybe someone wanted me to be the one to write it, so I wanted to do it all at once, and present it as if I were already very used to it.</t2321>
<t2322>It was a very nice family, and the house was also great.</t2322> <t2323>I had never seen such a good house with so much style.</t2323> <t2324>It didn't have an iron latch on the main door, nor a wooden one with a leather cord, but a brass knob to turn, just like the houses in the city.</t2324> <t2325>In the living room, there were no beds or signs of them, although there are plenty of living rooms in the cities where you can see beds.</t2325> <t2326>There was a very large fireplace, lined with bricks at the bottom, which they kept clean by using water and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they washed them with a red water paint called Spanish earth, just like in the city.</t2326> <t2327>They had some bronze fireplace irons with which you could grab an entire log.</t2327> <t2328>In the middle of the mantelpiece, there was a clock with a painting of a village on the bottom part of the glass cover, and a round opening in the middle for the dial, and behind it, you could see the pendulum swinging.</t2328> <t2329>It was a pleasure to hear the ticking of that clock, and sometimes when a tinker passed by and cleaned and tuned it, it would start ringing and give a hundred and fifty chimes before getting tired.</t2329> <t2330>They wouldn't have sold it for anything in the world.</t2330>
<t2331>And on each side of the clock there was a very strange parrot made as if from chalk and painted in many colors.</t2331> <t2332>Next to one of the parrots there was a porcelain cat and next to the other a porcelain dog, and when they were pressed they squeaked, but they did not open their mouths nor did they seem different or interested.</t2332> <t2333>Behind them there were two fans made of wild turkey feathers.</t2333> <t2334>On the table, in the middle of the room, there was a kind of beautiful porcelain basket that had apples, oranges, peaches, and grapes, all piled up, and much redder and yellower and prettier than real fruit, but it wasn't real because you could see where pieces had chipped off and underneath the white chalk or whatever it was.</t2334>
<t2335>That table had a beautiful oilcloth tablecloth, with a red and blue eagle and a painted border all around.</t2335> <t2336>They said it had come from Philadelphia.</t2336> <t2337>There were also some books, in very neatly arranged piles at each corner of the table.</t2337> <t2338>One of them was a large family Bible full of illustrations.</t2338> <t2339>Another was The Pilgrim's Progress, about a man who left his family, but it didn't say why.</t2339> <t2340>From time to time, I would read a bunch of pages.</t2340> <t2341>What it said was interesting, but difficult.</t2341> <t2342>Another was The Offering of Friendship, full of very beautiful things and poems, but I didn't read the poetry.</t2342> <t2343>Another was the Speeches of Henry Clay and another was Dr. Gunn's Family Medicine, which said everything to do if someone got sick or died.</t2343> <t2344>There was a hymn book and a bunch of other books.</t2344> <t2345>And there were some very beautiful cane chairs, and also very sturdy, not sunken in the middle and broken, like an old basket.</t2345>
<t2346>On the walls, they had hung pictures mostly of Washington and Lafayette and battles and Mary, Queen of Scots, and another one called The Signing of the Declaration.</t2346><t2347>There were some called pastels, made by one of the daughters, who had died when she was only fifteen years old.</t2347><t2348>They were different from all the pictures I had seen before: almost all darker than what you usually see.</t2348><t2349>One was of a woman in a tight black dress, with a belt under her armpits and bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves and a large black hat shaped like a coif, with a black veil and thin white ankles bandaged with a black ribbon and very small black slippers, like spatulas, and she was leaning thoughtfully on a cemetery slab, resting on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, with the other hand hanging down to one side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and under the picture, a sign said "I will never see you again, alas."</t2349><t2350>Another was of a young lady with her hair all styled in a pompadour and made into a bun and tied at the back with a large comb like the back of a chair, crying into a handkerchief, and in the other hand, she held a dead bird on its back with its legs up, and under the picture, it said "I will never hear your sweet trill again, alas."</t2350><t2351>There was another where a young lady was looking at the moon through a window, and tears were streaming down her cheeks, and in one hand, she held an open letter with a black wax seal on the edge, and she was bringing a locket with a chain to her mouth, and under the picture, it said "And you are gone, yes, you are gone, alas."</t2351><t2352>I guess those pictures were of great merit, but I don't know why I didn't like them, because when I was feeling a bit down, they always gave me the creeps.</t2352><t2353>Everyone was very sad because she had died, because she had many more pictures left to paint, and from the ones she had already painted, you could see what they had lost.</t2353><t2354>But I figured that with that state of mind, she would be much better off in the cemetery.</t2354><t2355>She was painting what they said was going to be her best picture when she got sick, and every day and every night she prayed to stay alive until she finished it, but she didn't get the chance.</t2355><t2356>It was a picture of a girl in a long white dress, standing on the railing of a bridge and ready to jump, with her hair loose down her back looking at the moon, her face bathed in tears, with two arms crossed over her chest, two arms extended in front, and two arms reaching towards the moon, and the idea was to see which pair of arms would look best and then erase all the others, but as I was saying, she died before deciding, and now they had that picture above the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday came, they put flowers all around it.</t2356><t2357>The rest of the time, it was covered with a curtain.</t2357><t2358>The girl in the picture had a kind and pleasant face, but to me, it seemed that so many arms gave her a bit of a spider-like look.</t2358>
<t2359>When the girl was alive, she had been making a scrapbook in which she pasted obituaries, accidents, and cases of patient suffering that had appeared in the Presbyterian Observer, along with poems that these had inspired in her and which she wrote with her own imagination.</t2359> <t2360>They were very good poems.</t2360> <t2361>This is the one she wrote about a boy named Stephen Dowling Bots, who fell into a well and drowned:</t2361>
<t2362>ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DECEASED</t2362>
<t2363>Was it Stephen and did he get sick?</t2363>
<t2364>Is that what Stephen died of?</t2364>
<t2365>Did your heart suffer?</t2365>
<t2366>Did the people become sad?</t2366>
<t2367>No; that was not the fate</t2367>
<t2368>by Stephen Dowling Bots;</t2368>
<t2369>although his sad death grieved many of us,</t2369>
<t2370>it was not the illness that took him.</t2370>
<t2371>It was not whooping cough that took him from us,</t2371>
<t2372>neither was the horrible measles to blame;</t2372>
<t2373>none of them yielded</t2373>
<t2374>a Stephen Dowling Bots.</t2374>
<t2375>Nor was it the sorrow of an unshared love</t2375>
<t2376>the one who wrinkled her forehead in anger and pain;</t2376>
<t2377>it was not the anxieties of poor digestion</t2377>
<t2378>the ones that ended Stephen Dowling Bots forever.</t2378>
<t2379>Oh, no!</t2379> <t2380>Listen attentively, as tearful as I am,</t2380>
<t2381>the horrible fate that poor man suffered.</t2381>
<t2382>How his soul abandoned the cold and sad world</t2382>
<t2383>because our boy fell into a deep well.</t2383>
<t2384>Then they proceeded to drain his lung,</t2384>
<t2385>but it was already too late, alas, for the poor heart;</t2385>
<t2386>his soul rose in three clouds of cotton</t2386>
<t2387>where the celestial Gathering is celebrated.</t2387>
<t2388>If Emmeline Grangerford was capable of writing poetry like that before she turned fourteen, God knows what she could have done with time.</t2388> <t2389>Buck said that poetry came to her with complete ease.</t2389> <t2390>She didn't even have to stop to think.</t2390> <t2391>He said she would write a line and if she couldn't find anything that rhymed, she would cross it out and write another and keep going.</t2391> <t2392>She wasn't picky at all; she could write about anything someone gave her as a topic, as long as it was sad.</t2392> <t2393>Every time a man, or a woman, or a child died, there she was with her "tribute" before the corpse had even cooled down.</t2393> <t2394>She called them tributes.</t2394> <t2395>The neighbors said that first the doctor arrived, then Emmeline, and then the undertaker; the undertaker only beat Emmeline once, and that was because she couldn't find a way to rhyme with the name of someone named Whistler.</t2395> <t2396>From then on, she was never the same; she never complained, but she started to become melancholic and didn't live much longer.</t2396> <t2397>Poor thing; I would often go up to the little room that had been hers and take out her poor scrapbook and read it when her pictures had irritated me and I felt a bit angry with her.</t2397> <t2398>I liked that whole family, the dead and all, and I wasn't going to let anything come between us.</t2398> <t2399>Poor Emmeline wrote poetry for all the dead when she was alive, and it didn't seem right to me that there was no one to write one for her now that she was dead; so I tried to write one or two for her, but I don't know why they didn't come out.</t2399> <t2400>They always kept Emmeline's room tidy and clean, with everything exactly as she liked it when she was alive, and no one ever slept there.</t2400> <t2401>The old lady took care of the room herself, even though there were many black servants, and she spent a lot of time sewing and reading the Bible, mostly.</t2401>
<t2402>Well, as I was saying about the living room, there were some very beautiful curtains on the windows: white, with paintings of castles with ivy all over the walls and cattle going to drink.</t2402> <t2403>There was also a small and old piano that sounded like a rattle, and we had a great time when the young ladies sang "The Last Link is Broken" and played "The Battle of Prague" on it.</t2403> <t2404>All the rooms had plastered walls and almost all of them had carpets, and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside.</t2404>
<t2405>It was a double house, and the large open space between the two parts had a roof and was floored; sometimes they would set the table there at noon, and it was a cool and pleasant place.</t2405> <t2406>It was the best thing in the world.</t2406> <t2407>And on top of that, they cooked very well and there were heaps of everything!</t2407>
<t2408>Chapter 18</t2408>
<t2409>COLONEL GRANGERFORD was a gentleman, you understand?</t2409><t2410>He was a gentleman in everything, and the same was true of his family.</t2410><t2411>He was of good stock, as they say, and that counts as much in a man as in a horse, as Widow Douglas used to say, and no one denied that she was of the first aristocracy of our town, and father always said it too, although he himself was no better bred than a stray cat.</t2411><t2412>Colonel Grangerford was very tall and thin and had a pale brownish skin, without a single red spot; every morning he shaved his entire face, which was very thin, just like his lips and the nostrils of his nose; he had a very high nose and thick eyebrows and very black eyes, so deep-set that it seemed, as if to say, that he was looking at you from the bottom of a cave.</t2412><t2413>He had a high forehead and gray, straight hair that reached down to his shoulders.</t2413><t2414>He had long, thin hands, and every day he wore a clean shirt and a full linen suit so white it hurt your eyes to look at it, and on Sundays, a blue frock coat with copper buttons.</t2414><t2415>He carried a mahogany cane with a silver knob.</t2415><t2416>He was not at all frivolous, not one bit, and he never shouted.</t2416><t2417>He was very kind and it showed, so you could trust him.</t2417><t2418>Sometimes he smiled and it was a pleasure to see, but when he stood stiff as a flagpole and started shooting lightning from his eyes, you first thought of climbing a tree and then finding out what was going on.</t2418><t2419>He never had to tell anyone to have good manners: where he was, everyone always behaved well.</t2419><t2420>And everyone loved having him around; he was almost always like a ray of sunshine: I mean, with him it seemed like the weather was always good.</t2420><t2421>When he turned into a storm cloud, it darkened for half a minute and that was enough; in a week no one would do anything wrong again.</t2421>
<t2422>When he and the elderly lady came down in the morning, the whole family would rise from their chairs to greet them and would not sit down again until they had taken their seats.</t2422> <t2423>Then Tom and Bob would go to the sideboard where the glass jar was kept and pour a glass of herbal liqueur and give it to him, and he would hold the glass in his hand, waiting until Tom and Bob served themselves, and they would bow and say, "To your health, sir and madam," and they would also bow slightly and thank them and the three of them would drink, and Tom and Bob would pour a spoonful of water into the sugar and the little bit of whiskey or apple liqueur left at the bottom of their glasses and give it to Buck and me, and we would also drink to the health of the elders.</t2423>
<t2424>Bob was the eldest and then came Tom: two tall and handsome men with very broad shoulders and weathered faces, long black hair, and black eyes.</t2424> <t2425>They were dressed in white linen from head to toe, just like the elderly gentleman, and wore wide Panama hats.</t2425>
<t2426>Then came Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five years old and was tall, proud, and stunning, but very kind when she wasn't angry; although when she was, she would give looks that left one frozen, just like her father.</t2426> <t2427>She was very beautiful.</t2427>
<t2428>His sister, Miss Sophia, was also the same, but of a different type.</t2428> <t2429>She was calm and peaceful like a dove, and she was only twenty years old.</t2429>
<t2430>Each person had their own black servant, and Buck did too.</t2430> <t2431>My black servant had a great time because I wasn't used to having anyone do things for me, but Buck's spent his time running around.</t2431>
<t2432>That was the family that remained, but before there were more: three children who had been killed and Emmeline, who had died.</t2432>
<t2433>The elderly gentleman had a lot of farms and more than a hundred slaves.</t2433> <t2434>Sometimes a bunch of people would arrive on horseback, from ten or fifteen miles around, and they would stay for five or six days, spending the whole time having fun in the river or nearby, with dances and picnics in the woods during the day and dances in the house at night.</t2434> <t2435>Almost all of them were relatives of the family.</t2435> <t2436>The men arrived with their weapons.</t2436> <t2437>I assure you that those were distinguished people.</t2437>
<t2438>Nearby there was another clan of aristocrats—five or six families—almost all of them called Shepherdson.</t2438> <t2439>They were of as good a lineage and as refined, rich, and grand as the Grangerford tribe.</t2439> <t2440>The Shepherdson and the Grangerford used the same dock, which was about two miles upstream from our house, so sometimes when I went there with many of ours, I would see a bunch of Shepherdson who had already arrived with their thoroughbred horses.</t2440>
<t2441>One day Buck and I were in the hunting woods and we heard a horse approaching.</t2441> <t2442>We were crossing the path, and Buck goes and shouts:</t2442>
<t2443>—Quick! Run through the trees!</t2443>
<t2444>We started running and then looked through the leaves of the trees.</t2444> <t2445>Soon a splendid young man arrived, galloping down the road, very steady in the saddle and with a soldierly air.</t2445> <t2446>He carried the shotgun crossed over the pommel of the saddle.</t2446> <t2447>I had seen him before.</t2447> <t2448>He was young Harney Shepherdson.</t2448> <t2449>I heard Buck fire the shotgun next to my ear and Harney's hat fell off his head.</t2449> <t2450>He grabbed his weapon and headed straight to where we were hiding.</t2450> <t2451>But we didn't wait.</t2451> <t2452>We ran into the forest.</t2452> <t2453>The forest wasn't very dense, so I looked over my shoulder in case he fired, and twice I saw Harney aiming at Buck with the shotgun and then turning around, I suppose to pick up the hat, but I couldn't see him.</t2453> <t2454>We didn't stop running until we got home.</t2454> <t2455>The old man's eyes flashed for a minute —I think mostly with pleasure— and then he softened his expression a bit and said in a kind voice:</t2455>
<t2456>—I don't like that you shot from behind a tree.</t2456> <t2457>Why didn't you come out to the road, son?</t2457>
<t2458>—The Shepherdsons don't do it, father.</t2458> <t2459>They always take advantage.</t2459>
<t2460>Miss Charlotte had kept her head high like a queen while Buck told his story, with her nostrils flaring, and now she blinked.</t2460> <t2461>The two younger men had a somber air, but they said nothing.</t2461> <t2462>Miss Sophia turned pale, but regained her color when she learned that the man was not injured.</t2462>
<t2463>As soon as I could take Buck to where the corn was stored and we were alone under the trees, I asked him:</t2463>
<t2464>—Did you want to kill him, Buck?</t2464>
<t2465>—Man, of course.</t2465>
<t2466>—What had he/she done to you?</t2466>
<t2467>—Him? He has never done anything to me.</t2467>
<t2468>—Well, then, Buck, why did you want to kill him?</t2468>
<t2469>—Well, it's nothing, it's just for the blood revenge.</t2469>
<t2470>—What is a blood feud?</t2470>
<t2471>—But where were you raised? Don't you know what a blood feud is?</t2471>
<t2472>—I had never heard of that... tell me what it is.</t2472>
<t2473>—Well —said Buck—, a blood feud is something like this: a man fights with another and kills him, then the brother of the other man kills him; after that, the other brothers from each family start looking for each other, then the cousins get involved and after a while everyone is dead and the blood feud is over.</t2473> <t2474>But it's very slow and takes a lot of time.</t2474>
<t2475>—And has this been going on for a long time, Buck?</t2475>
<t2476>—Of course!</t2476> <t2477>It started about thirty years ago or so.</t2477> <t2478>There was a fight over something and then a lawsuit to resolve it, and one of the men won the lawsuit, so the other went and killed the one who had won it, which is naturally what he had to do, of course.</t2478> <t2479>What anyone would do.</t2479>
<t2480>—And, what was the problem, Buck? Was it about land?</t2480>
<t2481>—I suppose it would be... I don't know.</t2481>
<t2482>—Well, who killed whom? Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?</t2482>
<t2483>—How the hell am I supposed to know?</t2483> <t2484>It was a long time ago.</t2484>
<t2485>—Doesn't anyone know?</t2485>
<t2486>—Ah, yes, father knows, I suppose, and some of the other old folks; but they no longer know why the first fight happened.</t2486>
<t2487>—Have there been many deaths, Buck?</t2487>
<t2488>—Yes; there have been many funerals.</t2488> <t2489>But they don't always kill.</t2489> <t2490>Father has some shrapnel inside, but he doesn't mind because it doesn't weigh much anyway.</t2490> <t2491>Bob has one or two hunting knife cuts and Tom has been wounded once or twice.</t2491>
<t2492>—Has anyone died yet this year, Buck?</t2492>
<t2493>—Yes; we scored one and they scored another.</t2493> <t2494>About three months ago my cousin Bud, who was fourteen years old.</t2494> <t2495>He was going through the forest on the other side of the river and he wasn't carrying any weapons, which is foolish, and when he was in a lonely place he heard a horse coming from behind and saw old Baldy Shepherdson chasing him with a shotgun in his hand and his white hair flowing in the wind, and instead of jumping off the horse and running, Bud thought he could go faster, so the chase continued for five miles or more and the old man was gaining more ground each time; finally Bud saw that it wasn't worth it and he stopped and faced him so the wounds would be from the front, you know, and the old man caught up to him and killed him.</t2495> <t2496>But he didn't have much time to enjoy his luck, because in less than a week ours killed him.</t2496>
<t2497>—For me, that old man was a coward, Buck.</t2497>
<t2498>—Well, to me he wasn't a coward.</t2498> <t2499>Not at all.</t2499> <t2500>There isn't a single Shepherdson who is a coward; not one.</t2500> <t2501>And there isn't a single Grangerford who is a coward either.</t2501> <t2502>But once that old man held his own in a half-hour fight against three Grangerfords and he won.</t2502> <t2503>They were all on horseback; he dismounted and took cover behind some wood and put his horse in front so the bullets would hit it instead of him; but the Grangerfords kept circling the old man on horseback, shooting at him and he shooting back at them.</t2503> <t2504>He and his horse came home pretty banged up and full of holes, but the Grangerfords had to be carried home, one of them dead, and another died the next day.</t2504> <t2505>No, sir; if anyone is looking for cowards, they shouldn't waste their time with the Shepherdsons, because they don't breed those.</t2505>
<t2506>The following Sunday we all went to church, about three miles away, all on horseback.</t2506> <t2507>The men took their shotguns, and Buck did too, and they kept them between their knees or left them handy leaning against the wall.</t2507> <t2508>The Shepherdsons did the same: it was a most ordinary sermon: all about brotherly love and nonsense like that; but everyone said it was a good sermon and talked about it on the way back, and they had so much to say about faith and good works and sanctifying grace and predestination and I don't know what else that it seemed to me one of the worst Sundays of my life.</t2508>
<t2509>About an hour after eating, everyone was taking a nap, some in their chairs and others in their rooms, and it was all very boring.</t2509> <t2510>Buck and a dog were lying on the grass in the sun, sleeping like logs.</t2510> <t2511>I went up to our room thinking about taking a nap too.</t2511> <t2512>I saw the lovely Miss Sophia standing at her door, which was next to ours, and she made me come into her room, closed the door quietly and asked me if I loved her, and I answered yes, and she asked me if I would do her a favor without telling anyone and I said yes.</t2512> <t2513>Then she told me that she had forgotten the New Testament and had left it on the church pew between two other books, and if I would quietly go out and fetch it for her without telling anyone.</t2513> <t2514>I said yes.</t2514> <t2515>So I quietly walked down the path and in the church there was no one, except maybe a pig or two, because the door had no lock and pigs like the packed dirt floors in summer, because they are cool.</t2515> <t2516>If you notice, almost no one goes to church except when it's mandatory, but pigs are different.</t2516>
<t2517>I said to myself: "Something's up; it's not natural for a girl to be so concerned about a New Testament," so I shook it and a small piece of paper with a pencil-written note fell out: "At half-past two."</t2517> <t2518>I kept looking but didn't find anything else.</t2518> <t2519>That didn't tell me anything, so I put the paper back in the book and when I got home and went up the stairs, Miss Sophia was at her door waiting for me.</t2519> <t2520>She made me come in and closed the door; then she searched the New Testament until she found the paper, and as soon as she read it, she seemed very happy; and before one could realize it, she grabbed me and gave me a hug saying that I was the best boy in the world and that I shouldn't tell anyone.</t2520> <t2521>Her face turned very red for a moment, her eyes lit up, and she looked very pretty.</t2521> <t2522>I was very astonished, but when I caught my breath, I asked her what the paper said, and she asked if I had read it, and when I said no, she asked if I knew how to read manuscripts and I replied that I could only read print, and then she said that the paper was just to mark how far she had read and that I could go play now.</t2522>
<t2523>I went down to the river thinking about all that, and right away I realized that my black man was following me.</t2523> <t2524>When we lost sight of the house, he looked back and all around for a second, and then he came running and said to me:</t2524>
<t2525>—George, if you come to the swamp, I'll show you a bunch of water snakes.</t2525>
<t2526>It seemed very curious to me; he had said the same thing yesterday.</t2526> <t2527>He had to know that one doesn't like water snakes enough to go see them.</t2527> <t2528>What could he be looking for?</t2528> <t2529>So I said to him:</t2529>
<t2530>—Alright; you go ahead.</t2530>
<t2531>I followed him for half a mile; then he reached the swamp and waded through it with water up to his ankles for another half mile.</t2531> <t2532>We arrived at a piece of flat, dry land, full of trees, bushes, and ivy, and he said to me:</t2532>
<t2533>—Take a few steps in there, George; that's where they are.</t2533> <t2534>I've already seen enough of them.</t2534>
<t2535>Then he moved away and was immediately covered by the trees.</t2535> <t2536>I wandered around there until I reached an open spot, about the size of a bedroom, all surrounded by ivy, and there I saw a man who was asleep; and by all the devils, it was my old Jim!</t2536>
<t2537>I woke him up and thought he would be very surprised to see me, but he wasn't.</t2537> <t2538>He almost cried with joy, but he wasn't surprised.</t2538> <t2539>He said he had swum behind me that night and had heard all my screams, but he hadn't dared to respond because he didn't want anyone to pick him up and return him to slavery.</t2539> <t2540>And he continued saying:</t2540>
<t2541>—I hurt myself a bit and couldn't swim fast, so towards the end I was already very far from you; when you reached the shore, I calculated that I could catch up to you without having to shout, but when I saw that house, I started to go slower.</t2541> <t2542>I was too far away to hear what they were saying to you; I was scared of the dogs, but when everything went quiet again, I understood that you were in the house, so I went to the forest to wait for dawn.</t2542> <t2543>Early in the morning, some of the black people who were going to the fields arrived and took me with them and brought me here, where the dogs can't find me thanks to the water, and they bring me food every night and tell me how you are doing.</t2543>
<t2544>—But why didn't you tell my Jack to bring me earlier, Jim?</t2544>
<t2545>—Well, it wasn't worth bothering you, Huck, until we could do something, but now it's fine.</t2545> <t2546>I've been buying gadgets and food whenever I could and fixing the raft at night when...</t2546>
<t2547>—What raft, Jim?</t2547>
<t2548>—Our old raft.</t2548>
<t2549>—Are you going to tell me that our old raft didn't end up in pieces?</t2549>
<t2550>—No, after that.</t2550> <t2551>It was quite damaged on one end, but nothing serious happened, we just lost almost all the traps.</t2551> <t2552>And if we hadn't dived so much and swum so far underwater, if the night hadn't been so dark, we wouldn't have been so scared or so nervous, as they say, we would have seen the raft.</t2552> <t2553>But it's better this way, because now it's all fixed and practically new and we have lots of new things instead of the ones we lost.</t2553>
<t2554>—But, how did you manage to get the raft back, Jim? Did you go to catch it?</t2554>
<t2555>—How am I going to catch it if I'm in the forest?</t2555> <t2556>No; some of the black men found it stuck between some rocks there at the bend and hid it in a stream among the willows, and they argued so much about who was going to keep it that I found out right away, so I solved the problem by telling them it wasn't any of theirs, but yours and mine; and I asked them if they were going to keep the property of a young white gentleman, only to get a few lashes.</t2556> <t2557>Then I gave each of them ten cents and they were very satisfied, thinking they hoped more rafts would come so they could get rich again.</t2557> <t2558>These black men treat me very well, and when I want them to do something I don't have to ask them twice, my boy.</t2558> <t2559>That Jack is a good black man, and smart.</t2559>
<t2560>—Yes, it's true.</t2560> <t2561>He never told me that you were here; he told me to come and that he would show me a bunch of water snakes.</t2561> <t2562>If something happens, he has nothing to do with it.</t2562> <t2563>He can say that he has never seen us together, and he will be telling the truth.</t2563>
<t2564>I don't want to say much about the next day.</t2564> <t2565>I think I'm going to summarize it.</t2565> <t2566>I woke up around dawn and was about to turn over to go back to sleep when I noticed that there wasn't a sound; it was as if nothing was moving.</t2566> <t2567>That wasn't normal.</t2567> <t2568>Then I saw that Buck had gotten up and left.</t2568> <t2569>Well, then I got up, puzzled, and went down the stairs, and there was no one; everything was quieter than a grave.</t2569> <t2570>The same outside.</t2570> <t2571>I thought: "What does this mean?"</t2571> <t2572>Where the firewood was, I found my Jack and asked him:</t2572>
<t2573>—What's happening?</t2573>
<t2574>He answered me:</t2574>
<t2575>—Don't you know, Mr. George?</t2575>
<t2576>—No.</t2576> <t2577>I don't know anything.</t2577>
<t2578>—Well, Miss Sophia has run away!</t2578> <t2579>It's the honest truth.</t2579> <t2580>She ran away last night and nobody knows at what time; she ran away to marry that young Harney Shepherdson, you know... at least that's what they believe.</t2580> <t2581>The family found out about half an hour ago, maybe a bit more, and I assure you they haven't wasted any time; you've never seen such a rush to grab guns and horses in your life!</t2581> <t2582>The women have gone to fetch relatives, old Mr. Saul and the boys have taken the guns and hit the road to try to catch that young man and kill him before he can cross the river with Miss Sophia.</t2582> <t2583>I think very bad times are coming.</t2583>
<t2584>—And Buck left without telling me anything.</t2584>
<t2585>—Man, of course!</t2585> <t2586>They weren't going to involve you in that.</t2586> <t2587>Mr. Buck loaded the shotgun and said he would come back home with a dead Shepherdson.</t2587> <t2588>Well, surely there will be many of them and he will bring one if he gets the chance.</t2588>
<t2589>I started running along the river path as fast as I could.</t2589> <t2590>Soon I began to hear gunshots quite far away.</t2590> <t2591>When I reached the log warehouse and the pile of firewood where the steamboats dock, I started moving under the trees and bushes until I found a good spot, and then I climbed up a poplar cross where the bullets couldn't reach, and I looked.</t2591> <t2592>There was wood piled four feet high a little ahead of my tree, and at first I was going to hide behind it, but maybe it was lucky that I didn't.</t2592>
<t2593>In the open field in front of the log warehouse, there were four or five men circling on their horses, cursing and shouting, and trying to reach a couple of boys who were behind the pile of wood next to the landing, but they couldn't get there.</t2593> <t2594>Every time one of them peeked out from the river side of the woodpile, they got shot.</t2594> <t2595>The two boys stood back to back behind the wood, so they could shoot in all directions.</t2595>
<t2596>A while passed and the men stopped circling and shouting.</t2596> <t2597>They started running towards the warehouse, and then one of the boys aimed steadily over the wood and knocked one of them off his horse.</t2597> <t2598>All the men dismounted from their horses, grabbed the injured man, and began carrying him towards the warehouse, and at that moment the two boys started running.</t2598> <t2599>They were halfway to the tree where I was before the men noticed.</t2599> <t2600>Then they saw them and jumped on their horses and raced after them.</t2600> <t2601>They were gaining ground on the boys, but it didn't help because the boys had a good lead; they reached the pile of wood in front of my tree and hid behind it, so they were protected from the men again.</t2601> <t2602>One of the boys was Buck and the other was a thin boy about nineteen years old.</t2602> <t2603>The men circled for a while and then left.</t2603> <t2604>As soon as they were out of sight, I called Buck to see me.</t2604> <t2605>At first, he didn't understand why my voice was coming from a tree.</t2605> <t2606>He was very surprised.</t2606> <t2607>He told me to stay very alert and to let him know when the men reappeared; he said they were up to something and wouldn't take long.</t2607> <t2608>I preferred to leave that tree, but I didn't dare to come down.</t2608> <t2609>Buck started shouting and cursing, and swore that he and his cousin Joe (who was the other boy) would get revenge that very day.</t2609> <t2610>He said they had killed his father and two brothers and that two or three of the enemies had died.</t2610> <t2611>He said the Shepherdsons had ambushed them.</t2611> <t2612>Buck added that his father and brothers should have waited for their relatives because the Shepherdsons were too many for them.</t2612> <t2613>I asked him what was going to happen to young Harney and Miss Sophia.</t2613> <t2614>He replied that they had already crossed the river and were safe.</t2614> <t2615>I was glad, but Buck was furious for not having killed Harney the day he shot at him; in my life, I have never heard anyone say such things.</t2615>
<t2616>Suddenly, bang! bang! bang!, three or four shotguns went off.</t2616> <t2617>The men had advanced together through the trees and were coming from behind with their horses!</t2617> <t2618>The boys ran towards the river (both wounded), and while they swam downstream, the men ran along the bank shooting at them and shouting: "Kill them, kill them!"</t2618> <t2619>I felt so bad that I almost fell out of the tree.</t2619> <t2620>I'm not going to tell everything that happened because if I did, I would get sick again.</t2620> <t2621>I would have preferred never to have reached the shore that night to see such things afterward.</t2621> <t2622>I'm never going to forget them: I still dream about them many times.</t2622>
<t2623>I stayed in the tree until it started to get dark because I was scared to come down.</t2623> <t2624>Sometimes I heard gunshots in the distance, in the forest, and twice I saw groups of men galloping by the log warehouse with shotguns, so I figured the fight was still going on.</t2624> <t2625>I felt so discouraged that I decided not to go near that house again because I thought that somehow it was my fault.</t2625> <t2626>I thought that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia had to meet Harney somewhere at half-past two to run away, and that I should have told her father about the paper and the strange way she was acting, and then maybe he would have locked her up and all that horror would never have happened.</t2626>
<t2627>When I got down from the tree, I slid along the shore for a while, found the two corpses at the water's edge, and dragged them until they were on dry land; then I covered their faces and left as quickly as I could.</t2627> <t2628>I cried a little while covering Buck, because he had treated me very well.</t2628>
<t2629>It had just gotten dark.</t2629> <t2630>I didn't go back to the house, but went through the forest to the swamp.</t2630> <t2631>Jim wasn't on his island, so I ran to the stream and hid among the willows, ready to jump aboard and leave that horrible place.</t2631> <t2632>The raft was gone!</t2632> <t2633>My God, what a fright I got!</t2633> <t2634>I was out of breath for almost a minute.</t2634> <t2635>Then I managed to scream.</t2635> <t2636>A voice, less than twenty-five feet from me, says:</t2636>
<t2637>—Wow! Is that you, my boy?</t2637> <t2638>Don't make noise.</t2638>
<t2639>It was Jim's voice, and I had never heard anything so pleasant.</t2639> <t2640>I ran a bit along the shore and climbed aboard; Jim grabbed me and hugged me, so happy to see me, and says:</t2640>
<t2641>—God bless you, child, I was sure you had died again.</t2641> <t2642>Jack has been here and says he thought you had been shot because you hadn't come home, so at this moment I was going to take the raft down the stream to be ready to leave as soon as Jack came back and told me for sure that you had died.</t2642> <t2643>My God, how glad I am that you have returned, my child.</t2643>
<t2644>And then I go and say:</t2644>
<t2645>—All right; it's very good; they won't find me and will believe that I have died and floated down the river...</t2645> <t2646>Up there, there's something that will help them believe it, so don't waste time, Jim, let's find the big water as quickly as you can.</t2646>
<t2647>I didn't feel at ease until the raft had drifted two miles down the center of the Mississippi.</t2647> <t2648>Then we hung our signal lantern and figured we were free and safe again.</t2648> <t2649>I hadn't eaten anything since yesterday, so Jim brought out some corn muffins and milk with cream, and pork with cabbage and greens (there's nothing better in the world when it's well-cooked) and while I had dinner, we chatted and had a good time.</t2649> <t2650>I was very glad to get away from the blood feuds, and Jim from the swamp.</t2650> <t2651>We said there was no home like a raft, after all.</t2651> <t2652>Other places may seem crowded and stifling, but not a raft.</t2652> <t2653>On a raft, one feels very free and at ease.</t2653>
<t2654>Chapter 19</t2654>
<t2655>Two or three days and nights passed; I think I could say they swam by, so calm, smooth, and wonderful they slipped away.</t2655> <t2656>I'm going to tell you how we spent our time.</t2656> <t2657>The river was monstrously large there: in some places, it was a mile and a half wide; we navigated at night and rested and hid during the day; as soon as the night was about to end, we stopped navigating and moored, almost always in the still water under a landing place, and then we cut young poplars and willows and hid the raft underneath.</t2657> <t2658>Then we cast the fishing lines.</t2658> <t2659>Later, we would go into the river to swim for a while, to wash and refresh ourselves; then we would sit on the sandy bottom, where the water reached our knees, and wait for daylight to come.</t2659> <t2660>There wasn't a sound anywhere, everything was in absolute silence, as if the whole world had fallen asleep, except perhaps sometimes the croaking of frogs.</t2660> <t2661>The first thing you saw, if you looked over the water, was a kind of blurry line that was the forests on the other side; nothing else could be distinguished; then a pale spot in the sky and more paleness appearing, and then the river, soft and distant, which was no longer black but gray; you could see black spots drifting far away: barges and other boats, and long black lines that were rafts; sometimes you heard the creak of an oar, or voices mingled in the silence that made sounds carry from very far away; and after a while, you saw a line in the water, and by its color, you knew there was a current under the surface breaking it and making that line appear; and then you saw the mist floating as it rose from the water and the East turned red, and the river, and you saw a log cabin at the edge of the forest, over there on the other side of the river, which was probably a sawmill, and next to it, piles of wood with gaps made by some vagabonds, so a dog could pass through; then a nice breeze came from the other side, fresh and gentle, smelling very good because it came from the forest and flowers; but sometimes it wasn't like that because someone had left dead fish lying around, pikes and all that, and they smelled a lot, and then full daylight came and everything smiled at the sun, and the birds began to sing.</t2661>
<t2662>At that hour, it didn't matter to make a little smoke because it couldn't be seen, so we took the fish off the lines and prepared a hot breakfast.</t2662> <t2663>And then we would contemplate the solitude of the river and laze around, and little by little we would fall asleep.</t2663> <t2664>We would wake up, and when we looked to find out why, sometimes we saw a steamboat puffing upriver, so far on the other side that the only thing you could see was whether it had the wheel at the stern or on the sides; then, for an hour there was nothing to hear or see: only solitude.</t2664> <t2665>Then we would see a raft gliding in the distance, and sometimes one of the guys on board chopping wood, because that's what they almost always do on rafts, and you could see the axe shining and coming down, but you couldn't hear anything; you would see the axe rise again, and when it was above the man's head, then you would hear the chop, which had taken all that time to cross the water.</t2665> <t2666>And so we spent the day, lazing around, listening to the silence.</t2666> <t2667>Once a dense fog came down, and the rafts and everything that passed by made noise with pans so that the steamboats wouldn't overlook them.</t2667> <t2668>A skiff or a raft would pass so close that we could hear what the people on board were saying, their curses and their laughter, we could hear them perfectly, but we couldn't see any sign of them; it was a very strange feeling, as if they were spirits talking in the air.</t2668> <t2669>Jim said he thought they were, but I said:</t2669>
<t2670>—No; the spirits would not say: "Damn the damn fog."</t2670>
<t2671>As soon as it was night, we would head to the river; when we had the raft approximately in the center, we would do nothing and let it float wherever the current took it; then we would light our pipes and dip our legs in the water and talk about all sorts of things; we were always naked, day and night, when the mosquitoes allowed us; the new clothes that Buck's family had made for me were too good to be comfortable; anyway, I didn't really like wearing clothes much either.</t2671>
<t2672>Sometimes we had the whole river to ourselves for very long stretches.</t2672> <t2673>In the distance, we could see the banks and the islands on the other side of the water, and sometimes a spark that was a light in the window of a cabin, and sometimes in the middle of the water, we saw a spark or two: you know, a raft or a skiff, and you could hear a violin or a song coming from one of those boats.</t2673> <t2674>It's wonderful to live on a raft.</t2674> <t2675>Above us, we had the sky, all speckled with stars, and we would lie on our backs, look at them, and discuss whether someone had made them or if they had just appeared on their own.</t2675> <t2676>Jim always said that they had been made, but I maintained that they had just appeared; it seemed to me it would take too long to make so many.</t2676> <t2677>Jim said that the moon might have put them there; well, that seemed quite reasonable, so I didn't say anything against it, because I've seen frogs lay almost as many eggs, so it was certainly possible.</t2677> <t2678>We also watched the falling stars and saw the trail they left behind.</t2678> <t2679>Jim said it was because they had misbehaved and had been thrown out of the nest.</t2679>
<t2680>At night we would see one or two steamboats passing in the darkness, and every now and then they would send out a whole world of sparks from one of the chimneys, which fell into the river and looked beautiful; then the boat would round a bend and the lights would wink and the noise of the boat would disappear, leaving the river silent again, and then the waves it had raised would reach us, long after the boat had disappeared, causing the raft to move a little, and then nothing could be heard for who knows how long, except maybe the frogs or things like that.</t2680>
<t2681>After midnight, the people of the coast went to bed, and for two or three hours the shores were in darkness: there were no more sparks in the windows of the cabins.</t2681> <t2682>Those sparks were our clock: the first one that reappeared meant that dawn was arriving, so we immediately looked for a place to hide and moor.</t2682>
<t2683>One morning, around dawn, I saw a canoe and I crossed a channel to the main shore (it was no more than two hundred yards) and rowed a mile towards a stream among the cypresses, to see if I could get some blackberries.</t2683> <t2684>Just as I was passing a spot where a sort of cow path crossed the stream, a pair of men appeared running as fast as they could.</t2684> <t2685>I thought my time had come, because whenever someone was looking for someone, it seemed to me that it was for me, or maybe for Jim.</t2685> <t2686>I was about to leave in a hurry, but they were already very close to me, and they shouted and asked me to save their lives: they said they hadn't done anything and that's why they were being chased, that men with dogs were coming.</t2686> <t2687>They wanted to get directly into my canoe, but I told them:</t2687>
<t2688>—No, not now.</t2688> <t2689>I still don't hear the horses and the dogs; you have time to go through the bushes and climb a little up the stream; then get into the water and wade down to where I am and come over; that way the dogs will lose the trail.</t2689>
<t2690>That was what they did, and as soon as they were on board, I headed towards our mooring; after five minutes we heard the dogs and the men shouting in the distance.</t2690> <t2691>We heard them go towards the stream, but we couldn't see them; they seemed to leave it and wander around for a while, and then, as we kept moving away all the time, we could hardly hear them anymore; when we left the forest a mile behind and reached the river, everything was calm and we rowed to the sandbar and hid among the poplars, now safe.</t2691>
<t2692>One of those guys was about seventy years old or more, and he was bald with a very gray beard.</t2692> <t2693>He wore an old wide-brimmed hat and a greasy blue wool shirt, with old blue jeans tucked into his boots, with homemade suspenders; but no, he only had one left.</t2693> <t2694>He carried an old blue fabric overcoat over his arm, with shiny copper buttons, and they both carried large, half-worn travel bags.</t2694>
<t2695>The other guy was about thirty years old and was dressed just as plainly.</t2695> <t2696>After breakfast, we all lay down to chat, and the first thing that came up was that those guys didn't know each other.</t2696>
<t2697>—What problem have you had? —asked the bald man to the other.</t2697>
<t2698>—Well, I was selling a product to remove tartar from teeth, and it's true that it removes it, and generally also the enamel, but I stayed one night longer than I should have and was about to leave when I met you on the path on this side of town, you told me they were coming and asked me to help you escape.</t2698> <t2699>So I told you that I was also expecting trouble and that I would leave with you.</t2699> <t2700>That's all.</t2700> <t2701>And you?</t2701>
<t2702>—Well, I had been preaching sermons about temperance for a week and getting along very well with the women, both old and young, because I was making it hard for the drinkers, I assure you, and I was making at least five or six dollars a night, at ten cents a head, children and blacks free, and business was growing more and more, when somehow, last night, they started saying that I didn't mind spending some time alone with a jug.</t2702> <t2703>A black man woke me up this morning and told me that people were gathering quietly, with dogs and horses, and that they were going to come soon, give me a half-hour head start and then try to catch me, and that if they caught me they planned to tar and feather me and run me out of town on a rail.</t2703> <t2704>So I didn't wait for breakfast... I wasn't hungry.</t2704>
<t2705>—Old man —said the young man—, it seems to me that we could form a team; what do you think?</t2705>
<t2706>—I don't think it's bad.</t2706> <t2707>What do you do, mainly?</t2707>
<t2708>—By trade, I am a printing press operator; I work occasionally in over-the-counter medicines; theater actor: tragedy, you know; sometimes a bit of mesmerism and phrenology, when there's an opportunity; singing and geography teacher for a change; a lecture now and then...</t2708> <t2709>Well, lots of things; practically anything that comes up, as long as it's not work.</t2709> <t2710>What do you specialize in?</t2710>
<t2711>—I have worked quite a bit on the aspect of medicine.</t2711> <t2712>What I do best is laying on hands for cancer, paralysis, and things like that, and I don't do badly at fortune-telling when I have someone to find out the details for me.</t2712> <t2713>I also work on sermons, open-air preaching, and missions.</t2713>
<t2714>For a while, everyone remained silent; then the young man sighed and said:</t2714>
<t2715>—Ouch!</t2715>
<t2716>—What are you complaining about? —asked the bald man.</t2716>
<t2717>—To think that I could have had such an easy life and now find myself reduced to this company —and he began to dry his eye with a cloth.</t2717>
<t2718>—Blessed be! Don't you think this company is good?</t2718> <t2719>—asks the bald man, very dignified and angry.</t2719>
<t2720>—Yes, it is good enough; it is the most I deserve, for who brought me so low when I was born so high?</t2720> <t2721>Myself.</t2721> <t2722>I do not blame you, gentlemen, far from it; I blame no one, I deserve it all.</t2722> <t2723>Let the cold world perpetuate its revenge; one thing I know: somewhere a grave awaits me.</t2723> <t2724>The world can continue as it always has and take everything from me: loved ones, possessions, everything; but that it cannot take from me.</t2724> <t2725>Someday I will lie in it and forget everything, and my poor broken heart will be able to rest —and he continued to dry an eye.</t2725>
<t2726>—Bless your poor broken heart —says the bald man—; what broken heart are you talking about?</t2726> <t2727>We haven't done anything.</t2727>
<t2728>—No, I know that.</t2728> <t2729>I do not blame you, gentlemen.</t2729> <t2730>I have debased myself; yes, I alone.</t2730> <t2731>It is fair that I now suffer, perfectly fair; I cannot complain.</t2731>
<t2732>—Lowered from what? What have you lowered yourself from?</t2732>
<t2733>—Ah, you wouldn't believe me; the world never believes... but leave it; it doesn't matter.</t2733> <t2734>The secret of my birth...</t2734>
<t2735>—The secret of your birth!</t2735> <t2736>Are you going to tell us...?</t2736>
<t2737>—Gentlemen —says the young man very solemnly—, I will reveal it to you, for I believe I can trust you.</t2737> <t2738>In reality, I am a duke!</t2738>
<t2739>Jim's eyes popped out when he heard it, and I think mine did too.</t2739> <t2740>Then the bald guy goes and says:</t2740>
<t2741>—No! You can't mean it!</t2741>
<t2742>—Yes.</t2742> <t2743>My great-grandfather, the eldest son of the Duke of Aguasclaras, fled to this country at the end of the last century to breathe the pure air of freedom; he married here and died, leaving a son at the very moment his own father passed away.</t2743> <t2744>The second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates, and the true duke, newly born, was disinherited.</t2744> <t2745>I am the direct descendant of that child: I am the true Duke of Aguasclaras, and here I am, forgotten, stripped of my own possessions, persecuted by men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn out, with a broken heart, and reduced to the company of criminals on a raft!</t2745>
<t2746>Jim felt very sorry for him, and so did I.</t2746> <t2747>We tried to console him, but he said it was no use, that he couldn't be consoled much; he said that if we wanted to acknowledge his dignity, that would serve him more comfort than anything in the world, so we promised to do so if he told us how.</t2747> <t2748>He said we should bow when speaking to him and say "your grace," or "milord," or "your lordship," and that he didn't mind if we simply called him "Clearwaters," because, as he said, that was a title and not a name, and one of us would have to serve him at mealtimes and do all the little things he wanted.</t2748>
<t2749>Well, that turned out to be easy, so we did it.</t2749> <t2750>Jim spent the entire dinner standing, serving him and saying, "Would your grace like to try a bit of this or that?" and so on, and it was easy to see that he found it very pleasant.</t2750>
<t2751>But the old man remained very silent; he didn't have much to say and didn't seem very pleased with all the attention the duke was getting.</t2751> <t2752>He seemed to be thinking about something.</t2752> <t2753>So in the afternoon, he goes and says:</t2753>
<t2754>—Look, Aguassucias —he goes and says—, I feel really bad for you, but you're not the only one who has had problems of that kind.</t2754>
<t2755>—No?</t2755>
<t2756>—No, you are not the only one.</t2756> <t2757>You are not the only one who has been thrown out of the heights in a bad way.</t2757>
<t2758>—Ouch!</t2758>
<t2759>—No, you are not the only one who has a birth secret —and I swear she started to cry.</t2759>
<t2760>—Wait! What do you mean?</t2760>
<t2761>—Aguassucias, can I trust you? —asks the old man, still half-crying.</t2761>
<t2762>—Even the cruelest of deaths! —he took the old man by the hand, squeezed it, and said—: That secret of yours: speak!</t2762>
<t2763>—Dirty waters, I am the missing dolphin!</t2763>
<t2764>You can bet that Jim and I kept our eyes wide open that time.</t2764> <t2765>Then the duke says:</t2765>
<t2766>—What are you?</t2766>
<t2767>—Yes, my friend, it is true: you are looking at this moment at the poor missing dolphin, Louis the 17th, son of Louis the 16th, and Marie Antoinette.</t2767>
<t2768>—You! At your age!</t2768> <t2769>No!</t2769> <t2770>You mean to say that you are the late Charlemagne; you must be at least six or seven hundred years old.</t2770>
<t2771>—There have been so many problems, Aguassucias, so many problems that have turned my hair gray and brought this premature baldness.</t2771> <t2772>Yes, gentlemen, before you stands, dressed in cowboy clothes and in misery, the vagabond, the exiled, the persecuted, and the suffering legitimate king of France.</t2772>
<t2773>Well, he burst into tears and got so upset that neither Jim nor I knew what to do, feeling both sorry for him and at the same time happy and proud that he was on the raft with us.</t2773> <t2774>So we set to work, just as we had done before with the duke, and tried to console him as well.</t2774> <t2775>But he said it was no use, that the only thing that could console him was to die once and for all and end everything; although he said that sometimes he felt more comfortable and better if people treated him according to his rights, knelt down to speak to him, always called him "your majesty" and served him first at meals and did not sit in his presence until he said so.</t2775> <t2776>So Jim and I started to "majesty" him, doing everything he asked of us and standing until he told us we could sit down.</t2776> <t2777>That made him feel really good and he became very cheerful and happy.</t2777> <t2778>But the duke seemed to get angry with him and didn't seem at all satisfied with how things were going; but the king was very friendly with him and said that the duke's great-grandfather and all the other dukes of Aguassucias had the highest regard for his father and could visit the palace many times, but the duke remained angry for quite a while, until finally the king goes and says:</t2778>
<t2779>—The most likely thing is that we are going to spend a lot of time on this raft, Dirtywaters, so, what good is it to get angry?</t2779> <t2780>It only serves to annoy us.</t2780> <t2781>It's not my fault I wasn't born a duke and it's not your fault you weren't born a king, so why worry?</t2781> <t2782>What I say is that we have to make the most of things as they are: that's my motto.</t2782> <t2783>And it's not bad luck to have ended up here: good food and an easy life; come on, give me your hand, duke, and let's be friends.</t2783>
<t2784>The duke gave it to her, and Jim and I were very glad to see that.</t2784> <t2785>So we stopped feeling annoyed and were very happy because it would have been a shame not to get along on the raft; because the first thing you need on a raft is for everyone to be happy, to feel good, and to get along with each other.</t2785>
<t2786>It didn't take me long to realize that those liars were not kings or dukes at all, but the lowest of swindlers and frauds.</t2786> <t2787>But I never said anything or revealed it; I kept it to myself; it's the best way; that way there are no fights and you don't get into trouble.</t2787> <t2788>If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I had no objection, as long as there was peace in the family, and it was no use telling Jim, so I didn't.</t2788> <t2789>If I learned anything from my father, it's that the best way to get along with people like that is to let them go their own way.</t2789>
<t2790>Chapter 20</t2790>
<t2791>THEY ASKED us a bunch of questions; they wanted to know why we were hiding the raft like that and resting during the day instead of moving forward: Was Jim a runaway slave?</t2791> <t2792>I answered:</t2792>
<t2793>—For God's sake! Would a runaway slave flee to the South?</t2793>
<t2794>No, they admitted that they didn't.</t2794> <t2795>I had to explain things somehow, so I said:</t2795>
<t2796>—My family lived in Pike County, Missouri, where I was born, and they all died except for me, father, and my brother Ike.</t2796> <t2797>Father said he preferred to leave and go live with Uncle Ben, who has a little house by the river, forty-four miles down from Orleans.</t2797> <t2798>Father was very poor and we had some debts, so when he settled everything, there were only sixteen dollars left and our black man, Jim.</t2798> <t2799>That wasn't enough to travel fourteen hundred miles, neither on deck nor in any other way.</t2799> <t2800>Well, when the river rose, father had a stroke of luck one day; he found this raft, so we thought of going to Orleans on it.</t2800> <t2801>Father's luck didn't last long; a steamboat took off the front corner of the raft one night and we all fell into the water and dove under the wheel; Jim and I came out fine, but father was drunk and Ike was only four years old, so they never came out again.</t2801> <t2802>For a few days we had a lot of trouble, because people kept coming in boats and trying to take Jim, saying they thought he was a runaway black man.</t2802> <t2803>That's why we no longer sail during the day; at night they don't bother us.</t2803>
<t2804>The duke goes and says:</t2804>
<t2805>—Let me think of a way that we can sail during the day if we wish.</t2805> <t2806>I will think about it and come up with a plan to organize ourselves.</t2806> <t2807>Today we will continue like this because naturally we do not want to pass through that village over there in the daylight, it might not be healthy.</t2807>
<t2808>Towards the night it began to cloud over and it seemed like it was going to rain; the lightning flashed very low across the sky and the leaves were starting to tremble: it was going to be quite strong, it was easy to see.</t2808> <t2809>So the duke and the king started to prepare our wigwam to see how the beds were.</t2809> <t2810>Mine was made of straw, better than Jim's, who had a mattress made of corn leaves; in those corn mattresses there are always grains that get into your skin and hurt, and when you turn over, the dry corn leaves sound like you're crushing a bed of dead leaves and make so much noise that they wake you up.</t2810> <t2811>Well, the duke preferred to stay with my bed, but the king said no.</t2811> <t2812>He pointed out:</t2812>
<t2813>—I would say that the difference in rank would suggest to you that a corn mattress is not the most suitable for me.</t2813> <t2814>Your grace will stay with the corn bed.</t2814>
<t2815>Jim and I started to worry again for a moment, as we feared there might be more trouble between them, so we were very relieved when the duke went ahead and said:</t2815>
<t2816>—It is my eternal destiny: to always see myself crushed under the iron heel of pressure.</t2816> <t2817>Misfortune has broken my once proud spirit; I yield, I submit; it is my destiny.</t2817> <t2818>I am alone in the world: suffering falls upon me and I can endure it.</t2818>
<t2819>We left as soon as it was dark enough.</t2819> <t2820>The king told us to head towards the center of the river and not to show any light until we had passed far enough from the town.</t2820> <t2821>Soon we came into view of the small cluster of lights that was the town and we slipped by about half a mile away, everything perfectly, everything perfectly.</t2821> <t2822>When we were three-quarters of a mile further down, we used our signal lantern, and around ten it started to rain, blow, thunder, and lightning like the devil; so the king told us two to keep watch until the weather improved; then he and the duke crawled into the wigwam to spend the night.</t2822> <t2823>I was on watch until twelve, but I wouldn't have gone to bed even if I had one, because you don't see a storm like that every day, not by a long shot.</t2823> <t2824>Good heavens, how the wind howled!</t2824> <t2825>And every one or two seconds there was a flash that lit up the waves for half a mile around and the islands looked dusty in the rain and the trees swayed in the wind; then there was a brrruuum!... boom! boom! boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom! and the thunder rolled away growling and buzzing until it disappeared, and then, wham!, there was another flash and another crash.</t2825> <t2826>Sometimes the waves almost knocked me off the raft, but since I wasn't wearing anything, I didn't mind.</t2826> <t2827>We had no trouble with the logs coming down; the lightning lit everything up so we could see the logs coming with more than enough time to steer this way or that and avoid them.</t2827>
<t2828>It was my turn for the middle watch, you know, but by that time I was quite sleepy, so Jim said he would take the first half; Jim always behaved very well in that regard.</t2828> <t2829>I crawled into the wigwam on all fours, but the king and the duke had stretched out so much that there was no room left, so I stayed outside; I didn't mind the rain, because it was warm and now the waves weren't reaching as high.</t2829> <t2830>But around two o'clock they started rising again and Jim was going to call me, although he changed his mind because he figured they weren't high enough to do us any harm, but he was wrong because very soon one of those huge ones came and threw me into the water.</t2830> <t2831>Jim almost died laughing.</t2831> <t2832>Anyway, he was the black man who laughed the most of all those I have known.</t2832>
<t2833>I took the watch and Jim lay down and started snoring; after a while the storm subsided and went away, and as soon as we saw the first light of a cabin, I woke him up and we hid the raft in our hiding place for the day.</t2833>
<t2834>After breakfast, the king took out a well-worn deck of cards, and he and the duke played a game of seven and a half for five cents a hand.</t2834> <t2835>Then they got bored and said they were going to "plan a campaign," as they called it.</t2835> <t2836>The king went to look in his bag, from which he took out a bunch of printed leaflets and read them.</t2836> <t2837>One of them said that "The famous Dr. Armand de Montalban, from Paris," would give a "lecture on the Science of Phrenology" at such and such a place and on such and such a date, with an admission fee of ten cents, and that he would "chart personality graphs for twenty-five cents each."</t2837> <t2838>The duke said that was him.</t2838> <t2839>On another leaflet, he was the "world-renowned Shakespearean tragic actor, Young Garrick, from Drury Lane, London."</t2839> <t2840>On other leaflets, he had different names and did other marvelous things, like finding water and gold with a "divining rod," "exorcising witch spells," etc.</t2840> <t2841>Then he goes and says:</t2841>
<t2842>—But my favorite is the histrionic muse.</t2842> <t2843>Do you have experience on the stage, royalty?</t2843>
<t2844>—No —replied the king.</t2844>
<t2845>—Well, you shall have it before three days have passed, fallen grandeur —says the duke—.</t2845> <t2846>In the first good town we reach, we rent a hall and perform the duel from "Richard III" and the balcony scene from "Romeo and Juliet".</t2846> <t2847>What do you think?</t2847>
<t2848>—I will do anything as long as it makes money, Aguassucias; but you will see that I don't know anything about acting nor have I ever seen it done.</t2848> <t2849>I was too young when father had a theater in the palace.</t2849> <t2850>Do you think you can teach me?</t2850>
<t2851>—Easy!</t2851>
<t2852>—Very well.</t2852> <t2853>Anyway, I'm already eager to do something new.</t2853> <t2854>We can start immediately.</t2854>
<t2855>So the duke told him who Romeo was and who Juliet was and said that he was used to being Romeo, so the king could play Juliet.</t2855>
<t2856>—But if Juliet is such a young girl, Duke, with this bald head and this white beard, it might seem too strange.</t2856>
<t2857>—No, don't worry; these bumpkins won't even notice.</t2857> <t2858>Besides, you know, you'll be in disguise and that changes everything; Juliet is on the balcony watching the moonlight before going to bed, and she is wearing a nightgown and a lace sleeping cap.</t2858> <t2859>I have the two costumes here.</t2859>
<t2860>He took out two or three suits made of calico for curtains, which he said were the medieval armors of Richard III, and the other guy, a long white cotton nightgown and a matching frilled nightcap.</t2860> <t2861>The king was convinced, so the duke took out his book and read the parts with splendid enthusiasm, jumping and acting at the same time to show how it should be done; then he gave the book to the king so he could memorize his part.</t2861>
<t2862>At the turn of a curve, there was a tiny village, and after lunch, the duke informed us that he had already thought of a way to navigate during the day without any danger to Jim; so he said he would go to the village to arrange everything.</t2862> <t2863>The king said he would also go to see if he could get something useful.</t2863> <t2864>Since we had run out of coffee, Jim and I said that we would also go with them to buy some.</t2864>
<t2865>When we arrived, there was no one; the streets were empty and completely dead and silent, as if it were Sunday.</t2865> <t2866>We found a sick black man sunbathing in a courtyard, and he told us that everyone who wasn't too young, too sick, or too old had gone on a mission in the forest, about three miles away.</t2866> <t2867>The king asked how to get there and said he was going to work with those religious people to see what he could get out of it, and that I could accompany him.</t2867>
<t2868>The duke said he was going to look for a printing press.</t2868> <t2869>We found it; a tiny workshop above a carpentry shop; all the carpenters and printers had gone to the sermon and the doors were open.</t2869> <t2870>The place was very dirty and messy, with walls full of ink stains and leaflets with drawings of horses and runaway slaves.</t2870> <t2871>The duke took off his jacket and said that everything was already sorted out.</t2871> <t2872>So the king and I went to the religious meeting.</t2872>
<t2873>We arrived in about half an hour and soaking wet, because it was terribly hot.</t2873> <t2874>There must have been at least a thousand people who had come from twenty miles around.</t2874> <t2875>The forest was full of draft animals and carts, tied up everywhere, eating what was in the carts and kicking to ward off the flies.</t2875> <t2876>There were sheds made of sticks and roofed with branches, where they sold lemonade and gingerbread, with heaps of watermelons, green corn, and things like that.</t2876>
<t2877>The preachers were in sheds of the same type, although larger and filled with people.</t2877> <t2878>The benches were made of pieces of logs, with holes on the underside to insert sticks that served as legs.</t2878> <t2879>They had no backrests.</t2879> <t2880>The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds.</t2880> <t2881>The women wore wide-brimmed hats, and some wore dresses made of a linen and wool blend, others of holland cloth, and some of the young women, of calico.</t2881> <t2882>Some of the boys went barefoot, and there were children who wore nothing but a coarse linen shirt.</t2882> <t2883>Some of the older women were knitting and the younger ones were flirting in secret.</t2883>
<t2884>In the first shed we arrived at, the preacher was singing a hymn.</t2884> <t2885>He would recite two lines, everyone would sing them, and it was very beautiful to hear, because there were many people and they sang very enthusiastically; then he would recite another two lines for them to sing, and so on.</t2885> <t2886>The people were waking up more and more and singing louder and louder, and towards the end, some began to moan and others to shout.</t2886> <t2887>Then the preacher started to preach, and seriously too, and he strode first to one side of the platform and then to the other, and then he leaned over everyone, moving his arms and body all the time and shouting with all his might, and from time to time he would lift the Bible, open it and pass it from one side to the other, shouting: "It is the bronze serpent of the desert! Look at it and live!" And the people shouted: "Glory! Amen!"</t2887> <t2888>The preacher continued and the people moaned, shouted, and said amen:</t2888>
<t2889>—Ah, come to the bench of lamentations! Come, blackened by sin! (Amen!) Come, the sick and the sore! (Amen!) Come, the lame and the crippled and the blind! (Amen!) Come, the poor and the needy, full of shame! (Amen!) Come, all who feel tired, dirty, and suffering!</t2889> <t2890>Come with a broken spirit!</t2890> <t2891>Come with a contrite heart!</t2891> <t2892>Come with your rags, your sins, and your filth!</t2892> <t2893>The waters that purify are free, the gates of heaven are open, ah, enter and rest! (Amen!) (Glory, glory, hallelujah!).</t2893>
<t2894>And so on and so forth.</t2894> <t2895>With so many screams and cries, it was no longer possible to understand what the preacher was saying.</t2895> <t2896>In the middle of the group, there were people who stood up and elbowed their way to the bench of lamentations, their faces bathed in tears, and when everyone had gathered there in a group in the front benches, they began to sing, scream, and throw themselves onto the straw, completely crazed and out of control.</t2896>
<t2897>Well, before I could realize it, the king had set off and could be seen above everyone else, and then he jumped onto the platform and the preacher asked him to speak to the public, and he did.</t2897> <t2898>He told them that he was a pirate, that he had been a pirate for thirty years in the Indian Ocean, and that he had almost lost his crew last spring in a fight and now he had come back home to take some new sailors, but thank God last night he had been robbed and landed from a steamboat without a penny, and now he was glad; it was the best thing that had ever happened to him in his life, because now he was a changed man and felt happy for the first time in his life, and despite how poor he was, he was going to start working immediately to return to the Indian Ocean and spend the rest of his life trying to bring pirates back to the path of truth, because he could do it better than anyone else, as he knew all the pirate crews in that ocean, and although it would take him a long time to get there without money, he would go anyway, and every time he convinced a pirate he would say: "Don't thank me, don't give me any credit; it all belongs to those wonderful people at the Pokeville religious meeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and to that dear preacher you see there, the truest friend a pirate has ever had!"</t2898>
<t2899>And then she started crying, and everyone else did the same.</t2899> <t2900>Then someone shouted: "Let's take up a collection! A collection!"</t2900> <t2901>Half a dozen jumped to do it, but someone shouted: "Let him pass the hat!"</t2901> <t2902>Everyone said the same, including the preacher.</t2902>
<t2903>So the king walked among the people with his hat, wiping his eyes and blessing the people, praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates far away, and at every moment, the prettiest of the girls, all tearful, would come and ask him if they could kiss him to have a memory of him, and he always kissed them, and some of them he kissed and hugged at least five or six times, and they invited him to stay for a week, and everyone wanted him to sleep in their houses because they said it was an honor, but he said that since it was the last day of the mission, he could no longer do any good, and besides, he was in a hurry to get to the Indian Ocean as soon as possible and start working with the pirates.</t2903>
<t2904>When we returned to the raft and he did the count, he found that he had gathered eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.</t2904> <t2905>And in addition, he had taken a three-gallon demijohn of whiskey that he had found under a cart when coming home through the forest.</t2905> <t2906>The king said that all things considered, it was the best day he had ever had in the mission work.</t2906> <t2907>He said there was nothing to be done, that pagans are worth nothing compared to pirates if one wants to squeeze the most out of a religious mission.</t2907>
<t2908>The duke had thought he had done quite well until the king showed up, but afterward, it didn't seem so.</t2908> <t2909>He had prepared and printed two small jobs for farmers at that printing press (for horse sales) and had been paid four dollars.</t2909> <t2910>He had collected advertisements in the newspaper worth ten dollars, which he said he could reduce to four dollars if they paid in advance, which they did.</t2910> <t2911>The price of the newspaper was two dollars a year, but he accepted three subscriptions for half a dollar, on the condition that they paid in advance; they were going to pay in wood and onions, as usual, but he told them he had just bought the business and lowered the prices as much as he could, so he had to collect everything in cash.</t2911> <t2912>He had printed a small poem of three verses invented by himself, very sentimental and sad, titled "Yes, break, cold world, this broken heart," and had left it ready to print in the newspaper, without charging anything in return.</t2912> <t2913>Well, he had made nine and a half dollars and said it wasn't bad for a whole day's work.</t2913>
<t2914>Then he showed us another leaflet that he had printed and had not charged for, because it was for us.</t2914> <t2915>It had a drawing of a fugitive black man with a bundle on his shoulder and written underneath "Reward of two hundred dollars."</t2915> <t2916>It was all about Jim and described him exactly.</t2916> <t2917>It said that he had escaped from the Saint Jacques plantation, forty miles down from New Orleans last winter, and had probably gone North, and whoever captured and returned him could claim the reward and expenses.</t2917>
<t2918>—And now —said the duke—, starting tonight we can sail during the day if we want.</t2918> <t2919>When we see someone coming, we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope and put him in the wigwam, show this leaflet and say that we captured him upriver and that we were too poor to travel on a steamboat, so our friends gave us this raft on credit and we came down to collect the reward.</t2919> <t2920>It would be better with handcuffs and chains, but that wouldn't fit with the story that we're so poor.</t2920> <t2921>That would be like putting jewelry on him.</t2921> <t2922>The right thing is some ropes: we have to maintain the units, as we say on stage.</t2922>
<t2923>We all said that the duke was very clever and that there would be no problems navigating during the day.</t2923> <t2924>We thought that that night we could cover quite a few miles to get away from the commotion we figured the duke's work would cause at the printing shop in that town; after that, we could navigate whenever we wanted.</t2924>
<t2925>We remained hidden and silent and did not come out until nearly ten; afterward, we slipped away, quite a distance from the town, and did not raise the lantern until we had lost sight of it.</t2925>
<t2926>When Jim called me to take his four a.m. watch, he said:</t2926>
<t2927>—Huck, do you think we are going to meet more kings like these on this trip?</t2927>
<t2928>—No —I replied—.</t2928> <t2929>I suppose not.</t2929>
<t2930>—Alright —he continued—, then it's fine.</t2930> <t2931>I don't care about one or two kings, but I don't want any more.</t2931> <t2932>This one is a drunkard and the duke isn't far behind him either.</t2932>
<t2933>I found out that Jim had tried to make him speak in French to see what it sounded like, but he said that he had been in this country for so long and had had so many problems that he had forgotten it.</t2933>
<t2934>Chapter 21</t2934>
<t2935>IT WAS AFTER DAWN, but we kept going without dropping anchor.</t2935> <t2936>The king and the duke eventually got up, looking very tired, but after jumping into the water and swimming for a while, they seemed much more lively.</t2936> <t2937>After breakfast, the king sat in a corner of the raft, took off his boots, rolled up his pants, and left his legs in the water to be comfortable, lit his pipe, and started memorizing his "Romeo and Juliet."</t2937> <t2938>When he knew it quite well, he and the duke began rehearsing it together.</t2938> <t2939>The duke had to show him over and over how to deliver each speech, making him sigh and place his hand on his heart.</t2939> <t2940>After a while, he said he had done it quite well: "Only you mustn't shout 'Romeo!' like a bull; you have to say it softly and languidly, like this: 'Rooomeo!'; that's the point, because Juliet is just a charming girl, you know, and she doesn't bray like a donkey.</t2940>
<t2941>Well, then they took out a pair of long swords that the duke had made from oak slats and started to practice the duel: the duke said he was Richard III, and it was wonderful to see them jumping and leaping around the raft.</t2941> <t2942>But then the king tripped and fell into the water, and afterward, they rested and started talking about all the adventures they had had on the river in the past.</t2942>
<t2943>After eating, the duke said:</t2943>
<t2944>—Well, Capeto, we want this to be a top-quality show, you know, so we're going to add something more to it.</t2944> <t2945>Anyway, we need to have something to respond to the encores.</t2945>
<t2946>—What is this about encores, Aguassucias?</t2946>
<t2947>The duke told him and added:</t2947>
<t2948>—I can do a Scottish dance or play the sailor's bagpipe and you ... let's see... ah, I know: you can do Hamlet's monologue.</t2948>
<t2949>—The what of Hamlet?</t2949>
<t2950>—Hamlet's monologue, you know: the most famous one by Shakespeare.</t2950> <t2951>Ah, it's sublime, sublime!</t2951> <t2952>It always drives them crazy.</t2952> <t2953>It's not in this book, because I only have one volume, but I think I can remember it by heart.</t2953> <t2954>I'll see if I can extract it from the vaults of memory while walking.</t2954>
<t2955>So he dedicated himself to pacing up and down, thinking and frowning horribly at every moment; then he would raise his eyebrows; then he would press his forehead with his hand and lean back, as if groaning; then he would sigh and shed a tear.</t2955> <t2956>It was wonderful to see.</t2956> <t2957>Finally, he remembered.</t2957> <t2958>He told us to listen to him.</t2958> <t2959>He adopted a most noble posture, with one leg forward, arms extended, and head thrown back, looking at the sky, and began to shout, groan, and gnash his teeth, and after that, throughout his entire speech, he was howling and moving and puffing out his chest and the truth is that it was the most wonderful performance I have seen in my life.</t2959> <t2960>This was his speech, which I easily memorized while he taught it to the king:</t2960>
<t2961>To be or not to be; there's the rub</t2961>
<t2962>which turns such a long life into a calamity;</t2962>
<t2963>for who could bear his burden until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane,</t2963>
<t2964>except that the fear of something after death</t2964>
<t2965>kill the innocent dream,</t2965>
<t2966>second course of great nature.</t2966>
<t2967>And makes us prefer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune rather than fly to others that we know not of?</t2967>
<t2968>That is the respect that should calm us:</t2968>
<t2969>wake Duncan up with your call!</t2969> <t2970>I wish I could;</t2970>
<t2971>for who endures the scourge and contempt of time,</t2971>
<t2972>the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,</t2972>
<t2973>the delays of the law and the relaxation that its pains cause,</t2973>
<t2974>in the dead desert and in the middle of the night,</t2974>
<t2975>when the cemeteries yawn,</t2975>
<t2976>in her customary attire of solemn mourning,</t2976>
<t2977>except that undiscovered country from whose borders no traveler returns,</t2977>
<t2978>that spreads its contagion throughout the world,</t2978>
<t2979>and thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat of the adage,</t2979>
<t2980>pales with worry,</t2980>
<t2981>and all the clouds that descended upon our chests,</t2981>
<t2982>with this gaze their currents divert,</t2982>
<t2983>and lose the name of action.</t2983>
<t2984>It is an ending to eagerly desire.</t2984> <t2985>But calm down, sweet Ophelia:</t2985>
<t2986>do not open your terrible marble jaws,</t2986>
<t2987>but go to a convent... go!</t2987>
<t2988>Well, the old man liked the speech and immediately learned it to deliver it perfectly.</t2988> <t2989>It seemed as if it had been tailor-made for him, and as he mastered it and got into it, the way he shouted, jumped, and stood tall while delivering it was marvelous.</t2989>
<t2990>At the first opportunity, the duke had a few leaflets printed, and then, for two or three days while we were floating, the raft was quite lively, because there were nothing but duels and rehearsals —as the duke called them— all the time.</t2990> <t2991>One morning, when we had been in the state of Arkansas for quite some time, we came into view of a small village on a large bend of the river; so we moored three-quarters of a mile upstream, at the mouth of a creek that was closed off like a tunnel by cypress trees, and all of us except Jim got into the canoe and went to see if there was any possibility of putting on our show there.</t2991>
<t2992>We were very lucky; that afternoon a circus was going to set up and the peasants were already starting to arrive, in all kinds of rickety carts and on horseback.</t2992> <t2993>The circus would leave before nightfall, so our show had quite a good chance.</t2993> <t2994>The duke rented the courthouse and we went around the town putting up our programs.</t2994> <t2995>They said:</t2995>

<t3026>Due to unavoidable commitments in Europe!</t3026>
<t3027>Entry 25 cents; children and servants, 10 cents.</t3027>
<t3028>Afterwards, we strolled around the city.</t3028> <t3029>The shops and houses were almost all old, dilapidated, made of dry wood that had never been painted; they were raised off the ground by three or four feet high stilts so that the water wouldn't reach them when the river rose.</t3029> <t3030>The houses had little gardens, but it didn't seem like they grew much in them, except for jimsonweed, sunflowers, and piles of ashes, along with boots, broken shoes, and pieces of bottles, rags, and useless cans.</t3030> <t3031>The fences were made of different types of boards, nailed at different times and each leaning to its own side, and the gates usually had no more than one leather hinge.</t3031> <t3032>Some of the fences had been whitewashed at some point, but the duke said it was probably in Columbus's time.</t3032> <t3033>Generally, there were pigs in the garden and people trying to chase them away.</t3033>
<t3034>All the shops were on one street.</t3034> <t3035>They had homemade awnings in front, and those who came from the countryside tied their horses to the posts of the awnings.</t3035> <t3036>Underneath them were boxes of merchandise and loafers who spent the day leaning against them, marking them with their Barlow knives, chewing tobacco, with their mouths open, yawning and spying on each other; the most ordinary people.</t3036> <t3037>Generally, they wore yellow straw hats almost as wide as an umbrella, but they didn't wear jackets or vests; they were called Bill, Buck, Hank, Joe, and Andy, and they spoke in a lazy, drawling tone, with many curses.</t3037> <t3038>There was practically a loafer leaning against every awning post, almost always with their hands in their pockets, except when they took them out to lend someone chewing tobacco or to scratch themselves.</t3038> <t3039>Their conversation was practically limited to:</t3039>
<t3040>—Give me a chew of tobacco, Hank.</t3040>
<t3041>—I can't; I only have one left.</t3041> <t3042>Ask Bill.</t3042>
<t3043>Maybe Bill would give him a chew, or maybe he would lie and say he didn't have any.</t3043> <t3044>Some of those bums never have a cent or a chew of tobacco of their own.</t3044> <t3045>What they chew is what they borrow; they say to someone, "I wish you could give me a chew, Jack; I just gave Ben Thompson the last I had," which is almost always a lie; they don't fool anyone except strangers with that, but Jack isn't a stranger, so he responds:</t3045>
<t3046>— Have you given him something to chew on?</t3046> <t3047>It would be your sister's cat's grandmother.</t3047> <t3048>If you return all the scarves you've already asked me for, Lafe Buckner, then I'll lend you one or two tons and won't even charge you interest.</t3048>
<t3049>—Well, I did return you once.</t3049>
<t3050>—Yes, it's true: about six scarves.</t3050> <t3051>You asked me for store-bought tobacco and gave me back some blacker than tar.</t3051>
<t3052>The tobacco bought in the store is the smooth black tablet type, but those guys almost always chew the twisted natural leaf.</t3052> <t3053>When they ask for a chew, they usually don't cut it with a knife, but instead, they put the tablet between their teeth and gnaw at it, pulling it with their hands until they break it in two; then, sometimes, the one who lent the tobacco looks at it melancholically when it's returned and says sarcastically:</t3053>
<t3054>—Hey, give me the scarf and you keep the tablet.</t3054>
<t3055>All the streets and alleys were made of mud; there was nothing else: black mud like tar and almost a foot deep in some places, and at least two or three inches everywhere.</t3055><t3056>Pigs roamed and rooted around everywhere.</t3056><t3057>You could see a sow covered in mud, with her litter, walking down the street, lying right in the path where people had to swerve around her. She would stretch out, close her eyes, and wiggle her ears while the piglets nursed, and she seemed as content as if she were earning a salary.</t3057><t3058>But soon you would hear one of the loafers shouting, "Hey! Get her, boy! Go hard, Tige!" and the sow would take off with horrible squeals, with one or two dogs biting each ear and three or four dozen more arriving, and then all the loafers would get up and watch until she was out of sight, laughing with so much amusement and seeming to celebrate the noise greatly.</t3058><t3059>Nothing woke them up so quickly and entertained them as much as a dog fight, except for putting turpentine on a stray dog and lighting it, or tying a pan to its tail and watching it run itself to death.</t3059>
<t3060>On the side of the river, some of the houses jutted out over the bank and were listing and dilapidated and about to fall.</t3060> <t3061>The people had abandoned them.</t3061> <t3062>Under others, the bank had been disappearing under one of the corners, and that corner was all tilted.</t3062> <t3063>People still lived in those, but it was dangerous, because sometimes a piece of the bank as wide as a house collapses.</t3063> <t3064>Sometimes a strip of land a quarter of a mile wide starts to move and sinks until one summer it all falls into the river.</t3064> <t3065>These towns always have to retreat inland, further and further back, because the river keeps eating away at them all the time.</t3065>
<t3066>That day, the closer it got to noon, the more the streets filled with carts and horses that kept arriving.</t3066>
<t3067>The families brought food from the countryside and ate it in the wagons.</t3067> <t3068>Whiskey flowed freely, and I saw three fights.</t3068> <t3069>After a while, someone shouted:</t3069>
<t3070>—There comes old Boggs!</t3070> <t3071>He’s coming from the countryside to have his monthly drunken spree; here he comes, boys!</t3071>
<t3072>All the idlers seemed to cheer up; I figured they were used to having fun with Boggs.</t3072> <t3073>One of them said:</t3073>
<t3074>—Let's see who he intends to kill this time.</t3074> <t3075>If he had killed all the men he wanted to kill for the past twenty years, he would be quite famous.</t3075>
<t3076>Another said:</t3076>
<t3077>—I wish old Boggs would threaten me, because then I surely wouldn't die in a thousand years.</t3077>
<t3078>Boggs appeared trotting on his horse, shouting and howling like an Indian and announcing:</t3078>
<t3079>—Make way, you all.</t3079> <t3080>I'm on the warpath and the price of coffins is going to rise.</t3080>
<t3081>He was drunk and was wobbling in the chair; he was over fifty years old and had a very flushed face.</t3081> <t3082>Everyone was shouting at him and laughing and mocking him, and he mocked them back and told them that he would take care of them and kill them when their turn came, but that now he couldn't wait because he had come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, because his motto was: "First the meat and then the spoon stuff to finish."</t3082>
<t3083>He saw me, went to where I was, and asked me:</t3083>
<t3084>—Where are you from, boy?</t3084> <t3085>Are you ready to die?</t3085>
<t3086>And he left.</t3086> <t3087>I was scared, but a man told me:</t3087>
<t3088>—It doesn't mean anything; he always gets like that when he's drunk.</t3088> <t3089>He's the nicest old man in Arkansas and has never harmed anyone, drunk or sober.</t3089>
<t3090>Boggs arrived at the main store of the town, lowered his head to look under the awning curtain, and shouted:</t3090>
<t3091>—Come out here, Sherburn!</t3091> <t3092>Come out and face the man you've swindled.</t3092> <t3093>You are the dog I'm looking for, and I'm going to take you down too!</t3093>
<t3094>And so he continued, calling Sherburn everything he could think of, with the whole street full of people listening and laughing and having fun.</t3094> <t3095>After a while, an arrogant-looking man of about fifty-five years old (and by far the best-dressed in town) comes out of the store, and the people move to the sides of the street to let him pass.</t3095> <t3096>He says to Boggs, all calm and composed:</t3096>
<t3097>—I am fed up with this, but I will endure it until one o'clock.</t3097> <t3098>Until one o'clock, mind you: no more.</t3098> <t3099>If you open your mouth against me even once after that time, no matter how far you go, I will find you.</t3099>
<t3100>And he turns around and goes back inside.</t3100> <t3101>The people seemed to calm down a lot; no one moved and not a single laugh was heard again.</t3101> <t3102>Boggs left cursing Sherburn loudly all the way down the street; and shortly after, he turned back and stopped in front of the store, still saying the same things.</t3102> <t3103>Some of the men stood by his side and tried to make him be quiet, but he wouldn't; they told him it was a quarter to one, so he had to go home; he had to leave immediately.</t3103> <t3104>But it was no use.</t3104> <t3105>He kept swearing with all his might and threw his hat into the mud, made his horse trample it, and then left again shouting down the street, his gray hair blowing in the wind.</t3105> <t3106>Everyone who could talk to him did their best to convince him to get off so they could lock him up and calm him down, but it was no use: he went back up the street to keep cursing Sherburn.</t3106> <t3107>Then someone had an idea:</t3107>
<t3108>—Go find his daughter!</t3108> <t3109>Quick, go find the daughter; sometimes he listens to her.</t3109> <t3110>If there is anyone who can convince him, it's her.</t3110>
<t3111>So someone ran out.</t3111> <t3112>I went down the street a bit and stopped.</t3112> <t3113>Five or ten minutes later, Boggs reappeared, but not on horseback.</t3113> <t3114>He was staggering down the street towards me, without a hat, with a friend on each side holding him by the arm and hurrying him along.</t3114> <t3115>He was silent and seemed uneasy, and he didn't resist, but he was also running.</t3115> <t3116>Someone shouted:</t3116>
<t3117>—Boggs!</t3117>
<t3118>I looked to see who had said it, and it was that Colonel Sherburn.</t3118> <t3119>He was perfectly still in the street, with a pistol raised in his right hand, not aiming it, but with the barrel pointing at the sky.</t3119> <t3120>At that very moment, I saw a girl running up with two men.</t3120> <t3121>Boggs and the men turned around to see who had called; upon seeing the pistol, the men jumped to the side and the barrel of the pistol slowly lowered until it was level: with the trigger cocked.</t3121> <t3122>Boggs raised his hands and shouted: "Oh, sir, don't shoot!" Bang!</t3122> <t3123>The first shot was heard and Boggs staggered back, throwing his hands in the air; bang! the second shot sounded and he fell backward to the ground, all at once, with his arms spread out.</t3123> <t3124>The girl screamed, ran up, and threw herself towards her father, crying and saying: "Oh, he's killed him, he's killed him!"</t3124> <t3125>The people began to form a group around them, pushing their way through, craning their necks to try to see, while those closest tried to push them back, shouting: "Back, back! He needs air, he needs air!"</t3125>
<t3126>Colonel Sherburn threw the pistol to the ground, turned around, and walked away.</t3126>
<t3127>They took Boggs to a small pharmacy, with all the people also in a group and the whole town behind, and I ran and got a good spot at the window, where I was close and could see what was happening.</t3127> <t3128>They laid him on the floor, put a large Bible under his head and opened another one on his chest; but first they opened his shirt and I saw where one of the bullets had entered.</t3128> <t3129>He took about twelve long breaths, raising the Bible with his chest when he tried to breathe and lowering it when he exhaled, and then he remained still; he had died.</t3129> <t3130>Then they separated his daughter from him, who was screaming and crying, and took her away.</t3130> <t3131>She was about sixteen years old and had a very pleasant face, but she was very pale and full of fear.</t3131>
<t3132>Well, soon the whole town arrived and people tried to sneak in, they pushed and made their way as best they could to get to the window and take a look, but the people who were already there didn't want to leave and those behind kept saying all the time: "Come on, guys, you've seen enough; it's neither right nor fair for you to stay there all the time and not give anyone else a chance; we also have our rights, just like you."</t3132>
<t3133>They started arguing a lot, so I left, thinking there was going to be trouble.</t3133> <t3134>The streets were crowded and everyone was very nervous.</t3134> <t3135>Everyone who had seen the shots was recounting what had happened, and there was a large group around each of those guys, and people were craning their necks to listen.</t3135> <t3136>A tall, lanky man with long hair, a large white fur hat on his head, and a cane with a curved handle, was pointing out the spots on the ground where Boggs and Sherburn had been, and people followed him from one place to another or watched everything he did, nodding their heads to show they understood and bending slightly, with their hands resting on their thighs to see how he pointed to the spots on the ground with the cane; and then he stood up very straight and stiff where Sherburn had been, frowning and pulling the brim of his hat over his eyes and shouted: "Boggs!", and then lowered the cane to level and said "Bang!", leaned back, said "Bang!" again and fell to the ground on his back.</t3136> <t3137>The people who had seen it said he had done it perfectly; that was exactly how things had happened.</t3137> <t3138>Then at least a dozen people pulled out bottles and invited him.</t3138>
<t3139>Well, after a while someone said that they should lynch Sherburn.</t3139> <t3140>After a minute, everyone was saying the same thing, so they left, furious, shouting and grabbing all the clotheslines they could see to hang him with.</t3140>
<t3141>Chapter 22</t3141>
<t3142>THEY WENT IN A SWARM to Sherburn's house, shouting and howling like Indians, and everyone had to get out of the way or run to avoid being run over and trampled, and it was terrible to see.</t3142> <t3143>The children were running ahead of the crowd, shouting and trying to get out of the way, and in all the windows along the way there were women sticking their heads out and black children in every tree and black men and women looking over all the fences, and as soon as the horde got close to them, they moved aside and got out of their reach.</t3143> <t3144>Many of the women and girls were crying and screaming, half-dead with fright.</t3144>
<t3145>They arrived in front of Sherburn's fence, so tightly packed that not even a pin could fit through, making such a noise that one couldn't even hear their own thoughts.</t3145> <t3146>It was a small yard about twenty feet wide.</t3146> <t3147>Someone shouted: "Tear down the fence! Tear down the fence!"</t3147> <t3148>Then there was a sound of breaking wood, being torn and crushed, and the fence fell, and the first group of the crowd started to enter like a wave.</t3148>
<t3149>Just then Sherburn appears on the porch roof of the facade, with a double-barreled shotgun in his hand, and there he stays, so calm and collected, without saying a word.</t3149> <t3150>The uproar ended and the wave of people drew back.</t3150> <t3151>Sherburn didn't say a word; he stayed there, looking down.</t3151> <t3152>That silence was nerve-wracking and frightening.</t3152> <t3153>Sherburn slowly scanned the crowd with his eyes, and when he met someone's gaze, they tried to hold it, but couldn't; they lowered their eyes, as if he had looked right through them.</t3153> <t3154>And after a moment, Sherburn sort of laughed, but not a pleasant laugh, rather one of those that makes you feel like you're eating bread mixed with sand.</t3154>
<t3155>And then he goes and says, slowly and disdainfully:</t3155>
<t3156>—Look at you coming to lynch someone!</t3156> <t3157>It makes me laugh.</t3157> <t3158>Look at you thinking you had the courage to lynch a man!</t3158> <t3159>Since you are so brave that you dare to tar and feather the poor abandoned and friendless women who come here, you believed you had the guts to lay hands on a man.</t3159> <t3160>But a man is perfectly safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind...!</t3160> <t3161>As long as it's daytime and you're not behind him.</t3161>
<t3162>"Do I know you?"</t3162> <t3163>I know you perfectly well.</t3163> <t3164>I was born and raised in the South, and I have lived in the North; so I know perfectly well what you are all like.</t3164> <t3165>On average, a bunch of cowards.</t3165> <t3166>In the North, you let anyone trample over you, but then you go home, looking for a humble spirit to endure it.</t3166> <t3167>In the South, one man, all by himself, has stopped a stagecoach full of men in broad daylight and robbed them all.</t3167> <t3168>Your newspapers tell you that you are very brave, and from hearing it so much, you believe you are braver than everyone else... when you are just as brave and nothing more.</t3168> <t3169>Why don't your juries sentence murderers to hang?</t3169> <t3170>Because they are afraid that the friends of the accused will shoot them in the back in the dark... which is exactly what they would do.</t3170>
<t3171>"So they always acquit, and then a man goes at night with a hundred masked cowards behind him and lynches the scoundrel."</t3171> <t3172>"You made a mistake by not bringing a man with you; that's your error, and the other is that you didn't come at night and with masks on."</t3172> <t3173>"You brought part of a man: that Buck Harkness, and if you hadn't counted on him to start, your strength would have gone out through your mouth."</t3173>
<t3174>"You didn't want to come.</t3174><t3175>Guys like you don't like problems or dangers.</t3175><t3176>You don't like problems or dangers.</t3176><t3177>But it's enough for a half-man, like that one, Buck Harkness, to shout 'Lynch him, lynch him!' and you're scared to back down, you're scared to show what you are: cowards, and that's why you start shouting and hang on to the coattails of that half-man and come here shouting, swearing the enormities you're going to do.</t3177><t3178>The most pitiful thing in the world is a mob of people; that's what an army is: a mob of people; it doesn't fight with its own courage, but with the courage given by belonging to a mob and by its officers.</t3178><t3179>But a mob without a man at the head is less than pitiful.</t3179><t3180>Now what you have to do is tuck your tails between your legs and go home to hide in a hole.</t3180><t3181>If you really are going to lynch someone, you'll do it at night, Southern style, and when you come, you'll do it with masks and you'll bring a man.</t3181><t3182>Now, get out and take your half-man with you.</t3182>
<t3183>Upon saying this last thing, he slung the shotgun over his left arm and cocked it.</t3183>
<t3184>The group suddenly recoiled and then dispersed, each one hurriedly going their own way, and Buck Harkness followed them, looking quite defeated.</t3184> <t3185>I could have stayed if I had wanted to, but I didn't want to.</t3185>
<t3186>I went to the circus and kept wandering around the back until the guard passed by, and then I slipped under the canvas.</t3186> <t3187>I had my twenty-dollar gold coin and some more money, but I figured it was better to save it, because you never know when you might need it when you're far from home and among strangers and such things.</t3187> <t3188>You have to be very careful.</t3188> <t3189>I have nothing against spending money on circuses when there's no other choice, but it doesn't make sense to waste it on them either.</t3189>
<t3190>It was a truly amazing circus.</t3190> <t3191>It was the most wonderful thing ever seen when they all arrived on horseback two by two, gentlemen and ladies side by side, the men in shorts and t-shirts, without shoes or stirrups and with their hands resting on their thighs, so calm and so comfortable, at least twenty of them, and each lady so fine and all so beautiful like a gang of real queens, with dresses that cost millions of dollars and all covered in diamonds.</t3191> <t3192>It was truly a pleasure to see them; I have never seen anything more beautiful.</t3192> <t3193>And then they started standing up one by one and began circling around the ring, the men very tall, slender, and upright, with their heads moving slightly and almost touching the top of the tent, and with the ladies' rose-colored dresses swirling around their hips and puffed up, so that they looked like beautiful parasols.</t3193>
<t3194>And then they started going faster and faster, all of them dancing, first with one foot in the air and then with the other, with the horses leaning more and more and the ringmaster circling the central post, cracking the whip and shouting "Jai! Jai!", and the clown telling jokes behind him, until they all dropped the reins and each of the ladies put their hands on their hips and each of the gentlemen crossed their arms, and then the horses went and bent down until they were on their knees!</t3194> <t3195>So they went jumping into the ring one after another, with the most beautiful bows I've seen in my life, and then they left and everyone started clapping as if they had gone mad.</t3195>
<t3196>Well, everyone in the circus did the most amazing things, and the clown kept making jokes that had people almost dying of laughter.</t3196> <t3197>The ringmaster couldn't say a word without the other one responding as quick as lightning with the funniest things in the world, and what I couldn't understand at all was how he could come up with so many, so suddenly and so timely.</t3197> <t3198>Man, I couldn't have come up with them in a whole year.</t3198> <t3199>And then a drunk tried to get into the ring and said he wanted to ride a horse, and that he could ride as well as the best.</t3199> <t3200>They argued with him and tried to stop him, but he ignored them and the whole show came to a halt.</t3200> <t3201>Then people started shouting at him and laughing at him, and he got angry and started saying outrageous things, so the audience got angry and many men started coming down from the stands towards the ring, saying: "Give him a beating! Throw him out!" And one or two women started screaming.</t3201> <t3202>Then the ringmaster made a little speech saying he hoped there wouldn't be any incidents, and that if the man promised not to cause any more trouble, he would let him ride the horse if he thought he wouldn't fall.</t3202> <t3203>So everyone laughed and said okay, and the man mounted the horse.</t3203> <t3204>As soon as he was mounted, the horse started jumping, bucking, and prancing, with the circus staff holding onto the bridle, trying to stop it, and the drunk hanging onto the horse's neck, with his feet flying in the air with each jump, and all the people standing, shouting and laughing so hard they were in tears.</t3204> <t3205>And finally, of course, despite the circus staff, the horse broke free and ran like crazy, with the drunk clinging to it and holding onto the neck, first with one leg hanging down almost touching the ground and then with the other on the other side, and people dying of laughter.</t3205> <t3206>It didn't seem funny to me at all; I was screaming from the fear it gave me.</t3206> <t3207>But soon he managed to get back in the saddle and grab the bridle, falling first to one side and then the other, and after a moment he jumped up and let go of the bridle, and stood up!, with the horse running like mad.</t3207> <t3208>There he stayed, standing, letting the horse run, so calm, as if he had never been drunk in his life, and then he started taking off his clothes and throwing them to the ground.</t3208> <t3209>He took off so many things that they practically filled the air, and in total he shed seventeen outfits.</t3209> <t3210>And there he stood, slender and handsome, dressed in the most beautiful and striking way in the world, and he whipped the horse to make it run even faster, and then he jumped off, bowed, and danced his way to the dressing rooms, and everyone kept shouting in amazement and joy.</t3210>
<t3211>Then the ringmaster realized he had been tricked, and I think I have never seen a ringmaster so disheartened.</t3211> <t3212>But it was one of his own men!</t3212> <t3213>He had come up with that prank on his own, without telling anyone.</t3213> <t3214>Well, I also felt pretty foolish for having been deceived, but I wouldn't have wanted to be in that ringmaster's place, not even for a thousand dollars.</t3214> <t3215>I don't know; maybe there are better circuses than that one, but I haven't seen any yet.</t3215> <t3216>In any case, for me it was excellent, and when I come across it again, you can count on this customer as soon as I see it.</t3216>
<t3217>Well, that night our show was on, but there were only twelve people, just enough to cover the expenses.</t3217> <t3218>And they were laughing the whole time, which made the duke furious, and on top of that, everyone left before the play was over, except for a boy who had fallen asleep.</t3218> <t3219>So the duke said that those Arkansas bumpkins didn't understand Shakespeare; what they liked were slapstick comedies, it seemed.</t3219> <t3220>He said he could see what they were all about.</t3220> <t3221>So the next morning he got some large sheets of wrapping paper and black paint, prepared flyers, and distributed them all over town.</t3221> <t3222>The flyers said:</t3222>
<t3223>IN THE COURTROOM!</t3223>
<t3224>Only three nights!</t3224>
<t3225>The world-famous actors</t3225>
<t3226>DAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER!</t3226>
<t3227>And</t3227>
<t3228>EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER!</t3228>
<t3229>of the Theaters of London and the continent,</t3229>
<t3230>In his thrilling tragedy of</t3230>
<t3231>THE KING'S CAMELLEOPARD</t3231>
<t3232>O</t3232>
<t3233>THE PEERLESS ROYALTY!!</t3233>
<t3234>Entry 50 cents.</t3234>
<t3235>And in the end, the biggest line of all, which said:</t3235>
<t3236>ENTRY OF LADIES AND CHILDREN PROHIBITED</t3236>
<t3237>—Alright —he said—, if they don't come with this last thing, then I don't know Arkansaw!</t3237>
<t3238>Chapter 23</t3238>
<t3239>WELL, the king and he were working all day, setting up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles to act as footlights; and that night the hall was filled with men in an instant.</t3239> <t3240>When no more could fit, the duke left the ticket booth, went around the back, climbed onto the stage, and stood in front of the curtain, where he delivered a speech praising the tragedy and said it was the most thrilling ever seen, and then boasting about the tragedy and old Edmund Kean, who was going to play the main role, and when he finally had everyone impatient for it to start, he drew the curtain and the next moment the king appeared on all fours, naked, painted all over with rings and stripes of all colors, splendid as a rainbow.</t3240> <t3241>And... but the rest of his attire doesn't matter; it was sheer madness, though very amusing.</t3241> <t3242>The audience almost died laughing, and when the king finished doing somersaults and disappeared behind the stage, they started shouting and clapping, stomping and laughing until he came back and repeated it, and then they still made him repeat it again.</t3242> <t3243>I think even a cow would have laughed at the nonsense that old fool was doing.</t3243>
<t3244>Then the duke lowered the curtain, bowed to the audience, and said that the great tragedy would only be performed two more nights, due to urgent commitments in London, where all the tickets at Drury Lane were sold out. He then bowed again and said that if he had managed to entertain and educate them, he would greatly appreciate it if they mentioned it to their friends so they could also come to see it.</t3244>
<t3245>Twenty voices shouted:</t3245>
<t3246>—How, is it over? Is that all?</t3246>
<t3247>The duke goes and says yes.</t3247> <t3248>Then all hell broke loose.</t3248> <t3249>Everyone started shouting: "Scammers!" and they stood up furiously and rushed towards the stage and the tragic actors.</t3249> <t3250>But a burly and good-looking man jumped onto a bench and shouted:</t3250>
<t3251>—Calm down!</t3251> <t3252>Just one word, gentlemen —and they stopped to listen to him—.</t3252> <t3253>We have been swindled, and swindled well.</t3253> <t3254>But we don't want the whole town to laugh at us, I believe, and to bother us for the rest of our lives.</t3254> <t3255>No.</t3255> <t3256>What we want is to leave here calmly to make good publicity for the show, and deceive the rest of the town!</t3256> <t3257>Then we will all be in the same situation.</t3257> <t3258>Don't you think that's the most sensible thing? ("Sure it is! The judge is right!" they all shouted.)</t3258> <t3259>Well then, not a word to anyone about this swindle.</t3259> <t3260>Everyone go home and tell the others to come see the tragedy.</t3260>
<t3261>The next day in the village, everyone was talking about how splendid the performance had been.</t3261> <t3262>The hall filled up again that night, and the scam was repeated just like the previous one.</t3262> <t3263>When the king, the duke, and I returned to the raft, we all had dinner, and after a while, they made Jim and me float it to the middle of the river and hide it about two miles down from the village.</t3263>
<t3264>The third night the hall filled up again, and this time there were no new spectators, but people who had already come the previous two nights.</t3264> <t3265>I stayed with the duke at the ticket booth and saw that everyone passing by had their pockets full or something hidden under their jackets, and I also noticed that they didn't exactly smell like roses, far from it.</t3265> <t3266>I smelled rotten eggs by the dozens, rotten cabbages and things like that, and if I've ever smelled a dead cat, and I assure you I have, sixty-four of them walked in.</t3266> <t3267>I held on for a moment, but it was too much for me; I couldn't bear it.</t3267> <t3268>Well, when there wasn't room for even one more spectator, the duke gave a guy a quarter dollar, told him to stay at the ticket booth for a minute, and then headed towards the stage door, with me behind him; but as soon as we turned the corner and were in the dark, he goes and says to me:</t3268>
<t3269>—Now start walking quickly until there are no more houses, and then run to the raft like a bat out of hell!</t3269>
<t3270>That's what I did, and he did the same.</t3270> <t3271>We reached the raft at the same time, and in less than two seconds we were gliding down the river, in the darkness and silence, moving towards the middle of the river, all very quiet.</t3271> <t3272>I figured the poor king was going to have a hard time with the audience, but no way; a minute later he crawled out of the wigwam on all fours and said:</t3272>
<t3273>—Well, how did it go this time, Duke? —he hadn't even gone to town.</t3273>
<t3274>We didn't light a single lamp until we were about ten miles downstream from the town.</t3274> <t3275>There we had dinner, and the king and the duke burst out laughing at how they had tricked those people.</t3275> <t3276>The duke said:</t3276>
<t3277>—Idiots, bumpkins!</t3277> <t3278>I already knew that those from the first session wouldn't say anything and would let us deceive the rest of the town, and I knew they would take revenge on the third night, thinking it was their turn.</t3278> <t3279>Well, their turn has come, and I'd give something to know how they're going to take it.</t3279> <t3280>I'd really like to know how they're going to take advantage of the opportunity.</t3280> <t3281>They can always go for a picnic if they want.</t3281> <t3282>They brought plenty of provisions.</t3282>
<t3283>Those scoundrels had made four hundred sixty-five dollars in three nights.</t3283> <t3284>I had never seen money come in like that, by the cartload.</t3284>
<t3285>Afterwards, when they had already fallen asleep and were snoring, Jim goes and says:</t3285>
<t3286>—Doesn't it surprise you how that king behaves, Huck?</t3286>
<t3287>—No —I replied—, nothing.</t3287>
<t3288>—Why not, Huck?</t3288>
<t3289>—Well, no, because it's in their blood.</t3289> <t3290>I figure they are all the same.</t3290>
<t3291>—But, Huck, these kings of ours are scoundrels; that's what they are, scoundrels.</t3291>
<t3292>—Well, that's what I was saying; all kings are practically scoundrels, as far as I know.</t3292>
<t3293>—Is it true?</t3293>
<t3294>—You only have to read what they have done to find out.</t3294> <t3295>Look at Henry VIII; our guy is a Sunday school superintendent compared to him.</t3295> <t3296>And look at Charles II and Louis XIV, and Louis XV and James II and Edward II and Richard III and forty more; besides all those Saxon heptarchies that were around in ancient times causing trouble.</t3296> <t3297>But you should have seen that Henry VIII when he was in form.</t3297> <t3298>He was a gem.</t3298> <t3299>He married a new woman every day and chopped off her head the next morning.</t3299> <t3300>And he cared as much as if he were ordering a pair of eggs.</t3300> <t3301>“Bring Nell Gwynn,” he would say.</t3301> <t3302>They would bring her.</t3302> <t3303>The next morning: “Off with her head!” And off it went.</t3303> <t3304>“Bring Jane Shore,” he would say, and there she came.</t3304> <t3305>The next morning: “Off with her head.”</t3305> <t3306>And off it went.</t3306> <t3307>“Bring the fair Rosamund,” and the fair Rosamund would answer the call.</t3307> <t3308>The next morning: “Off with her head.”</t3308> <t3309>And he made each of them tell him a story every night until he gathered a thousand and one stories, and then he put them all in a book and called it the Book of Judgment, which is a good title, and it explains everything.</t3309> <t3310>You don’t know kings, Jim, but I do; this rogue of ours is one of the most decent I’ve come across in history.</t3310> <t3311>Well, Henry gets the idea that he wants to mess with this country.</t3311> <t3312>And, what does he do... does he give any warning?</t3312> <t3313>Does he tell the country?</t3313> <t3314>No.</t3314> <t3315>Suddenly he goes and throws all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard and invents a declaration of independence and dares them to try something.</t3315> <t3316>That’s how he did things.</t3316> <t3317>He never gave anyone a chance.</t3317> <t3318>He suspected something about his father, who was the Duke of Wellington.</t3318> <t3319>And, what does he do? Does he tell him to show up?</t3319> <t3320>No: he drowns him in a barrel of malmsey, like he was a cat.</t3320> <t3321>Imagine someone left money where he was; what did he do?</t3321> <t3322>He kept it.</t3322> <t3323>Imagine he had a contract to do something and you paid him and didn’t sit there to watch him do it; what did he do?</t3323> <t3324>Always the opposite.</t3324> <t3325>Imagine he opened his mouth; what happened?</t3325> <t3326>If he didn’t close it immediately, he would spit out a lie a minute.</t3326> <t3327>That’s how much of a rascal Henry was, and if he had been with us instead of our kings, he would have swindled that people much more than ours did.</t3327> <t3328>I’m not saying ours are lambs, because they’re not and that would be a lie, but they are nothing compared to that old bastard.</t3328> <t3329>All I’m saying is that kings are kings and you have to give them some leeway.</t3329> <t3330>As a whole, they’re quite a bunch of scoundrels.</t3330> <t3331>It’s because of how they’re raised.</t3331>
<t3332>—But this one stinks like a damn, Huck.</t3332>
<t3333>—Well, just like everyone else, Jim.</t3333> <t3334>We can't prevent kings from smelling that way; history doesn't tell us how to avoid it.</t3334>
<t3335>—But the duke seems somewhat more likable in certain aspects.</t3335>
<t3336>—Yes, the dukes are different.</t3336> <t3337>But not by much.</t3337> <t3338>This one is an average thing for a duke.</t3338> <t3339>When he is drunk, a nearsighted person couldn't distinguish him from a king.</t3339>
<t3340>—Well, in any case, I don't feel like meeting more of these types, Huck.</t3340> <t3341>These ones are more than enough for me.</t3341>
<t3342>—The same thing happens to me, Jim.</t3342> <t3343>But they have fallen upon us and we have to remember what they are and take things into account.</t3343> <t3344>I would like to find out that in some country there are no more kings.</t3344>
<t3345>Why tell Jim that they weren't real kings or dukes?</t3345> <t3346>It wouldn't have been worth anything; besides, as I had said: you couldn't tell them apart from the real ones.</t3346>
<t3347>I fell asleep and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn.</t3347> <t3348>He did it many times.</t3348> <t3349>When I woke up, just at dawn, he was sitting with his head between his knees, moaning and lamenting.</t3349> <t3350>I didn't pay him any attention nor did I let on that I noticed.</t3350> <t3351>I knew what was happening.</t3351> <t3352>He was thinking about his wife and children, far away, and he felt discouraged and homesick, because he had never been away from home in his entire life, and I truly believe he loved his people as much as white people love theirs.</t3352> <t3353>It doesn't seem natural, but I think that's how it is.</t3353> <t3354>Many times he would moan and lament like that at night, when he thought I was asleep, and he would say: "Poor little Lizabeth! Poor little John!</t3354> <t3355>It's very hard; I think I'll never see you again, never again!"</t3355> <t3356>He was a very good black man, that Jim.</t3356>
<t3357>But that time, I don't know how, I started talking to him about his wife and children, and after a while, he goes and says:</t3357>
<t3358>—I feel so bad because I heard something like a bang, or a door slam, over there on the shore a while ago, and it reminds me of the time I treated my little Lizabeth so poorly.</t3358> <t3359>She was only four years old and she got scarlet fever and had a very hard time; but she got better and one day I go and say, I said:</t3359>
<t3360>"—Close that door."</t3360>
<t3361>"And he didn't close it; he stayed there, as if smiling at me."</t3361> <t3362>I got pissed off and I say to him again very loudly, I go and say, I said:</t3362>
<t3363>"—Can't you hear me?"</t3363> <t3364>"Close that door!"</t3364>
<t3365>"And she was still there, as if smiling at me."</t3365> <t3366>And I was so pissed off!</t3366> <t3367>And I go and say, I said:</t3367>
<t3368>"—You're going to find out!"</t3368>
<t3369>»And I go and slap her so hard that she falls on her back.</t3369> <t3370>Then I went to the other room and took about ten minutes to come back, and when I returned, the door was still open, and the girl was right there, looking at the floor and complaining and crying.</t3370> <t3371>God, what a rage!</t3371> <t3372>I was going to hit her again, but just then, because it was a door that opened inward, just then the wind goes and slams it shut behind the girl, bam!</t3372> <t3373>And I swear the girl didn't even move!</t3373> <t3374>I almost lost my breath; and I felt so... I don't know how I felt.</t3374> <t3375>I left there all trembling and I go and open the door very slowly and stick my head right behind the girl, without making a sound, and suddenly I say: "Bam!" as loud as I can.</t3375> <t3376>And she didn't even move! Oh, Huck.</t3376> <t3377>I started to cry and grabbed her in my arms saying: "Oh, poor thing!</t3377> <t3378>May the Lord and all the saints forgive poor Jim, because he will never forgive himself as long as he lives!" Oh, she had gone completely deaf and mute, Huck, completely deaf and mute, and I was treating her like that!</t3378>
<t3379>Chapter 24</t3379>
<t3380>THE NEXT DAY, towards the evening, we moored at a small island of willows in the middle, where there was a town on each side of the river, and the duke and the king started making plans to work in those towns.</t3380> <t3381>Jim spoke with the duke and said that he hoped it wouldn't take more than a few hours, because it was very hard for him to have to stay in the wigwam all day, tied up with ropes.</t3381> <t3382>You see, when we left him, we had to tie him up, because if someone found him alone and untied, it would seem like he was a runaway black man, you know.</t3382> <t3383>So the duke said that indeed it was very hard to stay tied up all day and that he was going to think of some way to solve it.</t3383>
<t3384>The said duke was very clever, and soon an idea occurred to him.</t3384> <t3385>He dressed Jim in the costume of King Lear: a long calico curtain robe and a white horsehair wig, with its beard, and then took out the theater makeup and painted his face and hands, ears, and neck all in a dull and continuous blue, like a man who had been drowned for nine days.</t3385> <t3386>Hang me if it wasn't the most horrible sight one could imagine.</t3386> <t3387>Then the duke wrote on a blackboard a sign that said:</t3387>
<t3388>SICK ARAB;</t3388>
<t3389>HARMLESS WHEN NOT DRIVEN MAD.</t3389>
<t3390>And he nailed the sign to a post and placed the post four or five feet in front of the wigwam.</t3390> <t3391>Jim was very happy.</t3391> <t3392>He said it was much better than being tied up for years and years every day and trembling every time he heard something.</t3392> <t3393>The duke told him to do whatever he pleased and that if anyone came snooping around, he should jump out of the wigwam and make a bit of a fuss and let out a howl or two like a wild animal, and he figured they would leave and let him be.</t3393> <t3394>Which was a pretty good idea; but the truth is that a normal man wouldn't wait for him to start howling.</t3394> <t3395>But it not only looked like he had died, but something much worse still!</t3395>
<t3396>Those scoundrels wanted to try the Sin Par again because it brought in a lot of money, but they figured it wasn't worth it, as the news might have already spread.</t3396> <t3397>They couldn't come up with any project that seemed perfect, so in the end, the duke said he was giving up and would think about it for an hour or two to see if he could organize something in the town of Arkansas, and the king said he would go to the other town without any plan, but would trust Providence to give him some lucrative idea, meaning, I guess, that he was referring to the theater.</t3397> <t3398>We had all bought clothes at the store at the last stop, and now the king put on his and told me to put on mine.</t3398> <t3399>Of course, I did.</t3399> <t3400>The king's clothes were all black and had a very elegant and starched look.</t3400> <t3401>Until then, I had never understood how clothes could change a person.</t3401> <t3402>Before, he had the air of the old scoundrel he really was, but now, when he took off his new beaver hat and bowed and smiled, he looked so elegant and pious that one would think he had just stepped out of Noah's Ark and could have written Leviticus himself.</t3402> <t3403>Jim cleaned the canoe and prepared the paddle for me.</t3403> <t3404>A steamboat had docked on the shore beyond the cape, about three miles up from the town, and had been there for a couple of hours, loading material.</t3404> <t3405>And the king goes and says:</t3405>
<t3406>—Since I'm dressed like this, I figure it's better to get to Saint Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big city.</t3406> <t3407>Let's head to the steamboat, Huckleberry; we'll get to town on it.</t3407>
<t3408>There was no need to be told twice to take a ride on a steamboat.</t3408> <t3409>I reached the riverbank half a mile upstream from the village, and then we slid down along the cliff, in the calm water.</t3409> <t3410>We soon encountered a young farmer with an innocent air, sitting on a log and wiping the sweat from his face, as it was very hot, with a couple of cloth suitcases on the ground.</t3410>
<t3411>—We are going to dock —said the king.</t3411> <t3412>I obeyed—.</t3412> <t3413>Where are you going, young man?</t3413>
<t3414>—To the steamboat; I have to go to Orleans.</t3414>
<t3415>—Get on board —said the king—.</t3415> <t3416>One moment, my servant will help you with the luggage.</t3416> <t3417>Jump ashore and give the gentleman a hand, Adolfus —and I saw that it was me.</t3417>
<t3418>I obeyed, and the three of us set off again.</t3418> <t3419>The boy was very grateful; he said that traveling with luggage in such weather was very tiring.</t3419> <t3420>He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him that he had come down the river and landed in the other village that morning, and that now he was going to travel a few miles to see an old friend at a nearby estate.</t3420> <t3421>The boy said:</t3421>
<t3422>—When I saw you, I said to myself: "Surely, it is Mr. Wilks arriving just in time."</t3422> <t3423>But then I said to myself again: "No, I guess not, because he wouldn't be rowing upstream."</t3423> <t3424>It's not you, right?</t3424>
<t3425>—No, my name is Blodgett; Alexander Blodgett; Reverend Alexander Blodgett, I suppose I should say, given that I am one of the Lord's poor servants.</t3425> <t3426>But I can also regret that Mr. Wilks did not arrive on time, if that causes you any inconvenience, although I hope it does not.</t3426>
<t3427>—Well, it's not that he's going to lose his possessions, because those belong to him anyway, but he won't be able to see his brother Peter die, which he might not care about, nobody can know, but his brother would have given anything to see him before dying; in these three weeks he hasn't talked about anything else; he hasn't seen him since they were children and he has never seen his brother William in his life, that is, the deaf-mute one, William, who is only thirty or thirty-five years old.</t3427> <t3428>Peter and George were the only ones who came here; George was the married one; he and his wife died last year.</t3428> <t3429>Now only Harvey and William are left and, as I was saying, they are not going to arrive in time.</t3429>
<t3430>—Has anyone notified them?</t3430>
<t3431>—Ah, yes; one or two months ago, when Peter got sick, because Peter said then that it seemed to him like this time he wasn't going to get better.</t3431> <t3432>You see, he was very old and George's girls were too young to keep him much company, except for Mary Jane, the redhead; so he felt very lonely when George and his wife died, and he didn't seem to have much desire to live.</t3432> <t3433>He was desperate to see Harvey, and in fact also William, because he was one of those who can't stand making a will.</t3433> <t3434>He left a letter for Harvey and said that in it he told him where the money was hidden and how he wanted the rest of the property to be divided so that George's girls would be well taken care of, because George hadn't left anything.</t3434> <t3435>And that letter was the only thing they managed to get him to write.</t3435>
<t3436>—Why do you think Harvey hasn't come? Where does he live?</t3436>
<t3437>—Ah, he lives in England, in Sheffield; he is a preacher and has never returned to this country.</t3437> <t3438>He hasn't had much time, and besides, you know, maybe the letter didn't even reach him.</t3438>
<t3439>—A shame, a shame that he couldn't live to see his brothers, poor thing.</t3439> <t3440>And you say you're going to Orleans?</t3440>
<t3441>—Yes, but that is just the beginning.</t3441> <t3442>Next Wednesday I am taking a boat to Rio de Janeiro, where my uncle lives.</t3442>
<t3443>—It's quite a long trip.</t3443> <t3444>But it will be very nice; I wish I could go.</t3444> <t3445>Is Mary Jane the oldest?</t3445> <t3446>How old are the others?</t3446>
<t3447>—Mary Jane, nineteen years old; Susan, fifteen, and Joanna about fourteen... she's the one who is dedicated to good deeds and has a cleft lip.</t3447>
<t3448>—Poor little things!</t3448> <t3449>To be left alone like this in this cold world...</t3449>
<t3450>—Well, they could be worse off.</t3450> <t3451>Old Peter had friends, and they are not going to let anything happen to them.</t3451> <t3452>There are Hobson, the Baptist preacher, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker and Abner Shackleford and Levi Bell, the lawyer, and Doctor Robinson and their wives, and Widow Bartley and... well, lots of them; but those were Peter's closest friends and the ones he sometimes talked about when he wrote home.</t3452> <t3453>So Harvey will know where to look for friends when he arrives.</t3453>
<t3454>Well, the old man kept asking questions until he practically got everything out of the boy.</t3454> <t3455>Darned if he didn't ask about everyone and everything in that poor town, everything related to the Wilks and what Peter's business was, which was tanning; and George's, which was carpentry; and Harvey's, who was a pastor of a dissenting church, etcetera, etcetera.</t3455> <t3456>Then he said:</t3456>
<t3457>—Why did you want to walk all the way to the steamboat?</t3457>
<t3458>—Because it's one of the big boats from Orleans and I was afraid it wouldn't stop there.</t3458> <t3459>The big ones don't stop when they're called.</t3459> <t3460>The ones from Cincinnati do, but this one is from Saint Louis.</t3460>
<t3461>—Was Peter Wilks rich?</t3461>
<t3462>—Ah, yes, quite wealthy.</t3462> <t3463>He had houses and lands, and it is estimated that he left three or four thousand dollars in cash hidden somewhere.</t3463>
<t3464>—When did you say he had died?</t3464>
<t3465>—I didn't say it, but it was last night.</t3465>
<t3466>—Then the funeral will be tomorrow.</t3466>
<t3467>—Yes, around noon.</t3467>
<t3468>—Well, it's all very sad, but we all have to leave at one time or another.</t3468> <t3469>So what we have to do is be prepared and then peace will be with us.</t3469>
<t3470>—Yes, sir, it is the best.</t3470> <t3471>My mother always said the same.</t3471>
<t3472>When we arrived at the ship, it had almost finished loading and immediately set sail.</t3472> <t3473>The king didn't say anything about boarding, so after all, I missed out on the trip.</t3473> <t3474>When the ship had been gone for a while, the king made me row another mile upstream to a solitary spot, then he got off to the shore and said:</t3474>
<t3475>—Now run back and bring the duke with the new canvas suitcases.</t3475> <t3476>And if he has gone to the other side, go there to find him.</t3476> <t3477>Tell him to get ready to come no matter what happens.</t3477> <t3478>Come on, go.</t3478>
<t3479>I understood what he was preparing, but naturally, I didn't say anything.</t3479> <t3480>When I returned with the duke, we hid the canoe and they sat on a log and the king told him everything, just as he had told the young man: down to the last word.</t3480> <t3481>And all the time trying to speak like an Englishman, and he did it quite well, for a vagabond.</t3481> <t3482>I can't imitate it, so I'm not going to try, but he really did it very well.</t3482> <t3483>Then he said:</t3483>
<t3484>—How's your deaf-mute act going, Aguassucias?</t3484>
<t3485>The duke said that he could be trusted.</t3485> <t3486>He said that he had played the role of a deaf-mute on stage.</t3486> <t3487>So they waited for a steamboat to arrive.</t3487>
<t3488>Towards the first hour of the afternoon, two boats appeared, but they did not come from too far upstream; finally, a large one appeared and they called it.</t3488> <t3489>They sent the yawl and we boarded; it was from Cincinnati, and when they found out that we only wanted to travel four or five miles, they got furious and cursed us and said they would not disembark us.</t3489> <t3490>But the king said very calmly:</t3490>
<t3491>—If the gentlemen can afford a dollar per mile each to be taken up and down in a skiff, then a steamboat can afford to transport them, can't it?</t3491>
<t3492>So they softened and said fine, and when we got to the town they took us to the riverbank in the skiff.</t3492> <t3493>When they saw it arrive, about two dozen men came down to see it, and when the king said:</t3493>
<t3494>—Can any of you gentlemen tell me where Mr. Peter Wilks lives? —they looked at each other, nodding their heads, as if saying: "What did I tell you?"</t3494> <t3495>Then one of them says, in a very kind voice:</t3495>
<t3496>—I'm sorry, sir, but the most we can do is tell you where he lived until last night.</t3496>
<t3497>In the blink of an eye, the old rascal began to tremble, let himself fall against the man, resting his chin on his shoulder and crying on his back, and said:</t3497>
<t3498>—Oh, oh, our poor brother... He is gone and we never got to see him!</t3498> <t3499>Oh, this is too much, too much!</t3499>
<t3500>And he turns around whining and makes a series of idiotic signals to the duke with his hands, and I'll be hanged if the duke didn't drop one of the suitcases and start crying.</t3500> <t3501>They truly were the most sinister pair of swindlers I have ever seen in my life.</t3501>
<t3502>Well, the men formed a group and offered their condolences, they said all kinds of things and carried their suitcases up the hill and let them lean on them and cry, and when they told the king all the details of his brother's last moments, he recounted everything with his hands to the duke and the two of them cried for that dead tanner as if they had lost the twelve disciples.</t3502> <t3503>Well, if I ever come across something like that again, then I am a black man.</t3503> <t3504>That was enough to feel ashamed of the human race.</t3504>
<t3505>Chapter 25</t3505>
<t3506>The NEWS spread throughout the town in two minutes and people could be seen arriving running from all directions, some putting on their jackets.</t3506> <t3507>Soon we found ourselves in the middle of a crowd and the sound of footsteps was like that of a marching regiment.</t3507> <t3508>The windows and doors were full, and every minute someone would ask, over a fence:</t3508>
<t3509>—Is it them?</t3509>
<t3510>And someone who was trotting along with the group replied:</t3510>
<t3511>—I bet so.</t3511>
<t3512>When we arrived at the house, the street was full of people and at the door were the three girls.</t3512> <t3513>Mary Jane was a redhead, but that doesn't matter: she was the prettiest, and her face and eyes were glowing with joy at seeing her uncles arrive.</t3513> <t3514>The king opened his arms and Mary Jane jumped into them, and the one with the cleft lip threw herself into the duke's, and what a scene it was!</t3514> <t3515>Almost everyone, at least the women, burst into tears of joy at seeing them reunited again at last, and everyone so happy.</t3515>
<t3516>Then the king made a private signal to the duke (I saw it) and looked around to see the coffin, placed in a corner on two chairs; then he and the duke, each with one hand on the other's shoulder and the other on their eyes, approached slowly and solemnly, and everyone stepped back to make room for them and stopped talking and making noise while you could hear "shhh!" and all the men took off their hats and bowed their heads, so you could have heard a pin drop.</t3516> <t3517>And when they arrived, they leaned over and looked at the coffin, and at the first glance, they started crying so loudly that they could have been heard all the way to Orleans, or almost, and then they threw their arms around each other's necks, resting their chins on each other's shoulders, and for three minutes, or maybe four, I have never seen two men sob like those two.</t3517> <t3518>And, mind you, everyone else did the same, and the place started to ooze with moisture like I had never seen before.</t3518> <t3519>Then one of them stood on one side of the coffin and the other on the other side, and they knelt and rested their foreheads on the coffin and started to pretend to pray silently.</t3519> <t3520>Well, when that happened, people got more emotional than I have ever seen in my life, everyone broke into tears and continued crying out loud; the poor girls too, and almost all the women went to them, without saying a word, and kissed them very solemnly on the forehead, and then placed their hands on their heads looking up to the sky, all full of tears, and left sobbing and staggering to make way for others.</t3520> <t3521>I have never seen anything so disgusting.</t3521>
<t3522>Well, after a while the king gets up, steps forward a bit, gathers his strength, and starts delivering a trembling speech, all full of tears and nonsense, saying how hard it is for him and his poor brother to lose the deceased, and not having managed to see him alive after a long journey of four thousand miles, but it is a trial that is softened and sanctified by this great solidarity and by these sacred tears, so he thanks them from the bottom of his heart, his and his brother's, because they cannot with their mouths, because words are too weak and cold, and all that kind of nonsense and foolishness, until it becomes stomach-churning, and then he whimpers a pious amen, amen, Lord, and lets himself go and starts crying like a madman again.</t3522>
<t3523>And at the moment he let that out, someone in the group started singing the Gloria Patri, and everyone joined in with all their might, in such a way that it was very comforting and one felt like being in church.</t3523> <t3524>Music is such a good thing that after all those foolishness and lies, I have never seen anything that cleansed the atmosphere more and sounded more honest and more lively.</t3524>
<t3525>Then the king started flapping his gums again, saying that he and his nieces would celebrate by having some of the family's closest friends dine with them that night and help keep vigil over the deceased. He said that if his poor brother lying there could speak, he knows who he would mention, because they were names very dear to him and often mentioned in his letters, so he will name them himself, that is, the following: Reverend Mr. Hobson and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and Dr. Robinson and their wives, and the widow Bartley.</t3525>
<t3526>The Reverend Hobson and Doctor Robinson were at the other end of the town, hunting together; that is to say, I mean that the doctor was sending a sick person to the other world and the preacher was teaching him the straightest path to get there.</t3526> <t3527>The lawyer Bell was in Louisville on business.</t3527> <t3528>But the others were all there, so they came to shake the king's hand and thanked him and talked with him, and then they shook the duke's hand and said nothing, but just stood there smiling and nodding like a bunch of idiots while he made all kinds of hand signs and said, "Goo-goo-goo-goo" all the time, like a baby who doesn't know how to talk.</t3528>
<t3529>So the king kept on chattering and managed to ask practically about all the people and even the dogs in the village; he knew everyone's names, and mentioned all sorts of things that had happened at one time or another in the village or to George's family or Peter's.</t3529> <t3530>And he always suggested that Peter had told him in his letters, but it was a lie; he had gotten everything out of that poor idiot we went canoeing with to the steamboat.</t3530>
<t3531>Then Mary Jane brought the letter that her father had left, and the king read it aloud and began to cry with her.</t3531> <t3532>He left the house and three thousand dollars in gold to the girls, and the tannery (which was a good business), along with other houses and lands (worth about seven thousand) and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey and William, and he said where the six thousand dollars in coins were hidden in the basement.</t3532> <t3533>So the two swindlers said they were going to look for it to make everything clear and sent me to go with a candle.</t3533> <t3534>We closed the basement door as we entered, and when they found the bag, they opened it on the floor and it was a wonderful sight to see so much gold together: How the king's eyes sparkled!</t3534> <t3535>He gives the duke a pat on the shoulder and says:</t3535>
<t3536>—This is really worth it! Oh, yes, of course it is! Well, Biljy, it's better than the Peerless, isn't it?</t3536>
<t3537>The duke acknowledged that he did.</t3537> <t3538>They caressed the coins and let them slip through their fingers and clink on the ground, and the king says:</t3538>
<t3539>—There's no need to overthink it; what suits you and me, Aguassucias, is to be the siblings of a rich dead man and representatives of the only remaining foreign heirs.</t3539> <t3540>We owe this to Providence.</t3540> <t3541>In the long run, it's best to trust in it.</t3541> <t3542>I've tried everything, and there's no better solution.</t3542>
<t3543>Almost anyone would have been satisfied with that pile and would have trusted the count, but no, they had to count it.</t3543> <t3544>So they count it and it turns out that four hundred fifteen dollars are missing.</t3544> <t3545>And then the king says:</t3545>
<t3546>—Damn it, what could he have done with those four hundred fifteen dollars?</t3546>
<t3547>They stayed thinking about it for a while, looking for an explanation.</t3547> <t3548>Then the duke says:</t3548>
<t3549>—Well, he was quite sick and probably made a mistake...</t3549> <t3550>I guess that's what happened.</t3550> <t3551>The best thing is to leave it and say nothing.</t3551> <t3552>We don't need it.</t3552>
<t3553>—Ah, of course, yes, we don't need it.</t3553> <t3554>That doesn't matter to me.</t3554> <t3555>What I'm thinking about is the account.</t3555> <t3556>In this case, we have to act very clearly, you know.</t3556> <t3557>What we need is to take this money upstairs and count it in front of everyone so they can't suspect anything.</t3557> <t3558>But when the dead man says there are six thousand dollars, you know it's not convenient for us...</t3558>
<t3559>—One moment —says the duke—.</t3559> <t3560>We can add what is missing —and he begins to take gold coins out of his pocket.</t3560>
<t3561>—That idea is most astute, Duke...</t3561> <t3562>You have a very good head on your shoulders —says the king—.</t3562> <t3563>Blessed be the Peerless One who helps us once again —and he starts pulling gold coins out of his pocket and piling them up.</t3563>
<t3564>They almost ran out of money, but they reached exactly six thousand dollars.</t3564>
<t3565>—Hey —says the duke—, I have another idea.</t3565> <t3566>Let's go upstairs, count the money, and then give it to the girls.</t3566>
<t3567>—For God's sake, Duke, let me give you a hug!</t3567> <t3568>It's the most brilliant idea in the world.</t3568> <t3569>Of course, you have a very good head on your shoulders.</t3569> <t3570>Now let them suspect whatever they want... That way they'll be convinced.</t3570>
<t3571>When we went up, everyone gathered around the table and the king counted it and piled it up, three hundred dollars per pile: twenty very elegant little piles.</t3571> <t3572>Everyone looked at them with envy, licking their lips.</t3572> <t3573>Then they put everything back in the bag and I saw that the king was starting to puff up to give another speech.</t3573> <t3574>He goes and says:</t3574>
<t3575>—Friends all, my poor brother who lies there has been generous with those of us left behind in this valley of tears.</t3575> <t3576>He has been generous with these little lambs that he loved and protected and who now are left without father or mother.</t3576> <t3577>Yes, and those of us who knew him know that he would have been more generous with them had he not feared hurting his dear William and me.</t3577> <t3578>Isn't that right?</t3578> <t3579>I have no doubt.</t3579> <t3580>Well then, what kind of brothers would oppose his will at a time like this?</t3580> <t3581>And what kind of uncles would steal, yes, steal, from poor little lambs like these, whom he loved so much, at a time like this?</t3581> <t3582>If I know William, and I think I do... he... well, I'm going to ask him.</t3582>
<t3583>And he turns around and starts making a bunch of signals to the duke with his hands, and the duke watches him with a stupid and expressionless look for a while, and then suddenly seems to understand what he's saying and jumps on the king, saying "goo-goo" with all his might out of joy and gives him about fifteen hugs before letting him go.</t3583> <t3584>Then, the king goes and says:</t3584>
<t3585>—I already knew it; I reckon this will convince everyone of what he thinks.</t3585> <t3586>Come on, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanna, take the money... take it all.</t3586> <t3587>It is the gift of the one who lies there, cold but content.</t3587>
<t3588>Mary Jane threw herself at him and Susan and the one with the cleft lip at the duke, and they started giving them such kisses and hugs as I have never seen.</t3588> <t3589>And everyone crowded around with tears in their eyes, shaking hands with those swindlers, saying all the time:</t3589>
<t3590>—Kind souls!</t3590> <t3591>How good you are!</t3591> <t3592>How could you!</t3592>
<t3593>Well, soon everyone started talking about the deceased again and how good he was and what a great loss he represented and all that, and a little later a big man with a square jaw arrived who stood listening and watching without saying anything, and no one said anything to him either, because the king was speaking and everyone was busy listening.</t3593> <t3594>The king continued speaking, in the middle of something he had already started:</t3594>
<t3595>—... friends, especially of the deceased.</t3595> <t3596>That is why you are invited here this afternoon, but the truth is we want everyone to come... everyone; for he respected everyone, loved everyone, and that is why it is fitting that his funeral orgies be public.</t3596>
<t3597>And he kept saying stupid things because he liked to hear himself talk.</t3597> <t3598>And every now and then he would bring up the funeral orgies again, until the duke couldn't take it anymore and wrote on a small piece of paper: "Funerals, you old idiot," folded it, made a "coo-coo" sound, and passed it over everyone's heads.</t3598> <t3599>The king read it, put it in his pocket, and said:</t3599>
<t3600>—Poor William, despite his affliction, his heart always gets it right.</t3600> <t3601>He asks me to invite everyone to come to the funeral... he wants me to welcome everyone.</t3601> <t3602>But he doesn't need to worry, that was exactly what I was doing.</t3602>
<t3603>And then he continued with his speech, so calmly, and he goes on to talk about his funeral orgies over and over again, exactly the same as before.</t3603> <t3604>By the third time he says:</t3604>
<t3605>—I say orgies, not because it is the vulgar term, which it is not, the vulgar term is obsequies, but because orgies is the exact term.</t3605> <t3606>In England, we no longer say obsequies...</t3606> <t3607>That word has fallen into disuse.</t3607> <t3608>In England, we now say orgies.</t3608> <t3609>Orgies is better because it more accurately signifies what one wants to say.</t3609> <t3610>It is a compound word from the Greek orgo, outside, open, in the open air, and the Hebrew geesum, to plant, to cover; hence, to bury.</t3610> <t3611>So, as you can see, funeral orgies are a public, ahem, open funeral.</t3611>
<t3612>It was the most shameless thing I had ever seen.</t3612> <t3613>Well, the guy with the square jaw laughed in his face.</t3613> <t3614>Everyone was scandalized.</t3614> <t3615>Everyone said, "But, man, doctor!" and Abner Shackleford said:</t3615>
<t3616>—But, Robinson, haven't you heard the news?</t3616> <t3617>This is Harvey Wilks.</t3617>
<t3618>The king grinned from ear to ear, extended his hoof, and said:</t3618>
<t3619>—Is it the dear friend and doctor of my poor brother?</t3619> <t3620>I...</t3620>
<t3621>—Don't touch me! —replied the doctor—.</t3621> <t3622>You pretend to speak like an Englishman, don't you?</t3622> <t3623>It's the worst imitation I've heard in my life.</t3623> <t3624>You, the brother of Peter Wilks?</t3624> <t3625>You are a fraud, that's what you are!</t3625>
<t3626>Well, what a commotion it caused!</t3626> <t3627>They gathered around the doctor and tried to calm him down by explaining everything and telling him that Harvey had proven in forty different ways that he was Harvey and knew everyone by name, even the names of the dogs, and they begged him over and over not to hurt Harvey's feelings or those of the poor girls and all that.</t3627> <t3628>But it was all in vain; he kept shouting and saying that if someone claimed to be English and couldn't mimic the way the English spoke better than that, it was because he was a fraud and a liar.</t3628> <t3629>The poor girls clung to the king and cried, and suddenly the doctor turned on them.</t3629> <t3630>He went and said:</t3630>
<t3631>—I was a friend of your father and I am your friend, and I warn you as a friend, and an honest friend who wants to protect you and save you from troubles and sufferings, to turn your back on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him, with that ignorant vagabond, with those idiocies of Greek and Hebrew, he says.</t3631> <t3632>He is the most obvious impostor: he has come here with a bunch of empty names and data that he has obtained somewhere, and you believe they are proofs.</t3632> <t3633>And those foolish friends who should be more intelligent help you deceive yourselves.</t3633> <t3634>Mary Jane Wilks, you know that I am your friend, and that I am not a selfish friend.</t3634> <t3635>Now listen to me; kick this unscrupulous scoundrel out...</t3635> <t3636>I beg you to do it.</t3636> <t3637>Are you willing?</t3637>
<t3638>Mary Jane straightened up and, wow, how beautiful she was!, she responded:</t3638>
<t3639>—This is my answer —she grabbed the money bag, put it in the king's hands, and said—:</t3639> <t3640>Take these six thousand dollars and invest them for me and my sisters as you wish, and we don't need you to give us any receipt.</t3640>
<t3641>Then she took the king by one arm, and Susan and the girl with the cleft lip did the same with the other.</t3641> <t3642>Everyone applauded and stomped on the ground, with a noise like a storm, while the king lifted his head with an arrogant smile.</t3642> <t3643>The doctor said:</t3643>
<t3644>—Very well; I wash my hands of this.</t3644> <t3645>But I warn you that the time will come when you will feel bad every time you remember this day —and he left.</t3645>
<t3646>—Very well, doctor —said the king, as if mocking him—; then someone will go fetch you —at which everyone laughed a lot and said it was very clever.</t3646>
<t3647>Chapter 26</t3647>
<t3648>WELL, when everyone had left, the king asked Mary Jane if there was a free room, and she told him that she had one that would do for Uncle William, and that she would give hers to Uncle Harvey, who was a bit taller, because she would go to her sisters' room to sleep on a Turkish bed, and that there was a small room with a mattress in the attic.</t3648> <t3649>The king said that the mattress would be enough for his valet, meaning me.</t3649>
<t3650>So Mary Jane made us go up and showed us her rooms, which were simple but pleasant.</t3650> <t3651>She said she would have her dresses and other things removed from her room if they bothered Uncle Harvey, but he said no.</t3651> <t3652>The dresses were hung next to a wall, covered by a calico curtain that reached the floor.</t3652> <t3653>In one corner there was an old hair trunk, and in another, a guitar case; the rest was filled with decorations and those things that girls like to use to brighten up a room.</t3653> <t3654>The king said it was much more homely and pleasant with those decorations, so there was no need to change them.</t3654> <t3655>The duke's room was very small, but more than sufficient, just like my cubicle.</t3655>
<t3656>That night they held a great dinner where all the men and women were present; I stayed behind the chairs of the king and the duke to serve them, and the black servants took care of everyone else.</t3656> <t3657>Mary Jane sat at the head of the table, with Susan beside her, commenting on how bad the buns were and how poor the preserves were and how ordinary and tough the fried chickens were, and all that kind of nonsense, as women always do in search of compliments, but people knew everything was magnificent and told her: "How do you get the buns so toasty and so good?" and "Where did you get these wonderful pickles?" and all that nonsense people say just to say at dinners, you know.</t3657>
<t3658>And when it was all over, the girl with the cleft lip and I ate the leftovers in the kitchen, while the others helped the black people clean up.</t3658> <t3659>The girl with the cleft lip started asking me things about England, and hang me if it didn’t seem like things were getting difficult at times.</t3659> <t3660>She goes and says:</t3660>
<t3661>—Have you ever seen the king?</t3661>
<t3662>—To whom? To William IV?</t3662> <t3663>Man, of course: he goes to our church.</t3663> <t3664>I knew he had died years ago, but I didn't comment.</t3664> <t3665>So when I said he went to our church, she asked:</t3665>
<t3666>—How... is it always going?</t3666>
<t3667>—Yes, always.</t3667> <t3668>He has the pew in front of ours, on the other side of the pulpit.</t3668>
<t3669>—I thought you lived in London.</t3669>
<t3670>—Man, of course.</t3670> <t3671>Where else would I live?</t3671>
<t3672>—But I thought you lived in Sheffield.</t3672>
<t3673>I saw that he had me cornered.</t3673> <t3674>I had to pretend I was choking on a chicken bone to think about how to get out of that situation.</t3674> <t3675>Then I said:</t3675>
<t3676>—I mean that he always goes to our church when he is in Sheffield.</t3676> <t3677>That's only in the summer, when he goes to take sea baths.</t3677>
<t3678>—But what are you saying... Sheffield is not by the sea.</t3678>
<t3679>—Well, and who said yes?</t3679>
<t3680>—Well, you.</t3680>
<t3681>—That's not true.</t3681>
<t3682>—Yes!</t3682>
<t3683>—No.</t3683>
<t3684>—Yes.</t3684>
<t3685>—I haven't said anything like that.</t3685>
<t3686>—Well, then, what did you say?</t3686>
<t3687>—I said I was going to take sea baths; that's what I said.</t3687>
<t3688>—Well, then, how are you going to take sea baths if you're not in the sea?</t3688>
<t3689>—Look —I replied—, have you ever had mineral water?</t3689>
<t3690>—Yes.</t3690>
<t3691>—Well, did you have to go to a mine to look for it?</t3691>
<t3692>—Well, no.</t3692>
<t3693>—Well, then, neither does William IV have to go to the sea to take a sea bath.</t3693>
<t3694>—So, how does he give them to them?</t3694>
<t3695>—He does the same as the people here to drink mineral water: in barrels.</t3695> <t3696>There in the Sheffield palace, they have some very hot ovens and he likes the water to be hot.</t3696> <t3697>You can't boil all the water in the sea.</t3697> <t3698>There aren't enough machines there.</t3698>
<t3699>—Ah, I understand now.</t3699> <t3700>You could have said that to begin with and we would have saved time.</t3700>
<t3701>When he said that, I saw that I had gotten rid of the matter, so I felt more comfortable and happy.</t3701> <t3702>Then he asked:</t3702>
<t3703>—Are you also going to church?</t3703>
<t3704>—Yes, always.</t3704>
<t3705>—Where do you sit?</t3705>
<t3706>—Man, in our bank.</t3706>
<t3707>—Whose bank?</t3707>
<t3708>—Well, ours; your Uncle Harvey's.</t3708>
<t3709>—His? And why does he need a bank?</t3709>
<t3710>—To sit on it.</t3710> <t3711>What did you think I needed it for?</t3711>
<t3712>—Man, I thought he was in the pulpit.</t3712>
<t3713>Damn it, I had forgotten he was a preacher.</t3713> <t3714>I saw that he had caught me again, so I choked up again to think about it, and then I said:</t3714>
<t3715>—Damn, do you think there's only one preacher in a church?</t3715>
<t3716>—But, why do they need more?</t3716>
<t3717>—How! To preach when the king is coming!</t3717> <t3718>I've never seen a girl like that.</t3718> <t3719>They have no less than seventeen.</t3719>
<t3720>—Seventeen! My God!</t3720> <t3721>Well, I wouldn't be able to stand listening to so many, even if I never went to paradise.</t3721> <t3722>It must take them a week.</t3722>
<t3723>—Darn, they don't all preach on the same day: only one of them does.</t3723>
<t3724>—Well, and what does the rest do?</t3724>
<t3725>—Bah, not much.</t3725> <t3726>They walk around, pass the tray, and things like that.</t3726> <t3727>But in general, they don't do anything.</t3727>
<t3728>—Well, then, what are they there for?</t3728>
<t3729>—Man, it's a matter of class.</t3729> <t3730>Don't you know anything?</t3730>
<t3731>—Well, I don't want to know silly things.</t3731> <t3732>How do they treat servants in England?</t3732> <t3733>Do they treat them better than we treat our black people?</t3733>
<t3734>—No!</t3734> <t3735>There, a servant is nothing.</t3735> <t3736>They treat them worse than dogs.</t3736>
<t3737>—Don't they get holidays like we do, for Christmas week, New Year's, and the 4th of July?</t3737>
<t3738>—What things you say!</t3738> <t3739>Just with that, it's clear that you've never been to England.</t3739> <t3740>But, lip...; but, Joanna, they don't even have a single day off a year; they never go to the circus, or the theater, or shows for black people, or anywhere.</t3740>
<t3741>—Not even to church?</t3741>
<t3742>—Not even to the church.</t3742>
<t3743>—But you always go to church.</t3743>
<t3744>Well, he had caught me again.</t3744> <t3745>I had forgotten that I was the old man's servant.</t3745> <t3746>But the next moment, I came up with a sort of explanation that a valet was different from an ordinary servant and had to go to church whether he wanted to or not and sit with the family, because that was what the law said.</t3746> <t3747>But it didn't come out very well, and when I finished, I didn't see her convinced.</t3747> <t3748>She said:</t3748>
<t3749>—The truth, now, haven't you been telling me lies?</t3749>
<t3750>—Really, no —I replied.</t3750>
<t3751>—Not a single one?</t3751>
<t3752>—Not a single one.</t3752> <t3753>I haven't told you a single lie.</t3753>
<t3754>—Put your hand on this book and repeat it.</t3754>
<t3755>I saw that it was nothing more than a dictionary, so I put my hand on it and repeated it.</t3755> <t3756>Then she seemed a bit more convinced and said:</t3756>
<t3757>—Well, then I will believe some of what you have said, but the truth is that I am not going to believe the rest.</t3757>
<t3758>—What is it that you won't believe, Jo? —asked Mary Jane, who entered with Susan behind her—.</t3758> <t3759>It's neither right nor kind to speak to a stranger who is so far from home like that.</t3759> <t3760>How would you feel if you were treated that way?</t3760>
<t3761>—That's what you always say, Maim: you always go to help someone before anything happens to them.</t3761> <t3762>I haven't done anything to him.</t3762> <t3763>I guess he told some exaggerations and I said I wasn't going to swallow all of them, that's all I did.</t3763> <t3764>I suppose he can handle it, right?</t3764>
<t3765>—I don't care if you told him a lot or a little; he is in our house and he is a stranger, and it is not right for you to say those things.</t3765> <t3766>If you were in his place, you would be ashamed, so you shouldn't say things to others that would make them feel ashamed.</t3766>
<t3767>—But, Maim, he said...</t3767>
<t3768>—It doesn't matter what he said; that's not it.</t3768> <t3769>What matters is that you treat him with kindness, and don't go around saying things that remind him he's not in his own country and among his own people.</t3769>
<t3770>I said to myself: "And this is the girl I'm going to let that old reptile steal all her money from!"</t3770> <t3771>Then Susan got involved, and you can believe me, she gave harelip a piece of her mind.</t3771>
<t3772>And I said to myself: "And this is another one I'm going to let get her money stolen!"</t3772>
<t3773>Then Mary Jane moved on to other things and became all charming again, which was her true style.</t3773> <t3774>But when she finished, the poor cleft-lip girl was practically devastated.</t3774> <t3775>So she started to scream.</t3775>
<t3776>—Very well, then —said the other girls—you just have to apologize to him.</t3776>
<t3777>And that's what she did, and she did it very well, so well that it was a pleasure to listen to her, and I wish I could tell her a thousand lies again so she would repeat it once more.</t3777>
<t3778>And I said to myself: "This is another one I'm letting steal my money."</t3778> <t3779>And when it was over, they all started making me feel at home and letting me know I was among friends.</t3779> <t3780>I felt so low and vile that I said to myself: "It's decided; either I get them that money or I burst."</t3780>
<t3781>So I took off; to sleep, I said, without specifying the moment.</t3781> <t3782>When I was left alone, I started thinking things over.</t3782> <t3783>I asked myself: "Am I going to see that doctor, in secret, and betray these scoundrels?</t3783> <t3784>No, that wouldn't turn out well.</t3784> <t3785>He could say who told him and then the king and the duke would take care of me.</t3785> <t3786>Should I go and tell Mary Jane in secret?</t3786> <t3787>No... I don't dare.</t3787> <t3788>She would surely reveal it with some gesture; they already have the money and would take off with it.</t3788> <t3789>If I went looking for help, I would surely find myself caught up in the matter.</t3789> <t3790>No, there's only one way.</t3790> <t3791>I have to steal that money however I can and in a way that they don't suspect me.</t3791> <t3792>They've found a good vein here and they're not going to leave until they've squeezed everything they can out of this family and this town, so I have enough time to find a solution.</t3792> <t3793>I'm going to steal it and hide it and then, when I'm downriver, I'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it's hidden.</t3793> <t3794>But I'd better get it out tonight if I can, because maybe the doctor hasn't given up as he said and he might still scare them and drive them away."</t3794>
<t3795>“So —I thought— I’m going to search their rooms.”</t3795> <t3796>Although the hallway upstairs was dark, I found the duke’s room and started rummaging with my hands, but I remembered that just as the king was, he wouldn’t let anyone but himself handle the money, so I went to his room and started rummaging.</t3796> <t3797>But I saw that I couldn’t do anything without a candle and, naturally, I didn’t dare to light one.</t3797> <t3798>So I thought of doing the other thing: staying put and listening to what they said.</t3798> <t3799>Almost at that moment I heard them coming up and decided to hide under the bed; I went towards it, but it wasn’t where I thought, I touched the curtain behind which Mary Jane’s dresses were, so I jumped behind it, snuggled among the dresses, and stayed there very quietly.</t3799>
<t3800>They entered, closed the door, and the first thing the duke did was to bend down to look under the bed.</t3800> <t3801>Then I was glad I hadn't found it when I was looking for it.</t3801> <t3802>And that, you know, it seems natural to hide under the bed when you don't want to be found.</t3802> <t3803>Then they sat down and the king says:</t3803>
<t3804>—Well, what's going on? And don't go on too long, because it's better if we get up really early in the morning so they don't have a chance to talk about us.</t3804>
<t3805>—Well, it's about the following, Capeto.</t3805> <t3806>It's not easy; I don't feel at ease.</t3806> <t3807>I can't forget about that doctor.</t3807> <t3808>I wanted to know what plans you had.</t3808> <t3809>I have an idea and I think it's good.</t3809>
<t3810>—What is it, Duke?</t3810>
<t3811>—We better get out of here before three in the morning and head down to the river with what we already have.</t3811> <t3812>Especially since we got it so easily that it was practically given to us, you could say it was forced upon us, when we thought we would have to steal it again.</t3812> <t3813>I think it's best if we leave as soon as possible.</t3813>
<t3814>That made me feel quite bad.</t3814> <t3815>An hour or two earlier it would have been something different, but now it made me feel bad and disenchanted.</t3815> <t3816>The king lets out a shout and says:</t3816>
<t3817>—What! And not sell the rest of the inheritance?</t3817> <t3818>Leave like a couple of idiots and leave eight or nine thousand dollars in land waiting for someone to take it?; when everything can be sold in a moment!</t3818>
<t3819>The duke started to grumble, said that the bag of gold was enough and that he didn't want to get into more trouble; that he didn't want to rob some orphans of everything they had.</t3819>
<t3820>—What things you say! —replied the king—.</t3820> <t3821>We are only going to steal this money from them.</t3821> <t3822>Those who buy these properties will lose out, because as soon as it is discovered that they were not ours, which will be shortly after we have left, the sale will not be valid and everything will return to the estate.</t3822> <t3823>These orphans will get their house back again, and that is enough for them; they are young and strong, and they can easily earn a living.</t3823> <t3824>They are not going to lose anything.</t3824> <t3825>But, man, think about it; there are thousands and thousands of people who don't have even half.</t3825> <t3826>I assure you that they have no reason to complain.</t3826>
<t3827>The king gave him so many arguments that he eventually gave in and said fine, but he thought it was stupid to stay there, with that doctor suspecting them.</t3827> <t3828>But the king says:</t3828>
<t3829>—To hell with the doctor! What do we care about him?</t3829> <t3830>Don't we have all the fools in the town on our side?</t3830> <t3831>And isn't that a sufficient majority in any town?</t3831>
<t3832>So they prepared to go back down.</t3832> <t3833>The duke says:</t3833>
<t3834>—I don't think we left the money in a good place.</t3834>
<t3835>That encouraged me.</t3835> <t3836>I had started to think that they wouldn't give me a single clue that would help me.</t3836> <t3837>The king says:</t3837>
<t3838>—Why?</t3838>
<t3839>—Because from now on Mary Jane will be in mourning and the first thing she will do is tell the black man to clean the rooms, to put those clothes in a box and take them away; and, do you think that a black man is going to find the money and not borrow something?</t3839>
<t3840>—You have your head screwed on right again, Duke —says the king.</t3840>
<t3841>He started looking under the curtain two or three feet from where I was.</t3841> <t3842>I pressed myself against the wall without making any noise, although I was trembling, and I wondered what those guys would say if they caught me, trying to think about what I would have to do then.</t3842> <t3843>But the king found the bag before I could come up with even half an idea, and it was never suspected that I was around there.</t3843> <t3844>They grabbed the bag and put it through a tear in the straw mattress, under the feather mattress, and left it tucked about a foot or two between the straw and said it was fine because the blacks only make the feather mattress and only turn the straw mattress once or twice a year, so now there was no danger of it being stolen.</t3844>
<t3845>But they didn't count on me.</t3845> <t3846>I took it out before they had reached the bottom of the stairs.</t3846> <t3847>I groped my way to my cubicle and hid it there until I could think of something better.</t3847> <t3848>I thought it would be better to hide it somewhere outside the house, because if they missed it, they would search the house thoroughly; I was convinced of that.</t3848> <t3849>Then I went to bed with all my clothes on, but I couldn't fall asleep even if I wanted to, because I was so eager to finish with the whole matter.</t3849> <t3850>After a while, I heard the king and the duke coming up, so I got off the cot and rested my chin on the last step of the stairs to see if anything would happen.</t3850> <t3851>But nothing happened.</t3851>
<t3852>That's how I stayed until the last noises stopped being heard and the first ones hadn't started yet, and then I went down the stairs in silence.</t3852>
<t3853>Chapter 27</t3853>
<t3854>I WENT IN SILENCE to their doors to listen; they were snoring.</t3854> <t3855>So I tiptoed on and went down the stairs.</t3855> <t3856>There wasn't a sound anywhere.</t3856> <t3857>I looked through a crack in the dining room door and saw the men watching over the corpse, all asleep in their chairs.</t3857> <t3858>The door led to the room where the body was, and there was a candle in each room.</t3858> <t3859>I went on to the door of the room, which was open, but I saw that there was no one there except Peter's remains, so I continued: the main door was closed, and the key was nowhere to be seen.</t3859> <t3860>Just then I heard someone coming down the stairs behind me.</t3860> <t3861>I ran to the room, looked quickly around, and the only place I saw to hide the bag was in the coffin.</t3861> <t3862>The lid was ajar by about a foot, exposing the dead man's face with a damp cloth over it and the shroud.</t3862> <t3863>I slipped the money bag under the lid, just beyond where his crossed hands were, which gave me the creeps; they were icy cold, and then I ran back across the room and hid behind the door.</t3863>
<t3864>The one who entered was Mary Jane.</t3864> <t3865>She went to the coffin, walking slowly, knelt down and looked inside; then she took out her handkerchief and I saw that she started to cry, although I couldn't hear her and she had her back to me.</t3865> <t3866>I came out of my hiding place and as I passed by the dining room I thought of making sure that those at the wake hadn't seen me, so I looked through a crack and everything was in order.</t3866> <t3867>They hadn't even moved.</t3867>
<t3868>I went to bed, quite sad, because of how things were turning out after I had worried so much and taken so many risks.</t3868> <t3869>I said to myself: "If it could stay where it is, very well; because when we get to the river, a hundred or two hundred miles away, I could write to Mary Jane and she could dig it up and take it out, but that's not what's going to happen; what's going to happen is that they'll find the money when they go to close the lid.</t3869> <t3870>Then the king will get it again and won't give anyone else a chance to steal it."</t3870> <t3871>Naturally, I wanted to go down and take it out of there, but I didn't dare try.</t3871> <t3872>Every minute dawn was approaching and very soon some of the people from the wake would start moving and maybe catch me with six thousand dollars in my hands when no one had entrusted me with the money.</t3872> <t3873>"Damn the need for me to get involved in something like this," I said to myself.</t3873>
<t3874>When I came down in the morning, the living room was closed and the people from the wake had left.</t3874> <t3875>There was no one left but the family, the widow Bartley, and our tribe.</t3875> <t3876>I looked at their faces to see if anything had happened, but I couldn't see anything.</t3876>
<t3877>By midday, the gravedigger arrived with his assistant and placed the coffin in the middle of the living room, supported by a couple of chairs; then they arranged all our chairs in rows and borrowed more from the neighbors until the foyer, the dining room, and the living room were full.</t3877> <t3878>I saw that the coffin lid was the same as before, but I didn't dare to look at what was underneath it, with so many people in front.</t3878>
<t3879>Then people and authorities began to arrive, and the girls took seats in the front row, next to the head of the coffin, and for half an hour people filed past, each taking a moment to look at the face of the deceased, and some shed a tear, all very quietly and solemnly, and the girls and the authorities were the only ones who brought handkerchiefs to their eyes, kept their heads down, and whimpered a little.</t3879> <t3880>No other noise was heard, except for the shuffling of feet on the floor and the sound of noses blowing, because people always blow their noses more at a funeral than anywhere else, except in church.</t3880>
<t3881>When the house was full, the undertaker walked around everywhere with his black gloves and his soft and soothing manners, adding the final touches, putting everything in order, and making people feel comfortable, without making any noise, like a cat.</t3881> <t3882>He didn't say a word; he moved people around, found places for the last arrivals, opened pathways, all with gestures of his head and hands.</t3882> <t3883>Then he took his place leaning against the wall.</t3883> <t3884>He was the softest, slipperiest, and most unctuous man I have ever seen in my life; and he never smiled, he was like a piece of meat.</t3884>
<t3885>They had borrowed a harmonium that was in pretty bad shape; when everything was ready, a young woman sat at it and started to play, but it only produced squeaks and wheezes, and everyone started to sing.</t3885> <t3886>Peter was the only one who seemed to enjoy himself, as it appeared to me.</t3886> <t3887>Then it was Reverend Hobson's turn, who began to speak slowly and solemnly, and immediately the most horrible noise imaginable was heard from the basement: it was just a dog, but it was making a fearful racket and wouldn't stop; the priest had to stand there beside the coffin and wait: nothing else could be heard.</t3887> <t3888>It was truly terrible, and it seemed that no one knew what to do.</t3888> <t3889>But then they saw that the tall undertaker was signaling to the priest as if to say, "Don't worry; I'm here."</t3889> <t3890>Then he bent down and started to slide along the wall; only his shoulders could be seen above the heads of the people.</t3890> <t3891>So he kept sliding, with that racket growing more and more horrible, and finally, after he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappeared into the basement.</t3891> <t3892>Then, after about two seconds, we heard a thud and the dog ended with one or two of the strangest barks, and then everyone fell silent and the priest resumed his solemn talk from where he had left off.</t3892> <t3893>After a minute or two, the back and shoulders of the undertaker reappeared, sliding along the wall again, and he continued sliding around three sides of the room; then he stood up, cupped his hands around his mouth, and, stretching his neck towards the priest, said in a sort of hoarse whisper, over the heads of the people: "It had a rat!"</t3893> <t3894>Then he slid back along the wall to return to his place.</t3894> <t3895>It was clear that this was very satisfactory to the people, because naturally they wanted to know what it was about.</t3895> <t3896>These little things cost nothing and are what earn a man admiration and respect.</t3896> <t3897>There was no one more popular in the whole town than that undertaker.</t3897>
<t3898>Well, the funeral sermon turned out very well, but horribly long and tiring; then the king got up and spouted some of his usual nonsense, and finally the affair ended and the undertaker approached the coffin with his screwdriver.</t3898> <t3899>I started sweating and watched him very closely.</t3899> <t3900>But he didn't see anything, he just slid the lid, smooth as if it were greased, and screwed it down tight.</t3900> <t3901>That's how we were!</t3901> <t3902>I didn't know if the money was in there or not.</t3902> <t3903>Then I said to myself: "What if someone has secretly taken the bag?</t3903> <t3904>How do I know whether to write to Mary Jane or not?</t3904> <t3905>And if he digs it up and finds nothing, what will he think of me?</t3905> <t3906>Darn it," I said to myself, "they might as well look for me and lock me up: I'd better keep my mouth shut and not write anything; now everything is a mess and by trying to improve it I've made it a hundred times worse than before; I wish I had left everything alone.</t3906> <t3907>Damn the whole affair!</t3907>
<t3908>They buried him, we returned home, and I went back to looking at everyone's faces; I couldn't help it nor could I stay calm.</t3908> <t3909>But nothing happened; the faces told me nothing.</t3909>
<t3910>The king was seeing a lot of people that afternoon, reassuring everyone, very friendly, and he made them understand that in England his parishioners would be worried about him, so he had to hurry and immediately resolve the inheritance issue before leaving.</t3910> <t3911>He regretted very much having to rush, and the same was true for the others; they wanted him to stay longer, but they said they understood that it was impossible.</t3911> <t3912>And he said that naturally William and he would take the girls home with them, which also pleased everyone a lot, because then the girls would be well protected and among their own relatives, and it also pleased the girls; they liked it so much that they practically forgot they had any problems in the world and told him to sell everything whenever he wanted, that they were ready.</t3912> <t3913>The poor girls were so happy and content that it broke my heart to see how they were being deceived and lied to so much, but I couldn't see a safe way to intervene and change the general state of things.</t3913>
<t3914>Well, damned if the king didn't immediately put the house and the slaves and all the lands up for auction immediately, two days after the funeral; but anyone who wanted to could buy privately before if they wanted.</t3914>
<t3915>So the day after the funeral, around noon, the girls got their first surprise.</t3915> <t3916>A pair of slave traders appeared, and the king sold the black people to them at a reasonable price, with three-day promissory notes, according to what they said, and they took them away: the two sons upriver to Memphis, and their mother downriver to Orleans.</t3916> <t3917>I thought those poor girls and the black people were going to have their hearts broken with grief; they cried together and were so sad that it almost made me sick to see it.</t3917> <t3918>The girls said they had never dreamed of seeing that family separated or sold far from town.</t3918> <t3919>I will never be able to erase from my memory the vision of those poor girls and the black people so sad, hugging and crying; I think I wouldn't have been able to bear it and would have burst and betrayed our gang if I hadn't known that the sale was invalid and that the black people would be back home within a week or two.</t3919>
<t3920>That also attracted a lot of attention in the village, and many came running to say that it was a scandal to separate the mother and children like that.</t3920> <t3921>The impostors took it badly, but the old man insisted on moving forward, despite what the duke might say or do, and I assure you that the duke felt very uncomfortable.</t3921>
<t3922>The next day was the day of the auction.</t3922> <t3923>Well into the morning, the king and the duke went up to the attic to wake me up, and from their expressions, I could see there was trouble.</t3923> <t3924>The king goes and says:</t3924>
<t3925>—Were you in my room the night before last?</t3925>
<t3926>—No, your majesty —which is how I always addressed him when there were only people from our group present.</t3926>
<t3927>—Were you there yesterday or last night?</t3927>
<t3928>—No, your majesty.</t3928>
<t3929>—Your word of honor; without lying.</t3929>
<t3930>—My word of honor, your majesty.</t3930> <t3931>I am telling you the truth.</t3931> <t3932>I have not been near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you there with the duke to show it to you.</t3932>
<t3933>The duke goes and says:</t3933>
<t3934>—Have you seen anyone else enter it?</t3934>
<t3935>—No, your grace, not that I remember, I think.</t3935>
<t3936>—Think about it calmly.</t3936>
<t3937>I was thinking about it for a moment and seeing my opportunity, I said:</t3937>
<t3938>—Well, I've seen the black people go in there several times.</t3938> <t3939>The two of them gave a little jump, as if they had never expected it, and then as if it seemed like they had.</t3939> <t3940>Then the duke goes and says:</t3940>
<t3941>—How, all of them?</t3941>
<t3942>—No, I mean, at least not all at once; I think I never saw them leave together, except for once.</t3942>
<t3943>—Wow! When was that?</t3943>
<t3944>The day of the funeral, in the morning.</t3944> <t3945>It wasn't early because I slept in late.</t3945> <t3946>I was starting to go down the stairs when I saw them.</t3946>
<t3947>—Well, go on, go on! What did they do? What happened next?</t3947>
<t3948>—They did nothing.</t3948> <t3949>And nothing special happened either, that I could see.</t3949> <t3950>They tiptoed away; so I saw very well that they had gone to prepare your majesty's room, or something like that, if you had already gotten up, and upon seeing that you hadn't gotten up, they hoped to disappear and avoid getting into trouble instead of waking you up, if they hadn't already woken you up.</t3950>
<t3951>—Devil, this one is really good! —says the king, and the two of them were left with a desperate and rather silly expression.</t3951> <t3952>They stayed there thinking and scratching their heads, and the duke let out a sort of rasping chuckle and said:</t3952>
<t3953>—It's fabulous how those blacks have played their hand.</t3953> <t3954>They acted as if they were so sad to leave this region!</t3954> <t3955>And I believed they really were, just like you and everyone else.</t3955> <t3956>Don't ever tell me again that blacks don't have acting talent.</t3956> <t3957>They gave a performance that would fool anyone.</t3957> <t3958>To me, they are worth a fortune.</t3958> <t3959>If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn't want better actors...</t3959> <t3960>And we sold them for a bargain.</t3960> <t3961>Yes, and we can't even touch that bargain yet.</t3961> <t3962>Hey, where is that bargain... that note?</t3962>
<t3963>—At the bank waiting to get paid.</t3963> <t3964>Where else would I be?</t3964>
<t3965>—Well, then it doesn't matter, thank God.</t3965>
<t3966>I asked, somewhat shyly:</t3966>
<t3967>—Has something happened?</t3967>
<t3968>The king turned to me and exclaimed:</t3968>
<t3969>—It's none of your business!</t3969> <t3970>You shut your mouth and mind your own business...</t3970> <t3971>If you have any.</t3971> <t3972>And while you're in this town, don't forget it, understand? —and then he says to the duke—: we have to endure and say nothing; we have to keep quiet.</t3972>
<t3973>When they started to go down the stairs, the duke laughed again and said:</t3973>
<t3974>—Quick sales and small profits!</t3974> <t3975>It's a good business.</t3975> <t3976>Yes.</t3976>
<t3977>The king let out a snort and said to him:</t3977>
<t3978>—When I sold them so quickly, I was trying to do what was best for us.</t3978> <t3979>If it turns out there are no profits, that we gain nothing and get nothing, am I more to blame than you?</t3979>
<t3980>—Well, if they had listened to me, they would still be in this house and we wouldn't.</t3980>
<t3981>The king responded to him as best he could and then turned around and went back to dealing with me.</t3981> <t3982>He gave me a scolding for not telling him that I had seen the blacks leaving his room in that manner, which even an idiot would have understood meant something was up.</t3982> <t3983>And then he changed again and cursed himself above all for a while, saying that everything had happened because he hadn't stayed in bed until late and rested as much as he needed that morning, and that damned if he would ever do it again in his life.</t3983> <t3984>So they went off chatting and I felt very happy to have put all the blame on the blacks without having done them any harm.</t3984>
<t3985>Chapter 28</t3985>
<t3986>Little by little, the time for everyone to get up was approaching.</t3986> <t3987>So I descended the stairs to the lower floor, but upon reaching the girls' room, the door was open and I saw Mary Jane sitting next to her old horsehair trunk, which was open and into which she had been putting things, preparing to go to England.</t3987> <t3988>But now she had stopped with a folded dress in her lap and had her face in her hands while she cried.</t3988> <t3989>I felt very bad seeing that; naturally, just as anyone would have felt.</t3989> <t3990>I went in and said:</t3990>
<t3991>—Miss Mary Jane, you can't stand to see people suffer, and neither can I: almost never.</t3991> <t3992>Tell me everything.</t3992> <t3993>So she told me, and it was about the slaves, just as I expected.</t3993> <t3994>She said that wonderful trip to England no longer excited her; she didn't know how she could be happy there, knowing that the mother and children would never see each other again, and then she started crying harder than ever, opened her hands, and said:</t3994>
<t3995>—Oh, my God, my God, to think that they will never see each other again!</t3995>
<t3996>—But they will see each other, and within two weeks, and I know it! —I replied.</t3996>
<t3997>My God, it had slipped out without thinking!</t3997> <t3998>And before I could even move, she had thrown her arms around my neck, asking me to repeat it, again, to repeat it again, to repeat it again!</t3998>
<t3999>I realized that I had spoken too much and too soon and that I had gotten myself into a trap.</t3999> <t4000>I asked her to let me think about it for a minute; she remained seated, very impatient and nervous, so beautiful, but with a happy and calm air, like a person who has just had a tooth pulled.</t4000> <t4001>Then I began to study it.</t4001> <t4002>I said to myself: "I figure that someone who goes and tells the truth when they are in a trap is taking a considerable risk, although I have no experience and cannot say for sure, but in any case, it seems to me that this is one of those occasions where the truth appears to be better and indeed safer than the lie.</t4002> <t4003>I have to remember this and think it over again when I have time, because it is most strange and irregular.</t4003> <t4004>In my life, I have never seen anything like it.</t4004> <t4005>Well," I finally said to myself, "I'm going to take the risk; this time I'm going to tell the truth even though it's like sitting on a barrel of gunpowder and lighting it to see what happens next."</t4005> <t4006>Then I went and said:</t4006>
<t4007>—Miss Mary Jane.</t4007> <t4008>Is there any place out of town, not too far, where you could spend three or four days?</t4008>
<t4009>—Yes; at Mr. Lothrop's house.</t4009> <t4010>Why?</t4010>
<t4011>—The reason still doesn't matter.</t4011> <t4012>If I tell you how I know that the black people will meet again, here in this house, in two weeks, and I prove how I know it, will you go to Mr. Lothrop's house to stay for four days?</t4012>
<t4013>—Four days! —he replied—.</t4013> <t4014>I would stay for a year!</t4014>
<t4015>—Very well —I added—, the only thing I ask for is your word: it means more to me than someone else's oath on the Bible.</t4015> <t4016>—She smiled and blushed a little, very lovely, and I continued—: If you don't mind, I'm going to close the door, and with the lock.</t4016>
<t4017>Then I sat down again and said:</t4017>
<t4018>—Don't shout.</t4018> <t4019>Stay seated there and take it like a man.</t4019> <t4020>I have to tell the truth and you have to prepare yourself well, Miss Mary, because it's a bad thing and it's going to be difficult for you, but there's no way to avoid it.</t4020> <t4021>Those uncles of yours are not uncles at all; they are a pair of frauds, lifelong impostors.</t4021> <t4022>Well, we've gotten through the worst, and you will be able to handle the rest more easily.</t4022>
<t4023>Naturally, that left her absolutely stunned, but now I had already said the hardest part, so I continued while her eyes lit up more and more and I told her absolutely everything, from the first time we met the foolish boy who was going to the steamboat to when she had thrown herself into the king's arms at the main gate and he had kissed her sixteen or seventeen times, and then she jumped, her face blazing like a sunset, and said:</t4023>
<t4024>—Wicked!</t4024> <t4025>Come on, don't waste a minute, not even a second, let's have them tarred, feathered, and thrown into the river!</t4025>
<t4026>I answered:</t4026>
<t4027>—Of course.</t4027> <t4028>But do you mean before going to Mr. Lothrop's house or...?</t4028>
<t4029>—Ah —she replied—, what am I thinking! —and she sat down again—.</t4029> <t4030>Don't pay attention to what I said, I beg you.</t4030> <t4031>You won't, will you?</t4031>
<t4032>She gently placed her little hand in mine in such a way that I responded that I would rather die first.</t4032>
<t4033>—I haven't stopped to think about it because I was so angry —she added—; now go on and I promise I won't act like that again.</t4033> <t4034>Tell me what I have to do and I will do everything you say.</t4034>
<t4035>—Well —I said—, these two swindlers are tough guys and I have no choice but to keep traveling with them a bit longer, whether I like it or not; I prefer not to tell you why; and if you reported them, this town would free me from their clutches and I would be perfectly fine; but there would be another person you don't know about who would have terrible problems.</t4035> <t4036>Well, we have to save that person, right? Of course.</t4036> <t4037>Well, then we can't report them.</t4037>
<t4038>When I said that, a good idea occurred to me.</t4038> <t4039>I saw how I could get Jim and myself free from the frauds; make them stay in the local jail and then leave.</t4039> <t4040>But I didn't want to navigate the raft during the day with no one but me on board to answer questions, so I didn't want the plan to start working until well into the night.</t4040> <t4041>I continued saying:</t4041>
<t4042>—Miss Mary Jane, I'm going to tell you what we're going to do and you won't have to stay so long at Mr. Lothrop's house either.</t4042> <t4043>How far is it?</t4043>
<t4044>—A little less than four miles, right there in the field.</t4044>
<t4045>—Well, all right.</t4045> <t4046>Now go over there and stay without saying anything until nine or nine-thirty at night and then have them bring you back home: tell them you forgot something.</t4046> <t4047>If you arrive before eleven, put a candle in this window and wait until eleven; if I don't show up after that, it means I've left and you're safe.</t4047> <t4048>Then go out, spread the news, and have those wretches thrown in jail.</t4048>
<t4049>—Very well —he responded—, I will do that.</t4049>
<t4050>—And if by any chance I don't manage to escape, but they catch me with them, you have to say that I had told you everything beforehand and defend me as much as you can.</t4050>
<t4051>—Defend you!</t4051> <t4052>Of course.</t4052> <t4053>They won't lay a finger on you! —he said, and I saw his nostrils flare and his eyes gleam as he said it.</t4053>
<t4054>—If I escape, I won't be here —I pointed out— to prove that those scoundrels are not your uncles, and if I were here, I couldn't prove it.</t4054> <t4055>I could swear they were cheats and vagabonds, and nothing more, although that is something.</t4055> <t4056>Well, there are others who can do it better than I, and they are people who won't be doubted as easily as me.</t4056> <t4057>I'm going to tell you how to find them.</t4057> <t4058>Give me a pencil and a piece of paper.</t4058> <t4059>That's it: "The Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville."</t4059> <t4060>Keep it and don't lose it.</t4060> <t4061>When the judge wants to know something about those two, have someone go to Bricksville and say they have the men who performed in "The Royal Nonesuch," and as for witnesses, you'll get the whole town to come in the blink of an eye, Miss Mary.</t4061> <t4062>And ready for anything, too.</t4062>
<t4063>I figured that we already had everything on track and said:</t4063>
<t4064>—Leave them with their auction and don't worry.</t4064> <t4065>Nobody will have to pay for what they buy until a day after the auction, since it was announced so hastily, and they won't leave until they get that money; the way we've arranged it, the sale won't count and they won't get any money.</t4065> <t4066>It's just like what happened with the black people: the sale isn't valid and the black people will come back very soon.</t4066> <t4067>Notice that they still can't collect the money from the black people...</t4067> <t4068>They're in a very bad situation, Miss Mary.</t4068>
<t4069>—Well —she replied—, I'm going to go down for breakfast and then I'll go straight to Mr. Lothrop's house.</t4069> <t4070>—That can't be, Miss Mary Jane —I indicated—, not at all; go before breakfast.</t4070>
<t4071>—Why?</t4071>
<t4072>—Why do you think I wanted you to do all this, Miss Mary Jane?</t4072>
<t4073>—Well, it hadn't occurred to me...</t4073> <t4074>And now that I think about it, I don't know.</t4074> <t4075>Why?</t4075>
<t4076>—Well, because you are not a shameless person.</t4076> <t4077>I like your face just the way it is.</t4077> <t4078>One can sit down to read it as if it were written in capital letters.</t4078> <t4079>Do you think you can go see your uncles when they come to say good morning with a kiss and not...</t4079> <t4080>?</t4080>
<t4081>—Let's go, let's go, don't continue!</t4081> <t4082>Yes, I will leave before breakfast and very happy.</t4082> <t4083>And do I leave my sisters with them?</t4083>
<t4084>—Yes, don't worry about them.</t4084> <t4085>They have to keep enduring for a while.</t4085> <t4086>They might suspect something if all of you disappeared.</t4086> <t4087>I don't want you to see them, nor your sisters nor anyone from the town; if a neighbor asks you how your uncles are this morning, you might reveal something with a gesture.</t4087> <t4088>No, leave immediately, Miss Mary Jane, and I'll handle everything with them.</t4088> <t4089>I'll tell Miss Susan to greet your uncles warmly and to say that you have gone away for a few hours to rest a bit and change, or to visit a friend, and that you will be back tonight or early in the morning.</t4089>
<t4090>—It's fine that I went to see some friends, but I don't want you to greet them on my behalf.</t4090>
<t4091>—Well, then don't tell them anything.</t4091>
<t4092>He could tell her that, because it didn't hurt anyone, it was something unimportant and caused no problems, and it's the unimportant things that make life easier for people down here; Mary Jane would be at ease, and it cost nothing.</t4092> <t4093>Then I added:</t4093>
<t4094>—There's one more thing: the bag with the money.</t4094>
<t4095>—Well, they already have that, and I feel very foolish thinking about how they got it.</t4095>
<t4096>—No, you are mistaken there.</t4096> <t4097>They don't have it.</t4097>
<t4098>—Well, who has it?</t4098>
<t4099>—I wish I knew, but I don't.</t4099> <t4100>I had it, because I stole it, and I stole it to give it to you, and I know where I hid it but I'm afraid it's no longer there.</t4100> <t4101>I'm terribly sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I can't feel worse; but I did everything I could; I really did.</t4101> <t4102>They almost caught me and I had to put it in the first place I found and run away, but it wasn't a good place.</t4102>
<t4103>—Well, stop blaming yourself; it makes you feel bad and I won't allow it; you couldn't avoid it; it wasn't your fault.</t4103> <t4104>Where did you hide it?</t4104>
<t4105>I didn't want him to start thinking about his problems again, and I couldn't get my mouth to say something that would make him see that corpse with the bag of money in its stomach again.</t4105> <t4106>So for a moment, I didn't say anything, and then I responded:</t4106>
<t4107>—I prefer not to tell you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don't mind forgiving me; but I will write it on a piece of paper and you can read it on the way to Mr. Lothrop's house, if you want.</t4107> <t4108>Does that seem alright to you?</t4108>
<t4109>—Ah, yes.</t4109>
<t4110>So I wrote: "I put her in the coffin.</t4110> <t4111>She was there when you spent the night crying.</t4111> <t4112>I was behind the door and felt very sad for you, Miss Mary Jane."</t4112>
<t4113>A few tears welled up in my eyes as I remembered how she had been left crying there alone all night while those devils slept under her own roof, deceiving and robbing her, and when I folded the note and gave it to her, I saw that tears had welled up in her eyes too, and she grabbed my hand very tightly and said to me:</t4113>
<t4114>—Goodbye.</t4114> <t4115>I will do everything exactly as you have told me, and if I never see you again, I will never forget you and I will think of you many, many times, and I will always pray for you! —and she left.</t4115>
<t4116>Pray for me!</t4116> <t4117>I thought that if she knew me, she would have set herself a task more worthy of her.</t4117> <t4118>But I bet she did it anyway: she was like that.</t4118> <t4119>She had the strength to pray for Judas if it occurred to her, and she never backed down.</t4119> <t4120>People can say what they want, but to me, she was the bravest girl I had ever known; to me, she was full of courage.</t4120> <t4121>It seems like a compliment, but it isn't.</t4121> <t4122>And as for beauty —and also kindness—, she had more than anyone in the world.</t4122> <t4123>I haven't seen her since that time she walked out the door; no, I haven't seen her since then, but I think I've thought about her many, many millions of times and how she said she was going to pray for me, and if it ever occurred to me that it would be worth anything for me to pray for her, I would either pray or burst.</t4123>
<t4124>Well, I guess Mary Jane went out the back door, because no one saw her leave.</t4124> <t4125>When I met Susan and the girl with the cleft lip, I told them:</t4125>
<t4126>—What is the name of that family on the other side of the river that you sometimes go to see?</t4126>
<t4127>They answered:</t4127>
<t4128>—There are several; but above all, the Proctor family.</t4128>
<t4129>—That is the name —I said—; I almost forgot.</t4129> <t4130>Well, Miss Mary Jane asked me to tell you that she had to leave in a hurry: someone is sick.</t4130>
<t4131>—Which one?</t4131>
<t4132>—I don't know: or if I do know, I've forgotten; but I think it is...</t4132>
<t4133>—My God.</t4133> <t4134>I hope it's not Hanna!</t4134>
<t4135>—I'm sorry to say it —I added—, but it's precisely her.</t4135> <t4136>—My God, she was doing so well last week!</t4136> <t4137>Is she very sick?</t4137>
<t4138>—I have no idea.</t4138> <t4139>They stayed sitting with her all night, said Miss Mary Jane, and they don't think she will last many hours.</t4139>
<t4140>—Who would have thought! What's wrong with him?</t4140>
<t4141>Nothing reasonable occurred to me to say immediately, so I replied:</t4141>
<t4142>—He has mumps.</t4142>
<t4143>—Mumps, your grandmother!</t4143> <t4144>People don't stay to keep company with those who have mumps.</t4144>
<t4145>—So, no, eh?</t4145> <t4146>Well, I bet it's yes when it's mumps like yours.</t4146> <t4147>These mumps are different.</t4147> <t4148>They're a new kind, Miss Mary Jane told me.</t4148>
<t4149>—What new type?</t4149>
<t4150>—Mixed with other things.</t4150>
<t4151>—What other things?</t4151>
<t4152>—Well, measles, whooping cough, erysipelas, and consumption, and jaundice and brain fever and I don't know what else.</t4152>
<t4153>—My God! And they call that mumps?</t4153>
<t4154>—That's what Miss Mary Jane said.</t4154>
<t4155>—Well, and, why the devil do they call it mumps?</t4155>
<t4156>—Well, because it's the mumps.</t4156> <t4157>Start there.</t4157>
<t4158>—Well, it doesn't make sense.</t4158> <t4159>Someone could prick their foot, get infected, fall into a well and break their neck, and their brains could spill out, and then some idiot would come along and say they died because they cut their foot.</t4159> <t4160>Would that make sense?</t4160> <t4161>No, and this doesn't make sense either.</t4161> <t4162>Is it contagious?</t4162>
<t4163>—Is it contagious?</t4163> <t4164>What things you say.</t4164> <t4165>Can one get hooked by a rake in the dark?</t4165> <t4166>If it doesn't hit one tooth, it hits the other, right?</t4166> <t4167>And you can't remove the tooth without dragging the whole rake, right?</t4167> <t4168>Well, this type of mumps is like a kind of rake, so to speak, and not a toy rake, but when you get stuck with it, you really get hooked.</t4168>
<t4169>—Well, I think it's horrible —said the one with the cleft lip—; I'm going to see Uncle Harvey and...</t4169>
<t4170>—Ah, yes —I said—.</t4170> <t4171>That's what I would do.</t4171> <t4172>Of course.</t4172> <t4173>I wouldn't waste a moment.</t4173>
<t4174>—Well, why not?</t4174>
<t4175>—You just need to think about it for a minute and maybe you'll understand.</t4175> <t4176>Aren't your uncles obligated to return to England as soon as they can?</t4176> <t4177>And do you think they are going to be so mean as to leave and let you make that whole trip alone?</t4177> <t4178>You know they will wait for you.</t4178> <t4179>Very well.</t4179> <t4180>Your uncle Harvey is a preacher, isn't he?</t4180> <t4181>Very well, then.</t4181> <t4182>Is a preacher going to deceive a ship line employee?</t4182> <t4183>Is he going to deceive the ship's purser?</t4183> <t4184>To get them to let Miss Mary Jane board?</t4184> <t4185>You know perfectly well that he won't.</t4185> <t4186>So what is he going to do?</t4186> <t4187>Well, he'll say: "It's a shame, but my church matters will have to manage as they can, because my niece has been exposed to those horrible pluribusunum mumps, so I have the obligation to stay here waiting the three months needed to see if she has been infected."</t4187> <t4188>But it doesn't matter, if you think it's better to tell your uncle Harvey...</t4188>
<t4189>—That, and staying here doing nothing when we could be having fun in England while we waited to see if Mary Jane got it or not.</t4189> <t4190>What nonsense you speak.</t4190>
<t4191>—Well, in any case, maybe you should tell one of the neighbors.</t4191>
<t4192>—Look now at what he says.</t4192> <t4193>You are the most stupid thing I have ever seen.</t4193> <t4194>Don't you understand that they would tell everything?</t4194> <t4195>The only thing to do is not to tell anyone.</t4195>
<t4196>—Well, maybe you're right... Yes, I think you're right.</t4196>
<t4197>—But I think we should still tell Uncle Harvey that she has gone away for a while so he doesn't worry about her.</t4197>
<t4198>—Yes, Miss Mary Jane wanted you to tell them.</t4198> <t4199>She told me: "Tell them to greet Uncle Harvey and Uncle William for me and give them a kiss and tell them that I have gone to the other side of the river to see Mr...</t4199> <t4200>Mr... " What is the name of that rich family that your Uncle Peter esteemed so much?...</t4200> <t4201>I mean the one that...</t4201>
<t4202>—Man, you must be referring to the Apthorp, right?</t4202>
<t4203>—Naturally, damn names, I don't know why but half the time I forget them.</t4203> <t4204>Yes, she asked me to tell you that she has gone to see the Apthorps to make sure they come to the auction and buy this house, because she knows that her uncle Peter would prefer them to have it more than anyone else, and that she will stay with them until they say they are coming, and then, if she is not too tired, she will come back home, and if she is tired she will come back in the morning anyway.</t4204> <t4205>She asked me not to say anything about the Proctors, and to talk only about the Apthorps, which is perfectly true, because she is going there to talk about buying the house; I know because she told me herself.</t4205>
<t4206>—Very well —they said, and they went off to find their uncles and give them greetings and kisses and deliver the message.</t4206>
<t4207>Now everything was in order.</t4207> <t4208>The girls wouldn't say anything because they wanted to go to England, and the king and the duke would prefer that Mary Jane had gone to work so that the auction would go well and she wouldn't be within Dr. Robinson's reach.</t4208> <t4209>I felt great, and I figured I had done very well...</t4209> <t4210>I figured not even Tom Sawyer himself could have done it better.</t4210> <t4211>Of course, he would have done it with more style, but that's not easy for me, because I haven't been educated that way.</t4211>
<t4212>Well, they organized the auction in the public square, around mid-afternoon, and it went on and on; and there was the old man, with his sanctimonious airs, right next to the auctioneer, occasionally quoting something from the Scriptures or some pious saying, and the duke was going back and forth making "goo-goo" sounds so that everyone would feel sorry for him, and smiling at everyone.</t4212>
<t4213>But little by little, things started to run out and everything was sold, except for a few that remained in the cemetery.</t4213> <t4214>Then they set about trying to sell those; in my life, I have never seen even a giraffe like the king, so willing to swallow everything.</t4214> <t4215>And when they were at it, a steamboat docked and about two minutes later a group arrived, shouting and screaming, laughing and making a racket and yelling:</t4215>
<t4216>—Here comes the opposition!</t4216> <t4217>Now we have two groups of Peter Wilks' heirs: Step right up, pay, and see!</t4217>
<t4218>Chapter 29</t4218>
<t4219>THEY BROUGHT AN elderly gentleman of very good appearance and another younger one, also of good appearance, with his right arm in a sling.</t4219> <t4220>My God, how those people shouted and laughed, without stopping for a moment!</t4220> <t4221>But I didn't see the humor in it and supposed that the duke and the king would also find it hard to see.</t4221> <t4222>I had the feeling they were going to turn pale.</t4222> <t4223>But no, they did not turn pale.</t4223> <t4224>The duke did not let on that he suspected what was happening, but continued making "goo-goo" sounds to the people, happy and content, like a pitcher pouring out milk, and as for the king, he just looked sadly at the newcomers, as if his stomach hurt just thinking that there could be people in the world with so little shame.</t4224> <t4225>Ah, he did it admirably.</t4225> <t4226>Many of the town's characters went to the king to show him they were on his side.</t4226> <t4227>The old gentleman who had just arrived seemed dead with embarrassment.</t4227> <t4228>He immediately began to speak and I saw right away that they had an accent just like an Englishman's, not like the king's, although the king did very well with imitations.</t4228> <t4229>I can't write exactly what the old man said, nor can I imitate it, but he turned to the people and said something like this:</t4229>
<t4230>—This is a surprise I did not expect, and I sincerely admit that I am not very well prepared to react to it and respond, as my brother and I have suffered some misfortunes; he has broken his arm and last night our luggage was left in a town further up by mistake.</t4230> <t4231>I am Harvey, Peter Wilks' brother, and this is his brother William, who is deaf-mute, and now he can't even communicate much through signs, given that he only has one free hand.</t4231> <t4232>We are who we say we are, and within a day or two, when the luggage arrives, I will be able to prove it.</t4232> <t4233>But until then I will not say more, and I am going to the hotel to wait.</t4233>
<t4234>So he and the new mute set off, and the king burst out laughing and said:</t4234>
<t4235>—So, you've broken your arm, huh, just in time, right?</t4235> <t4236>And very convenient for a liar who has to speak in signs and hasn't learned them.</t4236> <t4237>They've lost their luggage!</t4237> <t4238>That's a good one!</t4238> <t4239>And it turns out to be very clever, in these circumstances.</t4239>
<t4240>So he laughed again, just like everyone else, except three or four, or maybe half a dozen.</t4240> <t4241>One of them was the doctor, another a gentleman with a shrewd appearance, carrying one of those old-fashioned carpet bags, who had just disembarked from the steamboat and was speaking quietly with the doctor, while they occasionally glanced at the king and nodded: it was Levi Bell, the lawyer who had gone to Louisville, and another was a tall, sturdy fellow who had approached to hear what the old man was saying and was now listening to the king.</t4241> <t4242>And when the king finished, the sturdy fellow goes and says:</t4242>
<t4243>—Listen, one thing: if you are Harvey Wilks, when did you arrive in town?</t4243>
<t4244>—The day before the funeral, my friend —says the king.</t4244>
<t4245>—But, at what time?</t4245>
<t4246>—In the afternoon, an hour or two before dusk.</t4246>
<t4247>—How did he arrive?</t4247>
<t4248>—I came on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.</t4248>
<t4249>—So, how is it that you were at La Punta that morning, in a canoe?</t4249>
<t4250>—That morning I wasn't at the Punta.</t4250>
<t4251>—He lies.</t4251>
<t4252>A few of them jumped on him and told him not to talk like that to an old man who was also a preacher.</t4252>
<t4253>—As a preacher, nothing; he's a liar and a fraud.</t4253> <t4254>That morning he was at the Point.</t4254> <t4255>I live there, don't I?</t4255> <t4256>Well, I was there and he was there, and I saw him.</t4256> <t4257>He arrived in a canoe, with Tim Collins and a boy.</t4257>
<t4258>The doctor goes and says:</t4258>
<t4259>—Would you recognize the boy if you saw him again, Hines?</t4259>
<t4260>—I suppose so, but I don't know.</t4260> <t4261>Well, there it is.</t4261> <t4262>I recognize it perfectly.</t4262>
<t4263>And he pointed at me.</t4263> <t4264>The doctor says:</t4264>
<t4265>—Neighbors, I don't know if these new ones are two liars or not, but if they're not, then I'm an idiot, that's what I say.</t4265> <t4266>I think we need to stop them from leaving here until we've cleared everything up.</t4266> <t4267>Come on, Hines; all of you, come along.</t4267> <t4268>Let's take these guys to the tavern to confront them with the other two and surely before we're done we'll have figured something out.</t4268>
<t4269>The people loved it, although perhaps not the king's friends; so we set off.</t4269> <t4270>It was towards the evening.</t4270> <t4271>The doctor took me by the hand and was very kind, but he never let go.</t4271>
<t4272>We all entered a large room in the hotel, lit some candles, and brought in the two newcomers.</t4272> <t4273>First, the doctor says:</t4273>
<t4274>—I don't want to be too harsh on these two men, but I believe they are swindlers and might have accomplices we know nothing about.</t4274> <t4275>In that case, won't the accomplices escape with the sack of gold that Peter Wilks left?</t4275> <t4276>It wouldn't be surprising.</t4276> <t4277>If these men are not swindlers, they won't object to us going to fetch the money and keeping it until they prove they aren't; don't you think?</t4277>
<t4278>Everyone agreed.</t4278> <t4279>So I thought that from the very beginning they had put our band in serious trouble.</t4279> <t4280>But the king only put on a sad face and said:</t4280>
<t4281>—Gentlemen, I wish the money were there, for I am not one to put obstacles in the way of a fair, open, and thorough investigation of this sad matter; but, unfortunately, the money is not there; you can send to look for it, if you wish.</t4281>
<t4282>—Where is it, then?</t4282>
<t4283>—Well, when my niece gave it to me to keep it for her, I hid it in the mattress of my bed, because I didn't want to take it to the bank just for a few days and I thought the bed would be a safe place, since we are not used to black people and I assumed they were honest, just like English servants.</t4283> <t4284>The black people stole it the next morning, when I went downstairs, and when I sold them I still hadn't realized it was missing, so they left with it.</t4284> <t4285>Here my servant can confirm it, gentlemen.</t4285>
<t4286>The doctor and several others said "wow!", and I saw that no one completely believed it.</t4286> <t4287>A man asked me if I had seen the black men steal it.</t4287> <t4288>I said no, but that I had seen them sneak out of the room and leave and that I had never thought anything bad, because I believed they had been scared of waking my master and were trying to leave before he reprimanded them.</t4288> <t4289>They didn't ask me anything else.</t4289> <t4290>Then the doctor turned to me and asked:</t4290>
<t4291>—Are you English too?</t4291>
<t4292>I said yes and he and others burst out laughing and said: "Nonsense!"</t4292>
<t4293>Well, then they continued with the general investigation, which went on with its ups and downs, hour after hour, and no one said a word about dinner, it seemed like they didn't even remember it, so they kept going and going and it turned out to be very complicated.</t4293> <t4294>They made the king tell his version, and then the old man tell his, and anyone who wasn't a mule full of prejudices would have seen that the old gentleman was telling the truth and the other was lying.</t4294> <t4295>And then they forced me to tell what I knew.</t4295> <t4296>The king looked at me out of the corner of his eye and I realized what it was convenient for me to say.</t4296> <t4297>I started talking about Sheffield and how we lived there and all the Wilks there were in England, and all that; but I hadn't said much when the doctor started laughing and then Levi Bell, the lawyer, goes and says:</t4297>
<t4298>—Sit down, boy; if I were you, I wouldn't tire myself out.</t4298> <t4299>I figure you're not used to lying and it's not easy for you; you lack practice.</t4299> <t4300>You're doing it quite poorly.</t4300>
<t4301>I didn't like that compliment very much, but in any case, I was glad they left me alone.</t4301>
<t4302>The doctor started to say something and then turns around and says:</t4302>
<t4303>—If you had been in the town from the beginning, Levi Bell...</t4303>
<t4304>The king interrupted, reached out his hand, and said:</t4304>
<t4305>—But, is this the old friend of my poor brother, may he rest in peace, whom he told me so much about in his letters?</t4305>
<t4306>The lawyer and he shook hands and the lawyer smiled with a satisfied air and they chatted for a while and then they moved to the side and spoke in low voices, and finally the lawyer speaks out loud and says:</t4306>
<t4307>—That's how things will be sorted out.</t4307> <t4308>We place the order and send it, along with your brother's, and that way you'll see that everything is in order.</t4308>
<t4309>So they brought a paper and a pen, and the king sat down, tilted his head to one side, bit his tongue, and scribbled something; then they handed the pen to the duke, and for the first time, he looked troubled.</t4309> <t4310>But he took the pen and wrote.</t4310> <t4311>Then the lawyer turns to the newly arrived old man and says to him:</t4311>
<t4312>—You and your brother, please write a line or two and sign with your name.</t4312>
<t4313>The elderly gentleman wrote, but no one managed to read what it said.</t4313> <t4314>The lawyer seemed extremely astonished and said:</t4314>
<t4315>—Well, I don't understand it —and he took a bunch of old letters out of his pocket and examined them; then he examined what the old man had written and then the letters again, and he goes and says—:</t4315> <t4316>These old letters are from Harvey Wilks, and here we see these two letters; you can all see that neither of the two wrote the letters (the king and the duke put on the faces of deceived fools, I assure you, seeing how the lawyer had made them take the bait), and this is the handwriting of that gentleman, and you can all easily see that he didn't write them either; in fact, the scribbles he makes can't even be called writing.</t4316> <t4317>Here we have some letters from...</t4317>
<t4318>The new old man goes and says:</t4318>
<t4319>—Please, allow me to explain it.</t4319> <t4320>No one can understand my handwriting, but here my brother copies the letters for me.</t4320> <t4321>What you are showing is his handwriting, not mine.</t4321>
<t4322>—Good! —says the lawyer—.</t4322> <t4323>That's how things stand.</t4323> <t4324>I also have some of William's letters here, so if you could tell him to write a line or two, then we can compa...</t4324>
<t4325>—He cannot write with his left hand —says the elderly gentleman—.</t4325> <t4326>If he could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters and also mine.</t4326> <t4327>Please compare them yourself and you will see that they are written in the same handwriting.</t4327>
<t4328>The lawyer compared them, and says:</t4328>
<t4329>—I think so, and if not, in any case, there is a much greater resemblance than I had noticed until now.</t4329> <t4330>Well, well, well!</t4330> <t4331>I thought we were on the track of a solution, but now it has disappeared, at least in part.</t4331> <t4332>But, in any case, there is one thing that is proven: neither of those two is a Wilks —with a nod towards the king and the duke.</t4332>
<t4333>Well, what can I tell you?</t4333> <t4334>The stubborn old fool wasn't willing to confess even then.</t4334> <t4335>Really, he wasn't.</t4335> <t4336>He said that the test wasn't fair.</t4336> <t4337>He said that his brother William spent his time joking around and hadn't tried to write, and that he was sure William was going to play one of his jokes as soon as he picked up the paper.</t4337> <t4338>And he kept getting more heated and talking so much that he started to believe what he was saying himself; but soon the new gentleman interrupted him, and said:</t4338>
<t4339>—I just thought of something.</t4339> <t4340>Is there anyone here who helped dress my her... who helped dress the late Mr. Peter Wilks for the burial?</t4340>
<t4341>—Yes —someone said—, Ab Turner and I.</t4341> <t4342>Here we both are.</t4342>
<t4343>Then the old man turns to the king and says:</t4343>
<t4344>—Could this gentleman tell me what he had tattooed on his chest?</t4344>
<t4345>Hang me if the king didn't have to react at full speed, or he would have shattered like a clod of earth falling into the river, it was so sudden; and I assure you it was something that would have shattered anyone if they had been hit like that without any warning; because, how was he to know what that man had tattooed?</t4345> <t4346>He paled a little; he couldn't help it; and you could have heard a fly buzz, because everyone leaned forward a bit to see what he would say.</t4346> <t4347>I said to myself: "Now he's going to have to throw in the towel; he has nothing left to do."</t4347> <t4348>Nothing to do? Ha!</t4348> <t4349>It's almost impossible to believe, but there he stayed.</t4349> <t4350>I figure his idea was to keep going with it until he tired people out so they would start leaving, and then he and the duke could flee and escape.</t4350> <t4351>In any case, there he stayed, and after a moment he started to smile and said:</t4351>
<t4352>—Hmm! What a difficult question!</t4352> <t4353>Yes, sir, I can tell you what he had tattooed on his chest.</t4353> <t4354>It was a small, very fine, blue arrow...</t4354> <t4355>That was it; and if you don't look very closely, you can't see it.</t4355> <t4356>And now, what do you say?</t4356>
<t4357>The truth is that in my life I have never seen anyone as shameless as that unscrupulous person.</t4357>
<t4358>The old man, with a fiery gaze, immediately turns towards Ab Turner and his companion, as if thinking that this time he has indeed caught the king, and then says:</t4358>
<t4359>—Well, you have heard what he said!</t4359> <t4360>Was there such a tattoo on Peter Wilks' chest?</t4360>
<t4361>Both of them replied:</t4361>
<t4362>—We didn't see anything like it.</t4362>
<t4363>—Good! —says the elderly gentleman—.</t4363> <t4364>What they did see tattooed on his chest was a small, partially erased capital P and a capital B (which is an initial he stopped using when he was young) and a capital W, with dashes between them arranged like this: P—B—W.</t4364> <t4365>And he wrote it on a sheet of paper.</t4365> <t4366>Come on, wasn't that what they saw?</t4366>
<t4367>The other two started talking again and said:</t4367>
<t4368>—No, we didn't see it.</t4368> <t4369>We didn't see any tattoo at all.</t4369>
<t4370>Well, now everyone was in a terrible mood and they started shouting:</t4370>
<t4371>—They are all swindlers!</t4371> <t4372>To the pond with them!</t4372> <t4373>Let's drown them!</t4373> <t4374>Let's run them out on a rail!</t4374> <t4375>—Everyone was shouting at once, with an overwhelming uproar.</t4375> <t4376>But the lawyer jumps onto the table and shouts:</t4376>
<t4377>—Gentlemen... Gentlemen!</t4377> <t4378>Allow me a word: just one word... PLEASE!</t4378> <t4379>We can still see it: let's exhume the corpse to see the tattoo.</t4379>
<t4380>That convinced them.</t4380>
<t4381>—Hurray! —everyone shouted, and they set off, but the lawyer and the doctor exclaimed:</t4381>
<t4382>—Calm down, calm down!</t4382> <t4383>Grab hold of these four men and the boy so they can come too.</t4383>
<t4384>—That's it! —they all shouted—, and if we don't find the tattoo, we're going to lynch the whole gang.</t4384>
<t4385>I assure you that now I was scared.</t4385> <t4386>But there was no way to escape.</t4386> <t4387>They grabbed all of us and made us go with them directly to the cemetery, which was a mile and a half downstream, and the whole town followed us because we were making a lot of noise and it was only nine at night.</t4387>
<t4388>As I passed by our house, I regretted having sent Mary Jane out of town, because if I could signal her now, she would come to save me and could expose our swindlers.</t4388>
<t4389>Well, we arrived en masse at the river road, making more noise than a bunch of wild cats, and to make it scarier, the sky was darkening and some trembling lightning bolts were starting to appear, and the wind was making the leaves shake.</t4389> <t4390>It was the most terrible and dangerous situation I had ever been in my life, and I felt dazed; everything was going very differently from what I had thought; instead of happening in a way that I could take my time and enjoy what was happening, with Mary Jane backing me up to save me and give me back my freedom when things got ugly, now there was nothing in the world standing between sudden death and me, except those tattoos.</t4390> <t4391>If they didn't find them...</t4391>
<t4392>I couldn't bear to think about it and, yet, I don't know why I couldn't think about anything else.</t4392> <t4393>It was getting darker and darker and it was a great moment to escape from those people, but the strongman (Hines) had me by the wrist and it was like trying to escape from Goliath.</t4393> <t4394>He was practically dragging me along, he was so nervous, and to avoid falling I had to run after him.</t4394>
<t4395>When they arrived, they entered the cemetery and filled it with a surge.</t4395> <t4396>And upon reaching the grave, they saw that they had a hundred times more shovels than they needed, but no one had thought to bring a lantern.</t4396> <t4397>But anyway, they started digging by the light of the lightning and sent someone to the nearest house, which was half a mile away, to fetch a light.</t4397>
<t4398>So they dug and kept digging like prisoners, and the night turned black as pitch and it started to rain and the wind whistled and roared and the lightning became clearer and clearer while the thunder drummed; but those people didn't pay any attention, so enthusiastic were they about the matter; and as soon as everything and everyone's faces in that crowd could be seen with the shovelfuls of earth coming out of the grave, the darkness erased everything the next second and nothing at all could be seen.</t4398>
<t4399>They finally took out the coffin and began to unscrew the lid, and the crowd jostled and shoved so much to get a spot and see what was happening like I had never seen in my life, and that, in the middle of the darkness, was terrifying.</t4399> <t4400>Hines hurt my wrist a lot by pulling on it, and I reckon he had forgotten about my existence, as nervous and panting as he was.</t4400>
<t4401>Suddenly, the lightning illuminated everything with a white light and someone shouted:</t4401>
<t4402>—By the living God, there is the bag of gold, on the chest!</t4402>
<t4403>Hines let out a howl, just like everyone else, and released my wrist while giving a shove to make his way to look, and I assure you that no one has ever been seen to shoot off like I did in search of the path in the darkness.</t4403>
<t4404>I had the road all to myself and I practically flew; at least I had it all to myself, except for those dense darknesses and the occasional lightning and the pounding rain and the gusts of wind and the cannonade of thunder, and you can believe me when I say that I ran with all my soul!</t4404>
<t4405>When I arrived at the village, I saw that there was no one around because of the storm, so I didn't look for hidden alleys; instead, I kept running down the main street, and when I started to reach where our house was, I squinted my eyes and saw it.</t4405> <t4406>Not a single light; the house was completely dark, which made me feel sad and disenchanted, I don't know why.</t4406> <t4407>But finally, just as I was passing by, the light in Mary Jane's window suddenly turned on!</t4407> <t4408>And my heart started pounding as if it were going to burst, and a second later the house and everything else had been left behind in the darkness, and I would never see it again in this world.</t4408> <t4409>She was the best girl I have ever seen in my life, and the bravest.</t4409>
<t4410>As soon as I was far enough from the town to see that I could reach the sandbar, I started to carefully look for a boat to borrow, and the first one I saw in the light of a lightning bolt that wasn't chained, I got into it and pushed off.</t4410> <t4411>It was a canoe and it was only tied with a rope.</t4411> <t4412>The sandbar was quite far, out there in the middle of the river, but I didn't waste any time, and when I finally reached the raft I was so exhausted that if I could have, I would have stayed there lying down to catch my breath.</t4412> <t4413>But I couldn't.</t4413> <t4414>As I jumped on board, I shouted:</t4414>
<t4415>—Get out, Jim, and cast off the lines!</t4415> <t4416>Thank God, we've gotten rid of them!</t4416>
<t4417>Jim came running and was approaching me with open arms of joy, but when I saw him in the light of a lightning bolt, my heart jumped into my mouth and I fell into the water on my back, for I had forgotten that he was King Lear and a drowned Arab, all at the same time, and it gave me a mortal fright.</t4417> <t4418>But Jim pulled me out of the water and was about to hug me and bless me, and all that out of joy at seeing that I had returned and that we had gotten rid of the king and the duke, but I went and said:</t4418>
<t4419>—Not now, let's leave it for breakfast, for breakfast!</t4419> <t4420>Cut the moorings and let the raft slide!</t4420>
<t4421>So in two seconds we were going down the river and the truth was that it felt good to be free again and alone on the great river without anyone bothering us.</t4421> <t4422>I started jumping and running around and clicking my heels in the air a few times, because I couldn't help it; but by the third time I heard a noise I knew very well, and I held my breath and listened to see what was happening, and sure enough, when the next flash of lightning burst over the water, there they were!, rowing so hard that their boat was speeding like a bullet!</t4422> <t4423>They were the king and the duke.</t4423>
<t4424>So I collapsed in a heap among the trunks and gave up on everything; I had to hold back a lot to keep from bursting into tears.</t4424>
<t4425>Chapter 30</t4425>
<t4426>WHEN THEY GOT on board, the king threw himself at me, grabbed me by the collar of my shirt, and said:</t4426>
<t4427>—So, trying to escape, little boy!</t4427> <t4428>You had gotten tired of us, hadn't you?</t4428>
<t4429>And I replied:</t4429>
<t4430>—No, Your Majesty, it is not like that... Please, stop, Your Majesty!</t4430>
<t4431>—Then, quickly tell us what you were planning to do, or I'll rip your guts out piece by piece!</t4431>
<t4432>—Honestly, I am going to tell you exactly what happened, Your Majesty.</t4432> <t4433>The man who was holding me was very kind to me and kept saying that he had a son my age who had died last year and that it was very sad for him to see a boy in such a dangerous situation, and when they were surprised to find the gold and rushed towards the coffin, he let me go and said: "Run away, or they will surely hang you," and I took off.</t4433> <t4434>It didn't seem to make any sense to stay...</t4434> <t4435>I couldn't do anything and I didn't want to be hanged if I could avoid it.</t4435> <t4436>So I didn't stop running until I found the canoe, and when I got here I told Jim to hurry or they might still come to catch and hang me, and I said that I feared the duke and you might no longer be alive and I got very sad, just like Jim; that's why I was so happy to see you arrive; ask Jim if it's not true.</t4436>
<t4437>Jim said that it was so, and the king told him to shut his mouth and added: "Ah, yes, sure!", and he shook me again and said that he was thinking of drowning me.</t4437> <t4438>But the duke goes and says:</t4438>
<t4439>—Let go of the boy, you old fool!</t4439> <t4440>Would you have done anything different?</t4440> <t4441>Did you ask about him when you left?</t4441> <t4442>I don't remember that.</t4442>
<t4443>So the king let me go and started cursing that town and all its inhabitants.</t4443> <t4444>But the duke goes and says: —You'd better curse yourself because you deserve it the most.</t4444> <t4445>From the beginning, you haven't done a single sensible thing, except when you calmly made up that story about the blue arrow tattoo.</t4445> <t4446>That was really good; it was phenomenal.</t4446> <t4447>And it was what saved us.</t4447> <t4448>Because if it hadn't been for that, they would have put us in jail until the Englishmen's luggage arrived, and then, I bet from there to the penitentiary!</t4448> <t4449>But that trick made them go to the cemetery and the gold thing worked out even better for us, because if they hadn't gotten so nervous and let us go when they rushed to see what was there, tonight we would have slept with ties on, and ties that last forever, which is more than we wanted.</t4449>
<t4450>They remained silent for a moment, thinking; then the king goes and says, as if remembering something:</t4450>
<t4451>—Wow! And we thought it had been stolen by the black people!</t4451> <t4452>I got extremely nervous!</t4452>
<t4453>—Yes —says the duke, slowly and sarcastically—, that's what we thought.</t4453>
<t4454>After half a minute, the king blurts out:</t4454>
<t4455>—At least, that's what I thought.</t4455>
<t4456>The duke says, in the same tone:</t4456>
<t4457>—On the contrary, I was thinking it.</t4457>
<t4458>The king gets irritated and says:</t4458>
<t4459>—Look, Aguassucias, what do you mean?</t4459>
<t4460>And the duke replies, very firmly:</t4460>
<t4461>—If we get into that, perhaps you'll allow me to ask what you were referring to.</t4461>
<t4462>—Gosh! —says the king, very sarcastically—, well I don't know: maybe you were asleep and didn't know what you were doing.</t4462>
<t4463>Then the duke got really angry and replied:</t4463>
<t4464>—Well, enough of this nonsense.</t4464> <t4465>Do you take me for a fool?</t4465> <t4466>Do you think I don't know who hid the money in the coffin?</t4466>
<t4467>—Yes, sir!</t4467> <t4468>I know you know it because you did it yourself!</t4468>
<t4469>—Lies! —and the duke lunges at him.</t4469> <t4470>The king shouts:</t4470>
<t4471>—Take those hands off!</t4471> <t4472>Let go of my neck!</t4472> <t4473>I take it all back!</t4473>
<t4474>The duke goes and says:</t4474>
<t4475>—Well, first you have to confess that you hid that money, and that you were planning to leave me one of these days and come back to dig it up and keep it all for yourself.</t4475>
<t4476>—Man, one minute, duke: answer this question, with all sincerity: if you didn't put the money there, say so and I will believe you and take back everything I've said.</t4476>
<t4477>—You old scoundrel, it wasn't me and you know it.</t4477> <t4478>Let that be clear!</t4478>
<t4479>—Well, then I believe you.</t4479> <t4480>But answer me just one more thing, and don't get angry.</t4480> <t4481>Didn't it occur to you to take the money and hide it?</t4481>
<t4482>The duke remained silent for a moment and replied:</t4482>
<t4483>—Well, it doesn't matter whether I thought of it or not, because in any case, I didn't do it.</t4483> <t4484>But you not only thought of it, but you did it.</t4484>
<t4485>—May I die if it was me, duke, and I tell you the truth.</t4485> <t4486>I'm not saying I wouldn't have done it, because that would be a lie, but you —or whoever it was— beat me to it.</t4486>
<t4487>—Liar!</t4487> <t4488>It was you and you have to say it or...</t4488>
<t4489>The king began to gurgle and then gasped:</t4489>
<t4490>—Enough! I confess!</t4490>
<t4491>I was very happy when he said it; it made me feel much calmer than before.</t4491> <t4492>So the duke took his hands off him and says:</t4492>
<t4493>—If you deny it again, I'll drown you.</t4493> <t4494>It's very well that you stay there sitting and crying like a child.</t4494> <t4495>It's what you deserve after what you've done.</t4495> <t4496>In my life, I've never seen even an ostrich swallow everything, and I trusted you all the time, as if you were my own father.</t4496> <t4497>You should be ashamed of yourself for staying there and hearing how they blamed a bunch of poor black people, without saying a word for them.</t4497> <t4498>I feel ridiculous remembering that I was such an idiot to believe that stupidity.</t4498> <t4499>Damn you, now I understand why you were so willing to fix the deficit: you wanted to keep the money that I had taken from the "unparalleled" and with one thing and another, keep everything.</t4499>
<t4500>The king goes and says, all timid and still with a breathless voice:</t4500>
<t4501>—But, Duke, it was you who mentioned compensating for the deficit, not me.</t4501>
<t4502>—Shut up! I don't want to hear a single word from you! —says the duke—.</t4502> <t4503>And now look at what you've done.</t4503> <t4504>They've recovered all the money, and on top of that, ours too, except for a few pennies.</t4504> <t4505>Go to sleep and don't ever talk to me about deficit or no deficit in your entire life!</t4505>
<t4506>So the king went back to the wigwam and sought company in his bottle, and shortly after the duke started on his, and after about half an hour they were friends again, and the more friendly they got, the more affectionate they became, until they ended up snoring, embraced with each other.</t4506> <t4507>The two became very talkative, but I saw that the king wasn't so far gone as to forget that he shouldn't repeat that he wasn't the one who had hidden the bag with the money.</t4507> <t4508>That made me feel calm and satisfied.</t4508> <t4509>Naturally, when they started snoring, we talked for a long time and I told Jim everything.</t4509>
<t4510>Chapter 31</t4510>
<t4511>FOR DAYS AND DAYS we did not dare to stop in any other town, but continued down the river.</t4511> <t4512>We had already reached the South, where it was hot and we were very far from home.</t4512> <t4513>We began to find trees full of black moss, which hung from the branches like large gray beards.</t4513> <t4514>It was the first time I had seen them, and it gave the forest a solemn and sad appearance.</t4514> <t4515>The scoundrels figured they were out of danger and started working in the towns again.</t4515>
<t4516>First, they gave a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough to get the two of them drunk.</t4516> <t4517>Then, in another town, they opened a dance school, but they danced worse than a kangaroo, so at the first pirouette the audience turned on them and expelled them from the town.</t4517> <t4518>Another time they tried to give elocution lessons, but they didn't "elocute" much, because the audience got up and started cursing them and made them leave.</t4518> <t4519>They tried being missionaries, hypnotists, doctors, fortune-tellers, and a bit of everything, but it seemed they had no luck.</t4519> <t4520>So, finally, they were practically out of money and did nothing but lie on the raft as it floated downstream, thinking and thinking, without saying a word all day, very sad and desperate.</t4520>
<t4521>Finally, they started to change and began talking in the wigwam in a low and confidential tone for two or three hours straight.</t4521> <t4522>Jim and I got nervous.</t4522> <t4523>We didn't like it.</t4523> <t4524>We thought they were planning something worse than before.</t4524> <t4525>We talked about it many times and finally decided that they were going to rob someone's house or store, or that they were planning to counterfeit money, or something similar.</t4525> <t4526>Then we got really scared and decided that we wouldn't have anything to do with it, and that if the slightest opportunity arose, we would sneak away and abandon them.</t4526> <t4527>Well, one early morning we hid the raft in a good, safe spot, about two miles below a village called Pikesville, and the king went ashore and told us all to stay hidden while he went to town to see if anyone had found out about "The Royal Nonesuch" ("a house to rob, that's what you mean," I said to myself, "and when you're done robbing it, you're going to come back and wonder what happened to me and Jim and the raft, and you can wait for us sitting down").</t4527> <t4528>And he said that if he didn't come back by noon, the duke and I would know that everything was fine and we should meet up with him.</t4528>
<t4529>So we stayed where we were.</t4529> <t4530>The duke was nervous, sweaty, and in a terrible mood.</t4530> <t4531>He scolded us for everything and nothing we did seemed right to him; he found everything wrong.</t4531> <t4532>Of course, they were preparing something.</t4532> <t4533>I was very glad when noon came and the king hadn't returned; now things were going to change, and maybe an opportunity would present itself.</t4533> <t4534>So the duke and I went to town and started looking for the king; after a while, we found him in the back room of a seedy tavern, half-drunk, with a bunch of drunks who were provoking him for fun while he cursed and threatened them with all his might, so drunk that he couldn't walk or do anything to them.</t4534> <t4535>The duke was mocking him for being an old fool and the king responded, so as soon as I saw things heating up, I took off at full speed and ran down the river road like a deer, because I had seen our opportunity and decided that they could wait forever before seeing Jim and me again.</t4535> <t4536>I arrived breathless but very happy and shouted:</t4536>
<t4537>—Cast off the moorings, Jim; everything is set!</t4537>
<t4538>But no one answered me nor came out of the wigwam.</t4538> <t4539>Jim had disappeared!</t4539> <t4540>I shouted once, then again and again, and started running through the forest up and down, shouting and yelling, but it was all for nothing: Jim had disappeared.</t4540> <t4541>Then I sat down and started to cry; I couldn't help it.</t4541> <t4542>But I couldn't stay sitting for long.</t4542> <t4543>After a while, I went back to the path trying to think about what I should do, and I met a boy who was walking by and asked him if he had seen a strange black man dressed in such and such a way, and he goes and says:</t4543>
<t4544>—Yes.</t4544>
<t4545>—Where? —I asked.</t4545>
<t4546>—By Silas Phelps' house, two miles down.</t4546> <t4547>He's a runaway slave and they've caught him.</t4547> <t4548>Were you looking for him?</t4548>
<t4549>—Absolutely!</t4549> <t4550>I found him in the forest one or two hours ago and he told me that if I screamed, he would rip out my guts and that I should stay still, where I was, which is what I did.</t4550> <t4551>I've been there since then because I was scared to leave.</t4551>
<t4552>—Well —he goes and says—, you don't have to be afraid anymore because they've caught him.</t4552> <t4553>He escaped from I don't know where in the South.</t4553>
<t4554>—It's a good thing they caught him.</t4554>
<t4555>—Man, absolutely!</t4555> <t4556>They were offering a reward of two hundred dollars for him.</t4556> <t4557>It's like finding money on the ground.</t4557>
<t4558>—Yes, it's true, and it could have been mine if I had been older.</t4558> <t4559>I saw it first.</t4559> <t4560>Who caught it?</t4560>
<t4561>—A strange guy, a stranger, who sold his right to him for forty dollars because he has to go upriver and can't wait.</t4561> <t4562>Imagine that!</t4562> <t4563>Well, I would wait even if it were seven years.</t4563>
<t4564>—I say the same thing —I replied—.</t4564> <t4565>But maybe it's because their rights aren't worth much if they sell them for so little.</t4565> <t4566>Maybe there's something illegal there.</t4566>
<t4567>—Well, I'm telling you no, it's completely legitimate.</t4567> <t4568>I myself have seen the reward notice.</t4568> <t4569>It gives all the details about him, down to the last one, as if it were in a painting, and it says which plantation he comes from, beyond New Orleans.</t4569> <t4570>No, sir, you can bet there's nothing strange about it.</t4570> <t4571>Hey, give me some chewing tobacco, do you have any?</t4571>
<t4572>I had nothing left, so he left.</t4572> <t4573>I went to the raft and sat in the wigwam to think.</t4573> <t4574>But nothing came to mind.</t4574> <t4575>I thought until my head hurt, but I couldn't see a way out of that problem.</t4575> <t4576>After all the journey and what we had done for those heartless people, everything had ended, everything had fallen apart and been destroyed, because they had the bad blood to play such a trick on Jim and turn him back into a slave for his entire life, and on top of that among strangers, for forty filthy dollars.</t4576>
<t4577>Once I told myself that it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a slave at home, where his family was, if he had to be a slave, so it would be better to write a letter to Tom Sawyer to tell Miss Watson where he was.</t4577> <t4578>But I immediately gave up the idea for two reasons: she would be indignant and angry at his bad faith and ingratitude for escaping from her, so she would sell him down the river again, and if not, everyone naturally despises an ungrateful black man and would remind Jim of it all the time, so that he would feel miserable and dishonored.</t4578> <t4579>And, what would they think of me!</t4579> <t4580>Everyone would find out that Huck Finn had helped a black man gain his freedom, and if I ever saw anyone from town again, it would have to be to bow down and lick their boots out of shame.</t4580> <t4581>That's how things are: someone does something wrong and then doesn't want to face the consequences.</t4581> <t4582>They think that as long as they can hide, they won't have to feel ashamed.</t4582> <t4583>And that was my situation.</t4583> <t4584>The more I thought about it, the more my conscience gnawed at me, and the more wicked, low, and miserable I felt.</t4584> <t4585>And finally, when I suddenly realized that it was the hand of Providence slapping me in the face and telling me that my wickedness was always known up in heaven, because I had stolen a black man from a poor old woman who had never done anything wrong to me, and now it was showing me that there is always Someone who sees everything and does not allow such wickedness beyond a certain point, I almost fell to the ground from the fear it gave me.</t4585> <t4586>Well, I did everything I could to make things easier for myself by telling myself that I had been raised poorly, so it wasn't all my fault, but inside me, there was something that kept repeating: "There was Sunday school and you could have gone; and if you had gone, they would have taught you that people who do the things you have done for that black man are destined for eternal fire."</t4586>
<t4587>That made me tremble.</t4587> <t4588>And I decided to start praying and see if I could stop being a bad boy and become better.</t4588> <t4589>So I knelt down.</t4589> <t4590>But the words wouldn't come out.</t4590> <t4591>Why not?</t4591> <t4592>It was no use trying to hide it from Him.</t4592> <t4593>Nor from myself either.</t4593> <t4594>I knew very well why they wouldn't come out of me.</t4594> <t4595>It was because my soul was not clean; it was because I had not repented; it was because I was playing both sides.</t4595> <t4596>I acted as if I were going to renounce sin, but inside I was still determined on the worst of all.</t4596> <t4597>I tried to force my mouth to say that I was going to do what was right and correct and write to the owner of that black man to tell her where he was; but deep down I knew it was a lie, and so did He.</t4597> <t4598>You can't pray lies, as I understood then.</t4598>
<t4599>So I was full of problems, all the problems in the world, and I didn't know what to do.</t4599> <t4600>Finally, I had an idea and said to myself: "I will write the letter and then try to pray."</t4600> <t4601>And, well, I was amazed at how I immediately felt as light as a feather again, and without any more problems.</t4601> <t4602>So I grabbed a sheet of paper and a pencil, feeling very happy and encouraged, and I sat down to write:</t4602>
<t4603>"Miss Watson, your runaway negro Jim is here two miles down from Pikesville and Mr. Phelps has him. He will return him for the reward if you send for him."</t4603>
<t4604>"HUCK FINN"</t4604>
<t4605>I felt good and clean of sin for the first time in my life and understood that now I could pray.</t4605> <t4606>But I didn't do it immediately; instead, I put the piece of paper aside and stayed there thinking: thinking how good it was that everything had happened this way and how close I had been to losing myself and going to hell.</t4606> <t4607>And I kept thinking.</t4607> <t4608>And I started thinking about our journey down the river and saw Jim in front of me all the time: day and night, sometimes in the moonlight, other times in the middle of storms, and when we floated down, chatting and singing and laughing.</t4608> <t4609>But I don't know why it seemed that I couldn't find anything to harden me against him, but quite the opposite.</t4609> <t4610>I saw him take my watch in addition to his own, instead of waking me up, so that I could sleep more, and I saw how happy he was when I returned in the middle of the fog, and when we met again in the swamp, far away where the blood feud was, and all those moments, and how he always called me his boy and caressed me and did everything he could for me, and how good he had always been, until I reached the moment when I had saved him when I told the men that we had smallpox on board and how grateful he was and that he had said that I was the best friend he had in the world, old Jim, and the only one he has now, and then, when I looked around randomly, I saw the piece of paper.</t4610>
<t4611>It was hard for me to make up my mind.</t4611> <t4612>I grabbed the paper and held it in my hand.</t4612> <t4613>I was trembling, because I had to decide forever between two things, and I knew it.</t4613> <t4614>I looked at it for a minute, as if holding my breath, and then I said to myself:</t4614>
<t4615>"Well, fine, I'll go to hell!" and I broke it.</t4615>
<t4616>They were terrible ideas and words, but it was already done.</t4616> <t4617>That's how I left it, and I didn't think about reforming anymore.</t4617> <t4618>I got it all out of my head and said I would go back to being bad, which was my thing, because that's how I was raised, and the other way didn't suit me.</t4618> <t4619>To start with, I was going to do whatever it took to get Jim out of slavery, and if I thought of something worse, I would do that too, because once you're in it, it doesn't matter if it's eight or eighty.</t4619>
<t4620>Then I started thinking about how to get it and turned it over and over in my mind until I found a plan that suited me.</t4620> <t4621>So I saw the position of a wooded island that was a little downstream, and as soon as it started to get a bit dark, I went out secretly with my raft and hid it there, and then I went to bed.</t4621> <t4622>I slept all night and got up before dawn, had breakfast, put on the clothes from the store and the rest in a bundle, and took the canoe to go ashore.</t4622> <t4623>I arrived where I thought the Phelps' house should be and hid the bundle in the woods; then I filled the canoe with water and stones and sank it where I could find it again whenever I wanted, about a quarter of a mile down from a small steam mill on the shore.</t4623>
<t4624>Then I set off, and when I passed by the mill I saw a sign that said "Phelps' Sawmill," and when I reached the houses, two or three hundred yards further on, I was very attentive, but no one was in sight, even though it was already fully daylight.</t4624> <t4625>But I didn't mind because I still didn't want to meet anyone: I just wanted to see what everything was like.</t4625> <t4626>According to my plan, I was going to appear there, coming from the town, and not from the river.</t4626> <t4627>So I took a look around and headed straight to the town.</t4627> <t4628>Well, the first person I saw when I arrived was the duke.</t4628> <t4629>He was putting up a poster for "The Royal Nonesuch" (three performances), just like the last time.</t4629> <t4630>What nerve those two scoundrels had!</t4630> <t4631>I stood beside him before he could even move.</t4631> <t4632>He seemed astonished and said:</t4632>
<t4633>—Hello! Where did you come from? —and then he adds, as if he were very happy—: Where is the raft?</t4633> <t4634>Did you put it in a good place?</t4634>
<t4635>And I replied:</t4635>
<t4636>—Man, that was what I was going to ask your grace.</t4636>
<t4637>Then he didn't seem so happy and asked:</t4637>
<t4638>—Why were you going to ask me?</t4638>
<t4639>—Well —I go and say—, when I saw the king yesterday in that tavern, I told myself that it would take us hours to get him home until he had sobered up, so I started wandering around the town to kill time and wait.</t4639> <t4640>A man came and offered me ten cents if I helped him take a boat to the other side of the river and come back with a sheep, so I went with him; but when we were taking it to the boat and the man gave me the rope and went behind the boat to push, the sheep turned out to be too much for me alone and it broke free and ran off, and we ran after it.</t4640> <t4641>We didn't have a dog, so we had to chase it all over the field until it got tired.</t4641> <t4642>We didn't catch it until dusk; then we took it to the other side and I headed towards the raft.</t4642> <t4643>When I arrived and saw that it had disappeared, I said to myself: "They've gotten into trouble and had to leave, and they've taken my black man, who is the only black man I have in the world, and now I'm in a strange country and I have nothing of my own, I have nothing left at all nor any way to make a living," so I sat down to cry.</t4643> <t4644>I fell asleep in the forest all night.</t4644> <t4645>But then, what happened to the raft?...</t4645> <t4646>And Jim. Poor Jim!</t4646>
<t4647>—Hang me if I know; I'm referring to what happened with the raft.</t4647> <t4648>The old fool made a deal and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the tavern, some clumsy guys had started playing half-dollars with him and had taken every last cent except what he had spent on whiskey, and when I went to take him home late at night and we saw that the raft had disappeared, we said to ourselves: "That little rascal has stolen the raft and escaped down the river."</t4648>
<t4649>—I wasn't going to escape without my black man, was I?</t4649> <t4650>The only black man I had in the world, my only possession.</t4650>
<t4651>—That hadn't occurred to us.</t4651> <t4652>The truth is, I reckon we had come to consider him as our black man; yes, that's it; God knows we had been quite bothered about him.</t4652> <t4653>So when we saw that the raft had disappeared and we were left without a cent, there was no choice but to try "The Unmatched Royalty" again.</t4653> <t4654>And here I am since then, drier than a desert.</t4654> <t4655>Where are those ten cents?</t4655> <t4656>Give them to me.</t4656>
<t4657>I had quite a bit of money, so I gave him ten cents, but I begged him to spend it on something to eat and to give me something, because I had no more money and hadn't eaten since yesterday.</t4657> <t4658>He didn't say a word.</t4658> <t4659>The next moment he threw himself at me saying:</t4659>
<t4660>—Do you think that black guy is going to snitch on us?</t4660> <t4661>If he snitches, we'll skin him alive!</t4661>
<t4662>—How is he going to snitch?</t4662> <t4663>Hasn't he escaped?</t4663>
<t4664>—No!</t4664> <t4665>The old fool sold it and didn't share it with me, and now there's nothing left.</t4665>
<t4666>—He sold him? —I said, and I began to cry—; but he was my black man, so he was my money.</t4666> <t4667>Where is he?</t4667> <t4668>I want my black man.</t4668>
<t4669>—Well, your black man is not going to come and that's it, so stop whining.</t4669> <t4670>Come on: do you think you would dare to snitch on us?</t4670> <t4671>Hang me if I trust you.</t4671> <t4672>Damn, if you were going to snitch on us...</t4672>
<t4673>He fell silent, but he had never seen the duke cast such a terrible look.</t4673> <t4674>I kept crying and said:</t4674>
<t4675>—I don't want to snitch on anyone, and besides, I don't have time to do it; I have to find my black man.</t4675>
<t4676>He seemed annoyed and stayed with the programs fluttering above his arm, thinking and furrowing his brow.</t4676> <t4677>Finally, he said:</t4677>
<t4678>—I'm going to tell you something.</t4678> <t4679>We have to stay here for three days.</t4679> <t4680>If you promise not to snitch and not to let the black guy snitch, I'll tell you where it is.</t4680>
<t4681>So I promised him, and he continued:</t4681>
<t4682>—A farmer named Silas Ph...</t4682>
<t4683>And then he fell silent.</t4683> <t4684>That is, he had started to tell me the truth, but when he fell silent and began to think and reflect, I figured he was changing his mind.</t4684> <t4685>And that was it.</t4685> <t4686>He didn't trust me; he wanted to make sure I wouldn't cause him problems for the entire three days.</t4686> <t4687>So after a moment, he goes and says:</t4687>
<t4688>—The man who bought it is named Abram Foster, Abram G. Foster, and he lives forty miles across the country, on the road to Lafayette.</t4688>
<t4689>—Very well —I said—.</t4689> <t4690>I can cover that in three days.</t4690> <t4691>And I am leaving this very afternoon.</t4691>
<t4692>—No, not a chance, you leave right now, and don't waste time or start chatting around.</t4692> <t4693>Keep your mouth shut and get moving; that way you won't have any problems with us, do you hear me?</t4693>
<t4694>That was the order I wanted to receive and the one I was waiting for.</t4694> <t4695>I wanted freedom to carry out my plans.</t4695>
<t4696>—So get lost —he says—, and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want.</t4696> <t4697>Maybe you'll get him to believe that Jim is your black man, because there are idiots who don't demand documents, or at least that's what I've been told happens here in the South.</t4697> <t4698>And when you tell him that the flyer and the reward are fake, maybe he'll believe you when you explain why they were distributed.</t4698> <t4699>Now get lost and tell him whatever you want, but be careful not to wag your tongue anywhere until you get there.</t4699>
<t4700>So I started walking towards the field.</t4700> <t4701>I didn't look back, but I had the feeling that I was being watched.</t4701> <t4702>But I knew I could make them tired of watching me.</t4702> <t4703>I kept walking towards the field for at least a mile before stopping; then I retraced my steps through the forest towards Phelps' house.</t4703> <t4704>I figured it was best to start with my plan without wasting any time because I wanted to prevent Jim from saying anything until those guys left.</t4704> <t4705>I didn't want trouble with people like that.</t4705> <t4706>I was already fed up with them and wanted to lose sight of them forever.</t4706>
<t4707>Chapter 32</t4707>
<t4708>WHEN I ARRIVED everything was calm, as if it were Sunday, it was hot and the sun was shining; the slaves had gone to the fields and all you could hear was that buzzing of insects and flies in the air that makes you feel as lonely as if the whole world had died and disappeared, and if a breeze blows and makes the leaves tremble, you feel sad because it's as if they were spirits saying something, spirits that have been dead for many years, and you always think they are talking about you.</t4708> <t4709>In general, it makes you want to be dead, and to have finished with everything.</t4709>
<t4710>The Phelps' house was one of those very small cotton plantations, which are all alike.</t4710> <t4711>A log fence around a two-acre yard; an entrance made of sawn logs placed on the ground, like steps of different heights to climb over the fence and for women to mount horses; some tufts of grass in the yard, but generally everything very arid and smooth, like an old worn-out hat; a large double-log house for the whites: logs finished with the holes filled with adobe or mortar and with those separations that are whitewashed from time to time; a round-log kitchen with a wide, open but roofed passage leading to the house, a log cabin for smoking meat behind the kitchen, three small log cabins for the blacks, placed in a row on the other side of the smokehouse, another isolated cabin against the back fence and some sheds on the other side; a lime deposit and a large cauldron in which to boil soap next to the shed; a bench next to the kitchen door, a bucket of water and a gourd; a dog sleeping in the sun; more dogs sleeping on either side, bushes and mulberry trees in a spot next to the fence; on the other side of the fence, an orchard and a watermelon patch, and then the cotton fields and beyond that the woods.</t4711>
<t4712>I turned around and climbed over the back gate next to where the quicklime was, and went to the kitchen.</t4712> <t4713>After a few steps, I heard the dull hum of a spinning wheel and then I realized that I would be better off dead, because it is the loneliest sound in the whole world.</t4713>
<t4714>I went on, without making any concrete plan, trusting only that Providence would put the right words in my mouth when the time came, for I had noticed that Providence always put the exact words in my mouth if I left it alone.</t4714>
<t4715>When I was halfway there, first one dog and then another got up, so naturally I stood in front of them, completely still.</t4715> <t4716>And what a commotion they made!</t4716> <t4717>After a quarter of a minute, you could say that I was like the hub of a wheel and the spokes were the dogs, a circle of fifteen of them revolving around me, with their necks and noses pointed at me, barking and howling, and more kept coming; you could see them jumping over fences and coming out of corners from everywhere.</t4717>
<t4718>From the kitchen ran out a black woman with a rolling pin in her hand, shouting: "Out! You, Tige! You, Spot! Out, I say!"</t4718> <t4719>And she gave a hit first to one and then to the other, who went away howling, and then followed the rest, and after a second half of them came back, wagging their tails and becoming friends with me.</t4719> <t4720>The truth is that dogs are not bad creatures.</t4720>
<t4721>And behind the woman appeared a black girl and two black boys who were wearing nothing but linen shirts and were clinging to their mother's dress, looking at me very shyly from behind her skirts, as they all do.</t4721> <t4722>Then the white woman, who must have been forty-five or fifty years old, ran out of the house, without a hat and with the spindle of the spinning wheel in her hand, and behind her, her white children, who were just as shy as the black ones.</t4722> <t4723>She was grinning from ear to ear, and she goes and says:</t4723>
<t4724>—It's you at last! Right?</t4724>
<t4725>I blurted out a "yes, ma'am" before thinking about it.</t4725>
<t4726>He hugged me and then took both of my hands and squeezed them many times, not stopping from saying: "You don't look as much like your mother as I thought, but the truth is I don't care at all.</t4726> <t4727>I'm so glad to see you!</t4727> <t4728>My God, my God, I could just eat you up!</t4728> <t4729>Kids, this is your cousin Tom!</t4729> <t4730>Come on, say hello to him.</t4730>
<t4731>But they lowered their heads, put their fingers in their mouths, and hid behind their mother's skirts.</t4731> <t4732>Then she continued saying:</t4732>
<t4733>—Lize, quickly, prepare him a hot breakfast right now.</t4733> <t4734>Or did you already have breakfast on the boat?</t4734>
<t4735>I said that I had breakfast on the boat.</t4735> <t4736>Then she went towards the house holding my hand, and the children came behind.</t4736> <t4737>When we arrived, she made me sit in a wicker chair and she sat on a low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and she goes and says:</t4737>
<t4738>—Now I can look at you properly and, God bless me, I have been longing to see you all these years, and finally you have arrived!</t4738> <t4739>We have been waiting for you for two days or more.</t4739> <t4740>Why did it take you so long?</t4740> <t4741>Did the ship run aground?</t4741>
<t4742>—Yes, ma'am... it's just that...</t4742>
<t4743>—Don't call me yes ma'am; call me Aunt Sally.</t4743> <t4744>Where did it run aground?</t4744>
<t4745>I didn't know exactly what to say, because I didn't know if the boat would come upstream or downstream.</t4745> <t4746>But I do many things by instinct, and my instinct said it would come upstream from Orleans more or less.</t4746> <t4747>But that didn't help me much either, because I didn't know the names of the bars in that part.</t4747> <t4748>I saw that I would have to invent a bar or forget the name of the one we had run aground on or...</t4748> <t4749>Then an idea occurred to me and I blurted it out.</t4749>
<t4750>—It wasn't the grounding...</t4750> <t4751>That didn't delay us much.</t4751> <t4752>It was that a cylinder head blew out.</t4752>
<t4753>—My God! Is anyone injured?</t4753>
<t4754>—No, ma'am.</t4754> <t4755>He killed a black man.</t4755>
<t4756>—Well, thank goodness; because sometimes those things kill someone.</t4756> <t4757>Last Christmas it was two years since your uncle Silas came from New Orleans on the old Lally Rook and blew a cylinder head and left a man paralyzed.</t4757> <t4758>And I think he died afterward.</t4758> <t4759>He was a Baptist.</t4759> <t4760>Your uncle Silas knew a family from Baton Rouge that knew his very well.</t4760> <t4761>Yes, now I remember he did indeed die.</t4761> <t4762>He got gangrene and they had to amputate.</t4762> <t4763>But even that didn't save him.</t4763> <t4764>Yes, it was gangrene, that's what it was.</t4764> <t4765>He turned all blue and died with the hope of a glorious resurrection.</t4765> <t4766>They say it was scary to see him.</t4766> <t4767>Your uncle has gone to town every day to look for you, and he just went out again only an hour ago; he must be about to return.</t4767> <t4768>You must have met him on the road, right?</t4768> <t4769>Older now, with a...</t4769>
<t4770>—No, I haven't seen anyone, Aunt Sally.</t4770> <t4771>The boat arrived just at dawn, I left my luggage on the dock and went for a walk around the town and also through the countryside to pass the time and not arrive too early; that's why I came in from the back.</t4771>
<t4772>—To whom did you give the luggage?</t4772>
<t4773>—No one.</t4773>
<t4774>—But, child, they are going to steal it from you!</t4774>
<t4775>—No, where I hid it, I don't think so —I said.</t4775>
<t4776>—How is it that you had breakfast so early on the ship?</t4776>
<t4777>Things were getting difficult, but I responded.</t4777>
<t4778>—The captain saw me up and thought it would be better if I ate something before disembarking, so he took me to the upper cabins, where the officers eat, and gave me everything I wanted.</t4778>
<t4779>I was getting so nervous that I wasn't paying attention.</t4779> <t4780>I was thinking about the children all the time; I wanted to take them away to get some information from them to find out who I was.</t4780> <t4781>But there was no way.</t4781> <t4782>Mrs. Phelps did nothing but talk.</t4782> <t4783>After a while, I got chills all over my body because she said:</t4783>
<t4784>—But here we are talking and you still haven't told me anything about my sister or the others.</t4784> <t4785>Now I'll stop talking and it's your turn; tell me everything, tell me how everyone is, down to the last one, how they're doing, what they're up to, what they've told you to tell me, and everything you remember.</t4785>
<t4786>Well, I understood that I was in real trouble.</t4786> <t4787>Providence had supported me up to that moment, but now it was up to me to manage as best I could.</t4787> <t4788>I saw that it was useless to try to start: I had to confess the truth.</t4788> <t4789>So I said to myself: "Now I have to risk telling the truth again."</t4789> <t4790>I opened my mouth to start speaking, but she grabbed me, hid me behind the bed, and then she says:</t4790>
<t4791>—Here he comes! Lower your head more; good, that's fine, now he can't see you.</t4791> <t4792>Don't let him notice you're here.</t4792> <t4793>I want to play a prank on him.</t4793> <t4794>Kids, don't say a word.</t4794>
<t4795>I saw that I was getting myself into another mess, but there was no point in worrying; there was nothing to do but stay quiet and try to escape when the storm broke out.</t4795>
<t4796>I could barely see the old man when he entered because the bed blocked my view afterward.</t4796> <t4797>Mrs. Phelps jumped and asked:</t4797>
<t4798>—Has he/she arrived?</t4798>
<t4799>—No —her husband replied.</t4799>
<t4800>—Good heavens! —she said—, what could have happened to him?</t4800>
<t4801>—I can't imagine it —said the old man—, and I must confess that I don't feel at ease at all.</t4801>
<t4802>—Calm down! —she said—</t4802> <t4803>I'm about to go crazy!</t4803> <t4804>He must have arrived, it's just that you didn't see him on the way.</t4804> <t4805>I'm sure that's what happened.</t4805> <t4806>Something tells me so.</t4806>
<t4807>—But, Sally, it's impossible that he didn't see it, and you know it.</t4807>
<t4808>—But, oh my God, my God, what will my sister say?</t4808> <t4809>She must have arrived.</t4809> <t4810>It must be that you haven't seen her.</t4810> <t4811>It must...</t4811>
<t4812>—Well, don't worry me more than I already am.</t4812> <t4813>I don't know how the hell to understand it.</t4813> <t4814>I don't know what to think anymore and I don't mind admitting that I'm terrified.</t4814> <t4815>But it's not possible that he arrived because he couldn't have arrived without me seeing him.</t4815> <t4816>Sally, this is horrible, simply horrible... Something must have happened to the ship!</t4816>
<t4817>—Look, Silas! Look over there!</t4817> <t4818>On the road! Is someone coming?</t4818>
<t4819>He jumped to the window next to the head of the bed and gave Mrs. Phelps the opportunity she was looking for.</t4819> <t4820>She leaned at the foot of the bed and gave me a tug to pull me out; and when her husband turned from the window, there she was, all smiling and radiant like the sun, and I beside her, quiet and sweaty.</t4820> <t4821>The old man looks at me and says:</t4821>
<t4822>—But, who is that?</t4822>
<t4823>—Who do you think he is?</t4823>
<t4824>—I have no idea.</t4824> <t4825>Who is it?</t4825>
<t4826>—It's Tom Sawyer!</t4826>
<t4827>I swear I almost fell to the ground!</t4827> <t4828>But I didn't have time to change tactics; the old man grabbed my hand and shook it over and over, and all the while the woman danced around us laughing and crying; then the two of them started asking me loads of questions about Sid and Mary and the rest of the tribe.</t4828>
<t4829>But if they were happy, that was nothing compared to me, because it was like being born again.</t4829> <t4830>I was overjoyed to find out who I was.</t4830> <t4831>Well, they stuck with me for two hours, and finally, when my tongue was so tired that I could hardly move it, I had already told them more things about my family (I mean the Sawyer family) than could have happened to six Sawyer families combined.</t4831> <t4832>And I explained all the details of how a cylinder head had blown at the mouth of the White River and it had taken us three days to fix it.</t4832> <t4833>Which was very good and worked wonderfully, because they didn't know if it took three days to fix it.</t4833> <t4834>If I had told them that we had blown a bolt, they wouldn't have cared.</t4834>
<t4835>Now I felt very calm on one hand and very uneasy on the other.</t4835> <t4836>Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable for me, and it continued to be so until after a while I heard a steamboat coming down the river.</t4836> <t4837>Then I said to myself: "What if Tom Sawyer is on that boat?</t4837> <t4838>What if he arrives at any moment and calls me by my name before I can give him a wink to not say anything?"</t4838>
<t4839>Well, I couldn't let it happen because it would ruin everything.</t4839> <t4840>I had to go to the road and stop it in time.</t4840> <t4841>So I told those two that I would go to town to fetch my luggage.</t4841> <t4842>The old man wanted to come with me, but I told him no, that I could drive the horse myself and that I preferred he didn't trouble himself for me.</t4842>
<t4843>Chapter 33</t4843>
<t4844>SO I SET off towards the town with the cart, and when I was halfway there, I saw another cart coming, and sure enough, it was Tom Sawyer, so I stopped and waited until he arrived.</t4844> <t4845>I said to him: "Stop!", and he stopped next to me, opened his mouth wide, and stayed like that; he swallowed two or three times, just like a priest when his throat gets dry, and then he said:</t4845>
<t4846>—I never did anything bad to you.</t4846> <t4847>And you know it.</t4847> <t4848>So, why have you started chasing me again?</t4848>
<t4849>I replied:</t4849>
<t4850>—I haven't returned... I never left.</t4850>
<t4851>When he heard my voice, he calmed down a bit, but he still wasn't entirely convinced.</t4851> <t4852>He said:</t4852>
<t4853>—Don't do anything bad to me, because I wouldn't do it to you.</t4853> <t4854>Do you swear that you are not a ghost?</t4854>
<t4855>—I swear it —I replied.</t4855>
<t4856>—Well... I...</t4856> <t4857>Well, of course that should be enough, but the truth is I don't understand anything.</t4857> <t4858>Look, have you never been murdered?</t4858>
<t4859>—No.</t4859> <t4860>They never killed me... It was a trick of mine.</t4860> <t4861>Come closer and touch me if you don't believe me.</t4861>
<t4862>That was what he did, and he was convinced, and he was so happy to see me again that he didn't know what to do.</t4862> <t4863>He wanted to find out everything immediately, because it was a great mysterious adventure, so it was what he liked.</t4863> <t4864>But I told him to leave all that for later and told his coachman to wait, and we moved aside a bit and I told him the problem I had and asked him what he thought was best to do.</t4864> <t4865>He said to let him think for a moment and not to tell him anything.</t4865> <t4866>So he kept thinking and thinking, and after a moment he goes and says:</t4866>
<t4867>—Alright; I have it now.</t4867> <t4868>Put my trunk in your cart and say it's yours; and come back slowly, so you arrive at the house around the estimated time; I will retrace my steps a bit to start over and arrive a quarter or half an hour after you, and at first, you don't have to say that you know me.</t4868>
<t4869>I replied:</t4869>
<t4870>—Very well, but wait a moment.</t4870> <t4871>There is something else: something that no one else knows but me, and that is that there is a black man there whom I want to steal to set him free, and his name is Jim; Miss Watson's old Jim.</t4871>
<t4872>And he goes and says:</t4872>
<t4873>—What! But Jim already...</t4873>
<t4874>He stopped and kept thinking about it, and then I go and say:</t4874>
<t4875>—I know what you're going to say.</t4875> <t4876>You're going to say that it's a dirty and vile matter, but what do I care?</t4876> <t4877>I'm vile and I'm going to steal it and I want you to stay quiet and not say anything.</t4877> <t4878>Do you want to?</t4878>
<t4879>His eyes lit up and he said:</t4879>
<t4880>—I'm going to help you steal it!</t4880>
<t4881>I was stunned, as if I had been shot.</t4881> <t4882>That was the most astonishing thing I had ever heard in my life, and I have to say that Tom Sawyer fell a lot in my esteem.</t4882> <t4883>I just couldn't believe it.</t4883> <t4884>Tom turned into a thief of black people!</t4884>
<t4885>—Well, let's go! —I said—.</t4885> <t4886>You're joking.</t4886>
<t4887>—Joking, nothing.</t4887>
<t4888>—Well, then —I said—, joke or not, if you hear anything about a runaway black man, don't forget that you know nothing about him and neither do I.</t4888>
<t4889>Then he took out his trunk and put it in my cart, and he went on his way and I went on mine.</t4889> <t4890>But, naturally, I forgot that I had to go slowly because I was so happy and full of ideas, so I arrived home too early for such a long trip.</t4890> <t4891>The old man was at the door and says:</t4891>
<t4892>—Man, what a marvel!</t4892> <t4893>Who would have thought that mare was capable of running so much!</t4893> <t4894>I wish we had timed her.</t4894> <t4895>And she hasn't sweated a drop, not a single drop.</t4895> <t4896>She is a marvel.</t4896> <t4897>Man, now I wouldn't accept even a hundred dollars for that mare, really, and yet before I would have sold her for fifteen and been quite happy.</t4897>
<t4898>He didn't say anything else.</t4898> <t4899>He was the most innocent and kindest person I have ever seen in my life.</t4899> <t4900>But it wasn't surprising, because he was not only a farmer but also a preacher, and he had a small log church at the back of the plantation that he had built out of his own pocket to serve as a church and a school, and he never charged anything for preaching, and the truth was that he did it very well.</t4900> <t4901>Down in the South, there were many farmer-preachers like him who did the same thing.</t4901>
<t4902>After about half an hour, Tom's cart appeared at the front door and Aunt Sally saw it through the window, because it was only about fifty yards away, and she said:</t4902>
<t4903>—Well, someone has come!</t4903> <t4904>Who could it be?</t4904> <t4905>It seems to be a stranger.</t4905> <t4906>Jimmy —who was one of their children—, run and tell Lize to set another plate for the meal.</t4906>
<t4907>Everyone rushed to the front door because, naturally, strangers don't arrive every year, so they are more interesting than yellow fever.</t4907> <t4908>Tom had already crossed the door and was heading towards the house; the cart was turning towards the town and we were all crowded at the entrance.</t4908> <t4909>Tom was wearing the clothes bought at the store and had an audience, which was what Tom Sawyer liked most in the world.</t4909> <t4910>In such circumstances, it was not difficult for him to put on all the airs he needed.</t4910> <t4911>He was not a boy to arrive meek as a lamb; no, he arrived calmly and with an air of importance, like a ram.</t4911> <t4912>When he got in front of us, he took off his hat very elegantly and very finely, as if it were the lid of a box inside which butterflies were sleeping and he didn't want to disturb them, and he goes and says:</t4912>
<t4913>—Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?</t4913>
<t4914>—No, boy —said the old man—.</t4914> <t4915>I'm sorry to tell you that your driver has deceived you; Nichols' house is about three miles further.</t4915> <t4916>Come in, come in.</t4916>
<t4917>Tom glanced over his shoulder and says:</t4917>
<t4918>—Too late, you can't see it anymore.</t4918>
<t4919>—Yes, he has gone, my son, and you must come in and eat with us, and then we will harness the mare and take you to Nichols' house.</t4919>
<t4920>—Ah, I can't cause you so much trouble; not even think about it.</t4920> <t4921>I'll go on foot... I don't mind the distance.</t4921>
<t4922>—But we are not going to let you go on foot; that would not be Southern hospitality.</t4922> <t4923>Just go on.</t4923>
<t4924>—Yes, please —said Aunt Sally—; it's no trouble at all.</t4924> <t4925>You must stay.</t4925> <t4926>It's three long miles and there's a lot of dust; we can't let you go on foot.</t4926> <t4927>And besides, I've already told them to set another plate when I saw you coming, so you mustn't disappoint us.</t4927> <t4928>Come inside, make yourself at home.</t4928>
<t4929>So Tom thanked them very animatedly and courteously and allowed himself to be persuaded; once inside, he said he was from Hicksville, Ohio, and that his name was William Thompson, and made another bow.</t4929>
<t4930>Well, he didn't stop talking and talking and talking, making up things about Hicksville and all kinds of people that came to his mind, and I was getting nervous and wondering how that was going to help me out of the predicament; finally, while he was still talking, he got up and gave Aunt Sally a kiss right on the mouth and then sat back down in his chair as calmly as ever and was about to continue talking; but Aunt Sally jumped up, wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, and said:</t4930>
<t4931>—You insolent, rude person!</t4931>
<t4932>He seemed to be in pain, and he goes and says:</t4932>
<t4933>—I am surprised, ma'am.</t4933>
<t4934>—Does it surprise you...</t4934> <t4935>But, who do you think I am?</t4935> <t4936>I really feel like grabbing and...</t4936> <t4937>But, what is this about giving me a kiss?</t4937>
<t4938>He seemed to shrink, and said:</t4938>
<t4939>—It wasn't with bad intentions, ma'am.</t4939> <t4940>I didn't mean to upset you, I... I...</t4940> <t4941>I thought you would like it.</t4941>
<t4942>—What an idiot! —he grabbed the spindle of the spinning wheel and it seemed like he was going to hit him with it—.</t4942> <t4943>Why would I like it?</t4943>
<t4944>—Well, I don't know.</t4944> <t4945>It's just that...</t4945> <t4946>It's just that...</t4946> <t4947>They told me it would be like this.</t4947>
<t4948>—They told you it would be like this.</t4948> <t4949>Well, the one who told you is another lunatic.</t4949> <t4950>I've never heard anything like it.</t4950> <t4951>Who told you?</t4951>
<t4952>—Well, everyone.</t4952> <t4953>That's what they said, ma'am.</t4953>
<t4954>She could barely contain herself, her eyes were blazing with anger, and she moved her fingers as if she wanted to scratch him, and she said:</t4954>
<t4955>—Who is everyone?</t4955> <t4956>Give me their names or there will be one less idiot in this world.</t4956>
<t4957>Tom stood up, looking hurried, turning his hat around, and said:</t4957>
<t4958>—I'm sorry, and I didn't expect it.</t4958> <t4959>They told me.</t4959> <t4960>They all told me.</t4960> <t4961>Everyone told me "give her a kiss," and they said she would like it.</t4961> <t4962>Everyone said it, to the last one, but I'm sorry, ma'am, and I won't do it again.</t4962> <t4963>Really, I won't.</t4963>
<t4964>—So you won't do it again, right?</t4964> <t4965>Man, I assure you!</t4965>
<t4966>—No, I mean it; I will never do it again until you ask me to.</t4966>
<t4967>—Until I ask you for it!</t4967> <t4968>Well, I have never heard anything like it in my entire life!</t4968> <t4969>I assure you that you are going to be the dumbest Methuselah in creation before I ask you for anything like that.</t4969> <t4970>..</t4970> <t4971>Neither to you nor to anyone like you.</t4971>
<t4972>—Well —says Tom—, I am very surprised.</t4972> <t4973>I don't know why, but I don't understand it.</t4973> <t4974>They said she would like it and I believed it too.</t4974> <t4975>But... —he fell silent and slowly looked from side to side, as if trying to find a friendly gaze somewhere, and finally stopped at the old man and asked him—: Didn't you think, sir, that she would like me to kiss her?</t4975>
<t4976>—Well, no; I... I... don't think so.</t4976>
<t4977>Then he kept looking until he stopped at me and asked:</t4977>
<t4978>—Tom, didn't you think that Aunt Sally would open her arms and say, "Sid Sawyer..."?</t4978>
<t4979>—My God! —she said, interrupting him and jumping towards him—, insolent creature, to deceive her like that... —and she was about to give him a hug but he pushed her away and said:</t4979>
<t4980>—No, first you have to ask me for it.</t4980>
<t4981>So she did not waste any time, but asked for it and filled it with hugs and kisses over and over again, and then handed it to the old man, who did the same.</t4981> <t4982>And when they calmed down a bit, she said:</t4982>
<t4983>—But my God, I have never seen such a surprise.</t4983> <t4984>We were not expecting you at all, only Tom.</t4984> <t4985>My sister never told me that anyone else was coming besides him.</t4985>
<t4986>—Because he only thought of sending Tom —he said—, but I begged and begged and at the last moment he let me come too; so when we were going down the river, Tom and I thought it would be a great surprise if he arrived at the house first and then I appeared suddenly, pretending to be a stranger.</t4986> <t4987>But we were wrong, Aunt Sally.</t4987> <t4988>This house is not safe for strangers.</t4988>
<t4989>—No, not even for insolent children, Sid.</t4989> <t4990>I should have slapped you; God knows how long it’s been since I’ve had such a surprise.</t4990> <t4991>But it doesn’t matter, I don’t care about the form: I’m willing to endure a thousand jokes like this as long as you’re here.</t4991> <t4992>What a performance you’ve put on!</t4992> <t4993>I won’t deny it, I was almost petrified with astonishment when you kissed me.</t4993>
<t4994>We dined in that wide passageway open between the house and the kitchen, and on the table, there was enough for seven families and everything was hot; none of that fibrous and tough meat that is kept in an icebox in a damp basement all night and in the morning tastes just like a piece of old, cold cannibal.</t4994> <t4995>Uncle Silas said a very long grace, but it was worth it, and things didn't get cold one bit, as I've seen happen many times with that kind of interruption.</t4995>
<t4996>We spent the whole afternoon talking; Tom and I were alert the entire time, but it was all for nothing, because they didn't say a word about the runaway black man and we were afraid to bring up the subject ourselves.</t4996> <t4997>But that night, at dinner time, one of the boys goes and says:</t4997>
<t4998>—Father, can't Tom, Sid, and I go to see the show?</t4998>
<t4999>—No —answered the old man—.</t4999> <t5000>I think there won't be one, and even if there were, you couldn't go, because the runaway black man has told Burton and me everything that happens in that scandalous show, and Burton said he was going to tell the people, so I think we've driven those boastful loafers out of town.</t5000>
<t5001>That's how things were!</t5001> <t5002>But we couldn't do anything.</t5002> <t5003>Tom and I had to sleep in the same room and in the same bed, so since we were tired, we said goodnight and went to bed immediately after dinner. We went out through the window and climbed down the lightning rod to go to town, as I didn't think anyone was going to say a word to the king and the duke, so if I didn't run to warn them, they were surely going to get into a big mess.</t5003>
<t5004>On the way, Tom told me that everyone had believed the story about my murder, and that father had disappeared immediately and hadn't returned, and the commotion that ensued when Jim escaped. I told Tom the whole story of our scoundrels from "The Peerless Royalty," and everything I had time to tell him about our raft journey. When we reached the town, towards the center (it must have been around eight-thirty), a bunch of people appeared running with torches, shouting and howling, banging pots and blowing horns; we stepped aside to let them pass, and I saw that they were carrying the king and the duke mounted on a rail. That is, I knew they were the king and the duke, although they had been smeared with tar and feathers and didn't look like beings from this world, but rather a kind of monstrous feather dusters.</t5004> <t5005>Well, I regretted seeing them and felt sorry for those poor rascals, as if I couldn't hold anything against them anymore.</t5005> <t5006>It was horrible to watch.</t5006> <t5007>Human beings can be terribly cruel to one another.</t5007>
<t5008>We saw that we had arrived late, that we couldn't do anything anymore.</t5008> <t5009>We asked some of the stragglers what had happened and they said that everyone had gone to the performance with innocent faces and had remained so calm and quiet until the poor king was in the middle of his antics on stage; then someone gave a signal and the entire audience stood up and rushed at them.</t5009>
<t5010>So we went back home, and I no longer felt as proud as before, but rather shrunk and ashamed and as if I were to blame, even though I hadn't done anything.</t5010> <t5011>But that's what always happens; it doesn't matter whether one does things right or wrong, because the conscience has no common sense and it always gets on top of you no matter what happens.</t5011> <t5012>If I had a yellow dog that wasn't smarter than people's conscience, I would poison it.</t5012> <t5013>It takes up more space than everything else, and yet, I don't know why, it's good for nothing.</t5013> <t5014>Tom Sawyer says the same thing.</t5014>
<t5015>Chapter 34</t5015>
<t5016>WE STOPPED TALKING and started thinking.</t5016> <t5017>After a while, Tom says:</t5017>
<t5018>—Hey, Huck, we're fools for not having thought of it before!</t5018> <t5019>I bet I know where Jim is.</t5019>
<t5020>—No! Where?</t5020>
<t5021>—In that cabin next to the one with the quicklime.</t5021> <t5022>Listen to this: when we were eating, didn't you see a black man taking some food?</t5022>
<t5023>—Yes.</t5023>
<t5024>—Who do you think the food was for?</t5024>
<t5025>—For a dog.</t5025>
<t5026>—Me too.</t5026> <t5027>Well, it wasn't for a dog.</t5027>
<t5028>—Why?</t5028>
<t5029>—Because he was also carrying a watermelon.</t5029>
<t5030>—It's true, I already saw it.</t5030> <t5031>Imagine that it didn't occur to me that dogs don't eat watermelons.</t5031> <t5032>That shows that one can see things and not see them at the same time.</t5032>
<t5033>—Well, the black man opened the padlock when he entered and locked it again when he left.</t5033> <t5034>When we got up from the table, he returned a key to the uncle, and I bet it was the same one.</t5034> <t5035>The watermelon indicates that he is a man; the lock, that he is imprisoned, and it is unlikely that there are two prisoners on such a small plantation where all the people are so good and so kind.</t5035> <t5036>The prisoner is Jim.</t5036> <t5037>Very well, I'm glad I figured it out like the detectives; otherwise, I wouldn't like it.</t5037> <t5038>Now you have to start thinking about it and come up with a plan to steal Jim; I'll come up with another one and we'll go with the one we like best.</t5038>
<t5039>What a head for just being a boy!</t5039> <t5040>If I had Tom Sawyer's head, I wouldn't trade it for being a duke, a steamboat pilot, a circus clown, or anything else I could think of.</t5040> <t5041>I started thinking of a plan, but just to do something.</t5041> <t5042>I knew very well where the best plan was going to come from.</t5042> <t5043>Right away Tom goes and says:</t5043>
<t5044>—Ready?</t5044>
<t5045>—Yes —I replied.</t5045>
<t5046>—Well, tell me about it.</t5046>
<t5047>—My plan is this —I said—.</t5047> <t5048>We can easily find out if it's Jim who is there.</t5048> <t5049>Then, tomorrow night I take out my canoe and we bring my raft from the island.</t5049> <t5050>On the first dark night we have, we take the key from the old man's pants when he goes to bed and we head down the river with Jim, hiding during the day and navigating at night, like Jim and I used to do before.</t5050> <t5051>Wouldn't that plan work?</t5051>
<t5052>—Work?</t5052> <t5053>Of course it would work, like two and two make four.</t5053> <t5054>But it's too simple; it says nothing.</t5054> <t5055>What good is a plan that doesn't pose any problem?</t5055> <t5056>It's too bland.</t5056> <t5057>Man, Huck, it wouldn't create more sensation than if it were a robbery in a soap factory.</t5057>
<t5058>I didn't say anything, because I didn't expect anything different, but I knew very well that when he had his plan ready, none of those objections could be made.</t5058>
<t5059>And so it happened.</t5059> <t5060>He told me what it was and in a moment I understood that it was worth fifteen of mine in terms of elegance, and that it would leave Jim just as free as my plan, and that it could also get us all killed.</t5060> <t5061>So I was very happy and said we could go ahead with it.</t5061> <t5062>I don't need to recount here what it was because I knew it would keep changing.</t5062> <t5063>I knew he would change it at every moment as we progressed, adding new adventures whenever he had a chance.</t5063> <t5064>And so he did.</t5064>
<t5065>Well, there was one thing that was beyond doubt, and that was that Tom Sawyer was serious and indeed was going to help steal the black man to free him.</t5065> <t5066>That was what left me astonished.</t5066> <t5067>This was a boy who was respectable and well-raised and who had a reputation to lose, and back home he had a family also with a reputation, and he was smart and not a fool, and he knew things, he was not ignorant, and he was not mean but kind, and yet there he was without any pride or sanctimoniousness or feelings, ready to get involved in such a matter and to fill himself with shame and fill his family with shame, in front of everyone.</t5067> <t5068>I couldn't understand it at all.</t5068> <t5069>It was absurd and I realized that I would have to tell him and show him that I was a good friend of his and let him leave it where it was and save himself.</t5069> <t5070>And I started to tell him, but he made me be quiet and replied:</t5070>
<t5071>—Do you think I don't know what I'm doing? Don't I know what I'm doing in general?</t5071>
<t5072>—Yes.</t5072>
<t5073>—Didn't I say I was going to help rob the black man?</t5073>
<t5074>—Yes.</t5074>
<t5075>—Well, that's that.</t5075>
<t5076>He didn't say anything more, and neither did I.</t5076> <t5077>It wasn't worth it anymore, because when he said he was going to do something, he always did it.</t5077> <t5078>But even though I didn't understand how he was willing to get involved in something like that, I left it and didn't worry about it anymore.</t5078> <t5079>If he was determined to do it, I couldn't stop him.</t5079>
<t5080>When we returned, the house was completely dark and silent, so we went to the cabin next to where the quicklime was to examine it.</t5080> <t5081>We crossed the yard to see what the dogs were doing.</t5081> <t5082>They already knew us and made no more noise than any country dog would when someone appears at night.</t5082> <t5083>When we arrived at the cabin, we looked at the front and both sides, and from the side I didn't know (which faced north), we saw the square hole of a window, quite high, with a single wooden plank nailed over it.</t5083> <t5084>I go and say:</t5084>
<t5085>—This is very good.</t5085> <t5086>That hole is big enough for Jim to get out if we pull off the board.</t5086> <t5087>And then Tom says:</t5087>
<t5088>—That's easier than walking and simpler than fooling a fool.</t5088> <t5089>I'd say we can find a slightly more complicated way, Huck Finn.</t5089>
<t5090>—Well, then —I replied—.</t5090> <t5091>What do you think if we make a hole between the logs like that time I was murdered?</t5091>
<t5092>—That's something —he said—.</t5092> <t5093>It's mysterious, complicated, and fine, but I'm sure we can find something that lasts at least twice as long.</t5093> <t5094>There's no rush, let's keep looking.</t5094>
<t5095>Between the cabin and the fence, at the back, there was a shed attached to the cabin by the roof and made of wooden planks.</t5095> <t5096>It was as long as the cabin, but narrow: only about six meters wide.</t5096> <t5097>The door was on the south side and had a padlock.</t5097> <t5098>Tom went to the soap cauldron and started searching, and came back with that iron thing used to lift the lid, so he pried off one of the padlock's handles.</t5098> <t5099>The chain fell off, we opened the door and went in, closed it, and when we lit a match we saw that the shed was only built next to the cabin, with no passage to it, that it had no floor, and there was nothing but a few rusty hoes and shovels, some picks, and a broken plow.</t5099> <t5100>The match went out and we left and put the handle back on, so the door was closed just as well as before.</t5100> <t5101>Tom was delighted, and he said:</t5101>
<t5102>—Now everything is in order.</t5102> <t5103>We are going to take him out through a tunnel.</t5103> <t5104>It will take us a week!</t5104>
<t5105>Then we went to the house and I entered through the back door (you just have to pull a leather cord, because they don't lock the doors there), but Tom Sawyer didn't think it was romantic enough, and the only thing that would do for him was to climb up the lightning rod.</t5105> <t5106>But after climbing halfway up three times and failing and falling all three times, and almost breaking his head the last time, he thought it would be better to give up, but after resting he decided he would try one more time to see how it would go, and that time he managed to make it.</t5106>
<t5107>In the morning we got up at dawn and went down to the cabins of the black people to pet the dogs and make friends with the black person who was bringing food to Jim, if it was Jim he was bringing it to.</t5107> <t5108>The black people had just finished breakfast and were starting to go to the fields, and Jim's black person was filling a metal bowl with bread and meat and other things, and while the others were leaving, they brought him the key to the house.</t5108>
<t5109>The black man had a friendly face, very smiling, and wore his hair all tied up in curls with pieces of thread.</t5109> <t5110>It was to ward off witches.</t5110> <t5111>He said that those nights the witches were giving him a hard time and making him see all kinds of strange things and hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and that he believed he had never been bewitched for so long in his entire life.</t5111> <t5112>He got so nervous talking about his problems that he forgot everything he had to do.</t5112> <t5113>Then Tom said to him:</t5113>
<t5114>—Who is that food for?</t5114> <t5115>Are you going to feed the dogs?</t5115>
<t5116>The black man began to smile slowly until his face was filled with it, like when a brick is thrown into a mud puddle, and he said:</t5116>
<t5117>—Yes, little master Sid, a dog.</t5117> <t5118>A very curious dog.</t5118> <t5119>Do you want to come see it?</t5119>
<t5120>—Yes.</t5120>
<t5121>I gave Tom a nudge and whispered to him:</t5121>
<t5122>—Are you going there at dawn?</t5122> <t5123>That wasn't the plan.</t5123>
<t5124>—No, it wasn't, but now it is the plan.</t5124>
<t5125>So, damn it, there we went, but I didn't like it one bit.</t5125> <t5126>When we arrived, you could hardly see anything because it was so dark, but there was Jim, without a doubt, and he could see us, and he shouted:</t5126>
<t5127>—But, Huck! My God!</t5127> <t5128>Isn't that Tom's place?</t5128>
<t5129>I knew what was going to happen, it was what I expected.</t5129> <t5130>I didn't know what to do, and even if I did, I wouldn't have done it, because the black man appeared saying:</t5130>
<t5131>—By all the saints!</t5131> <t5132>Does he know you, young gentlemen?</t5132>
<t5133>Now it could be seen quite well.</t5133> <t5134>Tom looked at the black man, very intently and as if wondering something, and then he said:</t5134>
<t5135>—Who knows us?</t5135>
<t5136>—Well, this runaway black man.</t5136>
<t5137>—I don't think so; but, why did it occur to you?</t5137>
<t5138>—Why? Didn't you just say that you knew them?</t5138>
<t5139>Tom goes and says, seemingly surprised:</t5139>
<t5140>—Well, this is certainly curious.</t5140> <t5141>Who said anything?</t5141> <t5142>When did they say it? What did they say? —and he turns to me, very calmly, and says to me—: Did you hear anyone say anything?</t5142>
<t5143>Naturally, I could only say one thing, so I replied:</t5143>
<t5144>—No; I haven't heard anyone say anything.</t5144>
<t5145>Then he turns to Jim and looks him up and down as if he had never seen him before and asks: "Did you say something?"</t5145>
<t5146>—No, sir —says Jim—; I haven't said anything, sir.</t5146>
<t5147>—Not a word?</t5147>
<t5148>—No, sir, I haven't said a single word.</t5148>
<t5149>—Have you seen us before now?</t5149>
<t5150>—No, sir; not that I know of.</t5150>
<t5151>So Tom turns to the black man, who was all flustered and confused, and says, very sternly:</t5151>
<t5152>—But, what's wrong with you? Why did you think someone said something?</t5152>
<t5153>—Oh, it's those damned witches, young master, and I wish I had died, truly.</t5153> <t5154>They're always up to those things, young master, and they almost scare me to death.</t5154> <t5155>Please, don't tell anyone, young master, or old Mr. Silas will scold me because he says witches don't exist.</t5155> <t5156>I wish he were here now...</t5156> <t5157>Let's see what he would say!</t5157> <t5158>I'm sure he wouldn't find a way to explain it this time.</t5158> <t5159>Stubborn people die of stubbornness; they never want to look at things to see what's really happening, and when someone sees it and tells them, they go and don't believe it.</t5159>
<t5160>Tom gave him ten cents and told him that we wouldn't tell anyone and that he should go buy more thread to tie his hair, and then he looks at Jim and goes and says:</t5160>
<t5161>—I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this black man.</t5161> <t5162>If I caught a black man ungrateful enough to escape, I wouldn't turn him in; I would hang him myself.</t5162>
<t5163>And while the black man went to the door to look at the ten-cent coin and bite it to see if it was good, he whispered to Jim in a low voice:</t5163>
<t5164>—Don't let them find out that you know us.</t5164> <t5165>And if you hear digging at night, it's us coming to set you free.</t5165>
<t5166>Jim had no time other than to grab our hands and squeeze them.</t5166> <t5167>Then the black man returned and we said we would come back again if he wanted, and he said yes, especially if it was at night, because the witches attacked him at night, and then it was really convenient for him to have people by his side.</t5167>
<t5168>Chapter 35</t5168>
<t5169>THERE WAS STILL almost an hour left before breakfast, so we went to the forest because Tom said we needed some light to see while we dug, but a lantern gave too much and could get us into trouble, so we needed to gather a bunch of that phosphorescent rotten wood they call "foxfire" that only gives off a kind of soft glow when placed in a dark spot.</t5169> <t5170>We gathered a lot, hid it among the grass, and sat down to rest, when Tom suddenly says, sounding displeased:</t5170>
<t5171>—Damn it, all of this is so easy it's disgusting.</t5171> <t5172>That's why it's so hard to organize a complicated plan.</t5172> <t5173>There's no guard to drug, and there should be a guard.</t5173> <t5174>Not even a dog to give something to make it sleep.</t5174> <t5175>And then, Jim is chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the bedpost; but you just have to lift the bed and remove the chain!</t5175> <t5176>And Uncle Silas trusts everyone.</t5176> <t5177>He sends the key to that scatterbrained black man and doesn't send anyone to watch over him.</t5177> <t5178>Jim could have escaped through that window by now, except he can't run with a ten-foot chain on his leg.</t5178> <t5179>Damn it, Huck, it's the most absurd system I've ever seen.</t5179> <t5180>You have to invent all the difficulties.</t5180> <t5181>Well, we can't avoid it, we have to do the best we can with the material we have.</t5181> <t5182>In any case, we have something left: it's more honorable to get him out amidst difficulties and dangers when the people who had the obligation to create them didn't, and one had to invent them by their own means.</t5182> <t5183>Just think about that lantern thing.</t5183> <t5184>If we only see the facts themselves, we simply have to pretend that the lantern thing is dangerous.</t5184> <t5185>But we could work with a torch procession if we wanted to, I think!</t5185> <t5186>Now that I think about it, we have to find something that can act as a saw as soon as we can.</t5186>
<t5187>—Why do we need a saw?</t5187>
<t5188>—Why do we need a saw?</t5188> <t5189>Don't we have to saw off the leg of Jim's bed to remove the chain?</t5189>
<t5190>—But you said that it's enough to lift the bed and pull the chain...</t5190>
<t5191>—Well, that's typical of you, Huck Finn.</t5191> <t5192>You come up with the same ideas as a schoolboy.</t5192> <t5193>Haven't you ever read a book in your life?</t5193> <t5194>The Baron Trenck, or Casanova, Benvenuto Cellini, or Henry IV, or any of those heroes?</t5194> <t5195>Who has ever heard of freeing a prisoner in such a simple way?</t5195> <t5196>No, the way the best authorities do it is to saw the bed leg in two and leave it like that and eat the sawdust, so they can't find it, and put some dust and grease around the spot, so that not even the sharpest steward perceives the slightest sign that it has been sawed and believes that the bed leg is perfectly fine.</t5196> <t5197>Then, the night you're ready, you kick the leg and the bed falls, you take off the chain and that's it.</t5197> <t5198>All you have to do is take the rope ladder to the walls, go down it, break your leg in the moat, because rope ladders are always nineteen feet short, you know, and there are the horses and trusted vassals who pick you up, mount you, and take you to your Languedoc or your Navarre or wherever you were born.</t5198> <t5199>It's a thrill, Huck.</t5199> <t5200>I wish this cabin had a moat.</t5200> <t5201>If there's time, the night of the escape we'll dig one.</t5201>
<t5202>And I go and say:</t5202>
<t5203>—Why do we need a pit when we're going to take it out from under the cabin?</t5203>
<t5204>But he didn't hear me.</t5204> <t5205>He had forgotten about me and everything else.</t5205> <t5206>He had his chin resting on his hand and was thinking.</t5206> <t5207>After a moment, he sighs and shakes his head; then he sighs again and says:</t5207>
<t5208>—No, that wouldn't be right; it's not entirely necessary.</t5208>
<t5209>—What? —I asked.</t5209>
<t5210>—Man, cut off Jim's leg —he answered me.</t5210>
<t5211>—Darn! —I said—, I don't see any need.</t5211> <t5212>And besides, why do you want to cut off his leg?</t5212>
<t5213>—Well, that's what some of the most authoritative authors do.</t5213> <t5214>They can't tear off the chain, so they cut off the hand and pull.</t5214> <t5215>And a leg would be even better.</t5215> <t5216>But we will have to give up on that.</t5216> <t5217>In this case, there isn't enough need, and besides, Jim is black and wouldn't understand the motives or the European custom, so we'll let it go.</t5217> <t5218>But, on the other hand, we can do something else: we can tear the sheets into strips and make a very easy rope ladder for him.</t5218> <t5219>And we can send it to him inside a cake; it's almost always done that way.</t5219> <t5220>I've eaten worse cakes.</t5220>
<t5221>—But, Tom Sawyer, what things you say —I commented—; a rope ladder is of no use to Jim.</t5221>
<t5222>—It has to be worth something to him.</t5222> <t5223>More like, what things you say; you don't know anything about this.</t5223> <t5224>He needs a rope ladder; it happens to everyone.</t5224>
<t5225>—What the hell is he going to do with her?</t5225>
<t5226>—What to do with it?</t5226> <t5227>You can hide it in the bed, can't you?</t5227> <t5228>That's what everyone does, and he has to do it too.</t5228> <t5229>Huck, it seems like you never want to do things right; you want to make it up every time.</t5229> <t5230>Suppose he does nothing with it.</t5230> <t5231>Doesn't he have it there in the bed to leave a clue when it's gone?</t5231> <t5232>And don't you think they'll look for clues?</t5232> <t5233>Of course they will.</t5233> <t5234>And, don't you plan to leave them any?</t5234> <t5235>That would be great, I assure you!</t5235> <t5236>I've never heard anything like it.</t5236>
<t5237>—Well —I said—, if that's part of the rules and he needs it, then we'll make one for him, because I don't want to break any rules; but I'm telling you one thing, Tom Sawyer, if we start tearing up sheets to make a ladder for Jim, we're going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally, you can be sure of that.</t5237> <t5238>It seems to me that a ladder made of walnut bark costs nothing and doesn't ruin anything, and it can be hidden just as well inside a cake and concealed in a straw mattress as any rope ladder, and as for Jim, he has no experience, so he doesn't care what kind of...</t5238>
<t5239>—Oh, gosh, Huck Finn, if I were as ignorant as you, I would keep my mouth shut, I assure you.</t5239> <t5240>Who has ever heard of a state prisoner escaping with a walnut bark ladder?</t5240> <t5241>It's completely ridiculous.</t5241>
<t5242>—Well, alright, Tom, do it as you like, but if you want to take my advice, let him borrow one of the sheets that are hanging out to dry.</t5242>
<t5243>He said he was fine, and that gave him another idea, and he said:</t5243>
<t5244>—Borrow a shirt as well.</t5244>
<t5245>—Why do we want a shirt?</t5245>
<t5246>—So that Jim writes a diary.</t5246>
<t5247>—Diary, your grandma... Jim doesn't know how to write.</t5247>
<t5248>—Let's suppose he doesn't know...</t5248> <t5249>He can make marks on the shirt, can't he?</t5249> <t5250>Especially if we make a pen for him with an old pewter spoon or with a piece of an old barrel stave.</t5250>
<t5251>—But, Tom, we can pluck a feather from a goose, and it turns out better, and faster, too.</t5251>
<t5252>—Prisoners don't have geese running around the dungeons to pluck feathers from, you fool.</t5252> <t5253>They always make the quills from the hardest, most difficult, and most complicated piece of an old copper candlestick or something they can get their hands on, and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to sharpen it, because they have to do it by rubbing it against the wall.</t5253> <t5254>They wouldn't use a goose feather even if they had one.</t5254> <t5255>It's not right.</t5255>
<t5256>—Well, then, what do we use to make the ink?</t5256>
<t5257>—Many do it with iron rust and tears, but those are the more common prisoners and women; the most authoritative authors use their own blood.</t5257> <t5258>Jim can do it, and when he wants to send any ordinary mysterious message so the world knows where he is captive, he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out the window.</t5258> <t5259>That’s what the Man in the Iron Mask always did, and besides, it turns out great.</t5259>
<t5260>—Jim doesn't have any tin plates.</t5260> <t5261>They feed him in a bowl.</t5261>
<t5262>—That doesn't matter, we can get some for you.</t5262>
<t5263>—And no one will be able to read what it says on the plate.</t5263>
<t5264>—That has nothing to do with the matter, Huck Finn.</t5264> <t5265>All he has to do is write on the plate and throw it.</t5265> <t5266>It doesn't need to be read.</t5266> <t5267>But half the time, you can't read anything that state prisoners write on a tin plate, or anywhere else.</t5267>
<t5268>—Well, then, what's the point of ruining those dishes?</t5268>
<t5269>—But, damn it, they are not the prisoner's dishes.</t5269>
<t5270>—But they belong to someone, don't they?</t5270>
<t5271>—Well, let's suppose so.</t5271> <t5272>What difference does it make to the prisoner?</t5272>
<t5273>And then he stopped because we heard the breakfast horn sounding.</t5273> <t5274>So we went to the house.</t5274>
<t5275>That morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt from the clothesline and found an old sack to put them in; we went down to get the "fox fire" and put that in the sack too.</t5275> <t5276>I said that it was borrowing, because that's what father always called it, but Tom said it wasn't borrowing, it was stealing.</t5276> <t5277>He said we were pretending to be prisoners and that prisoners don't care how they get things as long as they get them and that no one minds.</t5277> <t5278>It's not a crime for a prisoner to steal what he needs to escape, Tom said; it's his right, and as long as we were pretending to be prisoners, we had every right to steal anything around if it helped us get out of jail.</t5278> <t5279>He said that if we weren't prisoners it would be very different, and that it was mean and low to steal when you weren't a prisoner.</t5279> <t5280>So we agreed to steal anything that would be useful to us.</t5280> <t5281>And yet, one day after that, he made a huge fuss when I stole a watermelon from the negroes' garden and ate it, and he made me go give the negroes ten cents without explaining why.</t5281> <t5282>Tom said that what he meant was that we could steal anything we needed.</t5282> <t5283>"Well," I said, "I needed the watermelon."</t5283> <t5284>But he said I didn't need it to get out of jail; that was the difference.</t5284> <t5285>He said that if I had wanted to hide a knife inside it and pass it to Jim to kill the guard with, that would have been fine.</t5285> <t5286>So I let it go, though I didn't see the point of pretending to be a prisoner if I had to think about such difficult distinctions every time I saw a chance to take a watermelon.</t5286>
<t5287>Well, as I was saying, that morning we waited until everyone went to work and no one was seen in the yard.</t5287> <t5288>Then Tom took the sack to the shed while I stayed a few steps behind to keep watch.</t5288> <t5289>After a while, he came out and we sat down to talk on the woodpile.</t5289> <t5290>He goes and says:</t5290>
<t5291>—Now everything is in order, except for the tools, and that's easy.</t5291>
<t5292>—Tools? —I asked.</t5292>
<t5293>—Yes.</t5293>
<t5294>—Tools for what?</t5294>
<t5295>—Man, to dig.</t5295> <t5296>We aren't going to make a tunnel with our teeth, right?</t5296>
<t5297>—Don't we have enough with those old picks and shovels to dig out a black man?</t5297>
<t5298>He turned towards me, with a face so sorrowful it made you want to cry, and then he says:</t5298>
<t5299>—Huck Finn, have you ever heard in your life of a prisoner who has picks and shovels and all those conveniences in the closet to make a tunnel?</t5299> <t5300>What I want to ask you, assuming you still have a minimum of reason, is what motive would that be to make him a hero.</t5300> <t5301>Man, they could also lend him the key and be done with it.</t5301> <t5302>Picks and shovels...</t5302> <t5303>But they wouldn't even give those to a king.</t5303>
<t5304>—Well, then —I said—, if we don't need picks and shovels, what do we need?</t5304>
<t5305>—A pair of kitchen knives.</t5305>
<t5306>—To make a tunnel underneath that cabin?</t5306>
<t5307>—Yes.</t5307>
<t5308>—Damn it, Tom, that's nonsense.</t5308>
<t5309>—It doesn't matter if it's nonsense, it's the right thing to do and it's how things are done.</t5309> <t5310>There is no other way that I know of, and I've read all the books that provide information about these things.</t5310> <t5311>They always do it with a knife, and not by digging in the ground, mind you; usually, it's in stone.</t5311> <t5312>It takes them weeks and weeks and weeks, and all the time without stopping and without stopping.</t5312> <t5313>You only have to look at one of those prisoners from the underground dungeons of Deef Castle, in the port of Marseille, who made a tunnel that way; how long do you think he spent digging?</t5313>
<t5314>—I don't know.</t5314>
<t5315>—Well, then make a guess.</t5315>
<t5316>—I don't know.</t5316> <t5317>A month and a half.</t5317>
<t5318>—Thirty-seven years...</t5318> <t5319>And it came out in China.</t5319> <t5320>That's what is right.</t5320> <t5321>I wish the foundation of that fortress were made of stone.</t5321>
<t5322>—Jim doesn't know anyone in China.</t5322>
<t5323>—What does that have to do with anything?</t5323> <t5324>Neither does that guy.</t5324> <t5325>But you always go off on tangents.</t5325> <t5326>Why don't you talk about the main issue?</t5326>
<t5327>—Well...</t5327> <t5328>I don't care where he comes out, as long as he comes out; and I reckon Jim doesn't either.</t5328> <t5329>But anyway, there's another thing: Jim is too old to hold out until we make a tunnel with a knife.</t5329> <t5330>He won't last that long.</t5330>
<t5331>—Well, it will last.</t5331> <t5332>You don't think it's going to take us thirty-seven years to make a tunnel in the ground, do you?</t5332>
<t5333>—How long will it take us, Tom?</t5333>
<t5334>—Well, we can't risk taking as long as we should, because maybe Uncle Silas won't take that long to receive news from New Orleans.</t5334> <t5335>He will find out that Jim is not from there.</t5335> <t5336>Then what he will do is put up a notice about Jim, or something like that.</t5336> <t5337>So we can't risk taking as long in the tunnel as we should.</t5337> <t5338>To do it right, I figure we would need to take a couple of years; but we can't.</t5338> <t5339>With things so up in the air, what I recommend is that we start digging for real as fast as we can and then we can tell ourselves that it took thirty-seven years.</t5339> <t5340>Then we can get him out and take him away quickly as soon as there's an alarm.</t5340> <t5341>Yes, I figure that's the best.</t5341>
<t5342>—Well, it makes sense —I said—.</t5342> <t5343>Pretending it was thirty-seven years is no trouble; there's no problem, and if necessary, I don't mind pretending it took us one hundred and fifty years.</t5343> <t5344>It's no effort for me if I set my mind to it.</t5344> <t5345>So I'm going to go get a couple of kitchen knives.</t5345>
<t5346>—Find yourself three —he says—; we need one to turn it into a saw.</t5346>
<t5347>—Tom, if it doesn't go against the rules or against the religion that I suggest it to you —I said—, there is an old and rusty saw half-covered under the shed that is behind the meat smoker.</t5347>
<t5348>He looked at me as if tired and discouraged and said:</t5348>
<t5349>—You can't be taught anything, Huck.</t5349> <t5350>Go get the knives, and make it three —and so I did.</t5350>
<t5351>Chapter 36</t5351>
<t5352>THAT NIGHT, as soon as we calculated that everyone had fallen asleep, we climbed down the lightning rod, locked ourselves in the shed, took out our pile of "foxfire," and got to work.</t5352> <t5353>We cleared everything around us, about four or five feet along the bottom of the trunk.</t5353> <t5354>Tom said we were right behind Jim's bed and that we would dig underneath, and when we got there no one would notice there was a hole, because Jim's quilt hung almost to the floor and you would have to lift it to look underneath to see it.</t5354> <t5355>So we started digging with the knives until almost midnight, when we felt extremely tired, with our hands full of blisters, and yet you could hardly notice what we had done.</t5355> <t5356>Finally, I said:</t5356>
<t5357>—This is not going to last thirty-seven years; this job is for thirty-eight years, Tom Sawyer.</t5357>
<t5358>He said nothing.</t5358> <t5359>But he sighed and immediately stopped digging, and then I saw that he was thinking for a while.</t5359> <t5360>Then he said:</t5360>
<t5361>—This isn't working, it's not going to work.</t5361> <t5362>If we were prisoners it would work, because we would have all the years we wanted without any rush, and we could only dig for a few minutes a day, while the guard changed, so we wouldn't get blisters on our hands, and we could keep going constantly, year after year, and do it well, the way things should be done.</t5362> <t5363>But we can't waste time, we have to hurry; we don't have that much time.</t5363> <t5364>If we spend another night like this, we would have to rest for a week for our hands to heal; it would take us all that time to touch a kitchen knife again.</t5364>
<t5365>—So, what are we going to do, Tom?</t5365>
<t5366>—I'm going to tell you.</t5366> <t5367>It's not right, and it's not moral, and I wouldn't like it to be known, but it's the only way: we have to take it out with the picks and pretend they are kitchen knives.</t5367>
<t5368>—That's the way to talk! —I said—.</t5368> <t5369>You're thinking better and better, Tom Sawyer.</t5369> <t5370>What matters are the picks, whether they are moral or not, and as for me, I don't give a damn about morality.</t5370> <t5371>When it occurs to me to steal a black person, or a watermelon, or a Sunday school book, I don't care much about how as long as I do it.</t5371> <t5372>What I want is my black person or my watermelon or my Sunday school book, and if the best thing is a pick, then that's what I'm going to use to get that black person, or that watermelon, or that Sunday school book, and I don't give a damn what the most authoritative authors say about it.</t5372>
<t5373>—Well —he goes and says—, there is an excuse to use the picks and pretend they are something else in a case like this; otherwise, I wouldn't approve it, nor would I allow the rules to be broken, because what is right is right and what is wrong is wrong, and one doesn't have to do things wrong when one is not ignorant and knows what is right.</t5373> <t5374>It would be fine for you to get Jim out with a pick, without pretending it's something else, because you don't know what is right, but it wouldn't be right for me to do it, because I do know.</t5374> <t5375>Pass me a kitchen knife.</t5375>
<t5376>He had his next to him, but I handed him mine.</t5376> <t5377>He threw it on the ground and said:</t5377>
<t5378>—Give me a kitchen knife.</t5378>
<t5379>I didn't know what to do, but then I thought about it.</t5379> <t5380>I searched among the old tools and found a pickaxe, handed it to him, and he grabbed it and started working without saying a word.</t5380>
<t5381>It was always that special.</t5381> <t5382>Everything beginnings.</t5382>
<t5383>Then I grabbed a shovel and we started digging with the pick and shovel, taking turns, like madmen.</t5383> <t5384>We continued like this for about half an hour, which was all we could endure; but in return, we had made a good hole.</t5384> <t5385>When I went upstairs, I looked out the window and saw that Tom was doing everything he could with the lightning rod, but he couldn't climb because his hands were so cracked.</t5385> <t5386>Finally, he said:</t5386>
<t5387>—It's useless, I can't.</t5387> <t5388>What do you think I should do? Can't you think of anything?</t5388>
<t5389>—Yes —I said—, but I suppose it's not in the regulations.</t5389> <t5390>Go up the stairs and pretend they are a lightning rod.</t5390>
<t5391>That's what he did.</t5391>
<t5392>The next day, Tom stole a pewter spoon and a copper candlestick from the house to make some pens for Jim, as well as six tallow candles, and I stayed around the cabins of the black people waiting for an opportunity and stole three tin plates.</t5392> <t5393>Tom said it wasn't enough, but I replied that no one would ever see the plates Jim threw, because they would fall among the bushes and weeds under the window, so we could retrieve them to be used again.</t5393> <t5394>Then Tom was convinced.</t5394> <t5395>Afterwards, he goes and says:</t5395>
<t5396>—Now what we have to study is how to get things to Jim.</t5396>
<t5397>—We will give them to them through the hole —I said—, when we have finished it.</t5397>
<t5398>He looked at me disdainfully and said something like he had never heard such a stupid idea, and then he started to study it.</t5398> <t5399>After a while, he announced that he had already discovered two or three ways, but it was not yet necessary to decide on one.</t5399> <t5400>He said that first we had to inform Jim.</t5400>
<t5401>That night we climbed down the lightning rod shortly after ten, with one of the candles, we listened under the window and heard Jim snoring, so we threw it inside and didn't wake him up.</t5401><t5402>Then we started digging with the pick and shovel, and after about two and a half hours we had finished the job.</t5402><t5403>We got into the cabin under Jim's cot and searched until we found the candle and lit it, and we stared at Jim for a while to check his strong and healthy appearance, and then we woke him up slowly and gently.</t5403><t5404>He was so happy to see us that he almost started to cry and called us his children and all the affectionate things he could think of, and he asked us to find a chisel to take the chain off his leg immediately so he could leave without wasting time.</t5404><t5405>But Tom showed him that wouldn't be proper and sat down to explain our plans and how we could change them in a moment if there was any alarm and that he shouldn't worry, because we would make sure he escaped, no doubt.</t5405><t5406>Then Jim said that was fine and we stayed chatting for a while about the old times, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him that Uncle Silas came daily or every two days to pray with him and that Aunt Sally visited to see if he was comfortable and had enough food and that they were both very kind, Tom said:</t5406>
<t5407>—Now I know how to organize it.</t5407> <t5408>We will send you some things with them.</t5408>
<t5409>—Don't even think about it; it's one of the dumbest ideas I've ever heard in my life —I said, but he ignored me and went ahead.</t5409> <t5410>That's what happened when he had made a plan.</t5410>
<t5411>Then he told Jim that we would have to pass him the cake with the rope ladder and other sizable things through Nat, the black man who brought him food, and he had to be alert and not be surprised or let Nat see him when he opened them, and that we would put the small things in the uncle's jacket pockets and he had to steal them, and that if we had the chance we would tie things to the aunt's apron strings or put them in the apron pocket, and he told him what they would be and what for.</t5411> <t5412>He also asked him to keep a diary written in blood on his shirt and all those things.</t5412> <t5413>He told him everything.</t5413> <t5414>Jim didn't understand most of it, but he acknowledged that since we were white we knew more than he did, so he was quite happy and stated that he would do everything just as Tom had told him.</t5414>
<t5415>Jim had plenty of corn cob pipes and tobacco, so we had a great time in his company; then we crawled out on all fours through the hole and went to bed, with our hands raw.</t5415> <t5416>Tom was very excited.</t5416> <t5417>He said it was the most fun and the most intellectual thing in his life, and that if he could manage it, we would spend our lives doing it and leave Jim for our children to rescue, because he believed Jim would like it more and more as he got used to it.</t5417> <t5418>He said that if we kept going like this, it would last at least eighty years and break all time records.</t5418> <t5419>And he added that it would make all of us who had been involved in it famous.</t5419>
<t5420>In the morning we went to the woodpile, broke the copper candlestick into several more manageable pieces, and Tom put them in his pocket along with the pewter spoon.</t5420> <t5421>Then we went to where the cabins of the black people were, and while I distracted Nat, Tom put a piece of the candlestick in the middle of the cornbread that was in the bowl for Jim, and we went with Nat to see how it would turn out, which worked wonderfully; when Jim took a bite, he almost broke all his teeth, and that was a sign of how well everything was going.</t5421> <t5422>Tom himself said so.</t5422> <t5423>Jim didn't say what it was about, but he pretended it was a little stone or one of those things that always get into the bread, you know; but from then on, he never took a bite of anything without first stabbing it with a fork three or four times.</t5423>
<t5424>And while we were standing in that dim light, two of the dogs that had crawled into the hole under Jim's cot appeared and kept coming and coming until there were eleven of them and there was hardly any room left to breathe.</t5424> <t5425>Heck, we had forgotten to close the shed door!</t5425> <t5426>Black Nat only screamed "Witches" once and then knelt on the ground among the dogs and began to moan as if he were dying.</t5426> <t5427>Tom flung the door open, threw a piece of Jim's meat through it, and the dogs rushed out to get it. In two seconds, he was out, back in, and had closed the door, and I realized he had also closed the other one.</t5427> <t5428>Then he started talking to the black man, very understanding and affectionate, asking him if he had imagined seeing something again.</t5428> <t5429>The black man lifted his head, blinked, and said:</t5429>
<t5430>—Mr. Sid, you may think I'm a fool, but may I die right here if it didn't seem like I saw almost a million dogs, or devils, or something.</t5430> <t5431>I assure you, Mr. Sid.</t5431> <t5432>I touched them...</t5432> <t5433>I touched them, young master; they were everywhere.</t5433> <t5434>Damn it, I wish I could get my hands on one of those witches just once, just once, that's all I ask.</t5434> <t5435>But above all, I wish they would leave me alone, that would be the best.</t5435>
<t5436>Tom goes and says:</t5436>
<t5437>—Well, I'm going to tell you what I think.</t5437> <t5438>Why do they come here precisely at the time of this runaway black man's breakfast?</t5438> <t5439>It's because they're hungry, and nothing more.</t5439> <t5440>You have to make them a witch's pie.</t5440> <t5441>That's it.</t5441>
<t5442>—But, for God's sake, Sid, how am I going to make them a witch pie?</t5442> <t5443>I don't know how to make one.</t5443> <t5444>I've never heard of anything like it in my life.</t5444>
<t5445>—Well, then I'll have to do it myself.</t5445>
<t5446>—Will you do it, my boy? Will you really?</t5446> <t5447>I'll kiss the ground you walk on, truly!</t5447>
<t5448>—Very well, I will do it for you because it is about you and because you have behaved well with us and have shown us the runaway black man.</t5448> <t5449>But you have to be very careful.</t5449> <t5450>When we appear, you have to turn your back, and then, whatever we put in the bowl, you have to act like you don't see it.</t5450> <t5451>And you must not look when Jim empties the pot, because something might happen.</t5451> <t5452>I don't know what.</t5452> <t5453>Above all, do not touch the witches' things.</t5453>
<t5454>—Touch them, Mr. Sid? What are you saying?</t5454> <t5455>I wouldn't lay a finger on them, even if I had a hundred billion dollars, truly.</t5455>
<t5456>Chapter 37</t5456>
<t5457>THAT WAS SETTLED.</t5457> <t5458>Then we went to the dump in the backyard, where they have old boots, rags, broken bottles, and worn-out things and all that, and we searched until we found an old tin basin, patched the holes as best as we could to make the pie in it and took it down to the basement to fill it with stolen flour, and when we were going to have breakfast we found a couple of nails that, according to Tom, would be very useful for a prisoner to write his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls, and we left one of them in Aunt Sally's apron pocket, which was hanging on a chair, and we stuck the other one in the ribbon of Uncle Silas's hat, which was on the desk, because we heard the children say that their father and mother were planning to go that morning to see the runaway negro, and then we went to have breakfast and Tom left the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas's jacket pocket, but since Aunt Sally hadn't arrived yet, we had to wait a while.</t5458>
<t5459>When she arrived, she was all hot, flushed, and in a bad mood, and she could hardly wait for the blessing of the table, so she started serving coffee with one hand and thimbling the head of the nearest child with the other, while saying:</t5459>
<t5460>—I have searched everywhere and I don't understand what happened to your other shirt.</t5460>
<t5461>My heart sank between my lungs and livers and all that, and a hard piece of corn husk got stuck in my throat, so I started coughing, spat it all over the table, and hit one of the kids in the eye, making him squirm like a worm on a hook and let out a scream like an Indian on the warpath. Tom turned as red as a poppy, and then there was a big mess for about a quarter of a minute or so, and I would have confessed everything right then and there at the first opportunity.</t5461> <t5462>But then everything settled down again, because the surprise had caught us all off guard.</t5462> <t5463>Uncle Silas said:</t5463>
<t5464>—It is most curious.</t5464> <t5465>I cannot understand it.</t5465> <t5466>I know perfectly well that I took it off, because...</t5466>
<t5467>—Because now you only have one shirt.</t5467> <t5468>What things you say!</t5468> <t5469>I already knew that you had taken it off and I remember it better than you, because yesterday it was on the clothesline and I saw it myself.</t5469> <t5470>But it has disappeared and there's nothing more to say, so you'll have to wear a red flannel one until I find the time to make you another.</t5470> <t5471>And it will be the third one I've made for you in two years.</t5471> <t5472>I spend half my time just sewing shirts for you, and what I don't understand is what the devil you do with them.</t5472> <t5473>Logically, at your age, you should have already learned to take care of them a little.</t5473>
<t5474>—I already know, Sally, and I try as much as I can.</t5474> <t5475>But it can't all be my fault, because you know I don't see them or have anything to do with them except when I'm wearing them, and I don't think I've lost any while wearing them.</t5475>
<t5476>—Well, that's not your fault; you would have lost them if you could, I think.</t5476> <t5477>Besides, it's not just the shirt that's missing.</t5477> <t5478>A spoon is also missing, and that's not all.</t5478> <t5479>There were ten and now there are only nine.</t5479> <t5480>Maybe the calf ate the shirt, but what I can assure you is that the calf didn't eat the spoon.</t5480>
<t5481>—What else is missing, Sally?</t5481>
<t5482>—Six candles are missing, that's what's missing.</t5482> <t5483>The rats could have eaten the candles, and I reckon that's what happened; I wonder why they don't just take everything already, because you spend your life saying you're going to plug the holes and you never do, and if they weren't idiots, they'd sleep on your head, Silas, and you wouldn't even notice; but you can't blame the rats for the spoon, I'm sure of that.</t5483>
<t5484>—Well, Sally, it will be my fault and I admit it; I have let it slide, but I assure you that tomorrow I will plug all the holes.</t5484>
<t5485>—There's no rush; as long as you cover them next year, it's enough.</t5485> <t5486>Matilda Angelina Araminta Phelps!</t5486>
<t5487>Thimble tap and the girl takes her fingers out of the sugar bowl without saying a word.</t5487> <t5488>Just then, the black woman arrives at the passage and says:</t5488>
<t5489>—Ma'am, a sheet is missing.</t5489>
<t5490>—A sheet is missing!</t5490> <t5491>Well, what's going on here!</t5491>
<t5492>—Today I will cover the holes —says Uncle Silas, with a remorseful look on his face.</t5492>
<t5493>—Come on, shut up! Do you think the rats took the sheet?</t5493> <t5494>Where has it disappeared to, Lize?</t5494>
<t5495>—I swear to God I have no idea, Miss Sally.</t5495> <t5496>Yesterday it was on the clothesline but it has disappeared; it's not there anymore.</t5496>
<t5497>—This looks like the end of the world.</t5497> <t5498>I've never seen anything like this.</t5498> <t5499>A shirt, a sheet, a spoon, and six ve...</t5499>
<t5500>—Sita —says a light-skinned black woman as she arrives—, a bronze candelabrum is missing.</t5500>
<t5501>—Get out of here, shameless, or I'll hit you with a frying pan!</t5501>
<t5502>Well, she was furious.</t5502> <t5503>I started to wait for an opportunity.</t5503> <t5504>I thought it was best to go to the forest until the weather improved.</t5504> <t5505>She kept shouting, organizing an insurrection all by herself, while the rest of us were meek and quiet, until Uncle Silas, looking very surprised, pulled the spoon out of his pocket.</t5505> <t5506>Aunt fell silent, with her mouth open and raising her hands, and as for me, I wished I had been in Jerusalem or anywhere else.</t5506> <t5507>But not for long, because she goes and says:</t5507>
<t5508>—I was expecting that.</t5508> <t5509>So you had it in your pocket, and surely you have all the other things.</t5509> <t5510>How did it get there?</t5510>
<t5511>—I really don't know, Sally—he says, as if making excuses—, or you know very well that I would tell you.</t5511> <t5512>I was studying my text from Acts 17 before breakfast and I figure I put it there, without realizing it, when what I wanted was to put my New Testament, and it must be that because what I don't have is the New Testament, but I'll check, and if the New Testament is where it was before, I'll know that I didn't put it away and that will prove that I left the New Testament on the table and grabbed the spoon and...</t5512>
<t5513>—Well, for the love of God!</t5513> <t5514>Leave me alone!</t5514> <t5515>Now everyone out and don't come near me again until I've calmed down a bit.</t5515>
<t5516>I would have heard her even if she were talking to herself, and even more so because she said it out loud, and I would have gotten up to obey her even if it had killed me.</t5516> <t5517>As we passed through the room, the old man grabbed the hat and the nail fell out, but he simply picked it up and left it on the shelf without saying a word, and left.</t5517> <t5518>Tom saw it, remembered the spoon, and said:</t5518>
<t5519>—Well, it's no use sending things with him anymore, because he's not trustworthy —and he added—, but in any case, he did us a favor with the spoon, without knowing it, so let's do him one without him knowing: let's cover the rat holes.</t5519>
<t5520>There were heaps of them in the basement and it took us a whole hour, but we did the job well, without forgetting anything.</t5520> <t5521>Then we heard footsteps on the stairs, turned off the light, hid, and the old man appeared, with a candle in one hand and a bunch of tow in the other, as distracted as ever.</t5521> <t5522>He started searching everywhere, first one of the holes and then another, until he saw them all.</t5522> <t5523>Then he stood still for about five minutes, removing the tallow from the candle and thinking, until he slowly and pensively turned towards the stairs saying:</t5523>
<t5524>—Well, the truth is that I don't remember when I did it.</t5524> <t5525>Now I could prove to you that the rat problem is not my fault.</t5525> <t5526>But it doesn't matter: let's leave it at that.</t5526> <t5527>I figure it wouldn't be worth anything.</t5527>
<t5528>He went up the stairs talking to himself, and then we left.</t5528> <t5529>He was a very nice old man, and he still is.</t5529>
<t5530>Tom was very worried about how to find another spoon, because he said we needed it; so he started thinking.</t5530> <t5531>When he made up his mind, he told me what we had to do; then we went to wait where the basket of spoons was until we saw Aunt Sally coming, and Tom started counting the spoons and setting them aside while I hid one in my sleeve, and Tom goes and says:</t5531>
<t5532>—Hey, Aunt Sally, there are still only nine spoons.</t5532>
<t5533>And she responds:</t5533>
<t5534>—Come on, keep playing and don't bother me.</t5534> <t5535>I know what there is.</t5535> <t5536>I've counted them myself.</t5536>
<t5537>—Well, I counted them twice, Aunt, and I only get nine.</t5537>
<t5538>She seemed to lose her patience, but naturally came to count them, as anyone would have done.</t5538>
<t5539>—For heaven's sake, there are only nine! —he said—.</t5539> <t5540>But, what the devil, what is going on with these things?</t5540> <t5541>I'm going to count them again.</t5541>
<t5542>Then I put back the one I had hidden, and when he finished counting, he said:</t5542>
<t5543>—By all the demons, now there are ten! —she said, very irritated and uneasy at the same time.</t5543> <t5544>But Tom goes and says:</t5544>
<t5545>—But, aunt, I don't think there are ten.</t5545>
<t5546>—Don't be silly, didn't you see me counting them?</t5546>
<t5547>—I know, but...</t5547>
<t5548>—Well, I'm going to count them again.</t5548>
<t5549>So I swiped one and only nine came out, just like the last time.</t5549> <t5550>She got extremely nervous and started trembling all over because she was so angry.</t5550> <t5551>But she kept counting and counting until she got so confused that she even counted the basket as if it were a spoon, so three times she got the count right and three times she got it wrong.</t5551> <t5552>Then she grabbed the basket, threw it to the other side of the room, kicked the cat, and said we should leave her alone and that if we bothered her again, she would skin us alive.</t5552> <t5553>So we kept the missing spoon and left it in the pocket of her apron while she ordered us to leave, and Jim got it along with the nail before noon.</t5553> <t5554>We were very happy with all that, and Tom said it was worth twice the trouble it had caused us, because now she wouldn't be able to count the spoons twice without getting confused even if her life depended on it; and even if she counted them right, she wouldn't believe it, and he said that when her head got tired of counting, she would give up and threaten to kill anyone who asked her to count them again.</t5554>
<t5555>So that night we put the sheet back on the clothesline and stole one from the closet, and we kept putting it in and taking it out for a couple of days until she no longer knew how many sheets she had and didn't even care because she wasn't going to let it ruin her life or count them again even if it cost her life; she would rather die first.</t5555>
<t5556>So now everything was in order regarding the shirt and the sheet, the spoon and the candles, with the help of the veal; the rats and the accounts that didn't add up, and as for the candelabrum, it didn't matter, in time they would forget about it.</t5556>
<t5557>But the cake gave us a lot of work; it only caused us problems.</t5557> <t5558>We prepared it in the forest and cooked it there, and finally, we had it done and very satisfactory; but it took us more than a day and we had to use three basins full of flour before finishing it, and we got burned all over and the smoke got into our eyes; because the thing is, we only wanted to get a crust and we couldn't get it to hold well, because it always collapsed.</t5558> <t5559>But, naturally, we finally came up with something that would work, which was to cook the ladder with the cake as well.</t5559> <t5560>So that night we went to see Jim, tore the sheet into strips and twisted them all together, and before dawn, we had a great rope that would be enough to hang someone.</t5560> <t5561>We pretended it had taken us nine months to braid it.</t5561>
<t5562>In the morning we took her to the forest, but she wouldn't fit into the pie.</t5562> <t5563>Since she was made from an entire sheet, there was enough rope for forty pies if we had wanted, and there would still be some left for soup, sausages, or whatever one might want.</t5563> <t5564>We could have used her for an entire dinner.</t5564>
<t5565>But we didn't need that much.</t5565> <t5566>The only thing we needed was enough for the cake, so we threw the rest away.</t5566> <t5567>We didn't bake any of the cakes in the basin, because we feared the welded part would melt, but Uncle Silas had a wonderful copper heater that he valued greatly, because it had belonged to one of his ancestors, and it had a long wooden handle that had come from England with William the Conqueror on the Mayflower or one of those pilgrim ships and was hidden in the attic, with a bunch of old pots and valuable things, not because they were worth anything, which they weren't, but because they were like relics, you know, and we secretly took it out and brought it to the woods, but it failed us on the first cakes because we didn't know how to use it well, although it worked great on the last one.</t5567> <t5568>We put dough around all the edges, filled it with a rope of rags and then covered it all with dough and closed the lid, and on top we put some embers and stepped back five feet, with the long handle, so calm and comfortable, and after fifteen minutes we got a cake that was a pleasure to see.</t5568> <t5569>But whoever ate it would have to take a couple of barrels of toothpicks, because if that rope ladder didn't clog all their teeth, then I don't know what I'm talking about, and on top of that, they would have a stomach ache for the rest of their life.</t5569>
<t5570>Nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in Jim's bowl and placed the three tin plates at the bottom of the kettle under the bowl, so everything reached Jim perfectly, and as soon as he was alone, he broke the pie and hid the rope ladder in the straw mattress, scribbled on a tin plate, and threw it out the window hole.</t5570>
<t5571>Chapter 38</t5571>
<t5572>PREPARING THE FEATHERS was a very difficult job, just like with the saw, and Jim said that the inscription was going to be the hardest part of all.</t5572> <t5573>It was what the prisoner had to engrave on the wall.</t5573> <t5574>But it was necessary; Tom said he had to do it; there wasn't a single case of a State prisoner who didn't leave an inscription, along with his coat of arms.</t5574>
<t5575>—Look at Lady Jane Grey —he goes and says—; look at Gilford Dudley; look at that Northumberland!</t5575> <t5576>But, Huck, let's say it's a lot of work.</t5576> <t5577>What are you going to do about it?</t5577> <t5578>How are you going to manage?</t5578> <t5579>Jim has to leave his inscription and his coat of arms.</t5579> <t5580>It's what everyone does.</t5580>
<t5581>And Jim goes and says:</t5581>
<t5582>—But, Mr. Tom, I don't have a coat of arms; I have nothing but this old shirt and you know that I have to write the diary on it.</t5582>
<t5583>—Well, Jim, it's just that you don't understand; a coat of arms is very different.</t5583>
<t5584>—Well —I said—, in any case, Jim is right when he says he doesn't have a coat of arms, because he doesn't.</t5584>
<t5585>—I already knew that —says Tom—, but I bet you he will have it before he leaves here, because he is going to leave as he should, without any blemish on his record.</t5585>
<t5586>So while Jim and I were sharpening the feathers on a brick, Jim his with the copper and I mine with the spoon, Tom started working on thinking about the coat of arms.</t5586> <t5587>After a while, he said that so many had occurred to him that he didn't know which one to choose, but there was one that seemed to be his favorite.</t5587> <t5588>He goes and says:</t5588>
<t5589>—On the shield, we will place a gold bar on the dexter base, a purple saltire on the falcon, with a dog, couchant, in franchise, and under the foot, an embattled chain, for—slavery, with a green chevron with a dented point and three vector lines on a field of azure, with the points of the teeth rampant in a dancette; as a crest, a fugitive black man, sable, with a bundle on his shoulder over a bar of bastardy, and a pair of gules of support, which are you and me; as a motto, Maggiore fretta, minore atto.</t5589> <t5590>I got it from a book; it means that no matter how early you get up, it doesn't make the sun rise any sooner.</t5590>
<t5591>—Damn it —I said—, but what does all the rest mean?</t5591>
<t5592>—We don't have time to waste on that —he goes and says—; we need to start digging like the condemned.</t5592>
<t5593>—Well, in any case —I asked—; at least tell me something, what is a falquín?</t5593>
<t5594>—A falquín...</t5594> <t5595>A falquín is...</t5595> <t5596>You don't need to know what a falquín is.</t5596> <t5597>I'll teach you how to make one when the time comes.</t5597>
<t5598>—Damn, Tom —I said—; I thought you could tell it.</t5598> <t5599>What is a bar sinister?</t5599>
<t5600>—Ah, I don't know.</t5600> <t5601>But it is necessary.</t5601> <t5602>All the nobility has it.</t5602>
<t5603>That's how he was.</t5603> <t5604>If it didn't suit him to explain something, he wouldn't explain it.</t5604> <t5605>You could spend a week asking him about it, and it wouldn't matter.</t5605>
<t5606>Since he had everything arranged regarding the coat of arms, he began to finish that part of the task, which consisted of planning a very sad inscription, because it said that Jim had to leave, just like everyone else had done.</t5606> <t5607>He invented many, which he wrote on a paper, and when he read them, they said:</t5607>
<t5608>1.</t5608> <t5609>Here, a captive's heart was broken.</t5609>
<t5610>»2.</t5610> <t5611>Here a poor prisoner, abandoned by the world and friends, suffered a life of sorrows.</t5611>
<t5612>»3.</t5612> <t5613>Here a lonely heart was broken and a shattered spirit departed to its eternal rest, after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity.</t5613>
<t5614>»4.</t5614> <t5615>Here, without home or friends, after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble foreigner, the natural son of Louis XIV.»</t5615>
<t5616>Tom's voice trembled as he read it, and he almost started to cry.</t5616> <t5617>When he finished, there was no way he could decide which one Jim should write on the wall, because they were all great, but he finally decided to let him write them all.</t5617> <t5618>Jim said it would take him a year to write so many things on the logs with a nail, because he didn't know how to make letters; but Tom promised to draw them for him so that Jim would only have to follow the drawing.</t5618> <t5619>And shortly after, he said:</t5619>
<t5620>—Now that I think about it, those logs are no good; in the dungeons, you don't have logs; we have to make the inscriptions on a stone.</t5620> <t5621>We have to bring a stone.</t5621>
<t5622>Jim said that the stone was worse than the logs; that it would take him so much time to write on the stone that he would never escape.</t5622> <t5623>But Tom said he would let me help him.</t5623> <t5624>Then he took a look to see how Jim and I were doing with the feathers.</t5624> <t5625>It was the most tedious, hard, and slow work, it didn’t help at all to get rid of the blisters on my hands, and we hardly seemed to make any progress, so Tom goes and says:</t5625>
<t5626>—I know how to fix it.</t5626> <t5627>We need a stone for the coat of arms and the melancholic inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with one stone.</t5627> <t5628>Where the mill is, there is a huge grinding stone that we can bring to write things on it and also sharpen the quills and the saw.</t5628>
<t5629>It wasn't a bad idea, and it wasn't a bad grinding stone either, but we decided to give it a try.</t5629> <t5630>It wasn't midnight yet, so we went to the mill and left Jim with his work.</t5630> <t5631>We grabbed the stone and started rolling it home, but it was extremely difficult.</t5631> <t5632>Sometimes, no matter what we did, we couldn't stop it from falling, and at any moment it was about to crush us.</t5632> <t5633>Tom said it would surely take one of us out before we managed to finish.</t5633> <t5634>We got halfway and were already exhausted and almost drowning in sweat.</t5634> <t5635>We saw there was nothing else to do; we had to go get Jim.</t5635> <t5636>So he lifted the bed, took the chain off the leg of the cot, put it around his neck, and we crawled through the hole to where the stone was, and Jim and I started pushing it and made it roll quite easily, while Tom supervised.</t5636> <t5637>He was the best supervisor in the world.</t5637> <t5638>He knew how to do everything.</t5638>
<t5639>Our hole was already quite large, but not large enough to fit the stone through it; then Jim grabbed the pickaxe and immediately made it bigger.</t5639> <t5640>Afterwards, Tom drew the phrases on it with the nail and put Jim to work, with the nail serving as a chisel and a bolt as a hammer; he said to work until the candle was used up and then he could go to bed and hide the millstone under the mattress and sleep on top of it.</t5640> <t5641>Then we helped him put the chain back on the leg of the cot and got ready to go to bed.</t5641> <t5642>Tom thought of something, and he goes and says:</t5642>
<t5643>—Ah, are there spiders here?</t5643>
<t5644>—No, sir, thank God, no, Mr. Tom.</t5644>
<t5645>—Very well, we will bring you some.</t5645>
<t5646>—But, for God's sake, my child, I don't want spiders.</t5646> <t5647>They scare me.</t5647> <t5648>I even prefer rattlesnakes.</t5648>
<t5649>Tom stayed thinking for a moment, and then he says:</t5649>
<t5650>—It's a good idea.</t5650> <t5651>And I reckon it has been done before.</t5651> <t5652>It must have been done; it makes sense.</t5652> <t5653>Yes, it's a phenomenal idea.</t5653> <t5654>Where would you have it?</t5654>
<t5655>—Have what, little Tom?</t5655>
<t5656>—Man, a rattlesnake.</t5656>
<t5657>—By all the saints in heaven, Tom!</t5657> <t5658>But if I see a rattlesnake come in here, I'll fly through that log wall, even if I have to break it with my head.</t5658>
<t5659>—Man, Jim, after a while you wouldn't be afraid of her anymore.</t5659> <t5660>You could tame her.</t5660>
<t5661>—Tame her!</t5661>
<t5662>—Yes, it's easy.</t5662> <t5663>All animals appreciate gestures of affection and caresses; it would never occur to them to harm a person who caresses them.</t5663> <t5664>You can see it in any book.</t5664> <t5665>Try it, that's all I'm saying; try it for two or three days.</t5665> <t5666>You can make it so that in a short time it loves you, sleeps with you, and doesn't leave your side for a moment; that it lets you put it around your neck and stick your head in its mouth.</t5666>
<t5667>—Please, Mr. Tom...</t5667> <t5668>Don't say such things!</t5668> <t5669>I can't stand it!</t5669> <t5670>You would let me put your head in my mouth, as a favor, right?</t5670> <t5671>I bet you'd have to wait a long time before I'd ask you for that.</t5671> <t5672>And besides, I don't want you to sleep with me.</t5672>
<t5673>—Jim, don't be silly.</t5673> <t5674>A prisoner has to have a pet, and if it's never been tried with a rattlesnake, you can achieve more glory by being the first to try it than in any other way you can think of to save your life.</t5674>
<t5675>—But, Tom, I don't want that glory.</t5675> <t5676>The snake goes and bites Jim on the chin, and then, where's the glory?</t5676> <t5677>No, sir, I don't want to do any of that.</t5677>
<t5678>—Damn it, can't you try?</t5678> <t5679>I just want you to try...</t5679> <t5680>You don't need to keep going if it doesn't go well.</t5680>
<t5681>—But the problem ends if the snake bites me while I'm trying.</t5681> <t5682>Tom, I'm willing to try almost anything that seems reasonable, but if you and Huck bring me a snake to tame, I'm out of here, I assure you of that.</t5682>
<t5683>—Well, then leave it, leave it, since you're being so stubborn.</t5683> <t5684>We can get you some snakes and tie some buttons to their tails and pretend they are rattlesnakes; I suppose we'll have to settle for that.</t5684>
<t5685>—I could put up with that, said Tom, but damned if I couldn't manage without them, I assure you.</t5685> <t5686>I had never understood that being imprisoned was such a hassle.</t5686>
<t5687>—Well, it always is when things are done right.</t5687> <t5688>Are there rats around here?</t5688>
<t5689>—No, sir, I haven't seen any.</t5689>
<t5690>—Well, we will bring you some rats.</t5690>
<t5691>—But, Tom, I don't want to have rats.</t5691> <t5692>They are the most disgusting creatures there are, and they climb on you and bite your feet when you're trying to fall asleep.</t5692> <t5693>No, sir, I prefer snakes, if necessary, but no rats; I don't like them at all, and I mean it.</t5693>
<t5694>—But, Jim, there have to be rats...</t5694> <t5695>It says so in all the books.</t5695> <t5696>So don't make a fuss about it.</t5696> <t5697>Prisoners never lack rats.</t5697> <t5698>There isn't a single case.</t5698> <t5699>And they tame them, pet them, and teach them tricks, and thus they learn to be very sociable.</t5699> <t5700>But you have to play them some music.</t5700> <t5701>Do you have something to play music?</t5701>
<t5702>—I only have a wooden comb, a piece of paper, and a berimbau, and I don't think they'll like a berimbau very much.</t5702>
<t5703>—Surely, yes.</t5703> <t5704>They don't care about the type of music.</t5704> <t5705>A berimbau is phenomenal for a rat.</t5705> <t5706>All animals like music, and in prisons, they love it.</t5706> <t5707>Especially sad music, and with a berimbau, it's the only music you can play.</t5707> <t5708>They are always interested; they come out to see what's happening to you.</t5708> <t5709>Yes, it's going to go very well for you, you have everything.</t5709> <t5710>What you need to do is sit on the bed at night before you go to sleep, and in the morning do the same and play the berimbau; play "The Last Link is Broken," which is what rats love, and after playing for two minutes, you'll see that all the rats, snakes, and spiders and all that start to worry about you and come out.</t5710> <t5711>And they will all come to keep you company, and they will have a great time.</t5711>
<t5712>—Yes, I suppose they will, said Tom, but how is Jim going to handle it?</t5712> <t5713>Hang me if I understand it.</t5713> <t5714>But if it's necessary, I'll do it.</t5714> <t5715>I reckon it's better to keep the animals happy and not have problems at home.</t5715>
<t5716>Tom stayed thinking if something was missing, and after a moment he goes and says:</t5716>
<t5717>—Ah, I forgot something.</t5717> <t5718>Do you think you could grow a flower here?</t5718>
<t5719>—I don't know, but maybe yes, said Tom, although it's quite dark here and a flower isn't much use to me, and it would be very difficult for me.</t5719>
<t5720>—Well, try it anyway.</t5720> <t5721>Some other prisoners have already done it.</t5721>
<t5722>—I reckon one of those cat-tail plants could grow here, said Tom, but it wouldn't be worth half the effort it would take.</t5722>
<t5723>—Don't believe it.</t5723> <t5724>We'll bring you a tiny one and you plant it in that corner and cultivate it.</t5724> <t5725>And don't call it barbasco, but pitchiola, which is a name that sounds very nice in a prison.</t5725> <t5726>The best thing is to water it with your tears.</t5726>
<t5727>—But I have plenty of water from the fountain, said Tom.</t5727>
<t5728>—You don't need water from the fountain; what you need is to water it with your tears.</t5728> <t5729>That's what everyone does.</t5729>
<t5730>—But, Uncle Tom, I can grow a barbasco this big with water from the fountain, whereas with tears it will barely grow.</t5730>
<t5731>—It's not about that.</t5731> <t5732>It must be done with tears.</t5732>
<t5733>—He will die on me, Uncle Tom, I'm sure of it; because I almost never cry.</t5733>
<t5734>So Tom didn't know what to do.</t5734> <t5735>But he thought about it and said that Jim would have to cry as much as he could with an onion.</t5735> <t5736>He promised that he would go to the black people's cabins and secretly put one in Jim's coffee in the morning.</t5736> <t5737>Jim said he would prefer tobacco in the coffee, and he made so many problems with that, and with the work and the issue of growing the barbasco, the jew's harp and the rats and petting the snakes and spiders and everything else, on top of what he had to do with the feathers and the inscriptions and the diaries and all that, that he said being a prisoner was the hardest thing he had ever done in his life, until Tom lost his patience with him and told him that he had received more opportunities than any prisoner in the world to become famous and yet he didn't know how to appreciate it, and that with him it was nothing but a waste of time.</t5737> <t5738>So Jim said he was sorry and that he wouldn't behave the same way again, and then Tom and I went to bed.</t5738>
<t5739>Chapter 39</t5739>
<t5740>IN THE MORNING we went to the village, bought a wire mousetrap, brought it home and uncovered the best of the rat holes, and after about half an hour we had already caught fifteen of the best in the mousetrap; then we grabbed it and put it safely under Aunt Sally's bed.</t5740> <t5741>But while we were looking for spiders, little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it and opened the door to see if the rats would come out, and they did, and when we came back Aunt Sally was up on the bed raising all kinds of hell while the rats did everything they could to keep her entertained.</t5741> <t5742>Then she shook us with the stick and it took us at least another two hours to catch another fifteen or sixteen, because of that silly kid, and they weren't the best either, because the first batch had been unbeatable.</t5742> <t5743>In my life I have never seen a better group of rats than that first batch.</t5743>
<t5744>We managed to get a splendid variety of spiders, beetles, frogs, and caterpillars, among other things, and we almost took a wasp nest, but we didn't succeed.</t5744> <t5745>The family was at home.</t5745> <t5746>We didn't give up immediately, but endured as much as we could, because we tried to tire them out or let them tire us out, which is what happened in the end.</t5746> <t5747>Then we went to put some ointment on the stings and almost got better, although we couldn't sit comfortably.</t5747> <t5748>Then we went out to look for snakes and caught a couple of dozen water snakes and house snakes and put them in a sack in our room, which brought us to dinner time after a whole day of work; were we hungry?</t5748> <t5749>No, of course not!</t5749> <t5750>When we returned, there wasn't a single damn snake left; we hadn't tied the sack well and somehow they had found their way out and left.</t5750> <t5751>But it didn't matter much, because they had to be somewhere in the house.</t5751> <t5752>So we thought we would find them again.</t5752> <t5753>No, for many days snakes were not scarce in that house.</t5753> <t5754>You could see them hanging from the beams and other times tucked away somewhere, and they generally fell onto someone's plate or crawled down their neck, almost always where it wasn't pleasant.</t5754> <t5755>Well, they were all very pretty with their stripes and all, and even if there were a million of them, they wouldn't have harmed anyone, but Aunt Sally didn't care about that; she was disgusted by snakes, no matter what kind they were, and she couldn't stand them in any way, and every time one fell on her, no matter what she was doing, she would stop and run away.</t5755> <t5756>I've never seen a woman like that; you could hear her screams all the way to Jericho.</t5756> <t5757>She couldn't even grab one with tongs.</t5757> <t5758>If she turned around and found one in the bed, she would run and start screaming as if the house was on fire.</t5758> <t5759>It annoyed the old man so much that he said he almost wished snakes had never been created.</t5759> <t5760>But man, even after there hadn't been a single one in the house for a week, Aunt Sally still hadn't recovered; she was still so scared that when she was sitting thinking about something, if you touched her on the neck with a feather, she would jump out of her shoes.</t5760> <t5761>It was very curious.</t5761> <t5762>But Tom said all women were the same.</t5762> <t5763>He said that for some reason or another they were made that way.</t5763>
<t5764>He would give us a beating every time he encountered one of the snakes, and he said that was nothing compared to what he would do to us if we filled the house with them again.</t5764> <t5765>The beatings didn't bother me, because they were really nothing, but I did care about how difficult it was for us to find another bunch.</t5765> <t5766>But we got them, along with the other critters, and in your life, you have never seen a cabin as lively as Jim's when they all came out to hear the music and approached him.</t5766> <t5767>Jim didn't like spiders and the spiders didn't like Jim; so they would wait and then make his life impossible.</t5767> <t5768>And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the mill wheel, he hardly had any room left on the cot, and in what little space he had, he couldn't sleep, because it never stopped, and it never stopped because they never all slept at the same time, but took turns, so when the snakes slept, the rats were on guard, and when the rats went to bed, it was the snakes' turn to be on guard, so he always had a bunch of critters underneath him and another bunch making a circus on top, and if he got up to find a new spot, the spiders would pounce on him during the change.</t5768> <t5769>He said that if he ever escaped, he would never be a prisoner again, not even if they paid him a salary.</t5769>
<t5770>Well, after three weeks everything was in perfect shape.</t5770> <t5771>The shirt had arrived right away inside a cake, and every time a rat bit Jim, he would get up and write something in the diary while the ink was fresh; the pens were made, the inscriptions and everything else had already been engraved on the stone; the bed leg was sawed in two and we had eaten the sawdust, which gave us a terrible stomachache.</t5771> <t5772>We thought we would all die, but we didn't.</t5772> <t5773>It was the most indigestible sawdust I've seen in my life, and Tom said the same.</t5773> <t5774>But he also said that we had finally finished all the work, even though we were all exhausted, especially Jim.</t5774> <t5775>The old man had written twice to the plantation south of Orleans to come and get his runaway black man, but he had received no response, because that plantation didn't exist, so he said he would put an ad about Jim in the Saint Louis and New Orleans newspapers, and when he mentioned the Saint Louis ones, I got chills and saw that we had no time to lose.</t5775> <t5776>Tom said it was time for the anonymous letters.</t5776>
<t5777>—What is that? —I asked.</t5777>
<t5778>—Warnings to people that something is going to happen.</t5778> <t5779>Sometimes it is done in one way and other times in another.</t5779> <t5780>But there is always some spy who warns the governor of the castle.</t5780> <t5781>When Louis XVI was going to escape from the Tuileries, it was a maid.</t5781> <t5782>That's very good, and anonymous letters too.</t5782> <t5783>We will do both things.</t5783> <t5784>Normally, the prisoner's mother changes clothes with them and stays inside the castle, and he goes out dressed in the mother's clothes.</t5784> <t5785>We are going to do that too.</t5785>
<t5786>—But, listen, Tom, why do we want to warn anyone that something is going to happen?</t5786> <t5787>Let them find out on their own, it's their business.</t5787>
<t5788>—Yes, I already know.</t5788> <t5789>But you can't count on them.</t5789> <t5790>It's what they've done from the beginning: they've let us do everything ourselves.</t5790> <t5791>They are so confident and so oblivious that they don't even notice us.</t5791> <t5792>So if we don't warn them, there will be nothing and no one to interfere, and after all the work and all the worry we've put into this escape, it will go off as if nothing happened; it will have no value...</t5792> <t5793>It won't draw any attention!</t5793>
<t5794>—Well, as far as I'm concerned, Tom, that's the best thing.</t5794>
<t5795>—Darn! —he exclaimed, with a look of displeasure, so I said to him:</t5795>
<t5796>—But I am not going to complain.</t5796> <t5797>What you decide is fine with me.</t5797> <t5798>Where are we going to find the maid?</t5798>
<t5799>—That's your job.</t5799> <t5800>You sneak in the middle of the night and take the dress from that fair-skinned girl.</t5800>
<t5801>—But, Tom, then he will have problems in the morning, because he might not have another one.</t5801>
<t5802>—I know, but you only need a quarter of an hour to take the anonymous letter and slip it under the main door.</t5802>
<t5803>—Then, very well, agreed; but I could still take her without changing my clothes.</t5803>
<t5804>—Then you wouldn't look like a maid, would you?</t5804>
<t5805>—No, but anyway, no one is going to see what I seem or stop seeming.</t5805>
<t5806>—That has nothing to do with it.</t5806> <t5807>What matters is that we fulfill our duty and not worry about whether someone sees us doing it or not.</t5807> <t5808>Don't you have any principles?</t5808>
<t5809>—Very well, I won't say anything; I am the maid.</t5809> <t5810>Who is Jim's mother?</t5810>
<t5811>—I am the mother.</t5811> <t5812>I will put on one of Aunt Sally's dresses.</t5812>
<t5813>—Well, then you'll have to stay in the cabin when Jim and I leave.</t5813>
<t5814>—Not much time.</t5814> <t5815>I will stuff Jim's clothes with straw and leave them on the bed to represent his disguised mother; Jim will take off my dress, put it on, and we will escape together.</t5815> <t5816>When a fine prisoner escapes, it is called an evasion.</t5816> <t5817>For example, that's what they always say when a king escapes.</t5817> <t5818>And the same goes for the son of a king; it doesn't matter if he is a legitimate or illegitimate son.</t5818>
<t5819>So Tom wrote the anonymous letter and that night I stole the light-colored girl's dress, put it on, and slipped under the front door what Tom had told me.</t5819> <t5820>It said:</t5820>
<t5821>"Careful."</t5821> <t5822>"Trouble is approaching."</t5822> <t5823>"Stay very alert."</t5823>
<t5824>"AN UNKNOWN FRIEND"</t5824>
<t5825>The next night we nailed a drawing of a skull and crossbones that Tom made with blood on the front door, and the following night we nailed another drawing of a coffin on the back door.</t5825> <t5826>I had never seen a family so scared.</t5826> <t5827>They couldn't have been more frightened even if the house had been filled with ghosts waiting for them behind every piece of furniture and under the beds or floating in the air.</t5827> <t5828>If a door slammed, Aunt Sally would jump and say "oh!", and if something fell, she would jump and say "oh!", and when someone touched her before she realized it, she would do the same; she couldn't look to one side and feel satisfied, because she said there was always something behind her, so she spent her time turning around suddenly and saying "oh!", and before she finished turning around, she would twist again and say the same thing, and she was afraid to go to bed, but she didn't dare to stay sitting either.</t5828> <t5829>So things were going very well, Tom said; according to him, he had never seen anything go so well.</t5829> <t5830>He commented that this showed things were well done.</t5830>
<t5831>So, he said, let's get everything going!</t5831> <t5832>So the next morning, just at dawn, we prepared another letter, and we were thinking about the best way to deliver it, because at dinner time we had heard them say that they were going to put a black man on guard at each door all night.</t5832> <t5833>Tom went down the lightning rod to see how things were, and since the black man at the back door was asleep, he slipped it into his shirt from behind and came back.</t5833> <t5834>The letter said:</t5834>
<t5835>"Do not betray me, I wish to be your friend.</t5835> <t5836>There is a desperate band of murderers from Indian territory who are going to steal your fugitive black man tonight, and they have tried to scare you into staying home and not bothering them.</t5836> <t5837>I am from the band, but I have repented and want to leave it and lead an honest life again and I want to betray their infernal plans.</t5837> <t5838>They will arrive at exactly midnight from the north, by the fence, with a false key, and will go to the black man's cabin to take him away.</t5838> <t5839>I have to stay behind and blow a horn if I see danger, but what I will do is bleat like a sheep as soon as they arrive and not blow the horn; then, while they are removing the chains, you can go and lock them up and kill them whenever you want.</t5839> <t5840>Do nothing more than what I tell you; because if not, they will surely suspect something and create a disaster.</t5840> <t5841>I do not desire any reward, but to know that I have acted rightly.</t5841>
<t5842>"AN UNKNOWN FRIEND"</t5842>
<t5843>Chapter 40</t5843>
<t5844>AFTER BREAKFAST we felt so good that we took out the canoe to go fishing in the river, with some sandwiches, and we had a lot of fun; we went to where the raft was, saw that it was fine, and got home late for dinner, and we saw them so scared and worried that they didn't even know where to look and made us go to bed as soon as we finished dinner without telling us what was going on, not a word about the new letter, but it wasn't necessary, because we were more informed than anyone, and as soon as we went up half the stairs and Aunt Sally turned around, we went to the basement pantry, took out plenty of food, brought it up to our room, and went to bed.</t5844> <t5845>Around eleven-thirty we got up and Tom put on Aunt Sally's dress that he had stolen to go with the food, but he said:</t5845>
<t5846>—Where is the butter?</t5846>
<t5847>—I got a good piece —I said— on a slice of cornbread.</t5847>
<t5848>—Well, you left it there; it's not here.</t5848>
<t5849>—We can do without her —I replied.</t5849>
<t5850>—We can also go with her —he said—, so go back to the basement and bring her.</t5850> <t5851>Then slide down the lightning rod and come over.</t5851> <t5852>I'm going to put the straw in Jim's clothes so he can pretend to be his disguised mother and be ready to bleat like a sheep and take off as soon as you arrive.</t5852>
<t5853>So he left and I went to the basement.</t5853> <t5854>The piece of butter, the size of a fist, was where I had left it, so I took the piece of cornbread where I had placed it and went up to the main floor, but Aunt Sally appeared with a candle and I stuffed everything into my hat and put it on my head.</t5854> <t5855>When she saw me, she immediately said:</t5855>
<t5856>—Have you gone down to the basement?</t5856>
<t5857>—Yes, ma'am.</t5857>
<t5858>—What were you doing there?</t5858>
<t5859>—Nothing.</t5859>
<t5860>—Nothing!</t5860>
<t5861>—No, ma'am.</t5861>
<t5862>—Well, then, what has made you come down at this hour of the night?</t5862>
<t5863>—I don't know.</t5863>
<t5864>—Don't you know?</t5864> <t5865>Don't tell me those things, Tom. I want to know what you were doing down there.</t5865>
<t5866>—I wasn't doing anything, Aunt Sally.</t5866> <t5867>May I die if it's not true.</t5867>
<t5868>I figured that now she would let me go, and generally that's what she would have done, but I guess so many strange things were happening that anything that wasn't crystal clear made her nervous, so she goes and says, very determined:</t5868>
<t5869>—Go into the room and stay there until I come back.</t5869> <t5870>You went and did something you shouldn't have, and I bet I'll find out what it was before I'm done with you.</t5870>
<t5871>So he left while I opened the door and entered the room.</t5871> <t5872>My God, how many people were there!</t5872> <t5873>Fifteen farmers, and each one of them with a weapon.</t5873> <t5874>I felt terrible, I let myself fall into a chair and sat down.</t5874> <t5875>They were also seated, some talking a little, in low voices, and all of them restless and nervous, trying to pretend they weren't; but I knew they were because they kept taking off their hats and putting them back on, scratching their ears and changing seats and buttoning and unbuttoning.</t5875> <t5876>I wasn't calm either, but in any case, I didn't take off my hat.</t5876>
<t5877>What I felt like was for Aunt Sally to arrive and give me the beating to get it over with, if she wanted, and let me go to tell Tom how we had exaggerated everything and what a mess we had gotten ourselves into, so that we could stop fooling around and take off with Jim before those bumpkins ran out of patience and came after us.</t5877>
<t5878>He finally arrived and started asking me questions, but I couldn't answer them properly and didn't know what to say, because those men were so nervous that some wanted to start immediately and pounce on those bandits, because as they said, there were only a few minutes left until midnight, while others tried to hold them back and wait for the signal; meanwhile, there was Aunt Sally, asking questions non-stop, and I was trembling all over and about to faint from fear, and it was getting hotter and hotter and the butter was starting to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears, until one of them goes and says:</t5878>
<t5879>—I am about to go to the cabin immediately and catch them there when they arrive.</t5879>
<t5880>I almost fainted and a stream of butter dripped down my forehead.</t5880> <t5881>When Aunt Sally saw it, she turned as white as a sheet, and she goes and says:</t5881>
<t5882>—For heaven's sake, what's wrong with this boy?</t5882> <t5883>He surely has brain fever and his brains are coming out!</t5883> <t5884>Everyone came running to see what was happening, she took off my hat and with it came out the bread and what was left of the butter; then she hugged me, saying: —You gave me such a scare!</t5884> <t5885>And I'm so glad it's nothing worse, because we have nothing but problems, and misfortunes never come alone, and when I saw that I thought you were going to die, because I imagined from the color that it was as if your brains were going to...</t5885> <t5886>My God, my God, why didn't you tell me what you had gone down to get?</t5886> <t5887>I wouldn't have minded.</t5887> <t5888>Now go to bed and don't let me see you again until tomorrow!</t5888>
<t5889>I went up the stairs in a second, went down the lightning rod in another, and searched for the shed in the middle of the darkness.</t5889> <t5890>I could barely speak because I was so worried, but I told Tom as quickly as I could that we had to get out without wasting a minute: the house was full of armed men!</t5890>
<t5891>His eyes shone brightly, and he goes and says:</t5891>
<t5892>—No! Really?</t5892> <t5893>Man, Huck, if we had to do it again, we would surely bring two hundred!</t5893> <t5894>If we could postpone it...</t5894>
<t5895>—Quick! Quick! —I replied—.</t5895> <t5896>Where is Jim?</t5896>
<t5897>—Right there next to you; if you stretch out your arm, you can touch it.</t5897> <t5898>He's already dressed and everything else is ready.</t5898> <t5899>We can go and give the signal of the bleat.</t5899>
<t5900>But then we heard the footsteps of the men approaching the door and the noise they made when opening the padlock, and one of them said:</t5900>
<t5901>—I told you it was too early; they haven't arrived: the door is closed.</t5901> <t5902>Come on, some of you go to the cabin, wait for them in the dark, and kill them when they arrive, and the rest of you spread out and pay attention to hear them coming.</t5902>
<t5903>So they came in, but in the darkness they couldn't see us and almost all of them stepped on us while we tried to get under the bed.</t5903> <t5904>But we managed to get in there and out through the hole, quickly but without making any noise.</t5904> <t5905>Jim first, then me, and Tom last, which was what Tom had ordered.</t5905> <t5906>We were already in the shed and we heard the footsteps of those walking nearby.</t5906> <t5907>So we crawled to the door and Tom stopped us there and started looking through the crack, but he couldn't see anything because it was so dark, and he whispered to us that he would listen until the footsteps moved further away, and when he nudged us, Jim had to go out first and he would go last.</t5907> <t5908>So he put his ear to the crack and listened, listened, and listened, and the footsteps kept circling nearby all the time; finally, he nudged us and we left bent over, without breathing or making the slightest noise, sneaking in single file towards the fence until we got there and Jim and I jumped over it; but Tom got his pants caught on a splinter in the top log, so he had to pull to free himself, causing the splinter to break and make a noise, and when he dropped down to follow us, someone shouted:</t5908>
<t5909>—Who goes there? Answer or I'll shoot!</t5909>
<t5910>But we didn't respond; we stood up and started running.</t5910> <t5911>Then we heard some running and a bang, bang, bang!, and how the bullets whistled!</t5911> <t5912>We heard them shout:</t5912>
<t5913>—There they are! They're going to the river!</t5913> <t5914>Let's follow them, boys, and release the dogs!</t5914>
<t5915>So they started running at full speed.</t5915> <t5916>We could hear them well because they were wearing boots and shouting, but we neither wore boots nor shouted.</t5916> <t5917>We were heading towards the mill, and when they got very close, we hid among the bushes, let them pass, and then got behind them.</t5917> <t5918>They had kept the dogs very quiet so as not to scare the thieves, but now they had let them loose and they were making so much noise it was as if there were a million of them, but they were ours, so we stopped until they reached us, and when they saw that it was just us and that we offered no adventure, they simply greeted us and ran off towards where the noises and shouts were coming from, and we went back up towards the river, running behind them until we almost reached the mill and then we came out from the bushes where my canoe was tied, got into it and started rowing like mad towards the middle of the river, making no more noise than necessary.</t5918> <t5919>Then we calmly set the bow towards the island where my raft was and heard them shouting and barking at each other up the riverbank, until we were so far that the noises faded and disappeared.</t5919> <t5920>When we reached the raft, I went and said:</t5920>
<t5921>—Now, old Jim, you are free again, and I bet you will never be a slave again.</t5921>
<t5922>—And you did very well, Huck; it was very well planned and very well executed, and there is no one in the world who can make a plan as complicated and splendid as this one.</t5922>
<t5923>We were all very happy, but Tom was the happiest of all because he had been shot in the calf.</t5923>
<t5924>When Jim and I found out, we didn't feel as happy as before.</t5924> <t5925>It hurt him a lot and he was bleeding, so we laid him down in the wigwam and tore one of the duke's shirts to bandage him, but he goes and says:</t5925>
<t5926>—Give me those strips; I can do it myself.</t5926> <t5927>Now don't stop, don't stay around here, with an escape going so well.</t5927> <t5928>To the oars and let's go!</t5928> <t5929>Boys, it turned out great!</t5929> <t5930>Really, it did.</t5930> <t5931>I wish we had been in charge of Louis XVI's escape, and then in his biography they wouldn't have written that "Son of Saint Louis, ascend to heaven"; no, sir; we would have made him cross the border, that's what we would have done with him and with great ease: to the oars... to the oars!</t5931>
<t5932>But Jim and I were consulting each other, and thinking, and after a minute or so I go and say:</t5932>
<t5933>—You say it, Jim.</t5933>
<t5934>And he says:</t5934>
<t5935>—Well, this is what it seems to me, Huck: if it were him we were freeing and one of the boys got shot, would he say: "Go ahead, save me and don't think about a doctor to save that other one"?</t5935> <t5936>Would Tom Sawyer do that?</t5936> <t5937>Would he say that?</t5937> <t5938>You can bet he wouldn't!</t5938> <t5939>Well then, are you going to say it, Jim?</t5939> <t5940>No, sir, I won't take a step out of here without a doctor; even if it takes forty years.</t5940>
<t5941>I already knew that inside he was white and I figured he was going to say what he had said, so now everything was fine and I told Tom that I was going to look for a doctor.</t5941> <t5942>He started to make a fuss, but Jim and I stood firm and didn't want to give in; so he said he would get off and untie the raft by himself; but we didn't let him.</t5942> <t5943>Then he scolded us, but it was to no avail.</t5943>
<t5944>So when he saw me preparing the canoe, he said:</t5944>
<t5945>—Well, then, if you have to go, I'm going to tell you what you should do when you get to the village.</t5945> <t5946>You close the door and blindfold the doctor very well and make him swear that his lips are sealed; you give him a bag full of gold coins and then take him out and lead him around all the alleys in the dark.</t5946> <t5947>Then you bring him here in the canoe, turning between the islands, search him and take the chalk away from him and don't give it back until he has returned to the village, because if not, he will mark the raft with chalk to find it again.</t5947> <t5948>That's what everyone does.</t5948>
<t5949>So we told him we would do it and left, and Jim had to hide in the forest when he saw the doctor coming until he left again.</t5949>
<t5950>Chapter 41</t5950>
<t5951>THE DOCTOR WAS OLD; a very nice and kind old man.</t5951> <t5952>When I woke him up, I told him that my brother and I were on Española Island hunting yesterday afternoon and had camped on a piece of raft we found, but that, around midnight, I must have hit the shotgun while dreaming, because it went off and hit him in the leg.</t5952> <t5953>We wanted him to go treat it without saying anything or telling anyone, because we intended to go home that afternoon to surprise the family.</t5953>
<t5954>—What family are you from? —he asks.</t5954>
<t5955>—From the Phelps family, down the river.</t5955>
<t5956>—Ah —he says, and after a minute he repeats—: How did you say he shot himself?</t5956>
<t5957>—He had a dream and shot himself —I replied to him.</t5957>
<t5958>—Strange dream —he commented.</t5958>
<t5959>So he lit the lantern, grabbed the first aid kit, and we set off.</t5959> <t5960>But when he saw the canoe, he didn't like it; he said it was fine for one person, but it didn't seem safe for two.</t5960> <t5961>And I go and say:</t5961>
<t5962>—Ah, don't be afraid, sir, he took all three of us with ease.</t5962>
<t5963>—What three?</t5963>
<t5964>—Well, for me and Sid... and... and the shotguns; that's what I meant to say.</t5964>
<t5965>—Ah.</t5965>
<t5966>But he put his foot on the gunwale and made it move, shook his head, and said he would look for a bigger one.</t5966> <t5967>But they were all chained and locked, so he got into my canoe and said to wait until he came back, or that if I couldn't keep looking, or maybe it would be better to go home and prepare the family for the surprise, if that's what I wanted.</t5967> <t5968>But I told him no, so I explained how to find the raft and he set off.</t5968>
<t5969>Then an idea occurred to me.</t5969> <t5970>I said to myself: "What if he can't fix his leg in a jiffy, as the saying goes?</t5970> <t5971>What if it takes him three or four days?</t5971> <t5972>What are we going to do?</t5972> <t5973>Wait around until he tells someone?</t5973> <t5974>No, sir; I know what I'm going to do.</t5974> <t5975>I'll wait, and when he comes back, if he says he has to return, I'll go with him even if I have to swim, we'll tie him up and take him down the river, and when Tom is healed we'll pay him whatever it takes, or everything we have, and then we'll let him disembark."</t5975>
<t5976>So I got into a pile of firewood to sleep a bit, and when I woke up, the sun was already quite high.</t5976> <t5977>I ran to the doctor's house but they told me he had left at night and hadn't come back yet.</t5977> <t5978>“Well,” I thought, “it seems like Tom is doing poorly, so I'm heading straight to the island.”</t5978> <t5979>And I set off, but when I turned the corner, I almost ran straight into Uncle Silas.</t5979> <t5980>He goes and says:</t5980>
<t5981>—Hey, Tom!</t5981> <t5982>Where have you been all this time, rascal?</t5982>
<t5983>—I haven't been anywhere —I said—, except hunting the runaway black man with Sid.</t5983>
<t5984>—Well, where have you been? —he asks—.</t5984> <t5985>Your aunt was worried.</t5985>
<t5986>—Well, there was no reason —I said—, because it was very good.</t5986> <t5987>We followed the men and the dogs, but they ran faster than us and we got lost, but we thought we had heard them in the water, so we took out a canoe, followed them and crossed to the other side, but we didn't see them; then we followed the riverbank upstream until we got tired, tied up the canoe and fell asleep, and we haven't woken up until an hour ago; then we came rowing to see what was happening and Sid has gone to the post office to see if he finds out anything and I'm walking around to see if I can get something to eat before going home.</t5987>
<t5988>So we went to the post office to look for "Sid," but as I suspected, he wasn't there; so the old man picked up a letter that had arrived for him and we waited a while longer.</t5988> <t5989>Since Sid didn't show up, the old man said we should leave and that Sid could walk home, or take the canoe, when he finished fooling around in town, but that we would return in the cart.</t5989> <t5990>I couldn't get him to let me stay to wait for Sid, because he said it wouldn't do any good, and I had to go back with him so Aunt Sally could see that we were all right.</t5990>
<t5991>When we got home, Aunt Sally was so happy to see me that she started laughing and crying at the same time while hugging me and giving me one of those beatings of hers that you couldn't even feel, and then she said she would do the same to Sid when he got home.</t5991>
<t5992>The house was full of farmers and their wives who had come to eat and wouldn't stop talking.</t5992> <t5993>The worst was old Mrs. Hotchkiss, who was chattering away like there was no tomorrow.</t5993> <t5994>She goes and says:</t5994>
<t5995>—Well, Sister Phelps, I've searched that cabin everywhere and I think the black man was crazy.</t5995> <t5996>I told Sister Damrell, didn't I, Sister Damrell?</t5996> <t5997>I said, he's crazy, with these very words.</t5997> <t5998>You've all heard me: he's crazy, that's what I say; and it shows in everything.</t5998> <t5999>Just look at that millstone, that's what I say; no one can tell me that someone who goes and writes all those crazy things on a millstone isn't crazy, that's what I say.</t5999> <t6000>Here this person had their heart broken, and that one suffered for thirty-seven years, and all that: natural son of Louis something-or-other, and all those nonsense.</t6000> <t6001>He's nuts, that's what I say and I say it to begin with, in the middle, and to end with: that black man is crazy; he's crazy; crazier than Nebuchadnezzar, that's what I say.</t6001>
<t6002>—If you only need to look at that ladder made of rags, Sister Hotchkiss —says old Mrs. Damrell—; why on earth would anyone want...</t6002>
<t6003>—The same thing I was saying a moment ago to Sister Utterback, and if not, let her say so.</t6003> <t6004>She has seen that rag ladder, that's what I say; yes, look at it, that's what I say; what was I going to do with it?</t6004> <t6005>Sister Hotchkiss says...</t6005>
<t6006>—But, how the heck did they get that millstone in there?</t6006> <t6007>And, who made the hole?</t6007> <t6008>And, who...?</t6008>
<t6009>"That's what I say, brother Penrod!"</t6009> <t6010>"I was saying, pass me that little plate of molasses, please, I was saying to sister Dunlap a minute ago, how did they get that mill wheel in there?"</t6010> <t6011>"And without help, mind you, without help!"</t6011> <t6012>"That's the point."</t6012> <t6013>"Don't tell me, I say; they had help, I say, and a lot of help, that's what I say; heaps of help, I say; a dozen helped that black man, and as for me, I'd whip all the blacks here until I found out who they were, that's what I say; and, furthermore, I say..."</t6013>
<t6014>—A dozen, you say!</t6014> <t6015>Not even forty could have done so many things.</t6015> <t6016>Just look at those saws made from kitchen knives and everything else, the care with which they are made; just look at the leg of that cot sawed with them, which is a week's work for six men...</t6016> <t6017>Just look at that black doll made of straw on the bed and just look at...</t6017>
<t6018>—You are absolutely right, Brother Hightower!</t6018> <t6019>That's what I was telling Brother Phelps here.</t6019> <t6020>He says, "What do you think of all this, Sister Hotchkiss?", he says.</t6020> <t6021>What do I think of what, Brother Phelps?, I say.</t6021> <t6022>"What do you think of the bed of that cot being sawed like that?", he says.</t6022> <t6023>What do I think?, I say.</t6023> <t6024>What I think is that it didn't saw itself, I say; someone did it, I say; that's my opinion, for what it's worth; maybe it's worth nothing, I say, but whether it's worth something or not, it's my opinion, I say, and if someone has a better one, I say, let them say it, I say, and that's all.</t6024> <t6025>I tell Sister Dunlap, I say...</t6025>
<t6026>—Well, hang me, there must have been a whole gang of blacks who spent every night for four weeks to have done so much work, sister Phelps.</t6026> <t6027>Just look at that shirt; it's completely covered inch by inch with that secret African writing done in blood!</t6027> <t6028>There must have been a bunch of them all the time, or almost.</t6028> <t6029>Man, I'd give two dollars for someone to read it to me, and as for the blacks who wrote it, I'd whip them until...</t6029>
<t6030>—People who helped him, Brother Marples!</t6030> <t6031>Well, you could be sure of that if you had been in this house for some time now.</t6031> <t6032>But they stole everything they could, and that's with us being vigilant all the time.</t6032> <t6033>They stole that shirt from the clothesline! And as for the sheet they used to make the ladder, God knows how many times they stole it; and flour and candles and candlesticks and spoons and the old heater and almost a thousand things I can't even remember, my new calico dress, and that's with me and Silas and my Sid and my Tom watching all day and all night, as I was telling you, and none of us could see or hear anything they were doing, and now, at the last minute, they escape right under our noses and fool us, and not only fool us but also the Indian Territory thieves, and they go and escape with that black man without anyone laying a hand on them, and that's with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs chasing them just as they were escaping!</t6033> <t6034>I'm telling you, I've never heard anything like it in my life.</t6034> <t6035>Not even spirits could have done it better or with more intelligence.</t6035> <t6036>And I reckon they must have been spirits, because you know your dogs and there are none better; and those dogs didn't pick up their trail even once!</t6036> <t6037>Let someone who understands it explain it to me!</t6037> <t6038>Let's see who would be able to understand it!</t6038>
<t6039>—Well, the truth is that...</t6039>
<t6040>—For God's sake, never...</t6040>
<t6041>—God bless me, I wouldn't have believed it...</t6041>
<t6042>—House burglars, in addition to...</t6042>
<t6043>—By God and all the saints, I would be scared to live in a...</t6043>
<t6044>—Fear of living!</t6044> <t6045>Man, I was so scared that I hardly dared to lie down, stretch out, or sit down, Sister Ridgeway.</t6045> <t6046>But they were even stealing...</t6046> <t6047>My God, you can imagine the state I was in at midnight yesterday.</t6047> <t6048>I swear I was afraid they would take someone from the family!</t6048> <t6049>I had reached a point where I couldn't even reason anymore.</t6049> <t6050>Now in the daytime, it seems silly, but I was saying to myself: "There are my two poor little boys sleeping, all alone upstairs, in that room," and I truly tell you I was so scared that I went up the stairs and locked them in.</t6050> <t6051>That's what I did, and what anyone would do.</t6051> <t6052>Because, you know, when one is so scared it gets worse because the head starts to stop working, the most absurd things come to mind, and over time one begins to think: "Suppose I were a boy and I was up there with the door unlocked and it was..." —She fell silent with a somewhat astonished air, then slowly turned her head, and when she looked at me... I got up and went for a walk.</t6052>
<t6053>I said to myself: "I will be able to explain better why we weren't in the room this morning if I go aside and think about it for a bit," and so I did.</t6053> <t6054>But I didn't dare go too far, because I had been sent for.</t6054> <t6055>As it got late, everyone left and then I went in and told her that Sid and I had been woken up by the screams and noises, and since the door was closed and we wanted to see what was happening, we climbed down the lightning rod and both of us got a bit hurt, so we couldn't do it anymore.</t6055> <t6056>Then I went to tell her everything I had told Uncle Silas before, and then she said she forgave us and that it was logical and to be expected from boys, because all boys were crazy, as far as she knew, and as long as nothing had happened to us, she thought it was better to feel grateful that we were alive and well and to keep loving us, instead of worrying about things that had already happened.</t6056> <t6057>She kissed me, stroked my head, became very thoughtful and after a moment she jumped up and said:</t6057>
<t6058>—God bless me, it's almost night and Sid still hasn't arrived!</t6058> <t6059>What could have happened to that boy?</t6059>
<t6060>There I saw my opportunity, so I also jumped and said:</t6060>
<t6061>—I'm going to the village to bring it —I say.</t6061>
<t6062>—No, no way —she says—.</t6062> <t6063>You stay where you are; it's enough that one gets lost.</t6063> <t6064>If he doesn't arrive by dinner time, your uncle will go.</t6064>
<t6065>Well, he didn't arrive at dinner time, so immediately afterward the uncle went out.</t6065>
<t6066>He returned around ten a little uneasy: he hadn't found a trace of Tom.</t6066> <t6067>Aunt Sally is very uneasy; but Uncle Silas said there was no reason to be, that it was just boys being boys and that he would show up in the morning safe and sound.</t6067> <t6068>So she had to keep quiet, but she said that in any case she would stay up waiting for him and leave a light on so he could see it.</t6068>
<t6069>And then, when I went to bed, she came up with me and brought her candle, tucked me in, and treated me so well that I felt like a scoundrel, as if I couldn't look her in the eyes.</t6069> <t6070>She sat on the bed to chat with me for a long time and said what a splendid boy Sid was; it seemed as if she didn't want to stop talking about him, constantly asking me if I thought he might have gotten lost or hurt, or maybe drowned, and that he could be suffering somewhere right now, or dead, without her there to help him, while silent tears fell, and I told her that Sid was fine and that he would surely be home by morning.</t6070> <t6071>She would squeeze my hand, or give me a kiss, and ask me to repeat it and not stop, because it did her so much good and she was having such a hard time.</t6071> <t6072>When she was about to leave, she looked me in the eyes very intently and affectionately, and then she said:</t6072>
<t6073>—Tom, I'm not going to lock the door, and there's the window and the lightning rod, but you're going to be good, right?</t6073> <t6074>And you're not going to leave?</t6074> <t6075>Do it for me.</t6075>
<t6076>God knows how much I wanted to go out and see what was happening with Tom, and that I had no other intention; but after that, I wouldn't have left even if they had given me entire kingdoms.</t6076>
<t6077>But I couldn't stop thinking about her and Tom, so I slept very restlessly.</t6077> <t6078>That night I climbed down the lightning rod twice and went to the main entrance, and there I saw her sitting with her candle at the window, looking at the road and crying nonstop, and I thought that I wished I could do something for her, but I couldn't, except swear that I would never do anything to make her sad again.</t6078> <t6079>The third time I woke up was at dawn, I climbed down the lightning rod and there she was, with the candle almost finished, with her old head resting on her hand; she had fallen asleep.</t6079>
<t6080>Chapter 42</t6080>
<t6081>THE OLD MAN RETURNED to the village before breakfast, but he found no trace of Tom, and the two sat at the table, thinking without saying anything, with a very sad air while their coffee grew cold, and without eating anything.</t6081> <t6082>After a while, the old man goes and says:</t6082>
<t6083>—Have I given you the letter?</t6083>
<t6084>—What letter?</t6084>
<t6085>—The one they gave me yesterday at the post office.</t6085>
<t6086>—No, you haven't given me any letter.</t6086>
<t6087>—Well, I must have forgotten.</t6087>
<t6088>He started searching in his pockets and then went somewhere to find where he had left it, brought it, and gave it to her.</t6088> <t6089>She goes and says:</t6089>
<t6090>—But it's from Saint Petersburg, from my sister.</t6090>
<t6091>I decided that another walk would do me good, but I couldn't even move.</t6091> <t6092>Before she could open it, she dropped it and started running, because she had seen something.</t6092> <t6093>And so did I.</t6093> <t6094>It was Tom Sawyer lying on a mattress, and the old doctor and Jim in her calico dress, with his hands tied behind his back, and a bunch of people.</t6094> <t6095>I hid the letter behind the first thing that came to mind and ran out.</t6095> <t6096>She rushed towards Tom, crying, and goes and says:</t6096>
<t6097>—Oh, he's dead, he's dead, surely he's dead!</t6097>
<t6098>Tom turned his head slightly and said something that showed he wasn't right in the head, and she raised her hands to the sky and said:</t6098>
<t6099>—He's alive, thank God! And that's enough for me!</t6099> <t6100>She gave him a kiss and ran to the house to prepare the bed, giving orders left and right to the black servants and everyone, as fast as she could and with every step she took.</t6100>
<t6101>I followed the men to find out what they were going to do with Jim, and the old doctor and Uncle Silas followed Tom to the house.</t6101> <t6102>The men were furious and wanted to hang Jim to set an example for all the other blacks in the area, so they wouldn't try to escape like Jim had done or cause so much commotion and have an entire family almost scared to death for days and nights.</t6102> <t6103>But the others said, "No, that can't be done; that black man isn't ours, and surely the owner will show up and make us pay for him."</t6103> <t6104>So they cooled down a bit, because the people who are most eager to hang a black man who has done something are always the same ones who don't want to pay for him once he has served their purpose.</t6104>
<t6105>They called Jim all sorts of names and hit him on the head from time to time, but Jim didn't say anything; he never let slip that he knew me.</t6105> <t6106>They took him to the same cabin, put his own clothes on him, and chained him up again, but this time not to the leg of a cot, but to a huge ring nailed to the lower trunk, and they also chained his hands and both legs and said they wouldn't give him anything to eat but bread and water until his owner showed up or they sold him at an auction, if he didn't show up after a certain time, and they filled in the hole we had made and said that every night there would be a couple of farmers with shotguns guarding the cabin and with a bulldog at the door.</t6106> <t6107>By then they had finished their work, and were about to leave with a sort of general curse of farewell when the old doctor appeared, who saw all that and goes and says:</t6107>
<t6108>—Do not treat him worse than necessary, because he is not a bad black man.</t6108> <t6109>When I arrived where I found the boy, I saw that I couldn't remove the bullet without some help and that he wasn't in a condition to be left alone while I went to get it, and he kept getting worse and worse, and after a while, he lost his mind and wouldn't let me get close; he said that if I marked the raft with chalk, he would kill me and all sorts of absurd things.</t6109> <t6110>When I saw that I couldn't do anything for him, I said to myself: "I need someone to help me," and just then that black man appeared out of nowhere and said he would help me, and he really did help me.</t6110> <t6111>Of course, I thought he must be a runaway black man, but that's how things were, and I had to stay there all the rest of the day and all night.</t6111> <t6112>I assure you it has been difficult!</t6112> <t6113>I had a couple of patients with fevers and naturally, I would have liked to go to town to see them, but I didn't dare because the black man could escape and then it would be my fault; however, not a single skiff came close enough for me to call.</t6113> <t6114>So I had to stay there until dawn this morning, and I have never seen a black man who knew better how to take care of a sick person or was more faithful, even though he had to put his freedom at risk, and on top of that, he was exhausted and it was clear that he had had a lot to do recently.</t6114> <t6115>That's why I liked that black man; and I assure you, gentlemen, that a black man like that is worth a thousand dollars and should be treated well.</t6115> <t6116>I didn't have everything I needed and the boy was recovering just as if he were at home, and maybe better because it was very quiet, but there I was with both of them in my hands, and I had to stay there until dawn; then some men appeared in a skiff, and luckily the black man was sitting next to the mattress with his head resting on his knees, sleeping like a log; so I signaled to them silently, and they approached, grabbed him, and tied him up without him realizing what was happening, and we haven't had any problems.</t6116> <t6117>Since the boy was also half asleep, we wrapped the oars with some cloths, hooked up the raft, and towed it silently, and the black man didn't make any fuss or say a word from the beginning.</t6117> <t6118>He is not a bad black man, gentlemen; that's what I have to say about him.</t6118>
<t6119>Someone said:</t6119>
<t6120>—Well, that says a lot about him, doctor, it must be said.</t6120>
<t6121>Then the others also softened a bit, and I was very glad that the old doctor behaved so well with Jim, and also that it matched what I had thought of him, because it seemed to me that he was a man of good heart since I first saw him.</t6121> <t6122>Then everyone decided that Jim had acted very well and deserved some compensation.</t6122> <t6123>So everyone promised, immediately and wholeheartedly, that they would not curse him again.</t6123>
<t6124>Then they went out and locked him up.</t6124> <t6125>I hoped they would say they could remove one or two of the chains, because they were very heavy, or that he could eat some meat and vegetables with the bread and water, but it didn't occur to them, and I figured it was better not to get involved in the matter, but rather to tell Aunt Sally the doctor's story as best I could once the storm that was coming over me passed; I mean the explanations of how I had forgotten to mention that Sid had been shot when I started to tell how he and I had spent that night rowing between the islands in search of the runaway black man.</t6125>
<t6126>But he had plenty of time.</t6126> <t6127>Aunt Sally stayed with the sick person all day and all night, and every time she saw Uncle Silas with that long face, I would escape from him.</t6127>
<t6128>The next morning I found out that Tom was doing much better, and they said that Aunt Sally had gone to take a nap.</t6128> <t6129>So I went to the room and, if I found him awake, I figured we could come up with a story that the family would believe.</t6129> <t6130>But he was asleep and very peaceful, and pale, not with his face all flushed like when he arrived.</t6130> <t6131>So I sat down and waited for him to wake up.</t6131> <t6132>After about half an hour, Aunt Sally arrived quietly and there I was, in trouble again!</t6132> <t6133>She motioned for me not to say anything and sat down next to me, and started whispering that now we could all be happy, because all the symptoms were improving and he had been sleeping for a long time, getting better and more peaceful, and she bet ten to one that when he woke up he would have regained all his senses.</t6133>
<t6134>We stayed there watching him, and after a while, he moved a little, opened his eyes quite naturally, looked around, and said:</t6134>
<t6135>—Hello! But I'm at home!</t6135> <t6136>How did it happen? Where is the raft?</t6136>
<t6137>—Everything is going well —I replied.</t6137>
<t6138>—And Jim?</t6138>
<t6139>—Same —I said, but without much conviction.</t6139> <t6140>But he didn't notice and said:</t6140>
<t6141>—Great! Splendid!</t6141> <t6142>Now we are in order and safe!</t6142> <t6143>Have you told Auntie?</t6143>
<t6144>I was about to say yes, but she intervened and goes and says:</t6144>
<t6145>—What, Sid?</t6145>
<t6146>—Man, how we organized everything.</t6146>
<t6147>—What do you mean by everything?</t6147>
<t6148>—Man, everything that has happened.</t6148> <t6149>It's the only thing to tell; how Tom and I set the black man free.</t6149>
<t6150>—My God!</t6150> <t6151>What did you put him in ...?</t6151> <t6152>What is this boy talking about!</t6152> <t6153>My God, my God, he's lost his mind again!</t6153>
<t6154>—No, I haven't lost my mind; I know perfectly well what I'm saying.</t6154> <t6155>Yes, Tom and I did set him free.</t6155> <t6156>We decided to do it and we did it.</t6156> <t6157>And we did it with a lot of style.</t6157> <t6158>—It had started moving and she couldn't stop it; she just sat there watching and watching and let it go on.</t6158> <t6159>I realized that it made no sense for me to intervene—.</t6159> <t6160>But, auntie, it took us a tremendous amount of work, whole weeks, hours and hours every night, while you all slept.</t6160> <t6161>We had to steal candles and the sheet and the shirt and your dress and the spoons and the tin plates and the kitchen knives and the heater, the grindstone and the flour and all sorts of things, and you can't imagine the work it took us to make the saws and the pens and the inscriptions and everything else; you have no idea how much fun we had.</t6161> <t6162>We had to draw the coffins and the rest, the anonymous letters from the thieves, and go up and down the lightning rod, and make the hole in the cabin and the rope ladder and bake it into a cake and send him spoons and things to work with, which we put in the pockets of your apron...</t6162>
<t6163>—God help me!</t6163>
<t6164>—...</t6164> <t6165>And filling the cabin with rats and snakes and everything else to keep Jim company, and then you made Tom stay here so long with the butter inside his hat that you almost ruined everything, because the men arrived before we had left the cabin and we had to run out and they heard us and shot at us and I got hit, and we moved off the path and let them pass, and when the dogs came they didn't find us interesting, but went where there was more noise; we took out the canoe and went to the raft and we were safe and Jim was a free man, and we did it all by ourselves and it was great, Aunt!</t6165>
<t6166>—Well, in my life I've never heard anything like it!</t6166> <t6167>So it was you, rascals, who organized all this commotion and left us all not knowing what to think, almost scared to death.</t6167> <t6168>It makes me more eager than ever to make you pay for it right now.</t6168> <t6169>To think that I've spent night after night here... wait until you're fully recovered, scoundrel, and you'll see how I beat the devil out of you!</t6169>
<t6170>But Tom was so proud and so happy that he couldn't stop, and he kept on talking while she intervened and spat fire all the time, both at once, like a meeting of cats, and in the end she says:</t6170>
<t6171>—Well, have as much fun as you can now, because I assure you that if I catch you talking to him again...</t6171>
<t6172>—Talking to whom? —asks Tom, stopping his smile and looking surprised.</t6172>
<t6173>—With whom?</t6173> <t6174>Well, with the runaway black man, of course.</t6174> <t6175>What did you think?</t6175>
<t6176>Tom looked at me very seriously, and then he said:</t6176>
<t6177>—Tom, didn't you just tell me that he was fine? Hasn't he escaped?</t6177>
<t6178>—Him? —says Aunt Sally— The runaway black man?</t6178> <t6179>Of course not.</t6179> <t6180>They've brought him back here safe and sound, and he's in the same cabin, on bread and water, and loaded with chains until someone comes to claim him or we sell him!</t6180>
<t6181>Tom sat up abruptly in bed, with his eyes wide open and flaring his nostrils as if they were gills, and he shouts at me:</t6181>
<t6182>—You have no right to keep him locked up! Get out, and don't waste a minute.</t6182> <t6183>Let him go!</t6183> <t6184>He is not a slave.</t6184> <t6185>He is as free as anyone else!</t6185>
<t6186>—What is this boy talking about?</t6186>
<t6187>—I mean it, Aunt Sally, and if no one goes, I will.</t6187> <t6188>I've known him all my life just like Tom here.</t6188> <t6189>Old Miss Watson died two months ago and felt ashamed for having intended to sell him down the river and said so, and she granted him freedom in her will.</t6189>
<t6190>—So, why the hell did you want to set him free if he was already free?</t6190>
<t6191>—Well, that is indeed a question, I must say, typical of a woman!</t6191> <t6192>Man, well, because I wanted to try the adventure, and I would have been capable of getting into blood up to my neck for... Good heavens, AUNT POLLY!</t6192>
<t6193>May I die right now if he wasn't there, right next to the door, with an air as complacent and satisfied as an angel who had just gorged on cake!</t6193>
<t6194>Aunt Sally jumped towards her and almost took her head off with a hug.</t6194> <t6195>She started crying with her, and I found a good spot under the bed, because I had the feeling that things were getting pretty tough for us.</t6195> <t6196>I looked from underneath and after a while Aunt Polly let go and stood there looking at Tom over her glasses, you know, as if she were tearing him to pieces.</t6196> <t6197>And then she goes and says:</t6197>
<t6198>—Yes, you'd better look the other way; it's what I would do in your case, Tom.</t6198>
<t6199>—Oh my God! —says Aunt Sally— Has he changed that much?</t6199> <t6200>But that's not Tom, it's Sid; Tom is... but, where is Tom? He was here just a moment ago.</t6200>
<t6201>—You mean where Huck Finn is... that's who you mean!</t6201> <t6202>I reckon I haven't raised a rascal like my Tom all these years not to recognize him when I see him.</t6202> <t6203>That would be good.</t6203> <t6204>Come out from under the bed, Huck Finn.</t6204>
<t6205>That was what I did.</t6205> <t6206>But I didn't feel very happy.</t6206>
<t6207>Aunt Sally became one of the people who understood the least of anything I have ever seen in my life, except for one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he came and they told him everything.</t6207> <t6208>You could say it was as if he got drunk, and he spent the rest of the day not understanding anything.</t6208> <t6209>That night he preached a sermon at the church meeting that gave him a phenomenal reputation, because not even the oldest person in the world would have understood it.</t6209> <t6210>So Aunt Polly told everyone who I was, and I had to confess that I was in such a bad situation that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer... —and then she intervened and said: "Come on, come on, call me Aunt Sally, I'm used to it and there's no need to change things"—, that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to accept it, because I couldn't do anything else, and I knew Tom wouldn't mind, on the contrary, he would love it because it was a mystery and he would turn it all into an adventure and be very happy.</t6210> <t6211>That's how things turned out, and he pretended to be Sid and made everything as easy as he could for me.</t6211>
<t6212>His Aunt Polly said that Tom was right in what he had said about old Miss Watson having declared Jim free in her will, so, of course, Tom Sawyer had gotten into all that mess and all that adventure to free a black man who was already free, and that’s why I couldn’t understand until that moment and that conversation how Tom could help someone to set a black man free with the way he had been brought up.</t6212>
<t6213>Well, Aunt Polly said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and Sid had arrived safe and sound, she had said to herself: "Well, well!"</t6213> <t6214>It was to be expected, for having let him go alone without anyone to watch over him.</t6214> <t6215>So now I have to go all the way down the river, eleven hundred miles, and find out what the boy is up to this time, because there was no way you could answer me."</t6215>
<t6216>—But we didn't get any news from you here —says Aunt Sally.</t6216>
<t6217>—Wow, how strange!</t6217> <t6218>But I wrote to you twice to ask what you meant by saying that Sid had arrived.</t6218>
<t6219>—Well, sister, but they never arrived for me.</t6219>
<t6220>Aunt Polly turned around very slowly and sternly, and then said:</t6220>
<t6221>—You, Tom!</t6221>
<t6222>—Well... what? —he replies, sounding angry.</t6222>
<t6223>—Don't come asking me what, insolent; give me those letters.</t6223>
<t6224>—What letters?</t6224>
<t6225>—Those letters.</t6225> <t6226>I assure you that if I have to lay a hand on you, I'm going to...</t6226>
<t6227>—They are in the trunk.</t6227> <t6228>That's already been said.</t6228> <t6229>And they are just as they were when they were given to me at the post office.</t6229> <t6230>I haven't seen them.</t6230> <t6231>I haven't touched them.</t6231> <t6232>But I knew they were going to cause problems and I thought they weren't urgent for you and that...</t6232>
<t6233>—Well, you deserve a beating, there's no doubt about that.</t6233> <t6234>I wrote you another one to tell you that I was going to come, and I suppose that...</t6234> <t6235>—No, it arrived yesterday; I haven't read it yet, but it arrived fine, I have that one.</t6235>
<t6236>I would have bet two dollars that it wasn't, but I figured it might be safer not to bet.</t6236> <t6237>So I didn't say anything.</t6237>
<t6238>Last Chapter</t6238>
<t6239>THE FIRST TIME I could see Tom alone, I asked him what he had thought about during the escape, what he planned to do if the escape went well and he managed to free the black man who was already free before.</t6239> <t6240>He replied that what he had planned from the beginning, if we managed to get Jim out and keep him safe, was to continue with him down the river on the raft and have lots of adventures there, and then tell him he was free and take him back home on a fine steamboat, and pay him for all the time he had lost and write ahead so that all the black people would come to greet him and take him dancing into town with a torchlight procession and a band.</t6240> <t6241>Then he would be a hero and so would we.</t6241> <t6242>But I figured things were fine just the way they were.</t6242>
<t6243>We didn't take long to remove Jim's chains, and when Aunt Polly, Uncle Silas, and Aunt Sally found out how well he had helped the doctor take care of Tom, they showered him with praise, pampered him a lot, and gave him all the food he wanted so he could enjoy himself and not have to do anything.</t6243> <t6244>We took him up to the sickroom, where we chatted for a long time, and Tom gave Jim forty dollars for having been so patient as a prisoner with us and for having done everything so well, and Jim almost died of happiness and started shouting:</t6244>
<t6245>—Well, Huck, what was I telling you?</t6245> <t6246>What I told you on Jackson Island?</t6246> <t6247>I told you that I have a lot of hair on my chest and that it's a good sign, and I told you that I was rich once and that I was going to be rich again, and now it has come true, look at it!</t6247> <t6248>Do you get it?</t6248> <t6249>Don't tell me you don't: signs are signs and don't forget it; I knew I was going to be rich again, as sure as the sun rises in the East!</t6249>
<t6250>Then Tom started talking and talking and said that one of these nights the three of us could escape and form a band in search of amazing adventures among the Indians, in their territory, for two or three weeks.</t6250> <t6251>I said that was fine, that it suited me perfectly, but I didn't have money to buy clothes and I figured they wouldn't send it from home, because father had probably already returned and Judge Thatcher would have given him everything and he would have drunk it all.</t6251>
<t6252>—No, nothing like that —and then Tom says—; it's all still there: six thousand dollars and more; your father never came back.</t6252> <t6253>At least not until I came here.</t6253>
<t6254>Jim said, very solemnly:</t6254>
<t6255>—He is not coming back anymore, Huck.</t6255>
<t6256>And I go and say:</t6256>
<t6257>—Why, Jim?</t6257>
<t6258>—It doesn't matter why, Huck, but he won't be coming back anymore.</t6258>
<t6259>But I insisted, so in the end he goes and says:</t6259>
<t6260>—Don't you remember that house that was floating down the river and there was a man inside, all covered up, and I went in and uncovered him and didn't let you go in?</t6260> <t6261>Well, now you can ask for your money whenever you want, because it was him.</t6261> <t6262>Tom is almost well now and he wears the bullet hanging around his neck in a watch case, and he always checks what time it is, so there's nothing more to write about.</t6262> <t6263>I'm really glad, because if I had known how hard it was to write a book, I wouldn't have started it, and I don't plan to do it again.</t6263> <t6264>But I reckon I have to head to the territory before anyone else, because Aunt Sally is going to adopt me and civilize me, and I can't stand it.</t6264> <t6265>I know what it's like to go through that.</t6265>
