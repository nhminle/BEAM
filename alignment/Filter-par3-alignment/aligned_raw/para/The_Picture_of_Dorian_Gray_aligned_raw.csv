1,"The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.","The studio was filled with the fragrance of roses, and when the gentle summer breeze stirred among the trees in the garden, the scent of lilacs wafted through the open door, mingling with the more delicate aroma of blooming wild peach blossoms.",33.992,32.355,"The studio was filled with the languid scent of roses; when a light summer breeze wandered among the trees in the garden, the heavy fragrance of lilacs or the more delicate perfume of pink-flowered thorn trees wafted in through the open door.",33.699,32.053,"The intense perfume of the roses embalmed the studio, and when the light breeze stirred the trees in the garden, an intense scent of lilacs or the more delicate aroma of the pink flowers of the hawthorns entered through the open door.",28.5,26.369
2,"From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.","From the corner of the Persian camel saddlebag-patterned divan on which he habitually lay smoking countless cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could only faintly see the honey-sweet and honey-colored blossoms of a laburnum tree whose trembling branches seemed to struggle under the weight of such a blazing beauty; and occasionally, the strange shadows of birds in flight would flicker across the long tussore silk curtains drawn before the wide window, evoking a sensation somewhat akin to a fleeting Japanese impression, and making him think of the green-faced, yellow-fanged artists in Tokyo, who, through the medium of an inherently static art, had attempted to convey a sense of swiftness and movement. The mournful hum of bees threading through the long, uncut grass, or circling with monotonous persistence around the golden-tipped horns of the overgrown honeysuckle, seemed to make the stillness even more oppressive. The distant roar of London was like the pedal note of a far-off organ.",30.106,29.675,"Lord Henry Wotton, who was lying in the corner of the divan adorned with Iranian saddlebags, smoking countless cigarettes as was his habit, could make out the honey-colored, honey-sweet flowers of the yellow wisteria tree from where he was. The tree's trembling branches seemed to struggle under the burden of such flame-like beauty. Occasionally, the shadows of birds, like dreams, would fall upon the long, silken curtains stretched in front of the large window. At first glance, these curtains, which evoked a Japanese atmosphere, reminded Lord Henry of the pale, emerald-faced painters of Tokyo; painters who tried to convey movement and speed through the necessarily static medium of art. The dull hum of bees, either trying to make their way through the tall, uncut grass or circling monotonously around the dusty, gilded horns of the sprawling French marigolds, seemed to make the tranquility of the surroundings all the more tedious. The faint hum of London resembled the bass notes of a distant organ melody.",16.587,15.877,"Lord Henry Wotton, who had already consumed, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, glimpsed, from the end of the sofa where he was lying —upholstered in the style of Persian carpets—, the glow of the blossoms of a broom, sweet and honey-colored, whose trembling branches barely seemed capable of bearing the weight of such dazzling beauty as theirs; and, from time to time, the fantastic shadows of birds in flight slid over the long Indian silk curtains hanging in front of the immense windows, producing something like a Japanese effect, which made him think of the painters of Tokyo, with faces as pale as jade, who, through a necessarily motionless art, try to convey the sensation of speed and movement. The obstinate buzzing of bees, making their way through the tall unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence around the dusty golden horns of the disordered honeysuckles, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive, while the confused noises of London were like the deep notes of a distant organ.",29.449,29.004
3,"In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.","In the middle of the room, clamped tightly onto an upright easel, was a full-length portrait of a young man with extraordinary personal beauty, and sitting in front of it, a little further away, was the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance a few years ago had caused, at that time, an overwhelming public sensation and generated a myriad of strange speculations.",43.043,42.171,"In the very center of the room, on a standing canvas, stood a portrait of an extraordinarily beautiful young man. In front of it, a little further away, sat the painter of the portrait: Basil Hallward, who had caused quite a stir a few years ago by suddenly disappearing and giving rise to a host of strange speculations.",16.505,14.727,"In the center of the room, on a straight easel, rested the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary beauty; and, in front, at a certain distance, sat the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance a few years ago so moved society and gave rise to such strange suppositions.",36.521,35.623
4,"As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.","As the artist gazed at the elegant and beautiful figure that he had skillfully captured with his art, a contented smile briefly crossed his face and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly stood up and, closing his eyes, placed his fingers on his eyelids, as if trying to imprison in his mind a strange dream from which he feared he might awaken.",37.65,36.745,"As he gazed at the elegant and handsome figure reflected in the artist's work, a smile of pleasure spread across his face, and it seemed as if he wanted to linger there for a while. However, he suddenly started and straightened up, closing his eyes and pressing his fingertips against his eyelids as if trying to trap a strange dream in his mind that he feared losing upon waking.",19.148,17.58,"Upon contemplating the handsome and elegant figure that he had so skillfully depicted thanks to his art, a smile of satisfaction, which perhaps could have lasted longer, illuminated his face. But the artist abruptly stood up and, closing his eyes, covered his eyelids with his fingers, as if trying to capture in his mind some strange dream from which he feared to awaken.",21.804,20.445
5,"“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,” said Lord Henry languidly. “You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor is really the only place.”","""That is your most beautiful work, Basil, the most beautiful thing you have ever created,"" Lord Henry said languidly. ""Next year you must certainly send it to the Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar.

The Grosvenor is really the only place.""",41.09,40.439,"Lord Henry said in a lazy voice, ""This is your best work, Basil, the finest thing you have done."" ""You must send it to the Grosvenor Gallery next year, without a doubt. The Academy is too large, too vulgar. Whenever I went there, I either couldn't see the paintings because of the crowd, which is a terrible thing, or I couldn't see the people because of the multitude of paintings, which is even worse. Believe me, the only option is the Grosvenor Gallery.""",24.546,23.608,"—It is your best work, Basil —said Lord Henry with a languid tone—, the best you have done. Be sure to send it to the Grosvenor Gallery next year. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Every time I go there, either there are so many people that I can't see the paintings, which is horrible, or there are so many paintings that I can't see the people, which is even worse. The Grosvenor Gallery is the right place.",32.412,31.611
6,"“I don’t think I shall send it anywhere,” he answered, tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford. “No, I won’t send it anywhere.”","“I don't think I'll send it anywhere,” he replied, tossing his head back in that peculiar way that often made his friends laugh at him in Oxford. “No: I won't send it anywhere.”",47.339,46.008,"The painter replied, ""I don't think I'll send this anywhere,"" throwing his head back with that strange motion that had always amused his friends when he was in Oxford. ""No, I won't send it anywhere.""",15.146,11.75,"—I don't think I'll send it anywhere —replied the artist, throwing his head back in that curious way that always made his friends from Oxford laugh—. No; I won't send the portrait anywhere.",17.84,15.167
7,"Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. “Not send it anywhere? My dear fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion.”","Lord Henry raised an eyebrow and looked at him in astonishment through the thin blue smoke curling into surreal spirals from his opium-laden cigarette. “Not sending it anywhere? My friend, why? Do you have any reason? You artists are truly peculiar creatures! You do everything in the world to gain fame. Yet the moment you have it, it seems you want to throw it away. That is your folly, for there is only one thing in this world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. A portrait like this would place you above all the young men in England, and make the old ones seethe with envy, if those old men are still capable of feeling any emotion.”",45.23,44.85,"Lord Henry raised his eyebrows; he looked at his friend in astonishment through the thin, blue rings of smoke spiraling up from the thick, opium-laced cigarette he was smoking. “Aren't you going to send it anywhere? My dear friend, why? Do you have a reason? You painters are such strange people! You do everything to gain fame. And as soon as you gain it, you want to squander it! What you're doing is nonsense, because if there's anything worse in this world than being talked about, it's not being talked about. Such a portrait would place you higher than all the young painters in England and make the old ones die of envy; though I don't know if the old ones have any feelings left.”",20.683,19.874,"Lord Henry raised his eyebrows and looked at him with astonishment through the thin curls of smoke that, emerging from his opium-laced cigarette, twisted into strange shapes. —Aren't you going to send it anywhere? Why, my dear friend? What reason could you give? Why are you painters such strange people? You do anything to earn a reputation, but as soon as you have it, it seems you don't want it anymore. It's foolish, because in the world there's only one thing worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. A portrait like that would place you far above all the young English painters and would arouse the jealousy of the old ones, if the old ones are still capable of emotions.",31.304,30.762

11,"“Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you were so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you—well, of course you have an intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don’t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence.

A perfect Adonis, dear Basil, while you... Yes, you do have an intellectual expression, and so on, but beauty, true beauty, ends where the intellectual expression begins. The mind is a kind of exaggeration in itself, it disrupts the harmony of the face it enters. The moment a person starts to think, they become all nose, all forehead, or something equally dreadful. Just look at the men who have succeeded in intellectual professions. How utterly ugly they are from head to toe! Only the church is an exception to this, naturally.

I am telling you the truth. There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one’s fellows. The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all should live—undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.

There is a destiny for all physical and intellectual excellence, a kind of destiny that seems to follow the faltering steps of kings throughout history. It is better not to be different from your friends. Ugliness and ignorance are always the most advantageous in this world. They can sit comfortably and yawn at the game. If they know nothing of victory, at least they do not have to know defeat. They live as we all should live, peacefully, indifferently, without worry. They do not bring trouble to others nor receive it from anyone else.

It is better not to be different from our other human brothers. I think the luckiest ones in this world are the ugly and the foolish. They can lie back and watch the game called life with their mouths open. Even if they don't know what victory is, at least they don't taste defeat either. They actually live as we all should live, carefree, indifferent, and without turmoil. They do not cause the ruin of others, nor do they become victims at the hands of others.

What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from him, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much more to me than a model or a sitter.

I see things differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before. ‘A dream of form in days of thought’—who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad—for he seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty—his merely visible presence—ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means? Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and body—how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void. Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but which I would not part with?

Who said that? I can't remember, but that's what Dorian Gray is to me. The mere visible presence of this boy... Actually, he's over twenty, but I always see him as a child... Yes, even his mere visible presence... Oh, I don't know if you can grasp the full meaning of all this? Without even knowing it, this boy seems to define the lines of a completely new art school: a school that will combine all the fire of the romantic school with all the perfection of the ancient Greek school. The harmony of body and soul... How important this is! We, in our stupidity, have separated them, invented a crude realism, an empty idealism. Oh, Harry, if only you could understand what Dorian Gray symbolizes to me! You know that landscape of mine, Agnew offered a fortune for it, but I didn't let it go. It's one of my best works. And why, do you think? Because while I was painting it, Dorian Gray was sitting beside me.

The second, the one that witnesses the emergence of a new personality, also for art. What the invention of oil painting was for the Venetians, or the face of Antinous for the last Greek sculptors, the face of Dorian Gray will be for me someday. It's not just that I use him as a model to paint, to draw, to make sketches. I've done all that, of course. But for me, he is much more than a model or a subject.

The thoroughly well-informed man—that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a bric-à-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing, or you won’t like his tone of colour, or something. You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will alter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic.”","“Summer days, Basil, tend to linger,” Lord Henry murmured. “You might grow bored with him sooner than he with you. It is sad to think about, but Talent undoubtedly lasts longer than Beauty. That explains why we all put so much effort into refining ourselves over and over. In the mad struggle for survival, we want something enduring, so we fill our memories with rubbish and facts, with the naive hope of maintaining our place. The know-it-all — that is the ideal of our time. And the intellect of the know-it-all is a terrible thing. It is like a curiosity shop, full of monsters and dust, with everything priced higher than its true worth. I think you will grow bored first, no matter what. One day you will look at your friend, and you will see that he seems slightly misdrawn, or you will dislike his tone, or something. You will bitterly resent him in your heart, and seriously think that he has treated you very badly. The next time he visits, you will be cold and indifferent as if nothing happened. That will be a great pity, for it will change you. What you have told me is indeed a romantic story, a romantic story about art as one might call it, and the worst thing about having any kind of romantic story is that it makes one become exceedingly ordinary.”",36.528,36.262,"Lord Henry murmured, “Summer days are long, Basil.”“Perhaps you will tire of it before it does. A sad thought, yes, but genius undoubtedly lasts longer than beauty. That is why we all go to such lengths to educate ourselves excessively. In this mad, fierce struggle for life, we all want to possess something durable, so we fill our heads with trivia, with facts, to maintain our place in the struggle. The man with complete knowledge: This is the contemporary ideal. Yet the mind of a man with complete knowledge is a terrifying thing. Like a shop selling second-hand crockery, full of dust and misshapen objects, monsters. Everything is priced above its real value. Yes, it seems to me that you will be the first to grow weary. One day you will look at your friend, and his features will seem somewhat out of proportion to you, or you will not like the tone of his color, or something like that. Inwardly, you will bitterly reproach him, thinking he has treated you very badly. When he comes to your door again, you will behave entirely coldly and indifferently towards him. It will be a great pity, really, because it will change you. The story you told me is a thoroughly romantic one, a romance of art, we might say. The worst part of living such a romantic story is that when it ends, it completely alienates a person from romanticism.”",20.279,19.868,"—In summer, the days are usually long, Basil —murmured Lord Henry—. Perhaps you will tire before he does. It's sad to think about, but undoubtedly genius lasts longer than beauty. That explains why we strive so hard to cultivate ourselves. In the fierce struggle for existence, we want to have something that lasts, and we fill our heads with trash and data, with the foolish hope of maintaining our position. The person who knows everything: that is the modern ideal. And the mind of that person who knows everything is a terrible thing, a junk shop, all monsters and dust, and always with prices above their true value. I think you will tire first, anyway. Someday you will look at your friend, and he will seem a bit blurred, or you won't like the tone of his complexion, or something else. You will reproach him bitterly, and you will think, very seriously, that he has treated you badly. The next time he visits you, you will show yourself perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a shame, because it will change you. What you have told me is a love story, it should be called an aesthetic love story, and the worst thing about any love story is that afterward one feels very little romantic.",32.956,32.693

There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other people’s emotions were!—much more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to him. One’s own soul, and the passions of one’s friends—those were the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt’s, he would have been sure to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives. The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped all that!

Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love; it is the faithless who know the tragedies of love.” And Lord Henry lit a cigarette from a dainty silver box, then began to smoke with a cautious and satisfied air, as if he had just summarized the entire world in a single sentence. Somewhere, there was the rustling sound of sparrows chirping among the glossy green ivy leaves, while blue shadows flitted across the lawn like swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how interesting other people's emotions were! — much more pleasant than their ideas, — it seemed to him. The soul of a man, and the passions of his friends — those were the fascinating things in life.

There was the rustling of sparrows chirping among the polished leaves of the ivy, and blue cloud shadows were flying over the grass like swallows. How beautiful it was to be in this garden! How delightful were the feelings of others! Lord Henry found people's feelings much more delightful than their thoughts. One's own soul and the feelings of friends: these were the matters that enveloped a person in life. Lord Henry thought with a secret smile about the tedious dinner invitation he had avoided by lingering so long beside Basil Hallward. If he had gone to his aunt's invitation, he would have undoubtedly encountered Lord Goodbody, and the entire conversation would have been about the necessity of feeding the poor and building model housing. Every class would be prattling about the importance of virtues that were not a necessity for their own lives.

220,"At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him. His father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young and Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches, and his inordinate passion for pleasure. The son, who had been his father’s secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing. He had two large town houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and took most of his meals at his club. He paid some attention to the management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth. In politics he was a Tory, except when the Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them for being a pack of Radicals. He was a hero to his valet, who bullied him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn. Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the country was going to the dogs. His principles were out of date, but there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices.","At half-past twelve the next day, Lord Henry Wotton leisurely walked from Curzon Street through Albany to visit his uncle, Lord Fermor, a cheerful old bachelor despite his somewhat rude manners. The outside world considered him selfish because they couldn't gain any exceptional benefits from him, but the upper class viewed him as very generous because he supported those who entertained him. His father had been our ambassador in Madrid when Isabella was young, and Prim was not yet thought of, but he had left the diplomatic service in a fit of pique over not being invited to be the ambassador in Paris, a position he believed he was entirely entitled to because of his lineage, his laziness, his perfect English in his dispatches, and his excessive passion for pleasure. The son, who had been his father's secretary, also resigned along with his boss, a move that was considered somewhat foolish at the time, and when he inherited the title a few months later, he devoted himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing. He had two large houses in town but preferred to live in a furnished bachelor apartment to avoid inconvenience and mostly dined at his club. He also paid some attention to managing his coal mines in the Midlands, justifying this industrial stain on the grounds that one advantage of having coal was that it allowed a gentleman to afford to burn wood in his fireplace. In politics, he was a Conservative, except when the Conservatives were in power, during which time he openly insulted them for turning into Radicals. He was a hero to his valet, who bullied him, and a terror to most of his relatives, whom he bullied in turn. Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the country was going to the dogs. His principles were outdated, but there was much to be said in favor of his prejudices.",43.844,43.684,"The next day at half-past twelve, Lord Henry Wotton left Curzon Street and headed towards the Albany Hotel to visit his uncle, Lord Fermor. The world, which could not derive any benefit from Lord Fermor, who was a cheerful, talkative, and friendly old man despite some of his blunt behaviors, accused him of selfishness. However, society considered him generous because Lord Fermor would feed those who entertained him. His father had been the Ambassador to Madrid during Isabella's youth, long before Prim was even thought of, but he had quit the diplomatic profession in a fit of anger when he was not made Ambassador to Paris. Lord Fermor believed he fully deserved this position due to his lineage, mischief, the reports he prepared, his eloquence, and his excessive love of pleasure and luxury. His son, who was acting as his secretary, had also submitted his resignation along with him. It was thought that he had been a bit foolish at the time. A few months later, the new Lord Fermor, who inherited his father's title, dedicated himself to seriously studying that magnificent art of aristocracy, namely the art of doing absolutely nothing. He had two huge houses in the city, but preferred to stay in a hotel suite because it was less troublesome, and usually had his meals there as well. He took a slight interest in managing the coal mines he owned around the Midlands, and to excuse the stain on his honor for making this effort, he would say, ""There is only one benefit of coal: it provides the upper class with the privilege of burning wood in their own fireplaces!"" Politically, he was a Tory, except when the Tories were in power. During such times, Lord Fermor would denounce them as a ""pack of Radicals"" and condemn them vehemently. In the eyes of his personal valet, who managed him with an overbearing authority, Lord Fermor was a hero, while to his relatives, whom he managed with the same overbearing authority, he was a tyrant. Only England could have produced him, and he was always saying that the country was going to the dogs. His principles might have been somewhat outdated, but there was no denying his prejudices.",21.024,20.786,"At half past twelve the next day, Lord Henry Wotton walked from Curzon Street to Albany to visit his uncle, Lord Fermor, an old bachelor, cordial but somewhat brusque, who was generally considered selfish because the world gained no benefit from him, but whom good society deemed generous because he fed people who amused him. His father had been an ambassador in Madrid when Isabel II was young and no one had yet thought of General Prim, but he capriciously abandoned his diplomatic career out of spite when he saw that he was not offered the embassy in Paris, a position he believed he had full right to due to his birth, his indolence, the excellent English of his dispatches, and his excessive passion for pleasures. The son, who had been his father's secretary and who also resigned, a gesture that was considered somewhat reckless at the time, succeeded his father in the title a few months later, and dedicated himself seriously to cultivating the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing. Although he owned two large houses in London, he preferred to live in rented rooms, which caused him fewer inconveniences, and he took most of his meals at his club. He was somewhat concerned with the management of his coal mines in the Midlands, and excused that contact with industry by claiming that owning coal mines granted a gentleman the privilege of burning wood in his own fireplace. In politics, he was a conservative, except when the conservatives were in power, at which time he systematically insulted them, accusing them of being a bunch of radicals. He was a hero to his valet, who tyrannized him, and a terrifying figure to most of his relatives, whom he, in turn, tyrannized. He was a person who could only have been born in England, and he always claimed that the country was going to ruin. His principles were outdated, but much could be said in favor of his prejudices.",32.063,31.844

252,"So that was the story of Dorian Gray’s parentage. Crudely as it had been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a strange, almost modern romance. A beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony, and then a child born in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man. Yes; it was an interesting background. It posed the lad, made him more perfect, as it were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic. Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might blow.... And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face. Talking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin. He answered to every touch and thrill of the bow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence. No other activity was like it. To project one’s soul into some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one’s own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth; to convey one’s temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in that—perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and grossly common in its aims.... He was a marvellous type, too, this lad, whom by so curious a chance he had met in Basil’s studio, or could be fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate. Grace was his, and the white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for us. There was nothing that one could not do with him. He could be made a Titan or a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade! ... And Basil? From a psychological point of view, how interesting he was! The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself, Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her there had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose shadow they made real: how strange it all was! He remembered something like it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had first analyzed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own century it was strange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait. He would seek to dominate him—had already, indeed, half done so. He would make that wonderful spirit his own. There was something fascinating in this son of love and death.","So that is the story of Dorian Gray's lineage. As blunt as it was told to him, it stirred his heart with the suggestion of a strange, almost modern romance. A beautiful woman had risked everything for her mad passion. A few weeks of wild happiness cut short by a hideous, deceitful crime. Months of silent suffering, then a child born in pain. The mother kidnapped by death, the boy left in loneliness and the cruelty of a heartless old man. Yes; it was an interesting background. It elevated the young man, made him seem more perfect. Behind everything beautiful that has ever existed, there must be something tragic. The world must endure the pain of childbirth, so that even the most ordinary flower can bloom… And how enchanting he was at dinner the night before, when, with frightened eyes and lips parted in dreadful joy, he sat opposite him in the club, the red lampshade casting a deeper crimson on his awakened astonishment. Talking to him was like playing on a finely tuned violin. He responded to every touch and vibration of the bow… There was something irresistibly fascinating about exerting influence. No other activity was quite like it. To project one's soul into a graceful form, and let it linger there for a while; to hear one's own intellectual views echoed back with all the added music of passion and youth; to transmit one's temperament through another as if it were some magical fluid or strange perfume; there was a very real pleasure in it — perhaps the most satisfying pleasure left to us in an age as limited and coarse as ours, an age utterly mundane in its pleasures, utterly mediocre in its aims… He, the young man whom by a strange chance he had met in Basil's studio, was also an extraordinary model; or could be made into an extraordinary model, in any case. Grace was his, along with the pure innocence of youth, and beauty like that which the ancient Greek marble statues have preserved for us. There was nothing that could not be done with him. He could be crafted into a giant or a toy. How tragic it was that such beauty should be destined to fade!... And Basil? How interesting he was from a psychological perspective! A fresh artistic style, a new outlook on life, strangely inspired merely by the visible presence of someone completely unaware of it; a quiet soul still dwelling in the dim forest, still walking invisibly in the open field, suddenly revealing itself, like a fearless forest goddess, because in his soul, the one who sought her there, had awakened the extraordinary imagination that before only it could reveal the extraordinary; the mere form and pattern of those things had, so to speak, become essential, and achieved a kind of symbolic value, even though they were models of a different and more perfect form whose shadow they had made real: how strange all this was! He recalled something similar in history. Was it Plato, that artist of thought, who first analyzed it? Was it Buonarotti, who carved it into the colored marble of a sonnet sequence? But in our century, it was truly strange… Yes; he would try to become, to Dorian Gray, what that young man, unknowingly, had become to the artist who created that marvelous portrait. He would seek to dominate him — in fact, he had almost done so already. He would make that extraordinary soul his own. There was something truly enchanting about this child of Love and Death.",34.612,34.502,"So, this was the story of Dorian Gray's parents. Despite being told in broad strokes, this story had excited him by evoking a strange, contemporary romanticism. A beautiful woman who sacrificed everything for a mad passion. A few weeks of wild happiness ending in a vile, treacherous murder. Months of silent suffering, then a child born in pain. The mother being taken by death, the child left alone in the hands of an old, loveless man. Yes, an interesting background. It formed a backdrop for Dorian, making him seem even more perfect. Behind every perfect thing, there was hidden pain. It was as if the world had to suffer for the most ordinary flower to bloom... The boy had sat across from Lord Henry at the dinner they had at the club the previous night, with startled eyes and lips parted with timid pleasure, as the red shades of the candelabras painted the slowly awakening consciousness on his face a deeper rose color, how sweet he had been. Talking to him was like playing a fine violin. The boy responded to every touch, every pull of the bow... There was something immensely enveloping about wielding one's influence in this way. No other occupation could compare to this. To transfer one's own soul into a separate, beautiful form and hold it there for a while, to have one's thoughts echoed, to add the music of youth and excitement to it, and to transmit one's own temperament and attitude, like a slippery liquid, a mysterious scent, to another. There was a true joy in this...Perhaps in an era as limited and crude as ours, with pleasures roughly sensual and goals roughly vulgar, this was the most fulfilling joy left to us... Then, by a strange coincidence, this boy he had met in Basil's studio had a wonderful personality; or at least his personality could be shaped into a wonderful form. He had elegance, the pure clarity of youth, and the beauty that ancient Greek marbles had preserved for us. There was no shape that could not be given to this boy. He could be made into a titan or a toy. But how sad it was that such beauty was destined to fade away...And Basil? How interesting he was from a psychological standpoint! A new art method, a completely different perspective on life... The mere visible presence of the young man had evoked these in the painter, while the young man was completely unaware of them. That silent, feminine spirit living in dim groves, wandering unseen in the open fields, suddenly revealed itself, fearless, like the forest goddesses. A marvelous eye had opened in the painter's own soul, and marvelous things could only be seen by this eye. Thus, the simplest lines and forms of objects had become refined and exalted, gaining a symbolic value, as if they were examples of a completely different and more perfect form, and these forms made their shadows real. How strange all this was! Lord Henry seemed to recall something similar in history. Was it not Plato, that painter of thoughts, who first examined this? Was it not Buonarroti who first carved this into the colorful marbles of a sonnet? Yet in our current age, such a thing was startling. Yes, just as Dorian Gray had unknowingly symbolized something to the painter who drew that wonderful portrait, Lord Henry would try to make Dorian Gray symbolize it to him. He would try to dominate him, and he was already halfway there, even now. He would claim that beautiful soul for himself. There was an enchanting allure in this child of love and death.",23.131,22.985,"That was, therefore, the family history of Dorian Gray. Despite the schematic nature of the story, it had impressed him because it made one think of a strange, almost modern love story. A beautiful woman who risks everything for a mad passion. A few weeks of boundless happiness cut short by a heinous crime, by a betrayal. Months of silent suffering, and then a child born in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the child abandoned to loneliness and the tyranny of a heartless old man. Yes; some interesting antecedents, which placed the boy, which added a new perfection to him, so to speak. Behind all exquisite things, there is something tragic. For the humblest of flowers to bloom, the effort of worlds is needed...And, how charming he had been during dinner the night before, when, with surprise in his eyes and lips parted in pleasure and fear, he had sat across from him at the club, the red screens of the lamps enhancing the blush awakened in his face by astonishment! Talking to him was like playing the most delicate of violins. Dorian responded to every touch and vibration of the bow...There was something terribly captivating about influencing someone. There was no other activity like it. Projecting the soul onto a pleasing form, pausing for a moment; emitting one's own ideas to be echoed back, accompanied by the music of youthful passion; transmitting one's own sensitivity to another as if it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume; there lay the source of true joy, perhaps the most satisfying that such a mean and vulgar age as ours still allows, an age crudely carnal in its pleasures and enormously vulgar in its goals...That boy whom he had met by a strange chance in Basil's studio also embodied a wonderful model or, at least, could be turned into a wonderful being. His was the charm, and the immaculate purity of adolescence, along with a beauty that only ancient Greek marbles preserve for us. There was nothing that could not be done with him. He could be turned into a titan or a toy. What a pity that such beauty was destined to wither!... And Basil? From a psychological point of view, how interesting he was! A new artistic style, a new way of seeing life, all suggested so strangely by the mere presence of someone who was all that unconsciously; the silent spirit that dwells in shadowy forests and walks unseen through open fields, suddenly revealing itself like a dryad, and without fear, because in the soul that seeks it, that singular capacity has already awakened, to which the revelation of wonderful things corresponds; the simple forms, the simple contours of things that were stylized, so to speak, acquiring something akin to symbolic value, as if they were in turn the sketch of another more perfect form, whose shadow endowed them with reality: how strange it all was! He remembered something similar in the history of thought. Was it not Plato, that artist of ideas, who had analyzed it for the first time? Was it not Buonarotti who sculpted it in the multicolored marble of a succession of sonnets? But in our century it was strange...Yes; he would try to be for Dorian Gray what he, unknowingly, had been for the author of that wonderful portrait.

I don't know what I was expecting, but I went out into the street and headed east, soon losing myself in a labyrinth of grimy streets and dark, grassless squares. Around eight-thirty, I passed by a ridiculous little theater, with bright lights and garish posters. At the entrance, there was a horrid Jew, with the most exotic waistcoat I have ever seen in my life, smoking a foul-smelling cigar. His hair fell in greasy curls, and in the middle of a dirty shirt, a huge diamond sparkled. ""A box, milord?"" he said when he saw me, and he took off his hat with a fascinatingly servile air. There was something about him that amused me, Harry. He was so monstrous! You're going to laugh at me, I know, but I went in and paid no less than a guinea for a box next to the stage. To this day, I still don't know why I did it; but if I hadn't, my dear Harry, I would have missed the great love story of my life. I see you're laughing. How bad that seems to me!",38.466,38.307

Still, I felt interested, in a sort of way. At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act. There was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the drop-scene was drawn up and the play began. Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman, with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad. He was played by the low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most friendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But Juliet! Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were like the petals of a rose. She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen in my life. You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. I tell you, Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me. And her voice—I never heard such a voice. It was very low at first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one’s ear. Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a distant hautboy. In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing. There were moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins. You know how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane are two things that I shall never forget. When I close my eyes, I hear them, and each of them says something different. I don’t know which to follow. Why should I not love her? Harry, I do love her. She is everything to me in life. Night after night I go to see her play. One evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen. I have seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from her lover’s lips. I have watched her wandering through the forest of Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap. She has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of. She has been innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike throat. I have seen her in every age and in every costume. Ordinary women never appeal to one’s imagination.

I must confess that I was quite annoyed with the idea of watching Shakespeare performed in such a shabby, miserable nook. However, I still found it somewhat interesting. Anyway, I decided to wait for the first act. There was a dreadful band, kept in tune by a young Hebrew man sitting by a broken piano, which almost drove me away, but finally the curtain rose, and the play began. Romeo was a fat old man, with eyebrows blackened with burnt cork, a hoarse tragic voice, and a body like a beer barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad. He was played by a low comedian, who inserted his own jokes and had a very friendly relationship with the second-class audience. Both of them were as ridiculous as the scenery, which looked as if it had appeared in a country fair theater. But Juliet! Harry, imagine a girl, just seventeen years old, with a small face as fresh as a flower, a Greek-style head, with dark brown braided hair, eyes like wells of passionate violet, lips like rose petals. She is the most lovely creature I have ever seen in my life. You once told me that pathos does not move you, but that beauty, only beauty, could bring tears to your eyes. I tell you, Harry, I could hardly see this girl because of the veil of tears that came across me. And her voice — I have never heard a voice like that.

Believe me, Harry, I could barely see the girl properly because of the tears in my eyes. And her voice! I had never heard such a voice in my life! At first, it came out very slowly, like deep, soft notes dropping one by one into your ear. Then, as it rose a bit more, it resembled a flute or the sound of an oboe heard from afar. In the garden scene, this voice reflected that trembling excitement heard when nightingales sing before dawn. Later, at times, it resonated with the wild passion of a violin. You know how voices can affect a person at times. If there are two things I will never forget in my life, they are your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane.

Once, she went mad, stood before a guilty king, and gave him bitter herbs to taste. Once, she was innocent, yet the black hands of jealousy squeezed and crushed her swan-like neck.

419,"As he left the room, Lord Henry’s heavy eyelids drooped, and he began to think. Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as Dorian Gray, and yet the lad’s mad adoration of some one else caused him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He was pleased by it. It made him a more interesting study. He had been always enthralled by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary subject-matter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import. And so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others. Human life—that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating. Compared to it there was nothing else of any value. It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one could not wear over one’s face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken of them. There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to understand their nature. And, yet, what a great reward one received! How wonderful the whole world became to one! To note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life of the intellect—to observe where they met, and where they separated, at what point they were in unison, and at what point they were at discord—there was a delight in that!

He was pleased with this. It made him a more interesting subject for study. He had always been fascinated by the methods of natural science, but the usual subjects of that science seemed to him trivial and unimportant. So he had begun with the vivisection of himself, as he had ended with the vivisection of others. Life — it appeared to him as something to be studied minutely. Nothing else seemed to be of any value in comparison. Indeed, when one looks at life in its strange crucible of pain and pleasure, one cannot wear a mask to shield the face, nor keep the fumes of sulfur from tormenting the brain, and clouding the imagination with monstrous fancies and distorted dreams. There are subtle poisons so exquisite that to know their properties one has to fall ill from them. There are strange maladies so bizarre that one has to go through them to understand their nature. Yet, how great the reward will be! How wonderful the world will become to us! To remember the strange, relentless logic of passion, and the multicolored life of the intellect — to observe where they meet, where they part, at what points they harmonize, at what points they are at odds — there is a pleasure in that!

The fact was that there were very few people who interested him as much as Dorian Gray did. Yet, the young lord felt not the slightest jealousy or annoyance that the boy was madly infatuated with someone else. On the contrary, he found it pleasing. This passion made Dorian Gray more interesting, more worthy of study. Lord Henry had always harbored a deep curiosity about the natural sciences, though he found their ordinary subjects trivial and insignificant. Thus, he began by examining himself under the microscope, eventually turning to dissect and study others. Human life: this was the only thing worth examining in Lord Henry's eyes. Nothing could be as valuable. Indeed, while the observer watched life in the test tube filled with a mixture of pains and joys, he could not wear a glass mask, nor could he prevent the poisonous vapors from affecting his brain, causing his imagination to throb with strange fantasies and shapeless dreams. There were such insidious poisons that one had to be poisoned by them to discern their qualities. Yet, in the end, how magnificent a reward this examination gave to a person! How marvelous the world became in one's eyes! To notice the strange, rigid logic of passion and the experiences of the mind tinged with sentimentality, to observe where these two converged, where they diverged, where they reconciled, and where they clashed... What a great delight was hidden in this! Who cared about the cost? No excitement's price was too high.",9.01,8.352,"When Dorian Gray left the room, Lord Henry closed his eyes and began to think.

But there was no motive power in experience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself.

474,"Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of some stranger. He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace. Sibyl, however, was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing. Her love was trembling in laughter on her lips. She was thinking of Prince Charming, and, that she might think of him all the more, she did not talk of him, but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about the gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers. For he was not to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever he was going to be. Oh, no! A sailor’s existence was dreadful. Fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands! He was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a polite good-bye to the captain, and go off at once to the gold-fields. Before a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure gold, the largest nugget that had ever been discovered, and bring it down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen. The bushrangers were to attack them three times, and be defeated with immense slaughter. Or, no. He was not to go to the gold-fields at all. They were horrid places, where men got intoxicated, and shot each other in bar-rooms, and used bad language. He was to be a nice sheep-farmer, and one evening, as he was riding home, he was to see the beautiful heiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase, and rescue her. Of course, she would fall in love with him, and he with her, and they would get married, and come home, and live in an immense house in London. Yes, there were delightful things in store for him. But he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money foolishly. She was only a year older than he was, but she knew so much more of life. He must be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep. God was very good, and would watch over him. She would pray for him, too, and in a few years he would come back quite rich and happy.","Jim occasionally grimaced when he caught the curious gaze of some stranger.

Within a week, he would find a huge, pure gold nugget, the largest nugget ever found, and he would bring it to the shore in a closed carriage protected by six mounted policemen. The natives would attack them three times and be repelled with great bloodshed. But no, James would not go to the gold mines either.

If he were to marry Messalina, it would not seem less interesting to me. You know perfectly well that I am not a defender of marriage. The real drawback of marriage is that it kills selfishness. And people without selfishness are colorless. They lack individuality. Anyway, there are some temperaments that become more complex with marriage. They retain their selfishness and add many others to it. They are forced to live more than one life. They become highly organized people, and organizing one's life very well, I believe, is the object of human existence. Moreover, every experience has value and, say what you will against marriage, there is no doubt that it is an experience. I hope that Dorian Gray makes that girl his wife, adores her passionately for six months, and then, suddenly, becomes fascinated by someone else. It will be a wonderful subject of study.",44.347,44.113

I can’t describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose-coloured joy. She trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus. Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. I feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can’t help it.

634,"“Dorian, Dorian,” she cried, “before I knew you, acting was the one reality of my life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I thought that it was all true. I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other. The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine also. I believed in everything. The common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike. The painted scenes were my world. I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought them real. You came—oh, my beautiful love!—and you freed my soul from prison. You taught me what reality really is. To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw through the hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had always played. To-night, for the first time, I became conscious that the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to say. You had brought me something higher, something of which all art is but a reflection. You had made me understand what love really is. My love! My love! Prince Charming! Prince of life! I have grown sick of shadows. You are more to me than all art can ever be. What have I to do with the puppets of a play? When I came on to-night, I could not understand how it was that everything had gone from me. I thought that I was going to be wonderful. I found that I could do nothing. Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant. The knowledge was exquisite to me. I heard them hissing, and I smiled. What could they know of love such as ours? Take me away, Dorian—take me away with you, where we can be quite alone. I hate the stage. I might mimic a passion that I do not feel, but I cannot mimic one that burns me like fire. Oh, Dorian, Dorian, you understand now what it signifies? Even if I could do it, it would be profanation for me to play at being in love. You have made me see that.”","“Dorian, Dorian,” she cried, “before I knew you, acting was a reality of my life. Only in the theater did I truly live. I thought it was all true.

Tonight, for the first time, I realized that Romeo is disgusting, old, painted, that the moonlight in the garden is fake, that the scenery is trivial, that the words I had to say were hollow, not my own, not what I wanted to say. You have brought me something greater, something that all art is merely a reflection of. You have made me understand what love truly is. My love! My love! Prince Charming! Prince of life! I am sick of shadows. To me, you are above all the art in the world that has ever existed. What should I do with the puppets in the play? When I went to the theater tonight, I couldn't understand why everything left me. I thought I would perform wonderfully. I found that I couldn't do anything at all. Suddenly my heart realized what all this meant. That realization was wonderful to me. I heard them whistle, and I laughed. What could they know about a love like ours?

Then suddenly, I understood everything. And knowing this thrilled me with joy. I heard their boos, I smiled. What did they know of a love like ours? Take me away, Dorian! Take me to a place where we can be alone. I am disgusted with the stage. I might be able to mimic a passion I have never known, but I cannot mimic a passion that burns me like fire.

645,"As the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent Garden. The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street. The air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain. He followed into the market and watched the men unloading their waggons. A white-smocked carter offered him some cherries. He thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money for them, and began to eat them listlessly. They had been plucked at midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them. A long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red roses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge, jade-green piles of vegetables. Under the portico, with its grey, sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls, waiting for the auction to be over. Others crowded round the swinging doors of the coffee-house in the piazza. The heavy cart-horses slipped and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings. Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks. Iris-necked and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.","When dawn just broke, he found himself near Covent Garden. The darkness had dissipated, and, tinged pink by the pale fire, the sky curved into a perfect pearl. Huge horse-drawn carriages loaded with nodding lilies were clattering slowly down the shiny empty street. The air was fragrant with flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him a soothing balm for his pain. He followed into the market, watching people unload the carriages. A coachman in a white coat offered him some cherries. He thanked him, wondering why he refused to accept even a penny for them, and began to eat them indifferently. They had been picked at midnight, and the cold moonlight had seeped into them. A long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips and yellow with red roses marched in front of him, weaving their way through the massive emerald-green heaps of vegetables. Under the archway, with columns bleached gray by the sun, a group of girls with dirt-smeared bare heads were lingering, waiting for the auction to end. Other crowds gathered around the revolving doors of the coffee shop on the terrace. Heavy pack horses were both slipping and stamping on the rough stones, jingling their harnesses and saddles. Some coachmen were sleeping on piles of sacks. With rainbow necks and pink feet, the pigeons were scurrying around pecking at seeds.",37.98,37.722,"At dawn, he found himself near Covent Garden. The darkness had lifted, and the sky, illuminated by pale glimmers, had gathered into a perfect pearl. Along the bright-stoned, empty street, large carts loaded with lilies were slowly clattering forward. The air seemed to be drowsy with the scent of lilies. The beauty of the flowers felt like a balm to the young boy's suffering. Dorian walked to the marketplace following the carts, watching the men unload their cargo. A carter in a white, ruffled shirt offered him a handful of cherries. Dorian thanked him, reluctantly starting to eat the cherries, not understanding why the man didn't take any money. The cherries had been picked at night, with the frost of the moonlight seeping into them. A line of tall boys carrying crates full of striped tulips and red and yellow roses on their shoulders paraded in front of Dorian, making their way through the high, emerald green heaps of vegetables. Under the archway with sun-bleached gray pillars, a crowd of girls, dressed in ragged clothes and bareheaded, were waiting for the auction to end. Some had piled up in front of the swinging door of the café in the Piazza. There were carters who had fallen asleep on top of the piles of sacks. The hefty cart horses stumbled on the cobblestones, their saddles shaking and bells jingling as they staggered. Pigeons with purple necks and pink feet were running around, pecking at the seeds on the ground.",16.497,16.02,"At the break of dawn, he found himself near Covent Garden. As the veil of darkness lifted, the sky, reddened by faint glows, emptied itself to become a perfect pearl. Large carts, filled with swaying lilies, slowly traveled down the gleaming and empty street. The air filled with the fragrance of flowers, and their beauty seemed to provide him with an analgesic for his pain. He continued walking to the market and watched as the vehicles were unloaded. A carter in a white blouse offered him some cherries. Dorian thanked him and, wondering why the other had refused to accept money in return, began to eat them absentmindedly. They had been picked at midnight and had the coolness of the moon. A long line of boys carrying crates of tulips and yellow and red roses paraded before him, making their way through enormous jade-green heaps of vegetables. Under the grand portico, with its sun-faded gray columns, a flock of ragged girls, bareheaded, waited idly for the auction to end. Others crowded around the swinging doors of the Piazza café. The heavy draft horses slipped and struck the rough cobblestones hard, shaking their harnesses with bells. Some of the drivers slept on piles of sacks. With their metallic necks and pinkish legs, the pigeons ran back and forth pecking at seeds.",30.632,30.276
646,"After a little while, he hailed a hansom and drove home. For a few moments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent square, with its blank, close-shuttered windows and its staring blinds. The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like silver against it. From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke was rising. It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.","A moment later, he called for a two-wheeled carriage and hurried home. For several minutes, he lingered on the doorstep, looking around the quiet square with its bare windows, tightly shut shutters, and exposed curtains. The sky now resembled a pure cat's eye gem, and the rooftops glittered like silver against the sky. From a chimney opposite, a thin wisp of smoke rose. It curled, a purple ribbon, through the pearlescent air.",18.32,16.632,"After a while, Dorian hailed a carriage and went home. He lingered on the threshold for a few minutes, gazing at the closed shutters and vacant-looking windows of the silent square.

The smoke curled through the pearly air like a lilac ribbon.",16.254,14.247,"After some time, Dorian Gray hailed a cab that took him to his house. Once there, he paused for a moment on the threshold, surveying the silent square with its empty windows, shutters, and fixed-gaze blinds. The sky had turned into a pure opal, and the rooftops of the houses shone like silver beneath it. From some chimney on the other side of the square, a thin column of smoke began to rise, soon curling its purple spirals in the pearly air.",15.541,14.013
647,"In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge’s barge, that hung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance, lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire. He turned them out and, having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had decorated for himself and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal. As he was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the portrait Basil Hallward had painted of him. He started back as if in surprise. Then he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled. After he had taken the button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate. Finally, he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it. In the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed. The expression looked different. One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty in the mouth. It was certainly strange.","In the massive gold-plated Venetian lantern, once seized from the flagship of some governor, now hanging from the ceiling of the large oak-paneled hall, the lights still burned from three flickering nozzles: they looked like thin blue petals of fire, edged with white flames. He extinguished them, and, after tossing his hat and cloak onto the table, walked through the library towards the door of his bedroom, a vast octagonal room on the ground floor that, in accordance with his newly developed sense of luxury, he had just redecorated, hanging a few rare Renaissance tapestries that had been discovered stored in an abandoned attic at Selby Royal. As he turned the doorknob, his eyes caught sight of the portrait Basil Hallward had painted of him. He recoiled in surprise. Then he stepped into his room, looking somewhat bewildered. After unbuttoning his coat, he seemed to hesitate. Finally, he turned back, approached the painting, and examined it closely. In the dim light filtered through the cream-colored silk curtains, the face before him had changed a little. The expression looked different. One might say there was something cruel about the mouth. This was very strange.",36.368,36.097,"The house's oak-paneled, spacious entrance hall had a large, gilded Venetian chandelier –a spoil taken from a Doge's ship– whose three lamps were still flickering with trembling flames: They resembled three thin leaves of fire surrounded by white heat. Dorian threw his coat and hat onto the table, extinguished the lamps, and headed to the bedroom through the library. This room on the ground floor, an octagonal, spacious section, was decorated by Dorian according to his own taste, with a newly awakened penchant for ostentation. He had hung Renaissance-style, varied tapestries on the walls, which had been found in an unused attic on Selby Street. Just as he was turning the door handle, his eyes fell on the portrait painted by Basil Hallward. The young man recoiled as if startled. Then, with his eyebrows slightly furrowed, he entered the bedroom. After removing his collar, he seemed to hesitate for a moment. Finally, he turned back again, approached, and examined the portrait. In the dim light barely seeping through the cream-colored silk curtains, the face in the portrait seemed to have changed a bit. The expression looked different. There was a slight cruelty in the set of the mouth. It was truly a strange thing.",17.201,16.679,"In the enormous Venetian lantern —a golden booty from some ducal gondola— that hung from the ceiling of the great oak-paneled hall, the lights of three burners still burned, resembling slender blue petals with a white fire edge. He extinguished them and, after throwing his cloak and hat onto the table, crossed the library towards the door of his bedroom, a spacious octagonal room on the ground floor that, given his recent passion for luxury, he had just had decorated to his taste, hanging curious Renaissance tapestries on the walls that had been found stored in a forgotten attic at Selby Royal. As he turned the door handle, his gaze fell upon the portrait painted by Basil Hallward. The surprise made him stop. Then he entered his room without losing the expression of perplexity. After removing the flower he wore in the buttonhole of his jacket, he seemed to hesitate. Finally, he returned to the library, approached the painting, and examined it closely. Illuminated by the scant light beginning to filter through the cream-colored silk blinds, it seemed to him that the face had changed slightly. The expression seemed different. It appeared that a touch of cruelty had emerged in the mouth. It was, without a doubt, something very strange.",30.461,30.126
648,"He turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind. The bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky corners, where they lay shuddering. But the strange expression that he had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be more intensified even. The quivering ardent sunlight showed him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.","He turned around, and, walking to the window, pulled up the curtain. The radiant dawn flooded into the room, sweeping the grotesque shadows into the dark corners where they lay trembling.

The shimmering, scorching sunlight revealed the merciless wrinkles around the mouth as clearly as if he were looking into a mirror after doing something very bad.",35.315,34.56,"Dorian turned and went to the window, lifting the blind. The bright dawn light flooded the room, pushing the ghostly shadows into the corners, where they shivered and shrank, remaining there. However, the strange expression that Dorian thought he saw on the portrait's face remained, and it could even be said that it had become more pronounced. The trembling, exuberant sunlight showed Dorian the merciless lines at the corners of the mouth, as clear as if he were looking into a mirror after committing a terrible deed.",22.383,21.356,"Turning around, he walked towards the window and lifted the blind. The glow of dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into the dark corners, where they froze, trembling.

649,"He winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory Cupids, one of Lord Henry’s many presents to him, glanced hurriedly into its polished depths. No line like that warped his red lips. What did it mean?","He drew back, and, picking up from the table an oval mirror framed with ivory Cupids, one of the many gifts Lord Henry had given him, hurriedly looked into its glossy depths. There was no wrinkle such as the one that had distorted his red lips. What did it mean?",34.306,33.056,"The young man flinched and blinked his eyes. He took an oval mirror surrounded by ivory Cupids, one of Lord Henry's numerous gifts, from the table and anxiously looked into its reflective depths. There was no such line that disfigured his red lips! What did this mean?",20.109,17.957,"Trembling, he took from the table an oval mirror, framed by ivory cupids, one of the many gifts Lord Henry had given him, and cast a quick glance at its bright depths.

650,"He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it again. There were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had altered. It was not a mere fancy of his own. The thing was horribly apparent.","He rubbed his eyes, approached the painting, and examined it closely. There were no signs of any repairs when he looked at the actual paint layer, yet it was certain that the entire expression had changed. It was not just his own imagination. That was terribly obvious.",31.106,29.795,"Dorian rubbed his eyes, moved closer, and examined the portrait again. There was no sign of any change when he looked at the picture, yet the entire expression of the face had unmistakably altered. It had not seemed so to him. The frightening change was visibly apparent.",24.243,22.481,"After rubbing his eyes, he approached the painting and examined it again. There was no sign of change when he looked at the canvas, and yet, there was no doubt that the expression in the portrait was different. He had not imagined it. It was a horribly visible reality.",28.82,27.388
651,"He threw himself into a chair and began to think. Suddenly there flashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward’s studio the day the picture had been finished. Yes, he remembered it perfectly. He had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood. Surely his wish had not been fulfilled? Such things were impossible. It seemed monstrous even to think of them. And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the touch of cruelty in the mouth.","He dropped himself into the chair and began to think. Suddenly, the words he had spoken in Basil Hallward's studio on the day the painting was completed flashed through his mind. Yes, he remembered them vividly. He had uttered a wild wish that he himself would remain young while the portrait aged; that his beauty would not fade, while the face on the canvas bore the burden of his passions and sins; that the painted image would wither with the lines of suffering and thought, while he retained all the freshness and charm of youth that he had just become conscious of at that time. Was it certain that his wish had not been fulfilled? Such things could not happen. Even thinking about them seemed bizarre. Yet, the painting was before him, with a cruel expression on its mouth.",34.623,34.157,"Dorian dropped himself into a chair and began to think.

But that wish couldn't have come true, could it? Such things were impossible. Even thinking about it was irrational. Yet there was the picture before his eyes, with that cruel expression on its lips.",31.035,30.528,"Letting himself fall onto a chair, he began to think. Suddenly, like a flash of lightning, he remembered what he had said in Basil Hallward's studio the day the painter finished the portrait. Yes; he remembered it perfectly. He had expressed a foolish wish: that the portrait would age and that he would remain young; that the perfection of his features would stay intact, and that the face on the canvas would bear the weight of his passions and his sins; that the painted image would show the wrinkles of suffering and contemplation, but that he would retain all the delicate brilliance and allure of an adolescence that had just become self-aware. It was not possible that his wish had been granted. Things like that didn't happen, they were impossible. It seemed monstrous even to think of it.

652,"Cruelty! Had he been cruel? It was the girl’s fault, not his. He had dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he had thought her great. Then she had disappointed him. She had been shallow and unworthy. And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little child. He remembered with what callousness he had watched her. Why had he been made like that? Why had such a soul been given to him? But he had suffered also. During the three terrible hours that the play had lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of torture. His life was well worth hers. She had marred him for a moment, if he had wounded her for an age. Besides, women were better suited to bear sorrow than men. They lived on their emotions. They only thought of their emotions. When they took lovers, it was merely to have some one with whom they could have scenes. Lord Henry had told him that, and Lord Henry knew what women were. Why should he trouble about Sibyl Vane? She was nothing to him now.","Ruthless! Are you ruthless? It was the girl's fault, not yours. You dreamed of her as a great artist, offered your love to her because you thought she was great.

You remember how ruthlessly you observed her. Why were you made this way? Why was such a soul given to you? But you also suffered. Throughout the three terrible hours that the play lasted, you lived through centuries of pain, countless years of agony. Your life was as valuable as hers.

He had imagined Sibyl as a great artist, and because he saw her as great, he had given her his love. Then the girl had disappointed him. She had behaved in a shallow manner unworthy of his love. Still, when he thought of the girl sobbing at his feet like a child, an endless feeling of regret arose within Dorian. He remembered how heartlessly he had watched her! Why was he created this way? Why was such a soul given to him? But he had suffered too. During those three terrible hours of the play, who knows how many centuries of agony, how many eternities of torment he had lived through. His own life was worth as much as hers. If he had wounded Sibyl for a while, Sibyl had also cast a shadow over his life for a moment. Besides, women were more prone to suffering than men. They thrived on their emotions. They only thought about their feelings. They took lovers just to have someone at hand, to share mutual experiences.

He recalled how indifferently he had watched her. Why had nature made him like this? Why had he been given a soul like that? But he had also suffered. During the three terrible hours of the performance, he had lived through centuries of pain, eternities of torture. His life was worth as much as Sibyl's. She had mistreated him, although Dorian had inflicted a lasting wound on her. Women, moreover, were better prepared for pain. They lived off their emotions. They only thought about their emotions.

708,"“It is an interesting question,” said Lord Henry, who found an exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad’s unconscious egotism, “an extremely interesting question. I fancy that the true explanation is this: It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us. In the present case, what is it that has really happened? Some one has killed herself for love of you. I wish that I had ever had such an experience. It would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life. The people who have adored me—there have not been very many, but there have been some—have always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me. They have become stout and tedious, and when I meet them, they go in at once for reminiscences. That awful memory of woman! What a fearful thing it is! And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.”","“That is an interesting question,” Lord Henry said, finding a refined pleasure in playing with the unconscious selfishness of the young man — “a very interesting question. I think the correct explanation is this. It often happens that the real tragedies in life occur in such an anti-artistic manner that they hurt us with their brutal aggression, absolute disjointedness, absurd senselessness, and lack of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an impression of absolute malicious power, and we resist them. However, sometimes, a tragedy with beautiful artistic elements intersects our lives. If these beautiful elements are real, then the whole affair easily captivates our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are no longer actors, but the audience of the play. Or rather, we are both. We watch ourselves, and it is the very surprise of this performance that fascinates us. In the current situation, what has actually happened? Someone has committed suicide because they loved you. I wish I could have such an experience sometime. It would make me love love for the rest of my life. The people who have been infatuated with me — not many, but there have been some — always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for them, or they for me. They fade away, become dull, and when I meet them again, they immediately drift into memory. That dreadful memory of women! How terrifying it is! And how it reveals a state of complete intellectual dullness! We should absorb the colors of life, but never remember its details. The details are always vulgar.”",43.854,43.682,"Lord Henry, who took great and secret pleasure in provoking the young man's unconscious selfishness, said, ""This is an interesting problem, extremely interesting."" "" It seems to me that the real explanation is this: Often, the real tragedies of life are so far removed from the standards of art that they hurt us with their crude violence, their inconsistencies, the absurdity of their lack of meaning, their lack of elegance and grace. They affect us much like a crowd does. They leave us with an impression of pure brute force, and we rebel against it. On the other hand, occasionally, a tragedy with elements of artistic beauty enters our lives. If these elements of beauty are genuine, the event affects us directly, in terms of its dramatic structure. Suddenly, we find that we are no longer actors, but spectators of the play. Or rather, we are both actors and spectators. We watch ourselves and get carried away by the extraordinariness of the spectacle. So what has really happened in this event? A girl has killed herself for your love. I wish I had experienced something like that. It would have made me fall in love with love for a lifetime. The people who adored me...though they were not many in number...always insisted on surviving long after the interest I had in them or they had in me had faded. They became fat and tiresome people. Whenever we met, they immediately started to revive old memories. Ah, the terrible memory of a woman! What a dreadful thing it is! How it reveals the pure mossiness of the mind! One should absorb the color of life but never remember its details. Details are always the business of the vulgar.""",28.595,28.334,"—It is an interesting case —said Lord Henry, who found a subtle pleasure in playing with the unconscious selfishness of his young friend—; a most interesting case. I believe the true explanation is this: it often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an unartistic manner that they wound us by the rawness of their violence, by their absolute incoherence, their absurd lack of meaning, their complete lack of style. They affect us as vulgarity does. They only leave us with an impression of brute force, and we rebel against that. Sometimes, however, a tragedy crosses our lives that possesses elements of artistic beauty. If those elements of beauty are real, the entire ensemble appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we discover that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather that we are both things. We observe ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle seduces us. In the present case, what has really happened? Someone has killed themselves for love of you. I would have liked to have had such an experience once. It would have made me fall in love with love for the rest of my life. The people who have adored me (there have not been many, but a few), have always insisted on continuing to live after I stopped loving them and they stopped loving me. They have become corpulent and tedious, and when I meet them, they immediately dive into memories. Ah, that terrible memory of women! What a dreadful thing! And what total intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb the colors of life, but never remember the details. The details are always vulgar.",50.377,50.225

710,"“There is no necessity,” rejoined his companion. “Life has always poppies in her hands. Of course, now and then things linger. I once wore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic mourning for a romance that would not die. Ultimately, however, it did die. I forget what killed it. I think it was her proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me. That is always a dreadful moment. It fills one with the terror of eternity. Well—would you believe it?—a week ago, at Lady Hampshire’s, I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in question, and she insisted on going over the whole thing again, and digging up the past, and raking up the future. I had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel. She dragged it out again and assured me that I had spoiled her life. I am bound to state that she ate an enormous dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety. But what a lack of taste she showed! The one charm of the past is that it is the past. But women never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act, and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over, they propose to continue it. If they were allowed their own way, every comedy would have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce. They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art. You are more fortunate than I am. I assure you, Dorian, that not one of the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you. Ordinary women always console themselves. Some of them do it by going in for sentimental colours. Never trust a woman who wears mauve, whatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons. It always means that they have a history. Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands. They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one’s face, as if it were the most fascinating of sins. Religion consoles some. Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me, and I can quite understand it. Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all. Yes; there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern life. Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one.”","“No need,” your friend replied. “Life always has opium in hand. Of course, sometimes many things also drag on. There was a time I wore nothing but purple for an entire season, as a form of artistic mourning for a love that didn’t want to die. However, in the end, it still died. I forgot what killed it. I think it was her proposal to sacrifice the whole world for me. That is always a terrible moment. It makes one terrified of permanence. Oh, by the way — can you believe it? — last week, at Mrs. Hampshire’s place, I found myself sitting next to the lady in question at dinner, and she insisted on starting over, digging up the past, nurturing the future. I had buried my love under a bed of heliotrope. She dug it up again and assured me that I had ruined her life. I had to make it clear that she had eaten a dreadful meal, so I wasn’t worried. But how she displayed such a lack of tact. One charm of the past is that it is the past. But women never realize when the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act, and just when interest in the play has completely faded, they propose to continue it. If they were allowed to have their way, every comedy would end in a tragedy, and every tragedy would climax with a farce. They are charmingly artificial, but they lack the capacity to appreciate art. You are much luckier than I am. I assure you, Dorian, that no woman I have ever known could do for me what Sibyl Vane has done for you. Ordinary girls always console themselves. Some of them do so by favoring sentimental colors. Never trust a woman who wears mauve, no matter her age, or one over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons. It always means they are in trouble. Others find great comfort in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands. They flaunt their marital happiness in our faces as if it were the most seductive sin. Religion also comforts some women. Its mysticism has all the allure of an illicit affair, one woman once told me; and I can quite understand that. Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes us all self-centered. Yes; indeed, there are countless comforts that women have found in modern life. In fact, I haven’t even mentioned the most important one.”",46.967,46.855,"His friend replied, ""There's no need."" ""Life always has bunches of poppies in its hand. Sometimes certain things don't just drag on. Once, for an entire season, I wore a violet on my lapel: as a kind of artistic mourning for a love that simply couldn't die. However, in the end, the love died. I don't remember why it died. It was because the girl proposed sacrificing the whole world for my sake, if I'm not mistaken. That is always a dreadful moment. It instills a fear of eternity in one's heart. Anyway... Would you believe... A week ago, at a dinner at Lady Hampshire's, I found myself next to the mentioned lady... And the lady insisted on reliving everything, digging up the past and talking about the future. I had buried the love I experienced in a flower bed. The woman dug it up, swore that I had ruined her life. I must say, I wasn't worried about it because she was eating heartily at the table. However, what she did was so crude! The only charm of the past is that it is the past. Yet women never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act; they propose to continue when the play has lost all its interest. If I followed them, every comedy would end in a tragic note, and every tragedy would turn into a farce. Women have a very endearing artificiality, but no sense of art. You are luckier than I am. I assure you, Dorian, none of the women I know would do for me what Sibyl Vane did for you. Ordinary women always know how to console themselves. Some do it by cloaking themselves in romantic colors. Never trust a woman who wears purple, no matter her age... Nor a woman over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons. It means they definitely have a history behind them. Some women find great solace in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands. They flaunt their happy marriages in one's face, like the most attractive sin. Some are consoled by religion. A woman once told me that the pleasure of flirting lies in the mysteries of religion. I understand this very well. Besides, the thing that flatters one's pride the most in the world is being told, you are a sinner. Conscience makes us all selfish. Yes, the consolations women find in contemporary life are endless. In fact, I haven't even touched on the most important one.""",32.771,32.619,"—No need —replied his friend—. Life always distributes poppies by the handful. Of course, from time to time things get prolonged. On one occasion, I wore nothing but violets for an entire season, as an artistic mourning for a love story that refused to die. In the end, it finally did. I no longer remember what killed it. Probably, her proposal to sacrifice the entire world for me. That is always a terrible moment. It fills one with the terror of eternity. Well, would you believe it? Last week, at Lady Hampshire's house, I found myself dining next to the lady I am telling you about, and she insisted on revisiting the entire story, unearthing the past and stirring up the future. I had buried my love under a bed of asphodels. She brought it back to light, assuring me that I had ruined her life.

They are good husbands, or faithful wives, or something tedious. You know what I mean—middle-class virtue and all that kind of thing. How different Sibyl was! She lived her finest tragedy. She was always a heroine. The last night she played—the night you saw her—she acted badly because she had known the reality of love. When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died. She passed again into the sphere of art. There is something of the martyr about her. Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not think I have not suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment—about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six—you would have found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can, except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled, and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some unjust law altered—I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of ennui, and became a confirmed misanthrope. And besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic point of view. Was it not Gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts? I remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase. Well, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life. I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp—there is much to be got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator of one’s own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life. I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You have not realized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I am different, but you must not like me less. I am changed, but you must always be my friend. Of course, I am very fond of Harry. But I know that you are better than he is.

And besides, dear Basil, if you really want to console me, try to make me forget what happened or show the event to me from an artistic perspective! Wasn’t it Gautier who wrote about the consolation of the arts?

Antique brocades, green bronzes, lacquer works, ivory carvings, beautiful places, luxury, splendor...These things have much to offer a person.

779,"“I see you did. Don’t speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say. Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and power, by you. You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. I worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I wanted to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. When you were away from me, you were still present in my art.... Of course, I never let you know anything about this. It would have been impossible. You would not have understood it. I hardly understood it myself. I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes—too wonderful, perhaps, for in such mad worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less than the peril of keeping them.... Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew more and more absorbed in you. Then came a new development. I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman’s cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian’s barge, gazing across the green turbid Nile. You had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the water’s silent silver the marvel of your own face. And it had all been what art should be—unconscious, ideal, and remote. One day, a fatal day I sometimes think, I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own dress and in your own time. Whether it was the realism of the method, or the mere wonder of your own personality, thus directly presented to me without mist or veil, I cannot tell. But I know that as I worked at it, every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret. I grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry. I felt, Dorian, that I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it. Then it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me. Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me. But I did not mind that. When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I felt that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely good-looking and that I could paint. Even now I cannot help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates. Art is always more abstract than we fancy. Form and colour tell us of form and colour—that is all. It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him. And so when I got this offer from Paris, I determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition. It never occurred to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were right. The picture cannot be shown. You must not be angry with me, Dorian, for what I have told you. As I said to Harry, once, you are made to be worshipped.”","""I realize that you have already seen it. Don't speak. Wait until you have heard what I have to say. Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality has had an extraordinarily special influence on me. I was dominated by you, soul, intellect, and power. To me, you became the tangible embodiment of the ideal type that the memory of them still haunts us artists like a wonderful dream. I worship you. I gradually became jealous of anyone you talked to. I wanted to have you entirely for myself. I was only happy when I was with you. But when you were away from me, you were still present in my art... Of course, I never let you know about this. Perhaps it was impossible. Perhaps you would not understand. I myself hardly understood. I only knew that I had come face to face with absolute beauty, and that the world became wondrous before my eyes — too wondrous, perhaps, for in these mad adorations there is danger, the danger of losing them, no less than the danger of keeping them... Week after week went by, and I was drawn more and more to you. Then came a new development. I painted you as Paris in beautiful armor, as Adonis with a hunter's cloak and a gleaming boar spear. Wearing a heavy lotus crown, you sat on the prow of Adrian's flagship, gazing across the muddy blue Nile. You bent over a still pond in some Greek forest, and saw in the quiet silver of the water your own wondrous face. And it was everything that art should become, unconscious, ideal, distant. One day, a day that I sometimes think was disastrous, I decided to paint a magnificent portrait of you as you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own clothes and in your own time. Whether it was Realism in the painting style, or just the surprise of your personality appearing so directly before me, without any mist or veil, I cannot tell. But I knew that as I worked on it, it seemed as if every stroke and patch of color revealed my secret. I gradually became afraid that others might know about my idol worship. I felt, Dorian, that I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it. That was when I decided never to allow the painting to be exhibited. You were slightly annoyed; but at that time you did not realize what all this meant to me. Harry, with whom I discussed it, laughed at me. But I did not mind. When the painting was finished, and I sat alone with it, I felt that I was right... Then, a few days after it left my studio, and just after I escaped the unbearable enchantment of its presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish to imagine that I had ever seen anything in it more than the fact that you are extraordinarily handsome, and I could paint that. Even now I cannot help feeling that it was a mistake to think that the passion we feel in creation ever really shows itself in the work we create. Art is always more abstract than we imagine. Form and color tell us about form and color — that is all. I often think that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals them. And so when I received this invitation from Paris, I decided to make your portrait the principal work in my exhibition. Never did it occur to me that you would refuse. Now I see that you were right. The painting should not be displayed. You should not be angry with me, Dorian, for what I have told you. As I once told Harry, you were made to be worshipped.""",48.808,48.735,"“I see that it has been so. Do not say anything. Wait and listen to what I have to say. Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had an extraordinarily profound effect on me. My soul, my mind, my artistic power came under your dominion. There is an invisible ideal, the memory of which, like a unique dream, never leaves us artists. And you became the visible, living symbol of this ideal for me. I worshipped you. I became jealous of everyone you spoke to. I wanted to keep you entirely to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. When you were away from me, I found your presence in my art...Of course, I did not let you sense any of this. It was impossible. You could not have understood. I myself could not fully understand. I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and the world had taken on a marvelous appearance. Perhaps it had become too marvelous, because such a mad worship is fraught with dangers: the danger of losing what is worshipped as much as the danger of being able to keep it...Weeks added to weeks, and I gave myself more and more to you. Then a new development occurred. I had drawn you as Paris in elegant armor; as Adonis with a hunter's cloak and a shining spear in hand. You had sat crowned with heavy water lilies at the bow of Hadrian's boat, watching the murky green waters of the Nile. You had bent over a still pool in a Greek grove and seen your face in the silent silver of the water. All of this happened in a manner entirely suitable to art: ideal, distant, unconscious... Then one day, on what I might call an ominous day, I decided to draw your portrait as you truly are. I would draw you not in the costumes of past ages but in your own time, in your own clothes. I do not know if it was the realism in the method that pushed me to take you directly, away from veils and mists. What I do know is that every speck of paint, every shade of color that appeared while working on this portrait seemed to reveal my secret. I began to fear that others would understand this idolatrous side of me. Dorian, I sensed that I had said too much with this portrait, that I had put too much of myself into it. That is when I decided never to allow the painting to be exhibited. You were a bit upset by this; you could not know what the painting meant to me. I talked about it with Harry, he laughed at me, but I did not care. As I sat in front of the painting after finishing it, I felt that my decision was right...Anyway, a few days later, the portrait left my studio. When the unbearable enchantment of your presence lifted from me, I began to think that it was madness to believe I saw something special in this painting. All it was, was that you were extraordinarily handsome, and I was a good painter, that's all. It is wrong to think that the passion one feels while creating always reflects in the created work as it is. I still hold this view. Art is always more abstract than we think. Form and color tell us about form and color, that's all. Often it seems to me that instead of revealing the artist, art completely hides him from view. That's how it is. When I received this proposal from Paris, I decided to make your portrait the masterpiece of my exhibition. It never occurred to me that you would oppose it. But now I see that you are right. This painting cannot be exhibited. Dorian, do not be angry with me for what I have told you. As I once told Harry, you were created to be worshipped.”",31.777,31.67,"—I see that you do. Don't say anything. Wait to hear what I have to say. From the moment I met you, your personality has had the most extraordinary influence on me. You have dominated my soul, my brain, my energies. You became the tangible embodiment of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts artists like an ineffable dream. I idolized you. I felt jealous of everyone you spoke to. I wanted you for myself alone. I was only happy when I was with you. And when you were away from me, you were still present in my art... Of course, I never let you know any of this. It would have been impossible. You wouldn't have understood it. I barely understood it myself. I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that, before my eyes, the world had become something wonderful; too wonderful, perhaps, because in such excessive adoration there is a danger, the danger of losing it, no less serious than that of keeping it... Weeks and weeks passed, and I was more and more absorbed in you every day. Then something new happened. I had drawn you as Paris in a delicate armor, and as Adonis with a hunter's cloak and a polished spear. Crowned with lotus flowers at the prow of Hadrian's barge, looking towards the other shore over the green murky waters of the Nile. Bent over a still pond in some Greek forest, you had seen in the silent silver of the water the wonder of your own face. And everything had been, as befits art, unconscious, ideal, and remote. One day, a fateful day, I sometimes think, I decided to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you are, not in the garments of dead ages, but in your clothes and in your time. I don't know if it was the realism of the method or the very wonder of your personality, which presented itself to me then without intermediaries, without fog or veil. But I know that while I was working on it, with each brushstroke, with each touch of color, it seemed to me that I was revealing my secret. I was afraid that others would notice my idolatry. I realized that I had said too much, that I had put too much of myself into that painting. I then decided not to allow the portrait to ever be exhibited in public. You were a little upset; but you didn't realize all that it meant to me. Harry, to whom I spoke about it, laughed at me. But I didn't care. When the painting was finished, and I was alone with it, I felt that I was right... Then, a few days later, the canvas left my studio, and as soon as I was freed from the intolerable fascination of its presence, it seemed absurd to imagine that there was anything special about it, apart from the fact that you were very handsome and that I was capable of painting. Even now I can't help but think that it is a mistake to believe that the passion felt during creation truly appears in the created work. Art is always more abstract than we imagine. Form and color only speak of themselves..., that's all. It often seems to me that art hides the artist much more than it reveals him. So when I received the invitation from Paris, I decided to make your portrait the main piece of my exhibition. It never occurred to me that you would refuse. Now I understand that you were right. The portrait cannot be shown. Don't be angry with me for what I've told you, Dorian. As I once told Harry, you are made to be adored.",46.667,46.588

Now it was to hide something that had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death itself—something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.

Now it concealed something with its own decay, worse than the decay of death itself — something that would produce fears but never die.

Besides, why shouldn't his soul elevate and ennoble over time? There was no reason for his future to be so disgraceful. Perhaps one day, a love that entered his life would purify him and protect him from sins, why not?

Not even him. Why should he have to contemplate the hateful corruption of his soul? He would retain his youth: that was enough. And besides, wasn't there a possibility that one day more noble feelings might be born in him? There was no reason to think of a shameful future. Perhaps love could cross his life, purifying and protecting him from those sins that already seemed to stir in his flesh and spirit: those curious, still formless sins whose very indeterminacy lent them subtlety and allure.

853,"For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of this book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never sought to free himself from it. He procured from Paris no less than nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have almost entirely lost control. The hero, the wonderful young Parisian in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself. And, indeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own life, written before he had lived it.","For many years, Dorian Gray could not escape the influence of this book. Or perhaps, more accurately, he never tried to escape from it. He acquired no fewer than nine deluxe editions of the first printing from Paris, binding them in different colors so they could match the diverse moods and whimsical imaginations of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have almost lost control. He saw the main character, a marvelous young Parisian, in whom romantic and scientific temperaments were strangely blended, as a kind of prototype of himself.

Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never even thought of freeing himself from this influence. He bought exactly nine large copies of the book from Paris. He had them bound in different colors to match the changes in his mood and the whims of his often erratic nature. The hero of the novel, this extraordinary young Parisian man who combined emotional and scientific tendencies within himself, had become a symbol for Dorian, as if he had been designed before Dorian was born. In any case, the entire book seemed like a story of his life, written before it was lived.",27.857,27.326,"For years, Dorian Gray could not rid himself of the influence of that book.

He never knew—never, indeed, had any cause to know—that somewhat grotesque dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water which came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned by the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently, been so remarkable. It was with an almost cruel joy—and perhaps in nearly every joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its place—that he used to read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if somewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who had himself lost what in others, and the world, he had most dearly valued.","There is one point where you are luckier than the imaginary character in that novel. You have never known — indeed, there has never been any reason for you to know — the somewhat peculiar fear of mirrors, shiny metal surfaces, and still water, a fear that weighed heavily on the young Parisian from an early age, caused by the sudden decay of a beauty that once seemed quite exceptional. With an almost cruel joy — and perhaps in most joys, just as in all pleasures, cruelty always has its place — you often read the latter part of the book, with its truly tragic description, if not slightly overemphasized, of the sorrow and despair of someone who has lost what they cherished most in others and in the world.",25.101,24.48,"At one point, he was luckier than the incredible hero of the novel himself. Upon the sudden ruin of her beauty, which was evidently very striking at first, the Parisian had developed a rather ridiculous fear of mirrors, polished metals, and still waters at a very young age. However, Dorian had never known this fear, and there was no reason for him to know it. He was reading the final chapters, which told the somewhat exaggerated but truly heartbreaking story of a man who had lost what he valued most in the world and in people, with an almost cruel delight.

He had always the look of one who had kept himself unspotted from the world. Men who talked grossly became silent when Dorian Gray entered the room.

The very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure. He grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul. He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age.

It was the sharpness of the contrast that often heightened his capacity for pleasure. He became increasingly enamored with his own beauty, and increasingly attentive to the decay of his soul. He examined every detail, sometimes with a terrible, perverse joy, the hideous wrinkles that marred the withered forehead, or crept around the lecherous mouth, sometimes wondering which was more dreadful, the signs of sin or the signs of age.

He would look at the aged, evil-filled face on the canvas, and then at his own beautiful, fresh face smiling back at him from the mirrored glass. The sharp contrast between the two would stir a thrill of pleasure within him. He was falling more and more in love with his own beauty, and becoming more and more interested in the decay of his soul.

He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.","Because, although he was more than willing to assume the status almost immediately offered to him at adulthood, and, indeed, had found a subtle joy in the thought that he could truly become, to London in his time, what the author of Satyricon had once become to Rome in the time of Emperor Nero, nevertheless, deep down, he still wished to become someone of higher standing than merely an arbiter elegantiarum, to be consulted on how to wear jewels, or tie a cravat, or use a cane.

In fact, he did not lack a secret pleasure at the thought that he could play the role in London that the author of “Satyricon” once played in Nero's Rome. Yet, deep in his heart, there was a desire to be something more than just an arbiter elegantiarum – an arbiter of elegance to be consulted on matters such as wearing jewelry, tying a cravat, or holding a cane.

861,"The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence. But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic. As he looked back upon man moving through history, he was haunted by a feeling of loss. So much had been surrendered! and to such little purpose!

As he looked at humanity passing through History, he was haunted by a sense of loss. How many things had been renounced! and for such petty purposes! Stubborn, mad refusals, ghastly forms of self-torture and self-denial whose origins were fear and whose results were a degradation infinitely more terrible than the imagined degradation they, in their ignorance, sought to escape. Mother Nature, with her marvelous irony, drives the hermit away and feeds him with the wild beasts of the desert, and brings the animals of the plain to the recluse to be his companions.",35.754,35.441,"The sanctification of the senses has often, and very rightly, been condemned and criticized. Mankind has always harbored a natural dread of passions and senses that appear stronger than oneself (and are known to be shared with lower forms of life). However, it seemed to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood. The senses have been forced to remain wild and animalistic because the world has aimed to crush them by starving or to kill them through suffering. Yet, they should have become elements of a new spirituality, whose dominant characteristic is a refined intuition of beauty. Dorian, as he looked back and examined the progress of humanity throughout history, felt a sense of loss. What had mankind given up! And all for nothing! Mad, stubborn denials rooted in fear, turning away, monstrous self-inflicted tortures, deprivations. Mankind had done these things out of ignorance, supposedly to avoid shame and degradation; yet the result of their choice had been a degradation far worse than what they had tried to escape. With its marvelous irony, nature had forced those who had withdrawn from the world to live alongside wild desert animals, giving monks the animals of the fields as companions.",20.34,19.894,"The worship of the senses has frequently and justly been censured, because human nature makes one instinctively fear passions and sensations that seem stronger than oneself, and which one is aware of sharing with lower forms of the organic world.

When contemplating the path humanity had traveled since the dawn of history, he was overcome with a feeling of regret. There had been so many capitulations! And with such scant results! There had been senseless rejections, monstrous forms of mortification, of self-torture, whose origin was fear and whose result was an infinitely more terrible degradation than the imaginary degradation from which humanity, in its ignorance, had tried to escape.

Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be.

Rather, its purpose would be to directly experience such sensations, not the bittersweet fruits of these life experiences.

A hedonism that would undoubtedly use the services of intelligence, but without accepting any theory or system that implied the sacrifice of any form of passionate experience. Its objective, indeed, was the experience itself and not the fruits of the experience, both sweet and bitter. It would dispense with the asceticism that stifles the senses and the vulgar shamelessness that dulls them. But it would teach the human being to concentrate on the singular moments of a life that is in itself nothing more than a moment.",32.024,31.512
863,"There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie. Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble. In black fantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there. Outside, there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from her purple cave. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan mirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often. Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.","Some of us occasionally wake up before dawn, or after one of those dreamless nights that almost make us fall in love with death, or one of those grotesque and joyous nights, when, through the brain's chambers, flit shadows more terrifying than reality itself, sharing the same instinct with the vibrant life that lurks in every bizarre painting and supplements its eternal vitality to Gothic art, an art that, we can imagine, is especially the art of those who suffer from hypochondria. Gradually, white fingers crawl through the curtains, and they emerge before the trembling. In grotesque black garb, silent shadows crawl into the room's corners, hiding there. Outside, birds chirp in the leaves, or the sound of people heading to work, or the sighing whisper of the wind blowing down from the hills and wandering around the quiet house, as if afraid to wake those who are deeply asleep, yet still needing to call sleep out of its purple cave. One dark curtain after another is drawn up, the shapes and colors of things gradually recover, and we watch the dawn recreate the world in its ancient pattern. The pale mirrors regain their imitative life. The unlit candles still stand where we left them, and beside them lies the partially cut book we are studying, or the ribbon-tied flower we wore at the ball yesterday, or the letter we fear to read, or the letter we read too often. It seems to us that nothing has changed. The real life we know has returned from the unreal shadows. We resume it where we left off, and within us spreads a dreadful awareness of the necessity to continue actively with the same weary round of stereotyped habits, or a fierce longing that, perhaps, one morning our eyelids might open to a world refurbished in the darkness for our delight, a world in which everything will have fresh shapes and colors, will change, or have other secrets, a world in which the past has little or no place, or at least cannot survive in any form of consciousness of duty or regret, for even the recollection of joy has a bitter taste, and the memory of pleasure has its pain.",29.706,29.524,"Among us, there are very few who do not wake up suddenly at dawn after those dreamless sleeps that almost push us to embrace death, or after a night filled with terrors and monstrous joys. In such nights, ghosts seep into the compartments of the mind that are even more frightening than realities, filled with the life force hidden in all monsters. It is this life force in the monsters that gives Gothic art its unending vitality. Isn't Gothic art actually considered a branch of art unique to those whose minds are afflicted with dream fever? Yes, at such moments, white fingers gently slip inside through the curtains. These fingers seem to be trembling. And they seem to make the curtains ripple. Silent, dark shadows, cloaked in surreal forms, crawl and settle into the corners of the room. Outside, there is the rustling of birds among the leaves, and the sounds of people heading to work can be heard. The wind descends from the hills, and although it hesitates to wake those sleeping in the silent house, it roams around as if compelled to draw sleep out of its purple cave, sighing and sobbing. Dark, thin veils peel away one after another, opening step by step, objects regain their usual colors and shapes, and we watch as dawn recreates the world according to that ancient pattern. Pale reflections return to the mirrors. The flameless candelabras remain where we left them, and beside them, the half-opened book we read at night, the flower with a wired stem we pinned to our lapel at the ball, or the letter we are afraid to read—perhaps one we've read a hundred times. Nothing appears to have changed to our eyes. From the surreal shadows of the night, the real life we know emerges. We must pick it up from where we left off. Then, the necessity to continue expending energy to turn the tiresome wheel of the same entrenched habits descends upon us like a cloud. We might perhaps be seized by a mad desire to open our eyes to a world reshaped solely for our pleasure in the darkness of night: a world where everything carries brand new colors and shapes, has changed, and contains other mysteries; a world that almost leaves no place for the past, where the conscious responsibility and regret of the past leave no residue, where joyful memories do not bring disappointment, and sweet memories do not bring bitterness.",14.573,14.278,"There are very few among us who have not sometimes woken up before dawn, or after one of those dreamless nights that almost make us love death, or one of those nights of horror and monstrous joy, when ghosts more terrible than reality itself stir in the chambers of the brain, brimming with that intense life, inseparable from all that is grotesque, which gives Gothic art its imperishable vitality, since that art seems to belong above all to spirits tormented by the sickness of dreams. Little by little, bloodless fingers emerge from behind the curtains and seem to tremble. Adopting fantastic dark shapes, silent shadows creep into the corners of the room to crouch there. Outside, one hears the rustling of birds among the leaves, or the noises made by men heading to work, or the sighs and sobs of the wind descending from the mountains and wandering around the silent house, as if fearing to wake those who sleep, though it is compelled to drag sleep out of its purple cave at all costs. One by one, the veils of delicate black gauze lift, things gradually regain form and color, and we see how the dawn restores the world to its pristine appearance. The livid mirrors regain their imitation of life. The extinguished candles remain where we left them, and beside them rests the half-open book we intended to study, or the prepared flower we wore to the dance, or the letter we did not dare to read or have read too many times. Nothing seems to have changed. From the unreal shadows of the night, the real life we knew is reborn. We must continue where we had been interrupted, and at that moment we are overwhelmed by a terrible feeling, the need to vigorously continue the same exhausting cycle of stereotyped habits, or perhaps, sometimes, the mad desire that our eyes might open one morning to a world remodeled overnight to please us, a world in which things would have newly invented forms and colors, and would be different, or hide other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no value, or would survive, in any case, without a conscious sense of obligation or remorse, since even the memory of a joy has its bitterness, and the memory of a pleasure, its pain.",27.209,27.013
864,"It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and then, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that, indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition of it.","It seems that for Dorian Gray, the true purpose, or among the true purposes, of life is precisely the creation of such worlds; and in the quest for sensations that are both new and pleasing, and possessing that element of ""novelty"" which is so essential to romance, he often adhered to certain lines of thought that he knew were truly contrary to his nature, immersing himself in their subtle influences, and then, having, so to speak, captured their color and satisfied his curiosity, he abandoned them with a strange indifference that was not incompatible with the genuinely passionate temperament which, indeed, according to some modern psychologists, is always one of its states.",31.082,30.462,"It seemed to Dorian Gray that the true purpose of living –or one of the true purposes– was to be able to create worlds like these. Chasing after thrills that were both new and pleasurable, and possessed the ""extraordinary"" qualities he considered indispensable elements of romantic adventures, Dorian was actually adopting certain modes of thought that he knew were alien to his nature, allowing himself to be influenced by them indirectly. Then, so to speak, after absorbing their color and satisfying his intellectual curiosity, he would abandon them with a strange indifference. Such indifference is not at all unusual in a passionate character; in fact, according to some contemporary psychologists, such a disposition is considered a prerequisite for such a temperament.",17.836,16.986,"To Dorian Gray, it seemed that the creation of worlds like those was the true goal or, at least, one of the true goals of life; and in his quest for sensations that were at the same time new and pleasurable, and possessed that component of the unknown which is so essential for daydreaming, he often adopted certain modes of thought that he knew were really foreign to his nature, surrendering to their subtle influence, and then, after soaking up, so to speak, their color, and once his natural curiosity was satisfied, he abandoned them with that curious indifference which is not incompatible with a truly passionate temperament, and which, in fact, according to certain modern psychologists, is frequently its indispensable condition.",29.752,29.134
865,"It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman Catholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great attraction for him. The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its superb rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it sought to symbolize. He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft the jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at times, one would fain think, is indeed the “panis cælestis,” the bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ, breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins. The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle fascination for him. As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating the true story of their lives.","There was a time when people rumored that you were about to join the Roman Catholic Church; and indeed, the Roman rite always had a great allure for you. The daily sacrifice, truly more terrifying than any sacrifice of the ancient world, moved you with its grand rejection of sensory evidence just as much as with the primal simplicity of its elements and the eternal inspiration of the human tragedy it sought to symbolize. You liked kneeling on the cold marble floor, watching the priest, dressed in stiff brocade vestments, slowly and with white hands, draw aside the veil of the tabernacle, or lift above his head a monstrance adorned with jewels containing the pale host that one might sometimes be willing to think was indeed ""panis cælestis,"" the bread of angels, or, wearing the robe of Christ's passion, break the host into the chalice, and strike his breast for his sins. The smoking censers, which solemn altar boys, dressed in lace and bright red garments, swung into the air like large gilded flowers, had a subtle fascination for you. When you left, you often looked with wonder at the dark confessionals, longing to sit in the dim light of one of them and listen to men and women whisper through the worn-out grille the true story of their lives.",33.268,32.974,"There were rumors circulating that Dorian Gray was about to convert to the Catholic Church at one point. The fact is that the methods of this sect had always seemed very attractive to him. The Roman Catholic Church, with its daily sacrifices that it found more magnificent than all the sacrifices of the ancient world, its outright denial of the senses, as well as the simplicity of its elements and the unchanging inner anguish of the Human Tragedy it sought to symbolize, stirred Dorian's emotions. He enjoyed watching the priest in his tall, embroidered robe, kneeling on the cold marble floor: the priest opening the temple curtain with his white hands, cutting the sacred bread into the chalice in the guise of the Mass of the Passion of Man, and striking his chest for his sins, lifting the jewel-encrusted, lantern-shaped sacred bread container with the pale slice of bread inside it into the air. Sometimes Dorian was inclined to believe that this was indeed panis caelestis, the bread of angels. The incense burners that the children in lace and red garments, with serious expressions, tossed into the air like large, gilded flowers, subtly enchanted him. As he left the church, he would look curiously at those dark confession booths, and he would want to sit in the dim shadows of one of them, listening to the men and women whispering the true stories of their lives from behind the leaf screens.",20.775,20.366,"On one occasion it was rumored that he was about to convert to Catholicism; and, of course, the Roman ritual had always greatly attracted him. The daily sacrifice of the mass, more terribly real than all the sacrifices of the ancient world, moved him as much by its supreme disdain for the testimony of the senses as by the primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy it sought to symbolize. He liked to kneel on the cold marble floor and watch the priest, with his stiff, flowered chasuble, slowly part the veil of the tabernacle with his ivory hands, and raise the monstrance with the pale host that sometimes, one would like to believe, is truly the panis caelestis, the food of angels; or, adorned with the attributes of Christ's passion, break the sacred form and strike his chest to ask for the remission of all sins. The smoking censers, which the solemn altar boys, with their lace and scarlet cassocks, swung into the air like great golden flowers, exerted a subtle fascination over Dorian Gray. Upon leaving the church, he would gaze in wonder at the black confessionals, and he would have liked to sit inside one of them to listen to men and women whisper through the worn grille the true story of their lives.",34.663,34.364
866,"But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail. Mysticism, with its marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of the Darwinismus movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions, morbid or healthy, normal or diseased. Yet, as has been said of him before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared with life itself. He felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment. He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual mysteries to reveal.","But he never fell into the mistake of stifling his intellectual development by accepting any formal creed or system, or confusing, with the house he lived in, an inn only suitable for staying a short while during the night, or a few hours in a night without stars and a painful moon. Occultism, with its marvelous ability to make ordinary things strange to us, and the lawless mysticism that always seemed to accompany it, softened his heart for a season; and for a season he leaned towards the materialist doctrines of the Darwinismus movement in Germany, finding strange joy in tracing human thoughts and passions to some pearl-like brain cell, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the idea of the soul's absolute dependence on certain natural conditions, whether sick or healthy, normal or corrupt. However, as previously mentioned about him, he seemed to find no theory of life as important when compared to life itself. He clearly saw how futile all intellectual study would be when separated from action and experimentation. He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, had spiritual mysteries waiting to be discovered.",36.19,35.9,"However, he never made the mistake of officially adopting any religion or system that would restrict his mental development. He never fell into the error of mistaking a shelter for one night, or even an inn to take refuge in for a few hours of a night when the stars did not shine and the moon did not rise, for a house to live in. Mysticism, which has a wonderful effect of making ordinary things appear extraordinary to our eyes, and the mysterious antinomianism6 movement that often follows it for some reason, occupied him for a season. In another season, Dorian inclined towards the materialistic teachings of the Darwinismus7 movement in Germany. He took a strange pleasure in tracing the thoughts and feelings of a person to a pearly cell in the brain or a white nerve in the body. The idea that the soul was entirely dependent on certain bodily conditions—whether diseased or healthy, normal or abnormal—gave him satisfaction. The thing is, as we mentioned earlier, no theory about life seemed as important to him as life itself. He was well aware of how barren intellectual theories could be when they were disconnected from action and experience. He knew that the senses also had spiritual mysteries to reveal, which were no less significant than those of the soul.",25.306,24.904,"But he never made the mistake of halting his intellectual development by officially accepting any creed or system, nor by turning a temporary inn into a permanent dwelling, an inn that is only convenient for spending a day or a few hours of a starless night when the moon is in labor. Mysticism, with its wonderful power to make ordinary things strange, and the subtle antinomianism [3] that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a season; and for another season he inclined towards the materialistic doctrines of the German Darwinist movement and found a curious pleasure in tracing back the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in their brain, or to some whitish nerve in their body, enchanted with the idea that the spirit depended absolutely on certain physical conditions, morbid or healthy, normal or pathological. However, as has already been said of him, no theory about life seemed important to him compared to life itself. He was very aware of the sterility of all intellectual speculation if separated from action and experience. He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, had spiritual mysteries to reveal.",42.78,42.533
867,"And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their manufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums from the East. He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one’s passions, and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers; of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that sickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to be able to expel melancholy from the soul.","And so, at this moment, he began to study perfumes, with the secrets of their creation, the distillation of concentrated fragrant oils, and the burning of aromatic resins from the East. He found that there was no mood that did not have its counterpart in the realm of sensuality, and he forced himself to explore the precise connections between them, wondering what it was in African incense that made people become mysterious, in ambergris that could stimulate human passions, in heliotrope that could awaken memories of dead loves, in musk that could disturb the brain, in ylang-ylang that could color the imagination; and he often sought to establish a true psychological theory of perfumes, to evaluate the effects of fragrant roots and heavily powdered flowers, or fragrant oils, of black sandalwood, of the loathsome camphor tree, of the maddening spikenard, of the aloe wood that was rumored to be able to drive away melancholy from the soul.",19.026,18.357,"Thus, you see him studying perfumes, the secrets of perfume making, distilling fragrant oils, and burning aromatic resins from the Far East. He observed that every change in the mind had a counterpart in sensory life and strove to uncover the true connection between them: What was it in the daily scent that made one mystical? What was it in amber that inflamed emotions, in the scent of violets that revived memories of lost loves, in musk that disturbed the mind, in champaca that stimulated the imagination? Dorian was developing a solid philosophy about perfumes and attempting to measure their various effects, studying fragrant roots, flowers laden with aromatic pollen, and melissas; fragrant, dense trees: the sickening hyacinths, the delirium-inducing hovenias, the aloe tree said to banish melancholy from the soul...",9.913,8.917,"For this reason, he devoted himself for some time to the study of perfumes and the secrets of their manufacture, distilling intensely aromatic oils, and burning fragrant gums from the East, which allowed him to realize that there was no state of mind that did not have a correspondence in the life of the senses, dedicating himself to discovering their true relationships, wondering why incense drives mysticism, why ambergris unleashes passions, why violet awakens the memory of dead loves, and why musk disturbs the brain and champac [4] the imagination, repeatedly trying to develop a true psychology of perfumes, and to calculate the various influences of roots possessing soft scents, pollen-laden flowers, or aromatic balms, dark and fragrant woods, spikenard that induces nausea, hovenia that drives one mad, and aloes that are said to expel melancholy from the soul.",24.292,23.747
868,"At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long latticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of olive-green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad gipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave, yellow-shawled Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and, crouching upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of reed or brass and charmed—or feigned to charm—great hooded snakes and horrible horned adders. The harsh intervals and shrill discords of barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert’s grace, and Chopin’s beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell unheeded on his ear. He collected together from all parts of the world the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact with Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try them. He had the mysterious juruparis of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular sweetness. He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when they were shaken; the long clarin of the Mexicans, into which the performer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the harsh ture of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who sit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a distance of three leagues; the teponaztli, that has two vibrating tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the yotl-bells of the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the one that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican temple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a description. The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated him, and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like Nature, has her monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous voices. Yet, after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his box at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt pleasure to “Tannhauser” and seeing in the prelude to that great work of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul.","At other times, he would devote himself entirely to music, and in the long room with lattice windows, a gilded ceiling, and olive-green walls, he often held strange concerts, where frenzied Gypsies would tear wild music from tiny dulcimers, or solemn Tunisians wrapped in yellow shawls would pluck the taut strings of enormous lutes, while grinning black men beat steadily on copper drums, and, bent over red carpets, slender Indians with turbans would blow through long reed or brass pipes, mesmerizing, or pretending to mesmerize, giant cobras and terrifying horned vipers. The dissonant intervals and shrill, discordant notes of barbaric music excited him at times when the grace of Schubert, the beautiful sorrow of Chopin, and the powerful harmonies of Beethoven himself could not capture his ear. He collected from all over the world the strangest musical instruments he could find, both from the tombs of dead civilizations and among a few savage tribes that still maintained some contact with Western civilization, and he enjoyed touching and trying them. He had the mysterious juruparis of the Indians of the Rio Negro, an instrument that women were not allowed to see, and young men could not behold until they had undergone fasting and whipping, and the earthenware jar of the Peruvians, with its shrill bird call, and human bone flutes like those Alfonso de Ovalle had heard in Chili, and the green quartz crystal that resonated, found near Cuzco, capable of producing a single sweet note. He drew sketches of gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when shaken; the long clarin of the Mexicans, which the performer did not blow into but inhaled air through; the rough ture of the Amazon tribes, which emitted sound thanks to little guards who sat all day in tall trees and could be heard, it was said, from three miles away; the teponaztli, with its two wooden tongues struck by sticks coated in a flexible gum obtained from tree sap; the yotl bells of the Aztecs, hung in clusters like grapes; and the enormous cylindrical drum, covered with the skin of giant snakes, like the one Bernal Diaz saw when he accompanied Cortes into a Mexican temple, and which he left us a vivid description of its mournful sound. The bizarre characteristics of these instruments fascinated him, and he felt a strange pleasure in thinking that Art, like Nature, had its monsters, things that wore the guise of beasts and had hideous voices. However, after a while, he grew tired of them and returned to his box at the opera house, either alone or with Lord Henry, entranced by Tannhäuser, and found in the prelude of that masterpiece an expression of the tragedy of his own soul.",29.174,29.007,"At one point, he devoted himself entirely to music. He organized very peculiar concerts in a long room with latticed windows, a ceiling painted red and gilded, and walls lacquered in olive green. In these recitals, wild Gypsies would extract wandering melodies from their small, multi-stringed instruments, dignified Tunisians wrapped in yellow shawls would pluck the taut strings of their enormous ouds, grinning black men would pound their copper drums with monotonous beats, and thin Indians with turbans on their heads, squatting on red prayer rugs, would enchant or pretend to enchant terrifying, long, poisonous, horned snakes by playing their long flutes made of reed or brass. When he couldn't be moved by Schubert's delicate harmony, Chopin's exquisite melancholy, or even Beethoven's magnificent melodies, the harsh intervals and shrill dissonances of barbaric music excited Dorian. He had collected the strangest instruments he could find from all corners of the world: from the tombs of vanished nations, from places where a handful of wild tribes had managed to survive after coming into contact with Western civilization. He loved to caress and try them out. He had acquired those mysterious Juruparis of the Rio Negro Indians, which women were not allowed to look at and young men could only see after undergoing fasting and flogging trials. He had the earthenware flutes of the Peruvians that chirped with bird-like high pitches, the flutes made of human bone that Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the resonant jade stones found around Cuzco that produced indescribably beautiful sounds... He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when shaken; the long clarinets of the Mexicans that were played by sucking rather than blowing; the harsh-sounding turé of the Amazon natives, said to be heard from three leagues away, played by the sentinels who kept watch in the high trees all day; the teponaztli, carved from wood with two vibrating tongues, played with sticks coated in a gum made from plant latex; the yotl rattles of the Aztecs, clustered like grape bunches; and that huge drum seen by Bernal Diaz in the Mexican temple he entered with Cortez, which he vividly described for its mournful sound. Gray, captivated by the variety and striking nature of these instruments, took a peculiar pleasure in thinking that, like nature, art also created monsters, animal-shaped, and ugly-sounding things. However, after a while, he grew tired of these as well, and found himself either alone or with Lord Henry in his opera box, listening to Tannhäuser in a state of ecstasy, discovering the tragedy of his own soul in the prelude of this grand work of art.",20.452,20.253,"In another era, he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a spacious room with lattices, a vermilion and gold ceiling, and walls lacquered in olive green, he gave curious concerts where frenzied gypsies drew wild music from tiny zithers, or serious Tunisians dressed in yellow plucked the tense strings of monstrous lutes, while smiling black men monotonously beat copper drums and slender turbaned Indians, cross-legged on scarlet mats, played long flutes made of cane or bronze and charmed, or pretended to charm, large cobras and horrible horned vipers. The syncopated rhythms and the strident dissonances of those barbaric musics moved him at times when the charm of Schubert, the beautiful sorrows of Chopin, and even the majestic harmonies of Beethoven himself failed to make an impression on his ear. He gathered, from all parts of the world, the strangest instruments that can be found, both from the tombs of vanished peoples and among the few savage tribes that have survived contact with Western civilizations, and he enjoyed playing and testing them. He possessed the mysterious juruparis of the Indians of the Rio Negro, instruments that women are not allowed to look at and that even young men can only see after undergoing fasting and self-mortification; the clay vessels of the Peruvians from which they extract sharp bird-like cries, and flutes made from human bones, like those Alfonso de Ovalle [5] heard in Chile, and the sonorous green jaspers found near Cuzco that produce notes of singular sweetness. Dorian Gray possessed painted gourds, filled with pebbles, that resonated when shaken; the long clarion of the Mexicans, in which the player does not blow but inhales air through it; the crude ture of the Amazonian tribes, sounded by sentinels who remain all day in tall trees and can be heard, it is said, from a distance of three leagues; the teponaztli, made of two vibrating wooden slabs, struck with sticks covered with the elastic gum obtained from the milky sap of certain plants; the yotl bells of the Aztecs, hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of large snakes, like the one Bernal Díaz del Castillo saw when he entered the Mexican temple with Cortés, and whose plaintive sound he described so graphically. The fantastic nature of those instruments fascinated him, and the idea that art, like nature, has its monsters, creatures of beastly form and hateful voices, gave him a curious pleasure. However, after some time, he grew tired of them and returned to his box at the opera, either alone or in the company of Lord Henry, to listen to Tannhäuser with deep pleasure, seeing in the prelude of that great work an interpretation of the tragedy of his soul.",36.21,36.07

874,"Then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern nations of Europe. As he investigated the subject—and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up—he was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things. He, at any rate, had escaped that. Summer followed summer, and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame, but he was unchanged. No winter marred his face or stained his flowerlike bloom. How different it was with material things! Where had they passed to? Where was the great crocus-coloured robe, on which the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of Athena? Where the huge velarium that Nero had stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds? He longed to see the curious table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast; the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of Pontus and were figured with “lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters—all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature”; and the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning “Madame, je suis tout joyeux,” the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four pearls. He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with “thirteen hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the king’s arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked in gold.” Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black velvet powdered with crescents and suns. Its curtains were of damask, with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver ground, and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it stood in a room hung with rows of the queen’s devices in cut black velvet upon cloth of silver.

When he studied this subject — and he always had an extraordinary ability to become utterly fascinated with anything he touched — he was almost saddened by the shadow of decay that Time cast upon such marvelous beauties. Nevertheless, he avoided that fate. Summer after summer, the golden immortelle bloomed and withered many times, the dreadful nights endlessly retold their tales of shame, yet he remained unchanged. No winter could harm his face or tarnish his flower-like beauty. How different it was from material things! Where had they gone? Where was the great saffron-yellow cloak, on which gods fought against giants, a work that brown-skinned girls made to please Athena? Where was the enormous canvas that Nero stretched across the Colosseum in Rome, the giant's purple sail depicting a starry sky, with Apollo driving a chariot drawn by white horses with golden reins? He longed to see the strange napkins crafted for the sun priest, upon which every delicacy needed for a feast was displayed; the mourning cloth of King Chilperic, with three hundred golden bees; the bizarre cloaks that incited the wrath of Bishop Pontus, adorned with images of “lions, leopards, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters — everything that an artist could realistically copy from nature;” and the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, with the sleeves embroidered with the verses of a song beginning with “Madame, je suis tout joyeux,” the musical accompaniment sewn in gold thread, and each note, square at that time, made from four pearls.

While examining this subject –he had an extraordinary ability to fully dedicate himself to the subject at hand at the time– he was almost saddened as he thought about the wear and tear of time on beautiful and marvelous things. Fortunately, at least he had been able to stay away from it. Summers followed summers, yellow daffodils bloomed and withered countless times, nights filled with horror repeated their shameful stories, but Dorian never changed. No winter marred his beauty, nor did it wither that fresh bloom. Yet how different was the fate of tangible things! Where were they now? Where was that large, brightly colored shawl, embroidered by dark-skinned girls for the pleasure of Athena, depicting gods fighting giants? Where was that grand awning that Nero had stretched over the entrance of the Colosseum in Rome; that gigantic purple sail depicting Apollo in his chariot drawn by white horses with golden harnesses and the starry skies? Dorian longed to see those unique table napkins once embroidered for the Sun Priest: It was known that they depicted all the rare foods and drinks that could be served at feasts. Then there was King Chilperic's coffin cover embroidered with three hundred golden bees. And those strange robes that depicted lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters... in short, everything a painter could copy from nature, which had drawn the ire of the Bishop of Pontus. And the jacket worn once by King Charles of Orleans, embroidered with the lines of a song that began with ""Madame, je suis tout joyeux."" The melody of the song was embroidered on the cuffs of the jacket, with each note, shown in the square style of the day, marked by four pearls. Dorian had also read the description of the room in the Palace of Rheims prepared for the Burgundian Queen Joan, adorned with thirteen hundred and twenty-one parrots bearing the king's coat of arms on their wings and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies bearing the queen's coat of arms on their wings – all embroidered with gold thread. Catherine de Medicis had a mourning bed made for herself from black velvet sprinkled with crescent moon and sun embroideries. The bed's curtains were made of Damascus fabric with a pattern of wreaths covered with leaves on a gold and silver background, and fringes lined with pearls. The walls of the room where the bed stood were also adorned with rows of the queen's coats of arms made from cut black velvet on silver fabric. XIV. In Louis's room, there were statues of women about seven to eight meters high. The royal bed of the Polish King Sobieski was made of Izmir silver, with verses from the Quran inlaid with turquoise.

It had been seized from the Turkish encampment near Vienna and had once housed the banner of Muhammad under its trembling canopy.",18.353,18.141,"Dorian Gray later became interested in the embroideries and tapestries that served as frescoes in the cold halls of the northern nations of Europe. While researching the subject —and he always had the extraordinary ability to immerse himself completely, when the time came, in the subject he was tackling— it almost saddened him to reflect on the ravages that Time causes in everything that is beautiful and extraordinary. He, at least, had escaped that doom. Summers came and went, the golden daffodils had bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of his infamy, but Dorian remained the same. Winter did not spoil his complexion nor wither the splendor of his youth. How different it was with material things! What had become of them? Where was the great saffron-colored cloak, woven by dark-haired maidens to please Athena, for which the gods had fought against the giants? Where was the immense velarium that Nero had spread over the Roman Colosseum, that titanic purple sail on which the starry sky was depicted, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by white steeds with golden reins? Dorian longed to see the curious napkins made for the Priest of the Sun, on which all the delicacies and viands that could be desired for a feast were depicted; the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; the extravagant tunics that aroused the indignation of the Bishop of Pontus, where ""lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters: everything that, in fact, a painter can copy from nature"" were depicted; and the doublet once worn by Charles of Orleans, on whose sleeves the lyrics of a song that began with ""Madame, je suis tout joyeux"" were embroidered, with the musical accompaniment of the words in gold thread, and each note, square in those times, formed by four pearls. Dorian also learned of the room prepared in the palace of Reims to house Queen Joan of Burgundy, decorated with ""one thousand three hundred and twenty-one parrots adorned with royal arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings similarly bore the queen's arms, all worked in gold.

He possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask, figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the pine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls. The orphreys were divided into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood. This was Italian work of the fifteenth century. Another cope was of green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves, from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals. The morse bore a seraph’s head in gold-thread raised work. The orphreys were woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian. He had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins and fleurs-de-lis; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen; and many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria. In the mystic offices to which such things were put, there was something that quickened his imagination.","You also have a special passion for clerical vestments, and indeed you have everything related to religious matters. In the long cedar chests lined up in the west gallery of your house, you store many beautiful and rare specimens of what truly are the garments for the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and fine linen to hide the pallor of a body emaciated by mortification and worn by the suffering she implores, and wounded by self-inflicted punishment. You possess a magnificent chasuble made of deep red silk and gold-threaded Damascus brocade, decorated with repeating motifs of golden pomegranates set within solemn six-petaled flowers, outside of which, on both sides, are pineapples made of small pearls. The embroidered border of the robe is divided into fabric panels depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, and the coronation of the Virgin Mary is depicted in colored silk on the hood. It is an Italian work from the fifteenth century. The other chasuble is made of green velvet, embroidered with groups of heart-shaped holly leaves, from which long-stemmed white flowers radiate, their details highlighted with silver thread and colored crystals. The clasp bears the embroidered image of a cherub's head in gold thread. The border is woven with red and gold silk diamonds, featuring medallions of various saints and martyrs, among whom is Saint Sebastian. You also have chasubles made of amber silk, blue silk and gold brocade, and yellow Damascus silk with golden fabric, depicting scenes of the Passion and the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ, embroidered lions with peacocks and other symbols; slit albs made of white satin and pink Damascus silk, decorated with tulips with dolphins and fleurs-de-lys; altar frontals of deep red velvet and blue linen; and many corporals, chalice veils, and purificators. In the mystical ceremonies for which such items were used, there was something that stimulated your imagination.",31.003,30.771,"Dorian had a profound curiosity about the vestments of the church, just as he did about everything related to its ceremonies. In the west-facing gallery of his house, he had collected many rare and beautiful examples of the attire worn by the Brides of Christ, stored in long cedar chests. These women, to conceal their pale bodies wasting away due to the sufferings they endured by their own will and the tortures they inflicted upon themselves, were compelled to wear purple silks, expensive linens, and adorn themselves with jewelry. Dorian also possessed a magnificent priest's robe made of Damascus work woven with gold thread and crimson silk, adorned with golden pomegranates among six-petaled flowers, with pineapples embroidered with seed pearls on either side. The belts were divided into segments depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, with her coronation illustrated on the hood. This was an Italian piece from the fifteenth century. There was also a robe made of green velvet, embroidered with acanthus leaves clustered in the shape of hearts; the details of the long-stemmed white flowers emerging from these leaves were embroidered with colored beads and gold thread. On the hood, there was an angel's head filled with gold thread embroidery. The belts were woven from red and gold silk, speckled with medallions of many saints and martyrs (including St. Sebastian). Dorian also had many Catholic priest robes in his possession. These robes, made of amber-colored silk, blue silk and brocade with gold embroidery, yellow silk Damascus work with gold thread, were adorned with scenes depicting the Passion and Crucifixion of Jesus, as well as images of lions and peacocks. At the same time, Dorian had collected white satin bishop's robes decorated with tulip, dolphin, and fleur-de-lys patterns, pink silk Damascus work bishop's robes, red velvet, blue linen altar cloths, towels used in the Holy Communion, chalice covers, and the handkerchiefs said to have wiped Jesus' sweat on his way to the cross. There was something in the mystical purposes these objects served that stirred his imagination.",17.998,17.702,"He also felt a special passion for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed for everything related to the service of the Church.

Dorian owned a sumptuous crimson silk and damask cope with gold thread, in which pomegranates repeated a stylized motif of six-petaled flowers, with the emblem of the pineapple reproduced in fine pearls on either side.

877,"For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times to be almost too great to be borne. Upon the walls of the lonely locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the purple-and-gold pall as a curtain. For weeks he would not go there, would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart, his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence. Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day, until he was driven away. On his return he would sit in front of the picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other times, with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin, and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his own.","Because these treasures, along with everything he had collected in his lovely home, had become the means for him to forget quickly, the ways by which he could escape, for a season, from the fear that he sometimes felt had grown almost unbearably large. On the walls of the lonely, locked room where he had spent most of his childhood, he had hung with his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the true degeneration of his life, and in front of it hung that gold-and-purple coffin cloth as a curtain. In the weeks he did not go in there, he would forget that terrible drawing, and regain a light heart, a marvelous joy, a passionate enthusiasm for a full life. Then, suddenly, one night, he would sneak out of the house again, go down to the dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields and stay there, day after day, until he was driven away. Upon returning, he would sit before the painting again, sometimes hating both it and himself, but at other times, filled with pride in the individualism that was half the fascination of sin, and laugh with secret joy at the distorted shadow bearing the burden that should have been his.",44.97,44.726,"Because all these treasures, or rather everything he had gathered in that magnificent house, were for Dorian Gray a means of oblivion: ways to escape, at least for a while, from the fear that sometimes seemed unbearably great to him.

There were times when he would forget that disgusting, painted object for weeks by not going up to that room. Then he would regain the lightness and joy of his heart and devote himself once again to the joy of mere existence. Then, suddenly, in the middle of the night, he would secretly leave his house and go to the slums around Blue Gate Fields, staying until he was chased away. When he returned home, he would sit in front of the portrait. Sometimes he was filled with disgust towards the portrait and himself. Other times, succumbing to the pride of individuality that constitutes half the allure of sin, he would secretly smile with a sense of hidden satisfaction in front of that grotesque image that actually had to bear the burden he deserved.",20.318,19.873,"Because those treasures and everything he collected in his beautiful mansion were meant to serve as a means of forgetting, they were a way to escape, for a time, the fear that sometimes seemed almost too intense for him to bear.

He would spend weeks without going up, forgetting that dreadful painting, regaining the lightness of spirit, the wonderful joy of living, letting himself be passionately absorbed by existence itself. Then, suddenly, on any given night, he would stealthily leave his house, go down to some of the dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there for several days until he was thrown out. Upon returning home, he would sit in front of the portrait, sometimes hating it and hating himself, but at other times letting himself be dominated by that proud individualism that constitutes much of the fascination of sin, and he would smile, secretly pleased, at the deformed image, condemned to bear the burden that should have fallen upon his shoulders.",32.659,32.364

It was true that it still retained, beneath the vileness and ugliness of the face, a considerable resemblance to the original; but what consequences could be drawn from that?

880,"Yet he was afraid. Sometimes when he was down at his great house in Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not been tampered with and that the picture was still there.

882,"Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice, and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about him. It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him. Women who had wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.","For such deliberate insolence and disdain, he, of course, didn't bother to pay attention, and in the view of most people, his straightforward and generous attitude, his charming boyish smile, and the endless charm of his marvelous youth, which seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a persuasive enough answer to the slanders, as they called them, that continued to spread about him.

On the other hand, it was noticeable that some of those who were most intimate with him started to avoid him after a while.

883,"Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his strange and dangerous charm. His great wealth was a certain element of security. Society—civilized society, at least—is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating. It feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good chef. And, after all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private life. Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold entrées, as Lord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view. For the canons of good society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely essential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us. Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not.

And, after all, we are hardly consoled when told that the person who gave us a lousy dinner, or terrible wine, is blameless in their private life.

884,"Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray’s opinion. He used to wonder at the shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence. To him, man was a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead. He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose blood flowed in his veins. Here was Philip Herbert, described by Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James, as one who was “caressed by the Court for his handsome face, which kept him not long company.” Was it young Herbert’s life that he sometimes led? Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body to body till it had reached his own? Was it some dim sense of that ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause, give utterance, in Basil Hallward’s studio, to the mad prayer that had so changed his life? Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet. What had this man’s legacy been? Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him some inheritance of sin and shame? Were his own actions merely the dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize? Here, from the fading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves. A flower was in her right hand, and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses. On a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple. There were large green rosettes upon her little pointed shoes. He knew her life, and the strange stories that were told about her lovers. Had he something of her temperament in him? These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look curiously at him. What of George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and fantastic patches? How evil he looked! The face was saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain. Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so overladen with rings. He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century, and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars. What of the second Lord Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose! What passions had he bequeathed? The world had looked upon him as infamous. He had led the orgies at Carlton House. The star of the Garter glittered upon his breast. Beside him hung the portrait of his wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black. Her blood, also, stirred within him. How curious it all seemed! And his mother with her Lady Hamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lips—he knew what he had got from her. He had got from her his beauty, and his passion for the beauty of others. She laughed at him in her loose Bacchante dress. There were vine leaves in her hair. The purple spilled from the cup she was holding. The carnations of the painting had withered, but the eyes were still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour. They seemed to follow him wherever he went.","Anyway, that was Dorian Gray's perspective. He often found it strange how shallow the mentality of those who perceived the Self in humans as something simple, enduring, reliable, and inherent to a nature. To him, humans were creatures with countless lives and countless sensations, complex and diverse beings, carrying within them strange legacies of thoughts and passions, and their flesh was infected with grotesque diseases from the deceased. He enjoyed wandering through the desolate, cold galleries in his mansion and gazing at the various portraits of those whose blood ran through his veins. Here was Philip Herbert, described by Francis Osborne in the book ""Memories of the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James,"" as someone ""flattered by the Court for his handsome face, which did not stay with him long. "" Was it Herbert's youthful life that he sometimes experienced? Was there some peculiar disease that kept spreading from body to body until it reached his own? Was it some vague awareness of that fading beauty that made him, quite unexpectedly and almost without reason, utter in Basil Hallward's studio the mad prayer that changed his life so? Here, wearing a red doublet embroidered with gold, a jeweled cloak, gold-edged cuffs, and a ruffled collar, stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with black-and-silver armor piled at his feet. What was this man's legacy? Did Giovanna of Naples' lover pass down to him some inheritance of sin and shame? Were his actions merely dreams that the deceased dared not fulfill? Here, from the faded canvas, Elizabeth Devereux smiled, wearing a veiled hat, a pearl-studded bodice, and slashed pink sleeves. A flower in her right hand, while her left hand clutched an enameled ring bearing the image of white and Damask roses. On the table beside her lay a mandolin and an apple. There were large green rose bows on her small pointed shoes. He knew her life and the strange tales told about her lovers. Did he possess something of her temperament? Those drooping oval eyes seemed to look at him curiously. And what about George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and bizarre fake moles? How vile he looked! His sullen, dark face, and his lustful lips seemed twisted with disdain. The soft ruffled lace cuffs hung down his thin, yellow, ring-laden hands. He was a rake in the style of eighteenth-century Europe and in his youth was a friend of Lord Ferrars. And what about the second Lord Beckenham, a friend of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret wedding with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent posture! What passions did he pass down? People regarded him as a disgrace. He led the orgies at Carlton House. The Garter star sparkled on his chest. Beside him hung the portrait of his wife, a pale woman with thin lips, dressed in black. Her blood also flowed within him. How strange all this seemed! And his mother with Lady Hamilton's face and moist wine-stained lips — he knew what he inherited from her. From her, he inherited beauty and a passion for the beauty of others. She smiled at him in the loose garments of a Bacchus worshiper. There were vine leaves in her hair. Purple spilled from the goblet she held. The carnations in the painting had withered, but the eyes remained wonderfully deep and vibrant. They seemed to follow him wherever he went. George IV, King of England.",38.558,38.461,"More precisely, this was Dorian Gray's view. He was astonished by the shallowness of those who saw the ego in mankind as something simple, permanent, reliable, and singular. In his eyes, a human was a being with countless senses, carrying within them mysterious legacies of thoughts and feelings, hiding the marks of the dreadful diseases of the dead in their very flesh, a complex creature that transformed from form to form. Dorian loved wandering through the bare, cold picture gallery of his country house, looking at the portraits of those whose blood ran in his own veins. There was Philip Herbert. In his book Memoirs on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James, Francis Osborne described him as someone ""favored by the Court for his handsome face but who lost his handsomeness quickly."" Perhaps Dorian occasionally lived the life of this young Herbert. Could a strange, poisonous microbe have passed from body to body and reached his own? Was it a faint memory of that lost beauty that influenced him to make that mad wish, which changed his life so much, while he was idly standing in Basil Hallward's studio, seemingly for no reason? There stood Sir Anthony Sherard, in his embroidered red trousers, jeweled jacket, gilded armor collar and cuffs, with his silver and black crest at his feet. What inheritance had he left behind? Had sin and shame been passed down to Dorian from this man, who was the lover of Giovanna of Naples? Were Dorian's actions merely the unfulfilled dreams of the dead man? Here too, Lady Elizabeth Devereux was smiling from the canvas that had begun to fade, with her brocade hood, pearl-studded bodice, and pink slashed puffed sleeves. In her right hand, she held a flower, and with her left hand, she held a collar enameled with pink and white roses. On a table beside her, there was a mandolin and an apple. Large ribbons were placed on those small, pointed shoes. Dorian knew her life story and the strange rumors about her lovers. Had he inherited some of her traits? Those almond-shaped eyes with heavy lids seemed to gaze at him curiously. And what about George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and absurdly placed beauty patches? How malevolent he looked! His face was devilish, dark, and his sensual lips seemed twisted in disdain. Thin lace ruffles fell over those fleshless, yellow hands, heavily laden with rings. He was an eighteenth-century fop and had been friends with Lord Ferrars in his youth. And what of the second Lord Beckenham, a companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days and a witness to the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How arrogant and handsome he was with his curly chestnut hair and insolent stance! What fiery passions had he passed on to Dorian? Everyone had considered him immoral. He was the ringleader of the orgies at Carlton House. Yet, the star of the Garter shone on his chest. Beside him hung the portrait of his wife, a pale, thin woman dressed in black. Her blood also flowed in Dorian's veins. How interesting all this was! Then, there was his own mother, with a face resembling Lady Hamilton, her lips moist from wine. Dorian knew what he had inherited from her. He had taken her beauty and her passion for the beauty of those around her. His mother smiled at him in the loose gown of a Bacchante. There were vine leaves in her hair. Purple spilled from the goblet she held. The carnations in the painting had withered, but the depth and brightness of the color in the woman's eyes were still extraordinary. Those eyes seemed to follow Dorian wherever he went.",30.418,30.296,"Such was, at least, the opinion of Dorian Gray, who marveled at the superficiality of those psychologists for whom the Self is something simple, permanent, reliable, and unique. For him, man was a being endowed with innumerable lives and sensations, a complex and multiform creature that harbored curious inheritances of thoughts and passions, and whose very flesh was infected by the monstrous ailments of the dead. He enjoyed walking through the cold corridor of his ancestral home where the family portraits were stored, to contemplate the different portraits of those whose blood ran through his veins. There was Philip Herbert, of whom Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James, tells us that he was ""spoiled by the court due to his good looks, although his handsome face did not accompany him for long."" Was the life he led similar to that of young Herbert? Had some strange poisonous germ passed from organism to organism until it finally reached his? Was the confused feeling of that lost grace what had driven him, so suddenly and almost without reason, to utter, in Basil Hallward's studio, the foolish prayer that had changed his life? And there, with his red doublet embroidered in gold, jeweled coat, ruff, and cuffs with golden edges, stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with black and silver armor at his feet. What had Dorian inherited from that man? The lover of Giovanna of Naples, had he bequeathed him some sin, some infamy? Were his actions nothing more than the dreams that the dead had not dared to carry out? There, from the muted-colored canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, with her gauze hood, pearl breastplate, and slashed pink sleeves. A flower in her right hand, and in her left an enameled necklace of white and damasked roses. On a table beside her rested a mandolin and an apple. And large rosettes on her pointed little shoes. Dorian knew of her life, and the strange stories told about her lovers. Was there something of her temperament in him? Her almond-shaped eyes with heavy lids seemed to look at him with curiosity. And what about George Willoughby, with his powdered wig and extravagant beauty spots? How wicked he seemed! The sullen, dark face, and the sensual lips that formed a sneer of disdain. Delicate lace cuffs fell over the long yellowish hands too laden with rings. He had been a dandy of the 18th century, and a friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars. And the second Lord Beckenham, companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest years, and one of the witnesses to his secret marriage to Mrs. Fitzherbert? How proud and handsome, with his chestnut curls and his swashbuckling pose! What passions had he bequeathed him? The world attributed all infamies to him. He had undoubtedly directed the orgies of Carlton House. But on his chest shone the star of the Garter. Next to his could be seen the portrait of his wife, a pale woman dressed in black, with very thin lips. That blood also ran through Dorian's veins. How curious it all seemed! And his mother, with a face like Lady Hamilton and fresh lips, moistened by wine: Dorian knew what he had received from her. She had passed on her beauty to him, and the passion for the beauty of others. She laughed at him with her loose Bacchante dress. There were vine leaves in her hair. The cup she held spilled purple. The carnations in the painting had withered, but the eyes remained marvelous for their depth and the magic of their color. And they seemed to follow him wherever he went.",39.511,39.415
885,"Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one’s own race, nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious. There were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it had been in his brain and in his passions. He felt that he had known them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of subtlety. It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had been his own.","But people have ancestors in literature just as in lineage, perhaps many of these literary ancestors are even closer in type and temperament, and certainly have an influence that we can perceive more perfectly.

He feels that he has known all of them, those terrible and strange characters who have passed through the stage of the world and made sin so marvelous, and evil so full of subtlety. He feels as if, in some mysterious way, their lives have become his own.",35.789,35.291,"On the other hand, just as a person has ancestors from their lineage, they also have ancestors in the literary world who, in terms of type and disposition, are closer to them than the others, and one could more distinctly perceive their influence. Sometimes it seemed to Dorian as if the entirety of human history consisted solely of his own biography: with its situations and actions, not as he lived them, but as his imagination created them for him, as he envisioned them in his mind and passions. It felt as though he had known all those different, formidable individuals who had passed through the world stage; those who made sin so magnificent and evil so mysterious. It was as if their lives in the past – how, it is unknown – were his own life.",14.063,13.024,"But one also has literary ancestors, in addition to those of one's own lineage, many of whom might be closer in constitution and temperament, and with an influence that was much more clearly recognized. There were times when it seemed to Dorian Gray that the entirety of history was nothing more than the story of his own life, not as he had lived it in his actions and details, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it had existed in his mind and passions. He felt as if he had known them all, those strange and terrible figures who had traversed the great theater of the world, making sin something so marvelous and evil something so subtle. It seemed to him that, in some mysterious way, their lives had also been his own.",41.767,41.345
886,"The hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life had himself known this curious fancy. In the seventh chapter he tells how, crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had sat, as Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the flute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables and supped in an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible tædium vitæ, that comes on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear emerald at the red shambles of the circus and then, in a litter of pearl and purple drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried through the Street of Pomegranates to a House of Gold and heard men cry on Nero Caesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon from Carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun.","The main character of the captivating novel had such a strong influence on his life that he had come to know this strange imagination. In chapter seven, he recounts how, wearing a laurel wreath to avoid being struck by lightning, he sat, like Tiberius, in the garden at Capri, reading the infamous book of Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted around, and a flute player mocked the incense swinger; and, like Caligula, feasting with green-robed jockeys in the stables, dining in an ivory trough with a jeweled-browed horse; and, like Domitian, wandering through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking around with weary eyes for the shadow of the dagger that ended his life, sickened by that tedium vitæ1, that terrible ennui that comes to those whom life denies nothing; and peering through a transparent emerald into the blazing slaughterhouse of the Arena2, then, on a pearl and purple litter drawn by silver-hoofed mules, being carried through the streets of Pomegranates to the Golden House, hearing people shout Nero Cæsar as he passed by; and, like Elagabalus, painting his face, diligently spinning among women, bringing the Moon from Carthage, offering her to the Sun in a mystical wedding.",25.176,24.777,"The hero of that marvelous novel, which had so profoundly affected his life, had also harbored the same strange fantasies. According to what he recounted in the seventh chapter, he had sat in a garden on the island of Capri, in the guise of Tiberius, reading the scandalous books of Elephantis, with a wreath on his head to protect against lightning strikes, surrounded by dwarfs, peacocks, and the music of a flutist mocking a priest. As Caligula, he had indulged in debauchery with stable boys in green shirts in the palace's courtyard, and had dined with a jewel-adorned horse from an ivory manger. As Domitian, he had wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, searching with sunken eyes for the shadow of the dagger that would end his life; sick and fallen with that dreadful taedium vitae, the weariness of life that befalls those to whom life has spared nothing, he had watched the bloody chaos in the arena through a transparent emerald he wore over his eye; and as he rode in a mother-of-pearl and purple-colored chariot drawn by silver-shod mules down Pomegranate Street towards the House of God, he had heard the people shout, ""Nero Caesar!"" As Elagabalus, he had painted his face with colorful paints; mingled with women and spun silk; and had brought the Moon from Carthage to marry it mystically with the Sun.",20.669,20.228,"The protagonist himself of the wonderful novel that had so greatly influenced his life had that curious impression. In the seventh chapter, it recounts how, crowned with laurel to avoid being struck by lightning, he had been Tiberius, who read, in a garden in Capri, the scandalous works of the Greek author Elefantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strolled around him, and the flutist imitated the to-and-fro of the censer; he had been Caligula, carousing in the stables with grooms in green livery before dining in an ivory manger next to a horse with a jewel-covered forehead; and Domitian, wandering through a corridor with marble mirrors, searching everywhere with feverish eyes for the reflection of a dagger destined to end his days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible taedium vitae, the common fate of all those to whom life has denied nothing; later, he had also witnessed, through a transparent emerald, the bloody carnages of the Circus only to then, in a litter of pearls and purple, drawn by mules with silver shoes, return, via the street of the Pomegranates, to the Golden House, while, as he passed, the inhabitants of Rome acclaimed Caesar Nero; he had been Heliogabalus, his face painted with colors, working at the distaff among the women, and who brought the Moon from Carthage to give it to the Sun in a mystical marriage.",30.012,29.695
887,"Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made monstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife and painted her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase living men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide riding beside him and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto; Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and minion of Sixtus IV., whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery, and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion for red blood, as other men have for red wine—the son of the Fiend, as was reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the name of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave poison to Ginevra d’Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles VI., who had so wildly adored his brother’s wife that a leper had warned him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his brain had sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen cards painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in his trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his page, and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the yellow piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but weep, and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.","1 Boredom. Latin language. 2 Circus, an arena that predates the Colosseum in Rome. Dorian often read and reread this strange chapter and the two chapters immediately following it, in which, like on some strange tapestries or finely crafted enamel paintings, were depicted the beautiful and majestic forms of those whom Corruption and Blood and Ennui had driven mad or grotesque: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who killed his wife and painted her lips with bright red poison so that her lover could suck death from the deadly thing he kissed; Pietro Barbi, a Venetian, known as Pope Paul II, who sought to claim the title of Formosus out of arrogance, and whose crown, worth two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the cost of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used dogs to hunt living people, and whose assassinated corpse was covered with roses by the harlot who loved him; The Borgias on white horses, with Incest and Fratricide riding beside them, Perotto's blood-stained cloak; Pietro Riario, the Cardinal young Archbishop of Florence, son and subordinate of Sixtus IV, whose beauty was matched only by his depravity, and who hosted Leonora of Aragon in a red and white silk tent, filled with goddesses and centaurs, and gilded a boy so that he could serve at banquets as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy could only be cured by death, who loved red blood as others love red wine — rumored to be the Devil's son, and who deceived his father in a dice game by wagering his soul; Giambattista Cibo, who took the name Innocent to mock, and in whose sluggish veins the blood of three boys was transfused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, lover of Isotta, lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned in Rome as an enemy of God and mankind, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, poisoned Ginevra d'Este with an emerald cup, and in honor of a shameful passion built a pagan temple to worship Jesus; Charles VI, who was so madly in love with his sister-in-law that a leper warned him of the madness coming upon him, and who, when his brain was diseased and strange, could only be soothed by Saracen cards depicting Love and Death and Madness; and, dressed neatly in leather doublet, wearing a jeweled cap with curls like holly leaves, Grifonetto Baglioni, who killed Astorre with his bride and Simonetto with his page, whose beauty was so great that when he lay dead in the golden square of Perugia, even those who hated him could not help but weep, and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him. 1 Cesare Borgia. 2 boys are 10 years old. This event took place in July 1492.",39.222,39.09,"Dorian would read this extraordinary chapter over and over again; and the two chapters that followed it as well. On these pages, the terrifying and beautiful images of famous individuals, driven mad and monstrous by evil passions, violence, and weariness, were depicted as if shown in a strange wall tapestry or an enameled decoration: the Duke of Milan, Filippo, who killed his wife and then painted the lips of her corpse with a red poison so that her lover would receive death from the dead; II. Paul, also known as Formosus due to his pride, a Venetian named Pietro Barbi who obtained his crown, valued at two thousand florins, in exchange for a dreadful sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who hunted humans with hounds, and whose corpse, after being killed, was covered with roses by a prostitute who had loved him; Borgia on his white horse, with Brother's Blood beside him, and Peretto's bloodstain on his cloak; the one whose beauty matched his immorality, who decorated his tent made of white and red silk with water nymphs and centaurs to welcome Leonora of Aragon, and in this feast, dipped a boy in gold to serve as a prize or a substitute for Hylas, VI. Sixtus's son and favorite, the young Archbishop of Florence, Cardinal Pietro Riario; Ezzelin, who could only escape his melancholy by watching death scenes, who was as addicted to red blood as others were to red wine, rumored to be the devil's son and to have used loaded dice while gambling with his father for his soul; Giambattista Cibo, mockingly called ""Innocent,"" who had the blood of three young men injected into his numbed veins by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, lover of Isotta and Lord of Rimini, who strangled Polyssena with a handkerchief and poisoned Ginevra d'Esté with a cup of emerald, who, for a shameful passion, founded a church for idol worship, considered an enemy of both man and God in Rome, and whose images were burned; VI. Charles, who was warned by a leper that he was about to go mad due to his insane love for his brother's wife, and when his mind became diseased and deranged, found solace only in Arabian playing cards illustrated with images of love, death, and madness; Grifonetto Baglioni, who killed Astorre and his wife, Simonetto and his servant, and whose beauty, as he lay dying in the yellow square of Perugia, moved even those who hated him to tears, and who was finally blessed by Atalanta, who had cursed him, with his ornate vest and jeweled cap, and his hair in hyacinth curls.",23.692,23.488,"Dorian read that fantastic chapter over and over again, and the two following ones, which presented, as certain unique tapestries or certain strangely crafted enamels do, the thrilling and splendid forms of those whom Vice and Blood and Boredom turned into monsters or madmen: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who murdered his wife and painted her lips with a scarlet poison so that her lover would sip the destruction of the dead creature he caressed; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known by the name of Paul II[10], who, in his vanity, wanted to claim the title of Fermosus, and whose y tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the price of an abominable sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used bloodhounds to hunt men, and whose body, when murdered, was covered with roses by a courtesan who had loved him; the Borgia on his white steed, and the Fratricide riding beside him, with the cloak stained by Perotto's blood; Pietro Riario, the young cardinal archbishop of Florence, son and favorite of Sixtus IV, whose beauty was only matched by his debauchery, who received Eleanor of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and who covered a young boy with gold leaf to play the role, for the occasion, of Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelino, whose melancholy was only cured by the spectacle of death and who had a passion for blood, as other men have for red wine; son of the Evil One, it was said, who had cheated his infernal father when gambling his soul with dice; Giambattista Cibo, who, mockingly, took the name of Innocent, and into whose lethargic veins a Jewish doctor injected the blood of three youths; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of Isotta and lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned in Rome as an enemy of God and men, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, gave Ginevra poison in an emerald cup, and, wishing to honor a shameful passion, built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles VI, so terribly in love with his brother's wife that a leper warned him of the madness that was approaching and who, when his brain became ill and he began to rave, could only be calmed with Saracen cards, illustrated with images of Love, Death, and Madness; and, with his elegant doublet, jeweled cap, and curls like acanthus leaves, Grifonetto Baglioni, who killed Astorre along with his betrothed, and Simonetto with his page, whose charm was such that, while he lay dying in the yellow square of Perugia, those who had hated him were moved to tears, and whom Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed.",46.273,46.161

There were sins whose allure lay not in their commission but in their recollection: strange victories that flattered one's pride more than they dulled the fire of emotions, giving a surge of pride to the mind that was far greater and more vivid than the pleasure they gave to the senses. However, this event was not one of those sins. It was something that needed to be banished from the mind, numbed with opium. It had to be drowned, or else it could drown the man.",16.284,15.224,"He felt that if he meditated on what had happened to him, he risked falling ill or going mad. There were sins whose fascination lay more in memory than in their actual commission; strange triumphs more gratifying to pride than to passions, and which gave the intellect a livelier feeling of joy, superior to the pleasure that they procure or could ever procure for the senses.

1014,"He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian. His dominant intellectual passion was for science. At Cambridge he had spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had taken a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year. Indeed, he was still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his own in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up prescriptions. He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs. In fact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Gray together—music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to be able to exercise whenever he wished—and, indeed, exercised often without being conscious of it. They had met at Lady Berkshire’s the night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on. For eighteen months their intimacy lasted. Campbell was always either at Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square. To him, as to many others, Dorian Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in life. Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever knew. But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at which Dorian Gray was present. He had changed, too—was strangely melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing music, and would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in which to practise.

His forehead was throbbing with maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his manner as he bent over his hostess’s hand was as easy and graceful as ever. Perhaps one never seems so much at one’s ease as when one has to play a part. Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any tragedy of our age. Those finely shaped fingers could never have clutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on God and goodness.

Indeed, none of those who looked at Dorian Gray that night would have believed that he had experienced a tragedy so dreadful it could rival any tragedy of our age.

Perhaps one is never so natural as when playing a role. Certainly, no one observing Dorian Gray that night could have believed that he had just lived through a tragedy comparable to the most horrible of our time. It was impossible that those delicately chiseled fingers could have wielded a knife with sinful intent or that those smiling lips could have blasphemed and mocked goodness.

It is most fortunate that you were not thought of at the time.

Luckily, you weren't even thought of back then. Besides, our clothes were too ugly, and the windmill too calm, so I never even had a single flirtation with anyone.

1094,"Her guests this evening were rather tedious. The fact was, as she explained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her married daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her, and, to make matters worse, had actually brought her husband with her. “I think it is most unkind of her, my dear,” she whispered. “Of course I go and stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old woman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really wake them up.

It is true that I visit them every summer upon returning from Homburg, but an old woman like me needs fresh air sometimes and, besides, I manage to wake them up.

Oh, Dorian, how happy you are! What a wonderful life you have had! You have drained everything. You have crushed grapes on your palate. Nothing is hidden from you. And it is to you nothing more than music. It hasn't spoiled you. You are still the same.”",52.881,52.789,"“Hmm. It must be an illusion. The things one is a hundred percent sure of are never true. This is the disaster of faith and the lesson taught by romanticism. How serious you are! My dear, don't be so serious. What do you and I have to do with the blind beliefs of our age? No, no, we are people who have given up our belief in the existence of the soul. Play me something. Play me a nocturne, Dorian. And while playing, tell me in a low voice how you have kept your youth. You must know a secret. I am only ten years older than you, yet I am wrinkled, worn out, and faded. You truly seem to be something extraordinary. You remind me of the day I first saw you. Somewhat arrogant, very shy, you were something unseen. You have changed, naturally, but not in appearance. I wish you would tell me your secret. I would do anything to get my youth back: anything except exercise, getting up early, and being a respectable citizen. Oh youth! Is there anything like youth? How ridiculous it is to talk about the ignorance of youth! Nowadays, the only people whose opinions I listen to with respect are those who are considerably younger than me. They seem to have surpassed me. Life has revealed its latest marvel to them. As for the old; I oppose every thought of the old. I do this as a principle. Ask them their opinion about something that happened yesterday: They will tell you the views that were valid in the 1820s, the days when everyone wore long socks, believed in everything, and knew nothing. What you are playing is so beautiful! Did Chopin write this in Majorca? While the sea wept at the foot of his villa, and the salty foam hit the window panes? Wonderful romantic. What a great blessing it is that we still have at least one art form that is not imitative! Don't stop. I want music tonight. It feels as if you are Apollo, and I am Marsyas listening to you. Oh, Dorian, I have such sorrows of my own that even you do not know. The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young. Sometimes I am amazed at my own sincerity. Oh, Dorian, how lucky you are! What a wonderful life you have led! You have lived everything to the fullest. You have tasted the pleasures of the world. There is no secret left in life for you. Yet you have passed through all of this as if listening to music. No bad trace remains on you. You are still what you were.”",38.88,38.746,"—Ah! then it must be an illusion. The things one is completely sure of are never true. That is the fatality of faith and the lesson of romanticism. What a solemn air! Don't get so serious. What do you and I have to do with the superstitions of our time? No; we have renounced believing in the soul. Play a nocturne for me, Dorian, and while you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have managed to keep your youth. You must have some secret. I'm only ten years older than you, but I have wrinkles and I'm worn and yellow. You are truly admirable, Dorian. You have never seemed so charming to me as tonight. You make me remember the day I met you. You were quite impertinent, very shy, and absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of course, but your appearance has not. I would like you to tell me your secret. I would do anything to regain youth, except exercise, get up early, or be respectable... Youth! There is nothing like youth. It is absurd to talk about the ignorance of youth. The only people whose opinions I listen to with respect are those much younger than me. They seem to be ahead of me. Life has revealed its latest wonders to them. As for older people, I always contradict them. I do it on principle. If you ask their opinion about something that happened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions that were current in 1820, when people wore high stockings, believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing. How beautiful is that which you are playing! I wonder if Chopin wrote it in Mallorca, with the sea crying around the villa where he lived, and with drops of salt water hitting the windows. Wonderfully romantic! It is a blessing that we still have a non-imitative art! Don't stop. Tonight I need music. You seem to me like young Apollo, and I am Marsyas, listening to you. I have my own sufferings, Dorian, of which even you are unaware. The tragedy of old age is not being old, but young. Sometimes my own sincerity surprises me. Ah, Dorian, how happy you are! What an exquisite life you have! You have drunk your fill of all pleasures. You have tasted the ripest grapes. Nothing has been hidden from you. And all of it has been nothing more to you than a few musical bars. Nothing has spoiled you. You remain the same.",45.313,45.205

Dorian knew these things. And yet... Was it not possible to repair all this? Was there no hope left for Dorian?",23.058,22.2,"Was it really true that one does not change? He felt a mad desire to regain the spotless purity of his adolescence; his pink and white adolescence, as Lord Henry had once called it. He knew that he was stained, that he had filled his spirit with corruption and fed his imagination with horrors; that he had exerted a harmful influence on others, and that he had experienced, in doing so, an indescribable joy; and that, of all the lives that had crossed paths with his, he had plunged precisely the most beautiful, the most promising ones into dishonor. But, was all that irremediable? Did he have no hope left?",29.885,29.246

1523,"He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and dragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of pain and indignation broke from him. He could see no change, save that in the eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of the hypocrite. The thing was still loathsome—more loathsome, if possible, than before—and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed brighter, and more like blood newly spilled. Then he trembled. Had it been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed? Or the desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking laugh? Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things finer than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these? And why was the red stain larger than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the painted feet, as though the thing had dripped—blood even on the hand that had not held the knife. Confess? Did it mean that he was to confess? To give himself up and be put to death? He laughed. He felt that the idea was monstrous. Besides, even if he did confess, who would believe him? There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere. Everything belonging to him had been destroyed. He himself had burned what had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad. They would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was his duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public atonement. There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well as to heaven. Nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had told his own sin. His sin? He shrugged his shoulders. The death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him. He was thinking of Hetty Merton. For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he was looking at. Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing more in his renunciation than that? There had been something more. At least he thought so. But who could tell? ... No. There had been nothing more. Through vanity he had spared her. In hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness. For curiosity’s sake he had tried the denial of self. He recognized that now.","He quietly stepped in, locked the door behind him, as was his habit, and pulled the purple curtain away from the portrait. A cry of pain and anger escaped his lips. He could not see any change, except that in those eyes there was a cunning look, and on that mouth there was a hypocritical curve. It was still disgusting—more disgusting, if possible, than before—and the red dew staining the hand seemed fresher, more like newly shed blood. At that moment, he shivered.

A cry of anger and pain escaped from his lips. He could see no change. There was only an expression of cunning in the eyes and a line of hypocrisy on the mouth. The portrait was still disgusting – even more disgusting than before – the crimson dew drops that stained his hand looked more vivid than before, resembling freshly spilled blood even more. Dorian began to tremble. Had his pride made him commit the only good deed of his life? Perhaps, as Lord Henry had mockingly hinted, a search for a new excitement. Perhaps the desire to play a role that sometimes makes us perform nobler deeds than we are. Perhaps all of these. Could it be? And the red stain. Why had it expanded? It seemed to have spread over those wrinkled fingers like a vile disease. There was blood on the feet in the picture too, as if it had dripped and oozed between the toes; even the hand that had not held the knife was bloody. A confession perhaps? Was this indicating that he should confess everything? Surrender, go to the gallows? Dorian laughed. That was impossible. Besides, even if he confessed, who would believe his words? There was no trace left of the murdered man. Everything had been disposed of. Dorian himself had burned those downstairs. Everyone would look at him as if he were mad. If he insisted on his words, they would lock him up in an asylum... Gene de suçunu itiraf etmek, ele güne karşı mahcup olmak, cezasını çekmek de boynunun borcuydu.

Dorian omuz silkti. Basil Hallward’ın ölümü pek umurunda değildi aslında. O Hetty Merton’u düşünüyordu, çünkü şu karşısındaki ayna, ruhunun aynası, ona haksızlık etmiyor muydu? Kibir ha? Merak? İkiyüzlülük? Bunlardan öte bir şey yok muydu, Hetty’den vazgeçmesinde? Olmaz olur muydu? Vardı; en azından o olduğunu sanıyordu. Ama kim bilebilirdi?.. Hayır. Başkaca hiçbir şey yoktu! Dorian kibri yüzünden kızı esirgemişti. İkiyüzlü olduğu için iyilik maskesi takmıştı. Merak uğruna fedakârlığı denemişti. Bunları şimdi kabul ediyordu. Now, about that murder...",16.369,16.132,"He entered without making the slightest noise, locking the door again as was his custom, and removed the purple cloth that covered the painting. A cry of pain and indignation escaped his lips. There was no noticeable change, except for a gleam of cunning in the eyes and the sinuous wrinkles of hypocrisy around the mouth. The canvas was as hateful as ever, even more so, if that were possible; and the scarlet dew that stained the hand seemed brighter, more like freshly spilled blood. Dorian Gray then began to tremble. Had vanity alone driven him to carry out his only good deed? Or had it been the desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had suggested with his mocking laugh? Or perhaps the passionate desire to play a role that pushes us to do better things than we are naturally inclined to? Or maybe all of it at once? But why was the red stain larger? It seemed to have spread like a horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the painted feet, as if that thing had dripped..., blood even on the hand that had not wielded the knife. A confession? Did that mean he was going to confess his crime? That he was going to turn himself in to be executed? He laughed. The idea seemed monstrous to him. Besides, even if he confessed, who would believe him? There was no trace anywhere of the murdered painter. All his belongings had been destroyed. He himself had burned the suitcase and coat. The world would simply say he was crazy. They would lock him up in an asylum if he insisted on repeating the same story... However, it was his duty to confess, to publicly endure the shame and expiate the guilt in an equally public manner. There was a God who demanded that humans confess their sins on earth as well as in heaven. Nothing he did would purify him if he didn't confess his sin. His sin? He shrugged. The death of Basil Hallward seemed very insignificant to him. He thought of Hetty Merton. Because that mirror of his soul he was gazing at was an unjust mirror. Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Was there nothing more than that in his renunciation? There had been something more. At least that's what he believed. But how to know...? No. There was nothing more. He had only renounced the girl out of vanity. Hypocrisy had led him to don the mask of goodness. He had practiced self-denial out of curiosity. Now he acknowledged it.",37.747,37.603
