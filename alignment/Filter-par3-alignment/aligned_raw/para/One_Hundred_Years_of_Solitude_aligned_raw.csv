1,"MANY YEARS LATER as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. At that time Macondo was a village of twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point. Every year during the month of March a family of ragged gypsies would set up their tents near the village, and with a great uproar of pipes and kettledrums they would display new inventions. First they brought the magnet. A heavy gypsy with an untamed beard and sparrow hands, who introduced himself as Melquíades, put on a bold public demonstration of what he himself called the eighth wonder of the learned alchemists of Macedonia. He went from house to house dragging two metal ingots and everybody was amazed to see pots, pans, tongs, and braziers tumble down from their places and beams creak from the desperation of nails and screws trying to emerge, and even objects that had been lost for a long time appeared from where they had been searched for most and went dragging along in turbulent confusion behind Melquíades’ magical irons. “Things have a life of their own,” the gypsy proclaimed with a harsh accent. “It’s simply a matter of waking up their souls.” José Arcadio Buendía, whose unbridled imagination always went beyond the genius of nature and even beyond miracles and magic, thought that it would be possible to make use of that useless invention to extract gold from the bowels of the earth. Melquíades, who was an honest man, warned him: “It won’t work for that.” But José Arcadio Buendía at that time did not believe in the honesty of gypsies, so he traded his mule and a pair of goats for the two magnetized ingots. Úrsula Iguarán, his wife, who relied on those animals to increase their poor domestic holdings, was unable to dissuade him. “Very soon well have gold enough and more to pave the floors of the house,” her husband replied. For several months he worked hard to demonstrate the truth of his idea. He explored every inch of the region, even the riverbed, dragging the two iron ingots along and reciting Melquíades’ incantation aloud. The only thing he succeeded in doing was to unearth a suit of fifteenth-century armor which had all of its pieces soldered together with rust and inside of which there was the hollow resonance of an enormous stone-filled gourd. When José Arcadio Buendía and the four men of his expedition managed to take the armor apart, they found inside a calcified skeleton with a copper locket containing a woman’s hair around its neck.","Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.

He went from house to house dragging two metal ingots, and everybody was amazed to see pots, pans, tongs, and braziers tumble down, the boards creak from the nails and screws trying to emerge, and even things that had been lost for a long time appeared from where they had been searched for most. Then, everyone was drawn out into the streets, flocking noisily, following the delightful magic tricks of Menkyađêt. ""Every object has a life,"" the gypsy advertised in a shrill voice, ""the issue is knowing how to awaken its soul."" José Arcadio Buendía, whose imagination often went far beyond the essence of nature and exceeded by far the miracles and mystical tricks, thought that this useless invention could be used to extract gold from the earth. Menkyađêt, being a noble person, warned him in advance: ""This thing cannot be used for that purpose."" But José Arcadio Buendía, not believing in the noble nature of the gypsies at that time, immediately traded a donkey and a pair of goats for two magnets. Úrsula Iguarán, his wife, who had thought of using these livestock to expand their dilapidated house, could not persuade him. ""Oh dear, we will have plenty of gold to build a house, don't worry,"" he retorted. For several months, he worked tirelessly to turn his predictions into reality. He meticulously dug all over the region, even under the riverbed, dragging the two magnets and loudly reciting Menkyađêt's prayer. The only thing he unearthed was a 15th-century suit of armor, covered in rust, inside like a giant pumpkin filled with stones. When José Arcadio Buendía and his four-man excavation team dismantled this armor, they found a human skeleton turned to lime, with a copper reliquary containing a lock of women's hair dangling from its neck.",52.141,52.055,"Colonel Aureliano Buendia, when he stood before the firing squad years later, would remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. At that time, Macondo was a village of twenty mud houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point with one's finger. Every year in March, a ragged band of gypsies would set up their tents outside the village, and with a great uproar of pipes and drums, they would display new inventions. First, they brought the magnet. A hulking gypsy with an untamed beard and sparrow hands, who introduced himself as Melquiades, put on a captivating demonstration with what he proclaimed to be the eighth wonder of the learned alchemists of Macedonia. As he dragged two ingots of metal from door to door, people saw pots and pans, tongs and braziers clattering and rolling from their places, nails and screws desperately trying to jump out of their sockets, causing the beams to creak, and especially the long-lost objects, which had been searched for extensively, tumbling out from their hiding places and rushing pell-mell after Melquiades' magical irons, leaving everyone dumbfounded. The gypsy, in his coarse accent, proclaimed, ""Objects have a life of their own; all it takes is to awaken their souls."" Jose Arcadio Buendia, whose unbridled imagination extended beyond the wonders of nature, the most improbable miracles, and even magic, thought that this useless invention could be used to extract gold from the earth's core. Melquiades, being an honest man, warned him, ""It is useless for that."" Since Jose Arcadio Buendia did not trust the honesty of the gypsies at that time, he traded his mule and a pair of goats for two magnetic ingots. His wife, Ursula Iguaran, who relied on these animals to increase the few pieces of broken-down furniture and goods in the house, tried to dissuade him to no avail. Her husband said nothing but, ""Very soon we will have enough gold to cover the floor of the house and then some,"" and to prove the correctness of his idea, he toiled for months. He scoured the entire region, dragging the two iron ingots behind him and shouting Melquiades' magical words, until he reached the riverbed. In the end, all he found was a fifteenth-century suit of armor, fused together by rust and making a hollow sound like a giant pumpkin filled with stones. When Jose Arcadio Buendia and his four-man exploration team managed to dismantle the armor, a calcified skeleton with a copper medallion around its neck containing a lock of woman's hair emerged from inside.",39.13,39.007,"and María Luisa Elío Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. Macondo was then a village of twenty mud and reed houses built on the bank of a river of clear water that rushed along a bed of polished stones, white and enormous like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and to mention them one had to point at them with a finger. Every year, in the month of March, a family of ragged gypsies would set up their tent near the village, and with a great uproar of flutes and drums they would announce the new inventions. First, they brought the magnet. A burly gypsy, with a wild beard and sparrow-like hands, who introduced himself as Melquíades, made a gruesome public demonstration of what he himself called the eighth wonder of the learned alchemists of Macedonia. He went from house to house dragging two metal ingots, and everyone was terrified to see that the pots, pans, tongs, and braziers fell from their places, and the woodwork creaked from the desperation of the nails and screws trying to unfasten themselves, and even objects long lost appeared where they had been most searched for, and they trailed in a turbulent stampede behind Melquíades' magical irons. ""Things have a life of their own,"" the gypsy proclaimed with a harsh accent, ""it's simply a matter of waking up their souls."" José Arcadio Buendía, whose unbridled imagination always went beyond the ingenuity of nature, and even beyond miracle and magic, thought it was possible to use that useless invention to extract gold from the earth. Melquíades, who was an honest man, warned him: ""It won't work for that."" But José Arcadio Buendía did not believe in the honesty of the gypsies at that time, so he traded his mule and a batch of goats for the two magnetized ingots. Úrsula Iguarán, his wife, who counted on those animals to expand the meager domestic assets, could not dissuade him. ""Very soon we will have so much gold that we can pave the house with it,"" her husband replied. For several months he endeavored to prove the accuracy of his conjectures. He explored the region inch by inch, including the riverbed, dragging the two iron ingots and reciting Melquíades' incantation aloud. The only thing he managed to unearth was a fifteenth-century armor with all its parts soldered together by a crust of rust, whose interior had the hollow resonance of an enormous gourd filled with stones. When José Arcadio Buendía and the four men of his expedition managed to disassemble the armor, they found inside a calcified skeleton that wore a copper locket with a woman's curl around its neck.",54.59,54.503
2,"In March the gypsies returned. This time they brought a telescope and a magnifying glass the size of a drum, which they exhibited as the latest discovery of the Jews of Amsterdam. They placed a gypsy woman at one end of the village and set up the telescope at the entrance to the tent. For the price of five reales, people could look into the telescope and see the gypsy woman an arm’s length away. “Science has eliminated distance,” Melquíades proclaimed. “In a short time, man will be able to see what is happening in any place in the world without leaving his own house.” A burning noonday sun brought out a startling demonstration with the gigantic magnifying glass: they put a pile of dry hay in the middle of the street and set it on fire by concentrating the sun’s rays. José Arcadio Buendía, who had still not been consoled for the failure of big magnets, conceived the idea of using that invention as a weapon of war. Again Melquíades tried to dissuade him, but he finally accepted the two magnetized ingots and three colonial coins in exchange for the magnifying glass. Úrsula wept in consternation. That money was from a chest of gold coins that her father had put together ova an entire life of privation and that she had buried underneath her bed in hopes of a proper occasion to make use of it. José Arcadio Buendía made no at. tempt to console her, completely absorbed in his tactical experiments with the abnegation of a scientist and even at the risk of his own life. In an attempt to show the effects of the glass on enemy troops, he exposed himself to the concentration of the sun’s rays and suffered burns which turned into sores that took a long time to heal. Over the protests of his wife, who was alarmed at such a dangerous invention, at one point he was ready to set the house on fire. He would spend hours on end in his room, calculating the strategic possibilities of his novel weapon until he succeeded in putting together a manual of startling instructional clarity and an irresistible power of conviction. He sent it to the government, accompanied by numerous descriptions of his experiments and several pages of explanatory sketches; by a messenger who crossed the mountains, got lost in measureless swamps, forded stormy rivers, and was on the point of perishing under the lash of despair, plague, and wild beasts until he found a route that joined the one used by the mules that carried the mail. In spite of the fact that a trip to the capital was little less than impossible at that time, José Arcadio Buendía promised to undertake it as soon as the government ordered him to so that he could put on some practical demonstrations of his invention for the military authorities and could train them himself in the complicated art of solar war. For several years he waited for an answer. Finally, tired of waiting, he bemoaned to Melquíades the failure of his project and the gypsy then gave him a convincing proof of his honesty: he gave him back the doubloons in exchange for the magnifying glass, and he left him in addition some Portuguese maps and several instruments of navigation. In his own handwriting he set down a concise synthesis of the studies by Monk Hermann. which he left José Arcadio so that he would be able to make use of the astrolabe, the compass, and the sextant. José Arcadio Buendía spent the long months of the rainy season shut up in a small room that he had built in the rear of the house so that no one would disturb his experiments. Having completely abandoned his domestic obligations, he spent entire nights in the courtyard watching the course of the stars and he almost contracted sunstroke from trying to establish an exact method to ascertain noon. When he became an expert in the use and manipulation of his instruments, he conceived a notion of space that allowed him to navigate across unknown seas, to visit uninhabited territories, and to establish relations with splendid beings without having to leave his study. That was the period in which he acquired the habit of talking to himself, of walking through the house without paying attention to anyone, as Úrsula and the children broke their backs in the garden, growing banana and caladium, cassava and yams, ahuyama roots and eggplants. Suddenly, without warning, his feverish activity was interrupted and was replaced by a kind of fascination. He spent several days as if he were bewitched, softly repeating to himself a string of fearful conjectures without giving credit to his own understanding. Finally, one Tuesday in December, at lunchtime, all at once he released the whole weight of his torment. The children would remember for the rest of their lives the august solemnity with which their father, devastated by his prolonged vigil and by the wrath of his imagination, revealed his discovery to them:","The gypsies returned to the village in March. This time they brought with them a telescope and a magnifying glass with a mirror as large as a drum, which they displayed as if they were the latest discoveries of the Jews in Amsterdam. They had a gypsy girl sit at the entrance of the village and placed the telescope right at the entrance of the tent. After paying five reals, the villagers peered through the telescope and saw the gypsy girl as if she were within arm's reach. ""Science has shortened distances,"" Melquiades advertised: ""Soon, without having to leave one's own house, people will be able to know anything that happens on earth. "" One scorching afternoon, they conducted a terrifying experiment with the giant magnifying glass: they piled a heap of dry grass in the middle of the road and focused the sun's rays through the magnifying glass, causing the entire heap to burst into flames. José Arcadio Buendía, still disheartened by the failure of using magnets to find gold, conceived the idea of using this invention as a weapon. Once again, Melquiades dissuaded him. But then Melquiades had to take back the two magnets and accept three colonial coins in exchange for the magnifying glass from José Arcadio Buendía. Úrsula wept bitterly. That money was part of the gold coins her father had saved throughout his life of poverty and had buried under the bed for emergencies. José Arcadio Buendía, without even intending to comfort his wife, threw himself wholeheartedly into experiments with the passion of a scientist and even ventured into deadly dangers. To demonstrate the magnifying glass's effectiveness against enemies, he stood right in the focal point of the sunlight concentrated by the magnifying glass and got burned, the burns becoming sores that took a long time to heal. He nearly burned down the house because he couldn't bear his wife's scolding, who had warned him of the dangers of this invention. He locked himself in his room for hours, calculating the strategic possibilities of the new weapon until he wrote a clear and persuasive pedagogical guide. He sent it to the authorities, accompanied by personal experience evidence and several explanatory drawings. He entrusted it to a messenger. This man crossed forests, got lost in dreadful swamps, crossed raging rivers, nearly lost his life to wild beasts, despair, and disease before finding the path frequented by the mail carriers' mules. Despite the difficult journey to the capital at that time, José Arcadio Buendía planned to quickly manufacture the weapon if the government ordered a demonstration in front of military officials, and he would personally instruct them in the complex art of solar-powered warfare. For many years, he awaited the government's reply. Finally, tired of waiting, he complained to Melquiades about the failure of his project at its very inception. Thus, the gypsies once again demonstrated their noble nature: they returned his doubloons and took back the magnifying glass, leaving him with several Portuguese maps and some nautical instruments. Melquiades himself wrote a concise summary of Father Hermann's studies and placed it where he could use the telescope, compass, and sextant. During the long, endless rainy months, José Arcadio Buendía isolated himself in the small room at the back of the house so that no one could disturb him during his experiments. By completely abandoning his regular eating and sleeping habits, he spent entire nights in the yard tracking the stars' paths and nearly developed a headache from his desire to devise an accurate method to find the South. Once he mastered the use and control of the instruments, he conceived of a vast space that allowed him to sail on unknown seas, reach uninhabited lands, and befriend illustrious people without leaving his desk. It was during this period that he developed the habit of talking to himself, wandering around the house without noticing anyone while Úrsula and the children weeded the garden, tended to the bananas, taro, cassava, yams, pumpkins, and eggplants. Without any warning, he suddenly ceased all his fervent activities to immerse himself in contemplation. For several days, he seemed bewitched, whispering to himself a series of astonishing hypotheses without trusting his own understanding. Finally, at lunchtime on a Tuesday in December, he released all the tension in his mind. The children would remember forever the solemnity of their father as he sat at the head of the table, trembling with fever, emaciated from prolonged observation and the bitterness of his imagination.",22.082,21.971,"The gypsies came again. This time, they brought a magnifying glass the size of a drum, which they claimed was the latest invention of the Jews from Amsterdam. They placed a gypsy woman at the other end of the village and set up the telescope at the entrance of their tent. Anyone who paid five reals could look through the telescope and see the gypsy woman as if she were just a yard away. Melquiades declared, Science has eliminated distance. Very soon, mankind will be able to see what is happening anywhere in the world without stepping out of their homes. The scorching midday heat showcased the astonishing demonstration of the giant magnifying glass: They piled up dry grass in the middle of the street and focused the sun's rays through the magnifying glass to set it on fire. Still unable to accept the failure of his magnets, Jose Arcadio Buendia decided to use this invention as a weapon of war. Although Melquiades tried to dissuade him again, he eventually accepted two magnetized ingots and three gold coins minted for the colonies in exchange for the magnifying glass. Ursula cried and lamented. The money had been taken from the chest full of gold that her father had saved all his life without eating or drinking, and that Ursula had buried under her bed, saying ""save for a rainy day."" Jose Arcadio Buendia, a scientist so engrossed in his 'tactical' experiments that he would even risk his life, did not attempt to console his wife. While trying to demonstrate the effect of the magnifying glass on enemy troops, he got so severely burned by the sun focused through the magnifying glass that his entire body was covered with unhealing sores. Despite all the objections of his wife, who was terrified of such a dangerous invention, he even tried to set his own house on fire to see if it would catch. Locking himself in his room for hours, calculating the possibilities of his new weapon, he finally produced a handbook whose instructive clarity was beyond question and whose persuasiveness was irresistible. He added a series of descriptions of the experiments he had conducted and a few pages of explanatory illustrations to the book, and sent it to the government with a courier. The courier, who crossed mountains, lost his way in endless swamps, battled raging rivers, and narrowly escaped death from despair, troubles, and wild animals, finally found the path that intersected with the road taken by the mules carrying the mail. Despite the impossibility of traveling to the capital at that time, Jose Arcadio Buendia promised to go to the capital as soon as the government ordered, to present a practical demonstration of his invention to the military authorities, and to teach those intricate war methods that operated with the sun. He waited for years for a response. Finally, tired of waiting, when he complained to Melquiades about the failure of his plan, the gypsy proved his honesty by giving him some Portuguese maps and tools for drawing expedition routes, in addition to the coins he had given in exchange for the magnifying glass. After summarizing and writing by hand Keşiş Hermann's studies on how to use the astrolabe, compass, and sextant, he left them for Jose Arcadio. Jose Arcadio Buendia locked himself in a small room he built at the back of the house so that no one would disturb his experiments during the long rainy season that lasted for months. He completely abandoned his household responsibilities and spent nights observing the orbits of the stars in the garden, almost getting sunstroke in his quest to find an infallible method to determine noon. Once he mastered using and operating his instruments, he developed a new concept of space that allowed him to explore unknown seas and uncharted lands and interact with marvelous beings without leaving his desk. It was during this period that, while Ursula and the children exhausted themselves in the garden growing bananas, caladium, cassava, sweet potatoes, pumpkin roots, and eggplants, Jose Arcadio developed the habit of pacing around the house and talking to himself without looking at anyone. Then this feverish activity suddenly ceased, giving way to a sort of enchantment. For a few days, as if bewitched, he kept repeating a series of assumptions one after another, not even sure if he understood them himself. Finally, on a Tuesday afternoon in December, he revealed the worm that had been eating him up inside. The dignified solemnity of their father, who was worn out from the wrath of his imagination and weeks of sleeplessness, as he explained his discovery, never left the children's minds:",24.236,24.13,"In March, the gypsies returned.

That money was part of a chest of gold coins that her father had accumulated over a lifetime of hardships, and which she had buried under the bed waiting for a good opportunity to invest it. José Arcadio Buendía did not even try to console her, wholly dedicated to his tactical experiments with the devotion of a scientist and even at the risk of his own life. Trying to demonstrate the effects of the magnifying glass on the enemy troops, he exposed himself to the concentration of the sun's rays and suffered burns that turned into ulcers and took a long time to heal. In response to his wife's protests, alarmed by such dangerous inventiveness, he almost set the house on fire. He spent long hours in his room, making calculations about the strategic possibilities of his novel weapon, until he managed to compose a manual of astonishing didactic clarity and irresistible persuasive power. He sent it to the authorities accompanied by numerous testimonies about his experiences and several sheets of explanatory drawings, in the care of a messenger who crossed the mountains, got lost in vast swamps, navigated stormy rivers, and nearly perished under the scourge of wild beasts, despair, and plague, before finding a route to connect with the mail mules.

4,"Úrsula lost her patience. “If you have to go crazy, please go crazy all by yourself!” she shouted. “But don’t try to put your gypsy ideas into the heads of the children.” José Arcadio Buendía, impassive, did not let himself be frightened by the desperation of his wife, who, in a seizure of rage, mashed the astrolabe against the floor. He built another one, he gathered the men of the village in his little room, and he demonstrated to them, with theories that none of them could understand, the possibility of returning to where one had set out by consistently sailing east. The whole village was convinced that José Arcadio Buendía had lost his reason, when Melquíades returned to set things straight. He gave public praise to the intelligence of a man who from pure astronomical speculation had evolved a theory that had already been proved in practice, although unknown in Macondo until then, and as a proof of his admiration he made him a gift that was to have a profound influence on the future of the village: the laboratory of an alchemist.","Mrs. Úrsula couldn't take it anymore. ""If you are crazy, then be crazy by yourself,"" she screamed, ""but please don't fill the children's heads with your wild ideas."" José Arcadio Buendía remained silent, not allowing himself to be intimidated by his wife's outburst, during which she had angrily thrown the telescope to the floor, shattering it. He made another one and gathered the men of the village in the small room, where, using theories incomprehensible to them, he demonstrated the possibility of returning to the starting point if ships kept sailing eastward. The entire village unanimously agreed that José Arcadio Buendía had lost his mind. At that moment, Melquíades returned to sort everything out. He openly praised human intelligence by simply studying astronomy, having developed a theory that had been recognized in practice even though until then no one in the village of Macondo had known about it, and to express his admiration, he gave José Arcadio Buendía an alchemy laboratory, a memento that would have a decisive influence on the future of this village.",17.838,17.284,"Ursula's patience ran out. If you intend to go mad, do it on your own! But don't try to fill the children's minds with those gypsy ideas! she shouted. Jose Arcadio Buendia, who did not bat an eye, was not frightened by his wife's unbalanced excessiveness, who, in her rage, smashed the astrolabe to the ground. He made a new astrolabe and gathered all the men of the village in his room, proving with theories that none of them could grasp that a boat constantly steering could return to the point where it first set out to sea. Just when the whole village was convinced that Jose Arcadio Buendia had lost his mind, Melquiades arrived and saved the situation. Although it was not known in Macondo at the time, Melquiades praised Jose Arcadio's superior intellect, who had independently developed a theory that had already been proven in practice by merely contemplating astronomy, in front of everyone and, as a token of his admiration, gave him a gift that would have a profound impact on the village's future: an alchemist's laboratory.",20.062,19.554,"Úrsula lost her patience. “If you are going to go crazy, go crazy by yourself,” she shouted. “But don’t try to instill your gypsy ideas in the children.” José Arcadio Buendía, unperturbed, was not intimidated by his wife’s desperation, who in a fit of rage smashed the astrolabe against the ground. He built another one, gathered the men of the village in the little room, and demonstrated to them, with theories that were incomprehensible to everyone, the possibility of returning to the starting point by always sailing eastward. The entire village was convinced that José Arcadio Buendía had lost his mind, when Melquíades arrived to set things straight. He publicly praised the intelligence of that man who, through pure astronomical speculation, had constructed a theory already proven in practice, although previously unknown in Macondo, and as a token of his admiration, he gave him a gift that would have a decisive influence on the future of the village: an alchemy laboratory.",42.09,41.804
5,"By then Melquíades had aged with surprising rapidity. On his first trips he seemed to be the same age as José Arcadio Buendía. But while the latter had preserved his extraordinary strength, which permitted him to pull down a horse by grabbing its ears, the gypsy seemed to have been worn dowse by some tenacious illness. It was, in reality, the result of multiple and rare diseases contracted on his innumerable trips around the world. According to what he himself said as he spoke to José Arcadio Buendía while helping him set up the laboratory, death followed him everywhere, sniffing at the cuffs of his pants, but never deciding to give him the final clutch of its claws. He was a fugitive from all the plagues and catastrophes that had ever lashed mankind. He had survived pellagra in Persia, scurvy in the Malayan archipelago, leprosy in Alexandria, beriberi in Japan, bubonic plague in Madagascar, an earthquake in Sicily, and a disastrous shipwreck in the Strait of Magellan. That prodigious creature, said to possess the keys of Nostradamus, was a gloomy man, enveloped in a sad aura, with an Asiatic look that seemed to know what there was on the other side of things. He wore a large black hat that looked like a raven with widespread wings, and a velvet vest across which the patina of the centuries had skated. But in spite of his immense wisdom and his mysterious breadth, he had a human burden, an earthly condition that kept him involved in the small problems of daily life. He would complain of the ailments of old age, he suffered from the most insignificant economic difficulties, and he had stopped laughing a long time back because scurvy had made his teeth drop out. On that suffocating noontime when the gypsy revealed his secrets, José Arcadio Buendía had the certainty that it was the beginning of a great friendship. The children were startled by his fantastic stories. Aureliano, who could not have been more than five at the time, would remember him for the rest of his life as he saw him that afternoon, sitting against the metallic and quivering light from the window, lighting up with his deep organ voice the darkest reaches of the imagination, while down over his temples there flowed the grease that was being melted by the heat. José Arcadio, his older brother, would pass on that wonderful image as a hereditary memory to all of his descendants. Úrsula on the other hand, held a bad memory of that visit, for she had entered the room just as Melquíades had carelessly broken a flask of bichloride of mercury.","In those days, Melquíades aged so quickly that everyone was astonished. During his initial visits to the village, he was almost the same age as José Arcadio Buendía. But while the latter maintained his robust health, the kind that could bring down a horse by grabbing its ears, the gypsy seemed to have been debilitated by terrible pains. In fact, it was the result of numerous strange diseases he had contracted during his travels around the world. According to his own words as he recounted to José Arcadio Buendía while helping him set up the laboratory, death chased him across the land, sniffing at his trouser legs but never managing to catch him. His life was a continuous escape from countless calamities and misfortunes that had befallen humanity. He survived leprosy in Persia, scurvy in the Malay Archipelago, leprosy in Algeria, dropsy in Japan, the plague on the island of Madagascar, earthquakes in Sicily, and the daily shipwrecks in the e. That magnificent man, who claimed to possess the secrets of Nostradamus, was a melancholic figure, surrounded by a sad sun, with Asian eyes that seemed to have seen the dark side of things. He wore a wide-brimmed black hat that looked like a crow's wing and an overcoat covered with centuries-old green moss. But despite his vast knowledge and mysterious activities, he still had a human quality, a worldly nature, that tied him to the trivial matters of everyday life: he lamented the weariness of old age, the strain of economic hardship, and he had not smiled for a long time because scurvy had taken all his teeth. José Arcadio Buendía understood that the stifling afternoon when Melquíades confided his personal stories would forever last the origin of a great friendship. The children were full of admiration for his legendary stories. Aureliano, at that time not yet five years old, would have to remember for the rest of his life the image of Melquiades that he had seen: he sat letting the blinding white light from the window shine on his face, while sweat streamed down his temples, and with the deep resonant voice of a grand organ, he illuminated the darkest regions of imagination. José Arcadio, his older brother, would probably pass down that marvelous image to his descendants as a cherished heirloom. In contrast, Úrsula retained a bad memory of that visit, because she entered the room just as Melquiades, in his absent-mindedness, had broken a bottle of mercury.",28.684,28.516,"Meanwhile, Meiquiades had aged at an incredible speed. During his first visits, he appeared to be the same age as Jose Arcadio Buendia. However, while Jose Arcadio maintained his strength to bring down a horse by grabbing its ears, the gypsy seemed to have been ravaged by a relentless ailment. In fact, this decline was the result of a rare assortment of diseases he had contracted during his countless journeys around the world. As he explained to Jose Arcadio Buendia while helping him set up the laboratory, death followed him everywhere, sniffing at the cuffs of his pants, but never quite deciding to strike the final blow. The Gypsy had escaped from all the ailments and all the troubles that had devastated people. He had survived pellagra in Iran, scurvy in the Malay Archipelago, leprosy in Alexandria, beriberi in Japan, plague in Madagascar, an earthquake in Sicily, and a terrible shipwreck in the Strait of Magellan. This hulking creature, said to have deciphered Nostradamus's codes, was a gloomy man with an Asian appearance that suggested he knew the inner workings of everything, and a melancholic air. He wore a huge black hat like a raven with its wings spread, and a velvet vest where centuries-old mold ran rampant. But despite his boundless wisdom and mysterious depth, he had human worries and the troubles of the world that kept him busy with the trivialities of daily life. He complained of the ailments of old age, struggled with the slightest economic difficulties, and had long since stopped smiling because his teeth had fallen out due to scurvy. In that suffocating midday heat, when the Gypsy revealed his secrets, Jose Arcadio Buendia was absolutely convinced that this was the beginning of a deep friendship. The children were left in awe by the incredible tales told by the Gypsy. Aureliano, who was only about five years old at the time, would always remember him as he first saw him, standing with his back to the gray, flickering light coming through the window, speaking in a sonorous voice that illuminated the darkest corners of the imagination, while sweat from the heat trickled down his temples. His brother Jose Arcadio would also pass down that unique image to all his descendants. However, for Ursula, who entered the room just as Melquiades dropped and broke the bottle of mercuric chloride, the memory of that first day was not at all pleasant.",31.893,31.743,"By that time, Melquíades had aged with astonishing rapidity. In his early travels, he seemed to be the same age as José Arcadio Buendía. But while the latter retained his enormous strength, which allowed him to bring down a horse by grabbing it by the ears, the gypsy seemed ravaged by a tenacious ailment. It was, in reality, the result of multiple and rare diseases contracted during his countless journeys around the world. According to what he himself told José Arcadio Buendía while helping him set up the laboratory, death followed him everywhere, sniffing at his pants, but without deciding to give him the final blow. He was a fugitive from all the plagues and catastrophes that had scourged humankind. He survived pellagra in Persia, scurvy in the Malaysian archipelago, leprosy in Alexandria, beriberi in Japan, the bubonic plague in Madagascar, the earthquake in Sicily, and a massive shipwreck in the Strait of Magellan. That prodigious being who claimed to possess the keys of Nostradamus was a gloomy man, wrapped in a sad aura, with an Asiatic gaze that seemed to know the other side of things. He wore a large black hat, like the outspread wings of a crow, and a velvet vest patinated by the verdigris of centuries. But despite his immense wisdom and mysterious aura, he had a human weight, an earthly condition that kept him entangled in the minute problems of everyday life. He complained of old-age ailments, suffered from the most insignificant economic mishaps, and had stopped laughing a long time ago because scurvy had taken his teeth. The stifling midday when he revealed his secrets, José Arcadio Buendía was certain that this was the beginning of a great friendship. The children were astonished by his fantastic tales. Aureliano, who was no more than five years old at the time, would remember him for the rest of his life as he saw him that afternoon, sitting against the metallic and shimmering light of the window, illuminating with his deep organ-like voice the darkest territories of the imagination, while melted grease dripped down his temples from the heat. José Arcadio, his older brother, would pass on that marvelous image, like a hereditary memory, to all his descendants. Úrsula, on the other hand, retained a bad memory of that visit because she entered the room just as Melquíades accidentally broke a bottle of mercuric chloride.",52.565,52.476
6,"“It’s the smell of the devil,” she said.",- Is that the smell of the devil? - she asked.,37.042,31.456,"Ursula said, ""This is the smell of the Devil.""",38.3,32.523,—It's the smell of the devil —she said.,46.231,41.105
7,"“Not at all,” Melquíades corrected her. “It has been proven that the devil has sulphuric properties and this is just a little corrosive sublimate.”","- Absolutely not, - Menkyadet defended. - It has been confirmed that demons have the smell of sulfur, but this one merely has the smell of mercury, ma'am!",6.204,3.177,"Melquiades, Not at all, he retorted. It has long been proven that sulfur characteristics exist in the devil, but this is just a bit of sublimation, that's all.",18.236,14.411,"—Not at all —corrected Melquíades—. It is proven that the devil has sulfuric properties, and this is nothing more than a bit of calomel.",23.054,19.624
8,"Always didactic, he went into a learned exposition of the diabolical properties of cinnabar, but Úrsula paid no attention to him, although she took the children off to pray. That biting odor would stay forever in her mind linked to the memory of Melquíades.","Always with a pedagogical demeanor, he conducted a display on the bizarre properties of cinnabar, but Úrsula paid no attention and instead took the children to pray. That smell of death, closely associated with the memory of Melquíades, would forever remain in her mind.",34.485,32.957,"Then, with the demeanor of a teacher, he began to explain the diabolical characteristics of the cinnabar one by one. Ursula, however, without paying any attention, took the children to pray. From that day on, whenever Melquiades was mentioned, that sharp smell always came to Ursula's mind.",8.71,6.488,"Always didactic, he gave a wise exposition on the diabolical virtues of cinnabar, but Úrsula paid no attention to him and took the children to pray.

9,"The rudimentary laboratory—in addition to a profusion of pots, funnels, retorts, filters, and sieves—was made up of a primitive water pipe, a glass beaker with a long, thin neck, a reproduction of the philosopher’s egg, and a still the gypsies themselves had built in accordance with modern descriptions of the three-armed alembic of Mary the Jew. Along with those items, Melquíades left samples of the seven metals that corresponded to the seven planets, the formulas of Moses and Zosimus for doubling the quantity of gold, and a set of notes and sketches concerning the processes of the Great Teaching that would permit those who could interpret them to undertake the manufacture of the philosopher’s stone. Seduced by the simplicity of the formulas to double the quantity of gold, José Arcadio Buendía paid court to Úrsula for several weeks so that she would let him dig up her colonial coins and increase them by as many times as it was possible to subdivide mercury. Úrsula gave in, as always, to her husband’s unyielding obstinacy. Then José Arcadio Buendía threw three doubloons into a pan and fused them with copper filings, orpiment, brimstone, and lead. He put it all to boil in a pot of castor oil until he got a thick and pestilential syrup which was more like common caramel than valuable gold. In risky and desperate processes of distillation, melted with the seven planetary metals, mixed with hermetic mercury and vitriol of Cyprus, and put back to cook in hog fat for lack of any radish oil, Úrsula’s precious inheritance was reduced to a large piece of burnt hog cracklings that was firmly stuck to the bottom of the pot.","The rudimentary laboratory - not to mention the numerous funnels, test tubes, filters, and sieves - included a basic vessel which was a long, narrow-necked glass flask modeled after the alchemical flask and a distillation pot made by the gypsies according to the modern description of the three-armed distillation pot of Maria the Jewess. Besides these, Melquíades also left behind seven metals symbolizing the seven planets, models of Moses and Zosimos; a fake gold nugget, and a notebook containing instructions and illustrations describing the processes of the great alchemy, which would allow anyone who could interpret them to intend to practice the craft of making the philosopher's stone. Seduced by the seemingly simple method of making fake gold, for several weeks, José Arcadio Buendía persuaded Úrsula to let him dig up their gold coins to multiply them. Faced with her husband's eccentricity, Úrsula had to yield to him as she had always done before. So José Arcadio Buendía poured thirty doubloons into a pan, mixing them with copper powder, sulfur powder, and lead powder. Then he placed them in a deep pan and heated them in a double boiler over the fire until they melted into a thick, syrupy liquid, reeking of a burnt smell, more like burnt candy than precious gold. During the arduous and disappointing distillation process, this alloy along with the seven metals symbolizing the seven planets was soaked in a solution of concentrated mercury and sulfate salts, then they were soaked again in a pan of lard (since there was no turnip oil, lard had to be used) to be heated in a double boiler over the fire. Finally, Úrsula's precious gold, after the elaborate cooking process, turned into something resembling thick porridge, burnt to a crisp, sticking tightly to the bottom of the pan, impossible to scrape off.",14.611,14.216,"The makeshift laboratory consisted of a primitive water pipe with an array of bowls, funnels, alembics, filters, and sieves added to it, a long-necked glass carafe, a portable copy of the alchemist's stone, and a model of a three-armed Jewish Mary alembic made by the gypsies according to contemporary definitions. In addition to these, Melquiades left a series of notes and drawings explaining the processes of the Great Teaching, which would show the seven pieces of metal symbolizing the seven planets, the formulas of Moses and Zosimos for doubling gold, and the ways to make the alchemist's stone. Convinced by the simplicity of the formulas for doubling gold, Jose Arcadio Buendia did not leave Ursula alone for weeks, so that she would extract the colonial gold and he could multiply the gold as if he were dividing and multiplying mercury. As always, Ursula gave in to her husband's stubbornness. Jose Arcadio Buendia put three colonial gold pieces into a pan, mixed them with copper shavings, yellow arsenic, sulfur, and lead, then threw them into a pot full of castor oil and boiled them until they turned into a thick and sticky paste that resembled wax more than gold. After being melted with metals symbolizing the seven planets through dangerous and desperate distillation processes, Ursula's precious paternal inheritance was mixed with alchemical mercury and Cyprus vitriol, and when cooked with lard in the absence of turnip oil, a large piece of burnt lard stuck to the bottom of the pot remained.",20.027,19.678,"The rudimentary laboratory—aside from a profusion of pots, funnels, retorts, filters, and strainers—was composed of a primitive athanor; a long-necked, narrow glass test tube, an imitation of the philosophical egg, and a distiller built by the gypsies themselves according to modern descriptions of Maria the Jewess's three-armed alembic. In addition to these things, Melquíades left samples of the seven metals corresponding to the seven planets, the formulas of Moses and Zosimos for the doubling of gold, and a series of notes and drawings on the processes of the Great Work, which allowed anyone who knew how to interpret them to attempt the manufacture of the philosopher's stone. Seduced by the simplicity of the formulas for doubling gold, José Arcadio Buendía courted Úrsula for several weeks, so that she would allow him to unearth her colonial coins and multiply them as many times as it was possible to subdivide the mercury. Úrsula yielded, as she always did, to her husband's unyielding obstinacy. Then José Arcadio Buendía threw thirty doubloons into a pot and melted them with copper shavings, orpiment, sulfur, and lead. He set everything to boil over a high flame in a castor oil cauldron until he obtained a thick, foul-smelling syrup more akin to common caramel than to magnificent gold. In hazardous and desperate distillation processes, melted with the seven planetary metals, worked with hermetic mercury and Cypriot vitriol, and cooked again in lard for lack of radish oil, Úrsula's precious inheritance was reduced to a charred chicharrón that could not be removed from the bottom of the cauldron.",37.85,37.628
10,"When the gypsies came back, Úrsula had turned the whole population of the village against them. But curiosity was greater than fear, for that time the gypsies went about the town making a deafening noise with all manner of musical instruments while a hawker announced the exhibition of the most fabulous discovery of the Naciancenes. So that everyone went to the tent and by paying one cent they saw a youthful Melquíades, recovered, unwrinkled, with a new and flashing set of teeth. Those who remembered his gums that had been destroyed by scurvy, his flaccid cheeks, and his withered lips trembled with fear at the final proof of the gypsy’s supernatural power. The fear turned into panic when Melquíades took out his teeth, intact, encased in their gums, and showed them to the audience for an instant—a fleeting instant in which he went back to being the same decrepit man of years past—and put them back again and smiled once more with the full control of his restored youth. Even José Arcadio Buendía himself considered that Melquíades’ knowledge had reached unbearable extremes, but he felt a healthy excitement when the gypsy explained to him atone the workings of his false teeth. It seemed so simple and so prodigious at the same time that overnight he lost all interest in his experiments in alchemy. He underwent a new crisis of bad humor. He did not go back to eating regularly, and he would spend the day walking through the house. “Incredible things are happening in the world,” he said to Úrsula. “Right there across the river there are all kinds of magical instruments while we keep on living like donkeys.” Those who had known him since the foundation of Macondo were startled at how much he had changed under Melquíades’ influence.","When the gypsies returned to this village, Úrsula tried to prevent the villagers from going to see them. But curiosity always overcomes fear, because that day, the gypsies ran all over the village blowing horns and beating drums noisily, while the announcer proclaimed that they would display the most marvelous achievement of the Nacians. So the whole village flocked to the gypsies' tent. Paying a penny at the entrance, they saw a young, healthy Melquiades, with smooth skin and a new set of gleaming white teeth. Those who remembered his scurvy-ridden gums, sunken cheeks, and dark lips were astonished by the convincing experiment demonstrating the extraordinary abilities of the gypsies. The people transitioned from amazement to fear when they saw Melquiades remove his teeth, perfectly new, set in two gums, and show them to everyone for a moment—in that fleeting moment, Melquiades reverted to the decrepit old man he had been in previous years—then he reinserted them into his gums and smiled with all the youthful vigor that had just been restored. Even José Arcadio Buendía had to admit that Melquiades' knowledge had reached unimaginable heights, but then he felt a healthier joy when the gypsies privately explained to him the method of planting false teeth. That made him find it both simple and miraculous, causing him to lose interest in alchemy overnight; he became sullen and irritable again, eating irregularly, and once more spent all day pacing around the house. ""So many incredible things are happening out there,"" he said to Úrsula. ""Across the river, yes, right there, there are all kinds of marvelous machines, while we still live like donkeys."" All those who knew him from the early days of founding Macondo were surprised to see how much he had changed under the influence of Melquíades.",15.685,15.267,"When the Gypsies returned, Ursula had worked on the entire village and turned them against them. But this time, when the Gypsies announced with a cacophony of every imaginable instrument and a town crier that they would be showcasing Naciancenes' legendary invention, curiosity overcame fear. Everyone crowded into the tent, paid a coin, and began to watch Melquiades, who had pulled himself together, with a wrinkle-free face, teeth shining like pearls, fresh as ever. Those who remembered his scurvy-ridden gums, sagging cheeks, and shriveled lips shuddered with fear at this latest proof of the Gypsy's supernatural power. When Melquiades, after briefly removing his complete set of teeth along with his gums and showing them to those present, and then in that brief moment becoming the familiar trembling old man again, put his teeth back in place and smiled with the full vigor of his revived youth, fear turned into panic. Even Jose Arcadio Buendia believed that Melquiades' wisdom had reached unimaginable levels, but when the gypsy explained the true nature of the dentures to him in private, he became overexcited. This matter seemed both so simple and so extraordinary that Jose Arcadio Buendia instantly lost interest in his alchemy experiments. He was again overwhelmed by a sense of suffocation. He wasn't eating properly and was wandering around the house incessantly. There are unimaginable things happening in this world, he said to Ursula. While all sorts of magical tools and equipment are just across the river, here we are, wallowing in our ignorance.

But even the most convinced of his madness abandoned work and families to follow him, when he shouldered his clearing tools, and asked for everyone's help to open a path that would connect Macondo with the great inventions.",51.304,50.954
16,"José Arcadio Buendía was completely ignorant of the geography of the region. He knew that to the east there lay an impenetrable mountain chain and that on the other side of the mountains there was the ardent city of Riohacha, where in times past—according to what he had been told by the first Aureliano Buendía, his grandfather—Sir Francis Drake had gone crocodile hunting with cannons and that he repaired hem and stuffed them with straw to bring to Queen Elizabeth. In his youth, José Arcadio Buendía and his men, with wives and children, animals and all kinds of domestic implements, had crossed the mountains in search of an outlet to the sea, and after twenty-six months they gave up the expedition and founded Macondo, so they would not have to go back. It was, therefore, a route that did not interest him, for it could lead only to the past. To the south lay the swamps, covered with an eternal vegetable scum and the whole vast universe of the great swamp, which, according to what the gypsies said, had no limits. The great swamp in the west mingled with a boundless extension of water where there were soft-skinned cetaceans that had the head and torso of a woman, causing the ruination of sailors with the charm of their extraordinary breasts. The gypsies sailed along that route for six months before they reached the strip of land over which the mules that carried the mail passed. According to José Arcadio Buendía’s calculations, the only possibility of contact with civilization lay along the northern route. So he handed out clearing tools and hunting weapons to the same men who had been with him during the founding of Macondo. He threw his directional instruments and his maps into a knapsack, and he undertook the reckless adventure.","José Arcadio Buendía had no understanding of the geography of this region. He knew that to the east was an impassable mountain range, and on the other side of the mountains was the ancient city of Riohacha, where in times past - according to the stories told by his grandfather, the first Aureliano Buendía - the pirate Francis Drake was very fond of the sport of using cannons to hunt crocodiles, then skinning them, stuffing them with straw, and presenting them to Queen Elizabeth. In his youth, he and his friends brought their wives, children, livestock, and household utensils to cross this mountain range in search of a way to the sea, but after twenty-six arduous months, they had to give up and decided to establish the village of Macondo to avoid returning to their old home. It was a path he disliked because it could only lead him back to the past. To the south were lakes covered with ancient water hyacinths and an immense swampy world that, according to the testimony of the gypsies, had no end. The vast swamp disappeared to the west into a white expanse of water that merged with the sky, where a pod of creatures with soft skin and the heads and necks of women resided. With the enchantment of their enormous breasts, they often caused sailors to lose their lives. The gypsies took six months traveling by boat on this waterway before finally reaching a strip of land where the mailman's donkeys passed through. According to José Arcadio Buendía's calculations, the only possible way to connect with the outside civilization was the northern route. So he distributed carpentry tools and hunting weapons to the same people who had accompanied him on the journey to find and establish the village of Macondo; then he personally packed a compass and maps into his backpack and embarked on this overly bold expedition.",23.601,23.323,"Jose Arcadio Buendia was completely ignorant about the geography of the region.

In his youth, Jose Arcadio Buendia and his men, along with their children, animals, and all sorts of household items, had crossed these mountains to find a way out to the sea, and after twenty-six months, they had founded Macondo to avoid turning back from the expedition. This path did not interest Jose Arcadio Buendia at all, as it would only lead to the past. In the south stretched swamps covered with endless vegetation; according to the gypsies, this vast swamp world had no end. The great swamp to the west merged into the boundless waters where soft-skinned, mammalian sea creatures, whose heads and bodies resembled women, and whose extraordinarily beautiful breasts lured sailors to their doom, roamed freely. The gypsies would sail on these waters for six months until they reached the path where the postal mules passed. According to Jose Arcadio's calculations, the only possibility of establishing a connection with civilization was the road to the north. Once he was convinced of this, he distributed the tools for clearing the way and hunting weapons to the people who had worked shoulder to shoulder with him while founding Macondo.

17,"During the first days they did not come across any appreciable obstacle. They went down along the stony bank of the river to the place where years before they had found the soldier’s armor, and from there they went into the woods along a path between wild orange trees. At the end of the first week they killed and roasted a deer, but they agreed to eat only half of it and salt the rest for the days that lay ahead. With that precaution they tried to postpone the necessity of having to eat macaws, whose blue flesh had a harsh and musky taste. Then, for more than ten days, they did not see the sun again. The ground became soft and damp, like volcanic ash, and the vegetation was thicker and thicker, and the cries of the birds and the uproar of the monkeys became more and more remote, and the world became eternally sad. The men on the expedition felt overwhelmed by their most ancient memories in that paradise of dampness and silence, going back to before original sin, as their boots sank into pools of steaming oil and their machetes destroyed bloody lilies and golden salamanders. For a week, almost without speaking, they went ahead like sleepwalkers through a universe of grief, lighted only by the tenuous reflection of luminous insects, and their lungs were overwhelmed by a suffocating smell of blood. They could not return because the strip that they were opening as they went along would soon close up with a new vegetation that. almost seemed to grow before their eyes. “It’s all right,” José Arcadio Buendía would say. “The main thing is not to lose our bearings.” Always following his compass, he kept on guiding his men toward the invisible north so that they would be able to get out of that enchanted region. It was a thick night, starless, but the darkness was becoming impregnated with a fresh and clear air. Exhausted by the long crossing, they hung up their hammocks and slept deeply for the first time in two weeks. When they woke up, with the sun already high in the sky, they were speechless with fascination. Before them, surrounded by ferns and palm trees, white and powdery in the silent morning light, was an enormous Spanish galleon. Tilted slightly to the starboard, it had hanging from its intact masts the dirty rags of its sails in the midst of its rigging, which was adorned with orchids. The hull, covered with an armor of petrified barnacles and soft moss, was firmly fastened into a surface of stones. The whole structure seemed to occupy its own space, one of solitude and oblivion, protected from the vices of time and the habits of the birds. Inside, where the expeditionaries explored with careful intent, there was nothing but a thick forest of flowers.","In the early days, they did not encounter any significant obstacles. They followed the rocky shore, going upstream until they reached the place where a 15th-century armor had been excavated a few years earlier, and from there they took a path winding through wild orange trees deep into the dense forest. At the end of the first week, they killed and roasted a deer, but they agreed to eat only half of it, salting the rest to preserve it for the coming days. With such careful planning, to sustain the expedition, they ate long-tailed parrots, a greenish meat with a musky crane flavor. After that, for more than ten days, they did not see the sun. The ground beneath their feet became damp and mushy like volcanic ash, and the vegetation grew denser and more treacherous, the sounds of birds and gibbons gradually faded, and the scenery became perpetually monotonous. The members of the expedition felt disheartened as their oldest memories were awakened in this wet and desolate paradise, a paradise even more ancient than the one where mankind committed the original sin, a place submerged in a kind of oily evaporating mud, where machetes had to be swung to cut through the stems of white lilies and golden salamanders. For an entire week, almost no one spoke a word, their chests constricted by the hot, dry air that reeked of blood. They moved like somnambulists through a gloomy world, illuminated only by the flickering glow of fireflies. They could not turn back because the path that had opened up behind their footsteps was soon covered by new vegetation, growing so fast it seemed visible to the eye. ""Don't be afraid,"" José Arcadio Buendía said: ""Above all, don't lose your sense of direction."" Never taking his eyes off the compass, he guided everyone in the group northward, until they reached an interesting piece of land. It was a pitch-dark night, without a single star, but it was a clear night thanks to the fresh and pure air. After the long journey through the forest, everyone was exhausted and quickly set up their hammocks, and for the first time in two weeks, they slept soundly. When they woke up, the sun was already high in the sky. They were all excited. Before them was a gigantic Spanish ship, white and dusty, standing out among the ferns and palm trees in the gentle morning light. It lay tilted to the right side. The torn sails still hung on the intact masts, lying among ropes adorned with laurel wreaths. The hull, covered by a layer of petrified fish scales and green moss, was completely fastened to the rocky ground. The entire structure seemed to occupy its own unique setting, a setting of solitude and oblivion, a setting protected from the ravages of time and birds. Inside the ship, which the explorers had skillfully managed to open, there was nothing but a dense forest of flowers.",24.906,24.739,"In the early days, they did not encounter any significant obstacles. They advanced along the rocky bed of the river to the place where they had found the soldier's armor years ago, then veered into the forest and took a path winding through wild orange trees. At the end of the first week, they shot and roasted a deer, but after eating only half of it, they agreed to salt the rest and save it for the coming days. By taking this precaution, they tried to delay, even if just a little, the necessity of eating the large parrots with bluish flesh that made one's mouth pucker. Then, for more than ten days, they did not see the sun. The ground became soft and mushy like volcanic ash, the plants grew denser and denser, the cries of birds and the clamor of monkeys gradually faded away, and the world was enveloped in endless sorrow. As the members of the exploration party stepped into the steaming pools of oil with their boots, and as their machetes slashed through blood-red lilies and golden salamanders, they were overwhelmed by memories that went back even further than Adam's sin in this damp and silent paradise. For a week, they walked almost without speaking, like sleepwalkers in this gloomy universe illuminated only by the faint glow of fireflies, and their lungs filled with the suffocating smell of blood. As they walked and cleared a path, it would be covered again by new plants that sprang up in the blink of an eye, so they couldn't turn back.

By following the direction of his compass, he was leading his men towards the elusive north to get them out of this enchanted region as soon as possible.

The men, exhausted from the long march, set up their hammocks and for the first time in two weeks, fell into a deep sleep. When they woke up after the sun had risen high, they were struck dumb by the enchanting sight that met their eyes. In the distance, among the ferns and palm trees, stood a large Spanish galleon that looked as if it could turn completely white and disintegrate into dust in the silent morning light. From the perfectly intact masts of the galleon, which was slightly tilted to the starboard side, hung tattered sails adorned with crests featuring orchids in the center. The hull, covered with a shield of petrified barnacles and soft algae, was firmly attached to the rocks. The large vessel seemed to exist within a unique space created by loneliness and neglect, protected from the ravages of time and bird droppings. In the interior section, carefully explored and examined by the scouting party, there was nothing but a dense forest of flowers.",28.605,28.444,"The first days they did not encounter any appreciable obstacles.

18,"The discovery of the galleon, an indication of the proximity of the sea, broke José Arcadio Buendía’s drive. He considered it a trick of his whimsical fate to have searched for the sea without finding it, at the cost of countless sacrifices and suffering, and to have found it all of a sudden without looking for it, as if it lay across his path like an insurmountable object. Many years later Colonel Aureliano Buendía crossed the region again, when it was already a regular mail route, and the only part of the ship he found was its burned-out frame in the midst of a field of poppies. Only then, convinced that the story had not been some product of his father’s imagination, did he wonder how the galleon had been able to get inland to that spot. But José Arcadio Buendía did not concern himself with that when he found the sea after another four days’ journey from the galleon.

Many years later, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had the opportunity to return to this area when it already had a regular postal route, and the only thing he found of that ship was a charred hull lying amidst a field of marigolds. Only then did he realize that the story was merely a product of his father's imagination. He wondered how that ship could have ventured so deep into a location that was right on the mainland. But José Arcadio Buendía did not need to worry so much when, after four days of walking, he encountered the sea about twelve kilometers from the ship.

20,"The idea of a peninsular Macondo prevailed for a long time, inspired by the arbitrary map that José Arcadio Buendía sketched on his return from the expedition. He drew it in rage, evilly, exaggerating the difficulties of communication, as if to punish himself for the absolute lack of sense with which he had chosen the place. “We’ll never get anywhere,” he lamented to Úrsula. “We’re going to rot our lives away here without receiving the benefits of science.” That certainty, mulled over for several months in the small room he used as his laboratory, brought him to the conception of the plan to move Maeondo to a better place. But that time Úrsula had anticipated his feverish designs. With the secret and implacable labor of a small ant she predisposed the women of the village against the flightiness of their husbands, who were already preparing for the move. José Arcadio Buendía did not know at what moment or because of what adverse forces his plan had become enveloped in a web of pretexts, disappointments, and evasions until it turned into nothing but an illusion. Úrsula watched him with innocent attention and even felt some pity for him on the morning when she found him in the back room muttering about his plans for moving as he placed his laboratory pieces in their original boxes. She let him finish. She let him nail up the boxes and put his initials on them with an inked brush, without reproaching him, but knowing now that he knew (because she had heard him say so in his soft monologues) that the men of the village would not back him up in his undertaking.

He did so as if to punish himself for the lack of thorough consideration when choosing this location to establish the village. ""We will never get anywhere,"" he lamented in front of Úrsula. ""We will rot alive here without ever enjoying the benefits that science brings."" This clear thought, simmering for months in the laboratory, led him to conceive a plan to move Macondo to a more suitable location. But this time Úrsula opposed his hasty plans. Through the silent and skillful maneuvering of a diligent woman, she prepared the village women to resist the rashness of their husbands who had begun to prepare for the move. José Arcadio Buendía did not know when or due to what opposing force his plans became entangled in a web of reasons and contradictions, ultimately reducing them to a mere illusion. Ursula watched him attentively, watched him until she felt a pang of compassion. It was the morning she met him in the room at the end of the house. While arranging the laboratory equipment into boxes, he rambled on about his dreams of moving the village. She let him finish. She let him nail the boxes shut and use a twig dipped in ink to write their initials on them without saying a word to him, but she understood that he knew (because she heard him say it in his monologues) that the men in the village would not participate in the relocation plan.

We can't go anywhere from here anymore, he lamented to Ursula. We will waste our lives here without benefiting from the blessings of science. After months of pondering in the small room he used as a laboratory, he came to this decision and became fixated on moving Macondo to a better place.

While Ucsula was sweeping the house, the house that she would now surely spend her whole life in, he sat engrossed watching the children until his eyes filled with tears.",20.224,19.476,"As soon as his wife said ""look,"" Jose Arcadio Buendia looked out the window and saw the children walking barefoot in the sunny garden. It seemed to him as if Ursula had cast a spell and the children had suddenly appeared at that moment. That was when something inside him, something mysterious that tore him away from the present and took him to the unknown recesses of his memories, happened. While Ursula swept the house, now free from the danger of being abandoned for the rest of her life, Jose Arcadio Buendia stood by the window, his eyes fixed on the children. After a while, as he wiped his tearful eyes with the back of his hand, he sighed with a resigned attitude towards his fate.",22.466,21.81,"José Arcadio Buendía took his wife's words literally. He looked through the window and saw the two barefoot children in the sunny garden, and had the impression that only at that moment had they begun to exist, conceived by Úrsula's spell. Something then occurred within him; something mysterious and definitive that uprooted him from his current time and set him adrift in an unexplored region of memories. While Úrsula continued sweeping the house she was now sure she would never leave for the rest of her life, he remained gazing at the children with an absorbed look, until his eyes moistened and he wiped them with the back of his hand, and he exhaled a deep sigh of resignation.",53.246,52.862

29,"José Arcadio, the older of the children, was fourteen. He had a square head, thick hair, and his father’s character. Although he had the same impulse for growth and physical strength, it was early evident that he lacked imagination. He had been conceived and born during the difficult crossing of the mountains, before the founding of Macondo, and his parents gave thanks to heaven when they saw he had no animal features. Aureliano, the first human being to be born in Macondo, would be six years old in March. He was silent and withdrawn. He had wept in his mother’s womb and had been born with his eyes open. As they were cutting the umbilical cord, he moved his head from side to side, taking in the things in the room and examining the faces of the people with a fearless curiosity. Then, indifferent to those who came close to look at him, he kept his attention concentrated on the palm roof, which looked as if it were about to collapse under the tremendous pressure of the rain. Úrsula did not remember the intensity of that look again until one day when little Aureliano, at the age of three, went into the kitchen at the moment she was taking a pot of boiling soup from the stove and putting it on the table. The child, Perplexed, said from the doorway, “It’s going to spill.” The pot was firmly placed in the center of the table, but just as soon as the child made his announcement, it began an unmistakable movement toward the edge, as if impelled by some inner dynamism, and it fell and broke on the floor. Úrsula, alarmed, told her husband about the episode, but he interpreted it as a natural phenomenon. That was the way he always was alien to the existence of his sons, partly because he considered childhood as a period of mental insufficiency, and partly because he was always too absorbed in his fantastic speculations.","José Arcadio, the eldest, was already fourteen years old. He had a square head, coarse hair, and a tendency to follow his own whims just like his father. Although he was large and muscular, it was clear that at this age he had already lost his imagination. He was conceived and born while everyone was struggling to cross the mountains, which was before the founding of Macondo. His parents thanked God when they saw that he had no animal parts on his body. Aureliano, the first to be born in Macondo, would turn six in March. He was a quiet and solitary boy. He had cried in his mother's womb and was born with his eyes wide open. While they were cutting his umbilical cord, he moved his head from side to side to familiarize himself with the objects in the room, and with a fearless curiosity, he examined the faces of the crowd. Afterward, ignoring those who came close to see him, the boy kept staring at the rickety roof that seemed about to collapse under the tremendous pressure of the rain. One day, when Aureliano was just three years old, he walked into the kitchen just as Úrsula was taking a pot of soup off the stove and placing it on the table, and it was on that day that she remembered the weight of that gaze. The boy lingered at the door, saying, ""It's going to spill..."" The pot had been securely placed on the table, but suddenly, just as he had predicted, it began to shake violently and then slid to the edge of the table as if pushed from within, shattering into pieces on the floor. Úrsula, terrified, recounted the story to her husband, but he explained the phenomenon as a natural occurrence. He often did that, always ignoring the presence of his children, partly because he considered childhood to be a stage of ignorance and partly because he was always too absorbed in his futile theories.",32.251,32.032,"Their eldest son, Jose Arcadio, was fourteen. He had a thick head, dense hair, and his temperament was like his father's. Like his father, he was large and strong, but it was evident from his infancy that he did not inherit his father's imagination. He was conceived and born during that arduous journey to cross the mountains before Macondo was founded, and his parents celebrated because he did not resemble the wild animals of the mountains. Aureliano, who held the distinction of being the first person born in Macondo, would turn six in March. He was a quiet, introverted child. He had cried while still in his mother's womb and was born with his eyes wide open. While they were cutting his umbilical cord, he examined the room with fearless curiosity, turning his head from side to side, scrutinizing the faces around him. Then, without paying attention to those who came to see him, he fixed his eyes on the ceiling covered with palm leaves that seemed about to collapse from the rain. When Aureliano was three years old, Ursula did not recall the sharpness of that gaze until the moment he entered the kitchen just as his mother was about to take the boiling soup pot off the stove and place it on the table. The child stood at the door in astonishment and said, The soup will spill. The pot was standing firmly in the middle of the table, but before the child had even finished his sentence, it began to move toward the edge of the table as if driven by an impulse from within and fell to the ground, breaking. Terrified, Ursula told her husband what had happened, but Jose Arcadio Buendia took it in stride. He always did that; to him, their sons might as well not have existed. He did not care about the children, partly because he equated childhood with mental deficiency, and partly because his mind was always preoccupied with his own absurd, fanciful constructions.",21.773,21.47,"José Arcadio, the eldest of the children, had turned fourteen.

30,"But since the afternoon when he called the children in to help him unpack the things in the laboratory, he gave them his best hours. In the small separate room, where the walls were gradually being covered by strange maps and fabulous drawings, he taught them to read and write and do sums, and he spoke to them about the wonders of the world, not only where his learning had extended, but forcing the limits of his imagination to extremes. It was in that way that the boys ended up learning that in the southern extremes of Africa there were men so intelligent and peaceful that their only pastime was to sit and think, and that it was possible to cross the Aegean Sea on foot by jumping from island to island all the way to the port of Salonika. Those hallucinating sessions remained printed on the memories of the boys in such a way that many years later, a second before the regular army officer gave the firing squad the command to fire, Colonel Aureliano Buendía saw once more that warm March afternoon on which his father had interrupted the lesson in physics and stood fascinated, with his hand in the air and his eyes motionless, listening to the distant pipes, drums, and jingles of the gypsies, who were coming to the village once more, announcing the latest and most startling discovery of the sages of Memphis.","But since the morning he called the children to help him unpack the laboratory equipment from the boxes, he had dedicated to them the most precious hours of his time. In the isolated room where the walls were increasingly covered with incomprehensible maps and legendary paintings, he taught them to read, write, do math, and spoke to them about the wonders of the world, not just within the limits of known knowledge but often far beyond his own imagination. This is what the children had just learned: in a far southern land of Africa, there are people so wise and gentle that their only joy is to sit and contemplate; and that one can wade through the Aegean Sea by jumping from one island to another all the way to the port of Salonica. Those fascinating lessons etched themselves into the children's memories, so much so that many years later, a minute before the Royalist army officer ordered the firing squad to shoot, Colonel Aureliano Buendía relived that serene March afternoon, the afternoon his father left a physics lesson unfinished, enthusiastically raising one hand in the air and half-closing his eyes to listen to the distant sounds of trumpets, drums, and the clinking of the gypsies who had come to the village many times, noisily advertising the latest astonishing invention of the wise men from Memphis. These are the new gypsies.",25.705,25.332,"From the day she called the children to help her unpack the laboratory tools from the crates, she dedicated her life to them. In that small back room, which was increasingly filled with strange maps and exaggerated drawings, she taught the children to read and write, to add and subtract, not only to the extent of her knowledge but also by pushing the boundaries of her imagination, she told them about the wonders of the world. This is how the children learned that at the southern tip of Africa, there lived people so wise and serene that they did nothing but sit and think in their spare time, and that it was possible to cross the Aegean Sea on foot by hopping from island to island all the way to the port of Thessaloniki. These mind-bending lessons were so deeply ingrained in the children's memories that, years later, just a second before giving the order to fire to the execution squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia recalled that hot March day, when his father interrupted his physics lesson, raised his hands in the air, stood as if mesmerized without blinking, and listened to the sounds of trumpets, drums, tambourines, and cymbals as the gypsies arrived in the village to announce the latest and most astonishing discovery of the sages of Memphis.",25.113,24.761,"But from the afternoon he called the children to help him unpack the things from the laboratory, he dedicated his best hours to them.

32,"Holding a child by each hand so as not to lose them in the tumult, bumping into acrobats with gold-capped teeth and jugglers with six arms, suffocated by the mingled breath of manure and sandals that the crowd exhaled, José Arcadio Buendía went about everywhere like a madman, looking for Melquíades so that he could reveal to him the infinite secrets of that fabulous nightmare. He asked several gypsies, who did not understand his language. Finally he reached the place where Melquíades used to set up his tent and he found a taciturn Armenian who in Spanish was hawking a syrup to make oneself invisible. He had drunk down a glass of the amber substance in one gulp as José Arcadio Buendía elbowed his way through the absorbed group that was witnessing the spectacle, and was able to ask his question. The gypsy wrapped him in the frightful climate of his look before he turned into a puddle of pestilential and smoking pitch over which the echo of his reply still floated: “Melquíades is dead.” Upset by the news, José Arcadio Buendía stood motionless, trying to rise above his affliction, until the group dispersed, called away by other artifices, and the puddle of the taciturn Armenian evaporated completely. Other gypsies confirmed later on that Melquíades had in fact succumbed to the fever on the beach at Singapore and that his body had been thrown into the deepest part of the Java Sea. The children had no interest in the news. They insisted that their father take them to see the overwhelming novelty of the sages of Memphis that was being advertised at the entrance of a tent that, according to what was said, had belonged to King Solomon. They insisted so much that José Arcadio Buendía paid the thirty reales and led them into the center of the tent, where there was a giant with a hairy torso and a shaved head, with a copper ring in his nose and a heavy iron chain on his ankle, watching over a pirate chest. When it was opened by the giant, the chest gave off a glacial exhalation. Inside there was only an enormous, transparent block with infinite internal needles in which the light of the sunset was broken up into colored stars. Disconcerted, knowing that the children were waiting for an immediate explanation, José Arcadio Buendía ventured a murmur:","Holding each child's hand to prevent them from getting lost in the chaotic crowd, constantly bumping into magicians with gold-plated teeth and puppeteers with six arms, suffocating in the scent of anise oil and mint emanating from the crowd, José Arcadio Buendía searched everywhere for Melquíades to have him explain the unfathomable secrets of that magical restlessness. He walked and walked until he finally reached the place where Melquíades usually pitched his tent, but instead, he encountered a sullen Armenian speaking Spanish, advertising an invisible syrup. The man gulped down a glass of amber-colored liquid while José Arcadio Buendía pushed through the crowd, who were wide-eyed watching the magic tricks, and he reached the spot to inquire about Melquíades. The gypsy looked at him in surprise before disappearing into a pool of thick, hot tar, from which the answer echoed: ""Melquíades is dead."" Horrified by this bad news, José Arcadio Buendía stood frozen, trying to overcome his anguish, until the spectators dispersed, drawn by the calls of other magicians, and the Armenian's pool completely evaporated. Afterwards, other gypsies also confirmed to him that it was indeed true. Melquíades had died of malaria on the sand dunes of Singapore, and his body had been thrown into the deepest waters of the Java Sea. The children paid no attention to this news. They were whining and begging their father to take them to see the new invention by the wise men of Memphis, advertised right at the entrance of the shop, which, according to rumors, belonged to Emperor Solomon. They insisted so much that José Arcadio Buendía had to pay thirty reals to enter and take his children to the middle of the shop, where a giant with a hairy body, a shaved head, a nose ring, and a heavy iron chain around his ankle was guarding a mysterious chest. When the giant opened the lid, a blast of freezing air came out from the chest.

Jose Arcadio Buendia was stunned by the news, unable to collect himself until the crowd dispersed to see other wonders and the tight-lipped Armenian's deposit evaporated. Later, the other gypsies confirmed that Melquiades had died of fever in the port of Singapore and that his body was thrown into the deepest part of the Java Sea. The children paid no attention.

Her Aragonese merchant husband, the father of her two children, spent half of his fortune on medicine and entertainment to free her from this fear.

39,"In that hidden village there was a native-born tobacco planter who had lived there for some time, Don José Arcadio Buendía, with whom Úrsula’s great-great-grandfather established a partnership that was so lucrative that within a few years they made a fortune. Several centuries later the great-great-grandson of the native-born planter married the great-great-granddaughter of the Aragonese. Therefore, every time that Úrsula became exercised over her husband’s mad ideas, she would leap back over three hundred years of fate and curse the day that Sir Francis Drake had attacked Riohacha. It was simply a way. of giving herself some relief, because actually they were joined till death by a bond that was more solid that love: a common prick of conscience. They were cousins. They had grown up together in the old village that both of their ancestors, with their work and their good habits, had transformed into one of the finest towns in the province. Although their marriage was predicted from the time they had come into the world, when they expressed their desire to be married their own relatives tried to stop it. They were afraid that those two healthy products of two races that had interbred over the centuries would suffer the shame of breeding iguanas. There had already been a horrible precedent. An aunt of Úrsula’s, married to an uncle of José Arcadio Buendía, had a son who went through life wearing loose, baggy trousers and who bled to death after having lived forty-two years in the purest state of virginity, for he had been born and had grown up with a cartilaginous tail in the shape of a corkscrew and with a small tuft of hair on the tip. A pig’s tail that was never allowed to be seen by any woman and that cost him his life when a butcher friend did him the favor of chopping it off with his cleaver. José Arcadio Buendía, with the whimsy of his nineteen years, resolved the problem with a single phrase: “I don’t care if I have piglets as long as they can talk.” So they were married amidst a festival of fireworks and a brass band that went on for three days. They would have been happy from then on if Úrsula’s mother had not terrified her with all manner of sinister predictions about their offspring, even to the extreme of advising her to refuse to consummate the marriage. Fearing that her stout and willful husband would rape her while she slept, Úrsula, before going to bed, would put on a rudimentary kind of drawers that her mother had made out of sailcloth and had reinforced with a system of crisscrossed leather straps and that was closed in the front by a thick iron buckle. That was how they lived for several months. During the day he would take care of his fighting cocks and she would do frame embroidery with her mother. At night they would wrestle for several hours in an anguished violence that seemed to be a substitute for the act of love, until popular intuition got a whiff of something irregular and the rumor spread that Úrsula was still a virgin a year after her marriage because her husband was impotent. José Arcadio Buendía was the last one to hear the rumor.","In this quiet village, long ago, there was a European tobacco farmer who was born in America. It was José Arcadio Buendía, who, together with the ancestor Úrsula, established a production enterprise that quickly amassed a large capital. Several centuries later, the grandson of the ancestor married the granddaughter of the ancestor Aragon. Therefore, whenever Úrsula left the house driven by her husband's passionate call, she remembered the coincidences that happened three hundred years ago and cursed the hour when the pirate Francis Drake attacked Riohacha. It was a simple way to relieve her worries, for in reality, they were bound together until death by a bond stronger than love: a shared torment of conscience. Being siblings, they grew up together in an old village that their forebears, through labor and traditional customs, had turned into the finest village in the province. Although their marriage was foreseen as inevitable from the moment they were born, when they expressed their desire to marry, their parents intended to prevent it. The elders feared that these two healthy individuals from families with a century-old close relationship would have to live in shame for giving birth to monstrous children. There was already a dire precedent before them. Úrsula's aunt married José Arcadio Buendía's uncle and gave birth to a child who wore baggy trousers all his life and died of bleeding after living forty-two years as a virgin, because he was born and grew up with a corkscrew-shaped tail with a tuft of hair at the end. It was a pig's tail that he never let any woman see. And he paid with his life when a butcher used a cleaver to chop off the pig's tail. José Arcadio Buendía, with the calmness of an eighteen-year-old, resolved the issue with a brief statement: ""Even if it gives birth to a pig, I don't care, as long as it can talk."" So they got married with a three-day-long celebration with fireworks and music bands. From then on, they would have been so happy if Úrsula's mother hadn't threatened her with all the terrifying deformities of the children she would bear, to the point that she didn't dare consummate the marriage. Fearing that her robust and unruly husband would rape her while she slept, Úrsula wore a pair of trousers made by her mother before going to bed. It was a pair of coarse cloth trousers reinforced with a system of leather straps and secured with a large iron lock. They lived like that for several months. During the day, he tended to his fighting cocks, while she sat embroidering with her mother. At night, she had to resist for hours against her husband's passionate desires, which seemed to be a substitute for physical intimacy, until the villagers sensed something unusual was happening and spread the rumor that Úrsula remained a virgin a year after marriage because her husband was impotent. José Arcadio Buendía was the last to hear the rumor.",22.821,22.661,"In that remote village, the great-great-great-grandfather of Ursula, who partnered with a local tobacco grower named Don Jose Arcadio Buendia, made a great fortune from this profitable business in just a few years. A few centuries later, the great-great-great-grandson of the local tobacco grower married the great-great-great-granddaughter of the Aragonese merchant. That is why, whenever Ursula got fed up with her husband's crazy ideas, she would instantly transcend three centuries of fate and curse the day Sir Francis Drake attacked Riohacha. She did this somewhat to vent her feelings, because until their death, they were bound to each other by a bond stronger than love, a shared sense of guilt. They were cousins. They grew up together in that old village, which had become one of the most beautiful towns in the province thanks to the hard work and customs of their ancestors. Although it was clear they would marry from the moment they were born, their own relatives initially opposed this desire when they expressed their wish to marry. They feared that iguana-like lizards would be born from the healthy children of these two races that had intermarried and mingled for centuries. Ursula's aunt had married an uncle of Jose Arcadio Buendia and gave birth to a boy who, because he was born with a tail that was furry like a tassel, curly like a corkscrew, and cartilaginous, could not loosen his belt for any woman until he was forty-two years old and had to wear loose pants for his entire life. This pig's tail, which no woman was allowed to see, became the man's doom when a butcher friend, as a favor, chopped it off with his cleaver. Jose Arcadio Buendia, with the stubbornness of being nineteen years old, solved the problem in one fell swoop: I don't care if my children are piglets, as long as they know how to speak. Thus, they got married with a wedding that lasted three days and three nights, with fireworks and brass band music. They would have been quite happy if Ursula's mother hadn't scared her daughter by saying she would give birth to children with pig tails, and even advised her not to share her husband's bed. Fearing that her large, uncomprehending husband might violate her in his sleep, Ursula began to wear a primitive chastity belt made of sailcloth, tightened with crisscrossed leather straps, and fastened with a large iron buckle in the front. They lived like this for a few months. During the day, Jose Arcadio Buendia was busy with fighting cocks, while Ursula was working on embroidery beside her mother. At night, instead of making love, they would wrestle fiercely for hours. Over time, the people around them sensed something was amiss, and despite being married for a year, rumors spread that Ursula was still a virgin because her husband was impotent. This rumor eventually reached the ears of Jose Arcadio Buendia.",15.408,15.188,"In the hidden ranchería, a Creole tobacco grower, Don José Arcadio Buendía, had lived for a long time. He had established such a productive partnership with Úrsula's great-grandfather that they made a fortune in just a few years.

It was simply a way to vent, because in truth, they were bound until death by a bond stronger than love: a shared remorse of conscience. They were cousins.

Several friends of José Arcadio Buendía, young men like him, excited, by the adventure, dismantled their houses and packed up, along with their wives and children, to head toward the land that no one had promised them. Before he left, José Arcadio Buendía buried the spear in the courtyard and, one after the other, he cut the throats of his magnificent fighting cocks, trusting that in that way he could give some measure of peace to Prudencio Aguilar. All that Úrsula took along were a trunk with her bridal clothes, a few household utensils, and the small chest with the gold pieces that she had inherited from her father. They did not lay out any definite itinerary. They simply tried to go in a direction opposite to the road to Riohacha so that they would not leave any trace or meet any people they knew. It was an absurd journey. After fourteen months, her stomach corrupted by monkey meat and snake stew, Úrsula gave birth to a son who had all of his features human. She had traveled half of the trip in a hammock that two men carried on their shoulders, because swelling had disfigured her legs and her varicose veins had puffed up like bubbles. Although it was pitiful to see them with their sunken stomachs and languid eyes, the children survived the journey better than their parents, and most of the time it was fun for them. One morning, after almost two years of crossing, they became the first mortals to see the western slopes of the mountain range. From the cloudy summit they saw the immense aquatic expanse of the great swamp as it spread out toward the other side of the world. But they never found the sea. One night, after several months of lost wandering through the swamps, far away now from the last Indians they had met on their way, they camped on the banks of a stony river whose waters were like a torrent of frozen glass. Years later, during the second civil war, Colonel Aureliano Buendía tried to follow that same route in order to take Riohacha by surprise and after six days of traveling he understood that it was madness. Nevertheless, the night on which they camped beside the river, his father’s host had the look of shipwrecked people with no escape, but their number had grown during the crossing and they were all prepared (and they succeeded) to die of old age. José Arcadio Buendía dreamed that night that right there a noisy city with houses having mirror wails rose up. He asked what city it was and they answered him with a name that he had never heard, that had no meaning at all, but that had a supernatural echo in his dream: Macondo. On the following day he convinced his men that they would never find the sea. He ordered them to cut down the trees to make a clearing beside the river, at the coolest spot on the bank, and there they founded the village.","That is the reason they crossed the mountains. A few friends of José Arcadio Buendía, all as young as he was, excited by this adventurous journey, packed their belongings and took them along with their wives and children to a land where no one had promised them anything. Before departing, José Arcadio Buendía buried his spear in the yard and one by one beheaded his magnificent fighting cocks, believing that doing so would somewhat console the spirit of Prudencio Aguilar. The only thing Úrsula took with her was a chest containing her wedding clothes, some food, and a small bag of gold coins left by her father. The group did not follow a specific route. They simply kept moving in the opposite direction of the road to Riohacha to leave no trace and avoid meeting acquaintances. It was a peculiar journey. After traveling for fourteen months, with stomachs aching from monkey meat and snake soup, Úrsula gave birth to a boy with all his parts intact. She gave birth on the road while lying on a hammock carried by two people because her legs were swollen and deformed, with veins bulging like blisters. The children were pitiful with their flat bellies and dark circles under their eyes. Yet they proved to be more resilient than their parents on this arduous journey and even enjoyed it most of the time. One morning, after nearly two years of climbing mountains, they were the first to see the western slope of the mountain range. From the cloud-covered peak, they saw the vast, flat waters of an immense swamp stretching to the other side of the world. But they never found the sea. One night, after months of wandering among the swamps, far from the last place they had encountered Indians on their path, they camped by the bank of a rocky river with water as clear as a strip of frozen crystal. Many years later, Colonel Aureliano Buendía would attempt to follow that path to attack Riohacha, and after six days, he realized it was madness. However, that night by the river, his father's companions were as desperate as drowning men with nothing to cling to, but their numbers had grown during the mountain crossing, and all of them were determined to live (of course, they had found ways) until their hair turned gray and their teeth fell out. That night, José Arcadio Buendía dreamed of a bustling city with houses made of glass walls rising right there. He asked what city it was and was given a name he had never heard before, a name that meant nothing but echoed in his dream: Macondo. The very next day, he convinced his friends that they would never find the sea. He ordered them to clear an area by the river, where it was cooler, and there they established a village.",26.741,26.584,"This is how they embarked on the journey to cross the mountains. A few friends of Jose Arcadio Buendia, who were as young as he was, dismantled their homes and gathered their belongings in the excitement of the adventure. They set out towards lands that no one had promised them, taking their wives and children along. Jose Arcadio Buendia, before setting out, buried his spear in the yard, thinking that perhaps this way he could give Prudencio Aguilar some peace in his grave, and he slaughtered his unique fighting cocks one by one. Ursula took nothing with her except a few pieces of kitchenware from her dowry chest and the small box containing the gold inherited from her father. They had not charted a definite course for themselves. They would walk in the exact opposite direction of the road to Riohacha, simply to leave no trace behind and avoid encountering acquaintances. It was a foolish journey. Fourteen months later, Ursula, whose stomach was ruined by monkey meat and snake stew, gave birth to a boy who looked entirely human. Because her legs were swollen like logs and her varicose veins bulged like fingers due to the pregnancy, she spent half the journey in a hammock carried by two men. The children, who looked pitiful with their sunken bellies and lifeless eyes, still endured the journey better than their parents, seeing it as a kind of game. After nearly two years of trekking through mountains and valleys, one morning they earned the distinction of being the first mortals to see the western slopes of the mountain range. From the cloud-shrouded peak, they saw the vast swamp spreading out like a giant puddle towards the end of the world. But they never found the sea. After losing their way in the swamp and wandering for several months, one night they camped by a pebbly river that flowed like a frozen stream of glass, far from the last Indians they had encountered on the road. Years later, during the second civil war, Colonel Aureliano Buendia tried the same route to raid Riohacha, but after six days of travel, he realized it was madness. Even so, that night when they camped by the river, his father's caravan looked like shipwreck survivors, but instead of dwindling during the journey, they had multiplied and were all determined to stake their claim in the world (and indeed they did). That very night, Jose Arcadio Buendia dreamed of a bustling, noisy city with walls made of mirrors rising up from where they camped. When he asked what this place was called, they told him a name he had never heard before, which had no meaning, but created a supernatural echo in his dream: Macondo. The next day, Jose Arcadio Buendia convinced his men that they would never find the sea. He told them to cut down the trees and clear a spot in the coolest part of the shore, right by the river, and that is where they founded the village.",28.027,27.873,"That was how they embarked on the journey through the mountains. Several friends of José Arcadio Buendía, young like him, excited by the adventure, dismantled their houses and took their wives and children to the land that no one had promised them. Before leaving, José Arcadio Buendía buried the spear in the yard and slaughtered his magnificent fighting cocks one by one, believing that in this way he was giving a bit of peace to Prudencio Aguilar. The only thing Úrsula took was a trunk with her newlywed clothes, a few household items, and the small chest with the gold pieces she inherited from her father. They did not set a defined itinerary. They only tried to travel in the opposite direction to the road to Riohacha to leave no trace and avoid encountering known people. It was an absurd journey. After fourteen months, with their stomachs ravaged by monkey meat and snake broth, Úrsula gave birth to a son with all his human parts. She had made half the journey in a hammock hung from a pole carried on the shoulders of two men, because the swelling had disfigured her legs, and her varicose veins burst like bubbles. Although it was pitiful to see them with their taut bellies and languid eyes, the children endured the journey better than their parents, and most of the time they found it fun. One morning, after almost two years of traveling, they were the first mortals to see the western slope of the mountains. From the cloudy summit, they gazed at the immense watery plain of the great swamp, spreading out to the other side of the world. But they never found the sea. One night, after several months of wandering lost through the swamps, far from the last indigenous people they had encountered on the way, they camped by the bank of a rocky river whose waters seemed like a torrent of frozen glass.

He asked what city that was, and they answered with a name he had never heard, that had no meaning, but that had a supernatural resonance in the dream: Macondo.

54,"José Arcadio Buendía did not succeed in deciphering the dream of houses with mirror walls until the day he discovered ice. Then he thought he understood its deep meaning. He thought that in the near future they would be able to manufacture blocks of ice on a large scale from such a common material as water and with them build the new houses of the village. Macondo would no longer be a burning place, where the hinges and door knockers twisted with the heat, but would be changed into a wintry city. If he did not persevere in his attempts to build an ice factory, it was because at that time he was absolutely enthusiastic over the education of his sons, especially that of Aureliano, who from the first had revealed a strange intuition for alchemy. The laboratory had been dusted off. Reviewing Melquíades’ notes, serene now, without the exaltation of novelty, in prolonged and patient sessions they tried to separate Úrsula’s gold from the debris that was stuck to the bottom of the pot. Young José Arcadio scarcely took part in the process. While his father was involved body and soul with his water pipe, the willful first-born, who had always been too big for his age, had become a monumental adolescent. His voice had changed. An incipient fuzz appeared on his upper lip. One night, as Úrsula went into the room where he was undressing to go to bed, she felt a mingled sense of shame and pity: he was the first man that she had seen naked after her husband, and he was so well-equipped for life that he seemed abnormal. Úrsula, pregnant for the third time, relived her newlywed terror.","Before the day he learned about ice, José Arcadio Buendía still did not understand the meaning of the dream about houses with glass walls. After that day, he thought he had grasped its profound meaning. He believed that in the not-too-distant future, people could mass-produce blocks of ice from the most ordinary material like water and use them to build new houses for the village. At that time, Macondo would no longer be a place so hot that iron hinges and door latches would curl from the heat, and it would become a city where it was winter all year round. If he was not eager to immediately build an ice factory, it was because he was then engrossed in educating his children, especially Aureliano, who had shown a special talent for alchemy from the very beginning. The laboratory was always spotless, without a speck of dust. Now, very calmly, not as excited by the miraculous as by reviewing Melquíades' instructions, he tried to separate Úrsula's gold from the compound that had solidified at the bottom of the pan. Young José Arcadio hardly participated in this work. While his father was fully engrossed in his work with the test tubes, the eldest son, who was naturally inclined to do as he pleased and was mature beyond his years, had grown into a robust young man. His voice had broken. His upper lip was now covered with a fine layer of fuzz. One night, Úrsula walked into the room when he had already undressed to go to bed. She was startled, feeling both embarrassed and compassionate. He was the first man, after her husband, whom she had seen naked, and he was well-prepared for life, which she found unsettling. For the third time, Úrsula was pregnant, and she relived the anxieties of her early married days.",21.386,21.047,"Jose Arcadio Buendia could never interpret the dream of houses with mirror walls until the day he discovered ice. When he saw the ice, he thought he had grasped the deep meaning of the dream. He thought that in the near future, they could produce large blocks of ice from an ordinary substance like water and build the new houses of the village with them. Macondo would no longer be a place like an oven where hinges and door knockers bent from the heat, but would turn into a city as cold as winter. If he did not insist on establishing an ice factory, the only reason was that he had devoted himself to the education of his sons, especially Aureliano, who showed a peculiar talent in alchemy at that time. The laboratory was cleaned and became spotless. Father and son, without getting carried away by a flood of new discoveries, calmly reviewed Melquiades' notes and, with long and patient effort, tried to separate Ursula's gold from the bottom of the pot where it had burned and stuck. Young Jose Arcadio did not participate much in this work. While his father was engrossed in the stills, the stubborn eldest son, who had always looked older than his age, grew into a big, burly young man. His voice changed. He started to grow a mustache. One night, when Ursula entered the room where the boy was undressing, she was overcome with a mixture of shame and pity: He was the first naked man she had seen since her husband, and his equipment was so developed that it almost had an abnormal appearance. Pregnant with her third child, Ursula felt the same terror she had felt on her wedding night.",30.695,30.437,"José Arcadio Buendía did not manage to decipher the dream of the houses with mirror walls until the day he encountered ice. Then he believed he understood its profound meaning. He thought that in the near future, ice blocks could be manufactured on a large scale, from a material as everyday as water, and with them, build the new houses of the village. Macondo would cease to be a scorching place, where hinges and latches twisted from the heat, to become a winter city. If he did not persevere in his attempts to build an ice factory, it was because he was then positively enthusiastic about the education of his children, especially Aureliano, who had revealed from the very beginning a rare alchemical intuition.

The young José Arcadio barely participated in the process. While his father had body and soul only for the athanor, the willful firstborn, who had always been too big for his age, became a monumental adolescent. His voice changed. A faint mustache began to grow. One night Úrsula entered the room as he was undressing to sleep, and experienced a confused feeling of shame and pity: he was the first man she had seen naked, after her husband, and he was so well equipped for life, that it seemed abnormal to her. Úrsula, pregnant for the third time, relived her newlywed terrors.",47.992,47.826
55,"Around that time a merry, foul-mouthed, provocative woman came to the house to help with the chorea, and she knew how to read the future in cards. Úrsula spoke to her about her son. She thought that his disproportionate size was something as unnatural as her cousin’s tail of a pig. The woman let out an expansive laugh that resounded through the house like a spray of broken glass. “Just the opposite,” she said. “He’ll be very lucky.” In order to confirm her prediction she brought her cards to the house a few days later and locked herself up with José Arcadio in a granary off the kitchen. She calmly placed her cards on an old carpenter’s bench. saying anything that came into her head, while the boy waited beside her, more bored than intrigued. Suddenly she reached out her hand and touched him. “Lordy!” she said, sincerely startled, and that was all she could say. José Arcadio felt his bones filling up with foam, a languid fear, and a terrible desire to weep. The woman made no insinuations. But José Arcadio kept looking for her all night long, for the smell of smoke that she had under her armpits and that had got caught under his skin. He wanted to be with her all the time, he wanted her to be his mother, for them never to leave the granary, and for her to say “Lordy!” to him. One day he could not stand it any more and. he went looking for her at her house: He made a formal visit, sitting uncomprehendingly in the living room without saying a word. At that moment he had no desire for her. He found her different, entirely foreign to the image that her smell brought on, as if she were someone else. He drank his coffee and left the house in depression. That night, during the frightful time of lying awake, he desired her again with a brutal anxiety, but he did not want her that time as she had been in the granary but as she had been that afternoon.","At that time, there was a cheerful woman, coarse in manners and speech, who often came to the house. She would help with odd jobs around the house and knew how to read tarot cards. Ursula confided in her about her son. She thought that her son's oversized body was as abnormal as the pig's tail of their cousin. The woman burst into a loud, echoing laugh that resonated throughout the house like a rushing stream of glass. On the contrary, she said, ""Your son will be a happy man, ma'am. "" To affirm her prediction, a few days later she brought a deck of cards to the house, then sneaked alone into the corn storage attached to the kitchen with José Arcadio and shut the door tightly. She calmly placed the deck of cards on the old carpenter's table and began to chatter about trivial matters, while the young man sat next to her, more bored than amused, waiting. Suddenly, she reached out and hugged him tightly. ""Oh, it's wonderful,"" she exclaimed with genuine surprise, and that was the only thing she could say. José Arcadio felt his muscles go limp, terrified, and wanted to scream. The woman did not instruct him on anything. But all that night, José Arcadio kept searching for her in the smoky scent emanating from her armpits, and that smell clung to his skin. He wanted to be with her all the time, wanted her to be his mother. He wanted them, he and her, to never leave the corn storage, wanted her to say ""oh, it's wonderful"" to him, wanted her to hug him again and say ""oh, it's wonderful. "" One day, he couldn't bear it any longer and went to her house to find her. He came to visit the house but didn't feel at ease, sitting in the living room, waiting in silence. In that moment, he didn't crave for her. He found her completely different from the image that her scent evoked; at that moment, she seemed like a thirsty woman. He drank coffee and then bid farewell to the rickety house. That night, in the fear caused by insomnia, he longed for her intensely again, but at that moment he didn't love her like he did in the corn storage, rather it felt as empty as that afternoon.",21.73,21.507,"At that time, a cheerful, coquettish, foul-mouthed woman who also knew how to read fortunes used to come and go as a daily worker. Ursula confided her son's condition to her. She thought that such a disproportionately large tool was as abnormal as her nephew's pig's tail. When the woman heard this, she burst into laughter that scattered in all directions like broken glass. On the contrary, she said, The boy will be lucky. To confirm her prophecy, a few days later she brought the cards and locked herself in the pantry behind the kitchen with Jose Arcadio. She calmly spread the cards on the carpenter's bench, and while the boy stood beside her more out of boredom than curiosity, she said whatever came to her mind. Then suddenly she reached out and touched the boy. She must have been truly astonished, as nothing but ""Oh my God"" came out of her mouth. Jose Arcadio felt his marrow froth and swell. He felt a vague sense of dread and was overcome with the urge to cry his heart out. The woman did not make any insinuations. But Jose Arcadio spent the whole night searching for the woman, for the scent that rose from her armpits and seeped into his own skin. He wanted the woman to always be by his side, to mother him, to never leave the pantry, and for her to always say ""Oh my God."" One day, unable to bear it any longer, he went to the woman's house. He sat in the living room without saying a word, staring blankly, making a formal visit. At that moment, he did not desire the woman at all. He found the woman completely different, as if she were someone else entirely, with no relation to the fantasy created by her scent. Jose Arcadio drank his coffee and left the house in distress. That night, during the terrible hours when he couldn't sleep, he desired the woman again with a wild longing, but this time he wanted her not as she was in the pantry, but as she was that day.",20.195,19.901,"At that time, a cheerful, foul-mouthed, provocative woman who helped with household chores and could read the future in cards used to come to the house.

The woman let out an expansive laugh that echoed through the whole house like a trail of glass. ""On the contrary,"" she said. ""He will be happy."" To confirm her prediction, she brought the cards to the house a few days later and locked herself up with José Arcadio in a grain storage room adjacent to the kitchen.

56,"Days later the woman suddenly called him to her house, where she was alone with her mother, and she had him come into the bedroom with the pretext of showing him a deck of cards. Then she touched him with such freedom that he suffered a delusion after the initial shudder, and he felt more fear than pleasure. She asked him to come and see her that night. He agreed. in order to get away, knowing that he was incapable of going. But that night, in his burning bed, he understood that he had to go we her, even if he were not capable. He got dressed by feel, listening in the dark to his brother’s calm breathing, the dry cough of his father in the next room, the asthma of the hens in the courtyard, the buzz of the mosquitoes, the beating of his heart, and the inordinate bustle of a world that he had not noticed until then, and he went out into the sleeping street. With all his heart he wanted the door to be barred and not just closed as she had promised him. But it was open. He pushed it with the tips of his fingers and the hinges yielded with a mournful and articulate moan that left a frozen echo inside of him. From the moment he entered, sideways and trying not to make a noise, he caught the smell. He was still in the hallway, where the woman’s three brothers had their hammocks in positions that he could not see and that he could not determine in the darkness as he felt his way along the hall to push open the bedroom door and get his bearings there so as not to mistake the bed. He found it. He bumped against the ropes of the hammocks, which were lower than he had suspected, and a man who had been snoring until then turned in his sleep and said in a kind of delusion, “It was Wednesday.” When he pushed open the bedroom door, he could not prevent it from scraping against the uneven floor. Suddenly, in the absolute darkness, he understood with a hopeless nostalgia that he was completely disoriented. Sleeping in the narrow room were the mother, another daughter with her husband and two children, and the woman, who may not have been there. He could have guided himself by the smell if the smell had not been all over the house, so devious and at the same time so definite, as it had always been on his skin. He did not move for a long time, wondering in fright how he had ever got to that abyss of abandonment, when a hand with all its fingers extended and feeling about in the darkness touched his face. He was not surprised, for without knowing, he had been expecting it. Then he gave himself over to that hand, and in a terrible state of exhaustion he let himself be led to a shapeless place where his clothes were taken off and he was heaved about like a sack of potatoes and thrown from one side to the other in a bottomless darkness in which his arms were useless, where it no longer smelled of woman but of ammonia, and where he tried to remember her face and found before him the face of Úrsula, confusedly aware that he was doing something that for a very long time he had wanted to do but that he had imagined could really never be done, not knowing what he was doing because he did not know where his feet were or where his head was, or whose feet or whose head, and feeling that he could no longer resist the glacial rumbling of his kidneys and the air of his intestines, and fear, and the bewildered anxiety to flee and at the same time stay forever in that exasperated silence and that fearful solitude.","A few days later, the woman suddenly called him to her house while she was at home with her mother. She pulled him into the bedroom under the pretext of teaching him to play cards. So she freely embraced him, to the point where he lost all pleasure after the initial ecstasy, and then he felt more fear than enjoyment. She coquettishly demanded that he come to find her that very night. He had already agreed, but as he walked out, he realized that he couldn't go. Yet that night, on the bed burning like hot coals, he understood that he needed to go find her even though he knew it was impossible. He fumbled to put on his clothes, ears straining in the darkness to hear the steady breathing of his younger brother, his father's coughing in the next room, the wheezing of the hens in the yard, the buzzing of mosquitoes, the pounding of his own heart, and the noise of the world that he had never heard before, then he stepped out onto the road that was quietly sleeping. He sincerely hoped that the door had been properly latched and not just left ajar as she had promised him. But the door was still unlatched. He gently pushed the door with his finger, and the hinges creaked, sounding both sad and resonant, sending chills down his spine. Ever since he stepped in, carefully sliding his shoulder to avoid making any noise, he could still sense that smell. He was still in the living room, where his three younger brothers had hung their hammocks in places he couldn't identify even now, and in the darkness, he couldn't determine their positions. So he had to feel his way around, pushing the door to the room and making his way there without mistaking the bed he was supposed to lie on. He searched for it. He stumbled over a hammock rope hung lower than he had expected, and the man who had been snoring until then, still in a dream-like state, said in a clear voice: ""It was the fourth day."" When he pushed the bedroom door, he couldn't avoid tripping over the raised edge of the floor. In the pitch-black darkness, suddenly, with an irresistible longing, he realized that he had completely lost his way. In this cramped room were his mother, his sister, her husband, and her three children sleeping, and also the woman, who perhaps was not waiting for him, had also fallen asleep. Perhaps he would not have followed that scent if it hadn't been so pervasive throughout the house. That woman's scent seemed both illusory and real, as if it was always right on his skin. He stood still like a statue for a long moment, surprised, wondering how he had come to this empty abyss. At that moment, a hand with spread fingers groping in the darkness touched his face. That hand was not surprised, because even though it did not know exactly who he was, it was waiting for him. So he trusted that hand and in a state of terrible exhaustion, he let it drag him to a place that wasn't very comfortable, where it stripped him naked, fondled him like fondling a potato, turned him to the left and then to the right, where he no longer smelled the scent of a woman but only the smell of devil's urine, and where when he tried to recall her face, he instead pictured Mrs. Ucsula's face; then he bewilderedly realized that he was doing something he had long desired but never thought he could actually do, not knowing what it was like because he couldn't tell where his feet were, where his head was, and didn't know whose feet or head they were, and he felt he couldn't endure any longer the sharp pain in his kidneys, the twisting pain in his stomach, he panicked and felt a dizzying desire both to run away and to stay forever in this despairing silence and terrifying loneliness.",20.121,19.962,"Days later, the woman unexpectedly called him to the house where she lived with her mother and took the boy to the bedroom under the pretext of showing him the playing cards. Then she touched the boy so recklessly that after the initial shiver passed, the young man felt disappointed; what he felt was more fear than pleasure. The woman told him to come and see her that night. He, knowing that he had no strength left in his knees, said okay, thinking he should get away as soon as possible. But that night, as he tossed and turned in his bed burning with fever, he realized that even if he couldn't manage it, he still couldn't help but go to the woman. In the dark, listening to his brother's calm breathing, his father's dry cough in the adjacent room, the chickens' clucking in the courtyard, the mosquitoes' buzzing, the pounding of his heart, and the rush of a world he had never noticed before, he dressed by feel and threw himself into the sleeping street. Inwardly, he wished that, as the woman had said, the door would not only be unlocked but also barred with an iron rod. But the door was open. He pushed the door with the tip of his finger, the sad and distinct creak released by the hinges sent icy echoes through the young man's insides. As he tried not to make a sound and slipped sideways to step inside, that smell hit his nose. He was still standing in the hall where the woman's three brothers had set up hammocks and were lying down. In the dark, he couldn't make out the positions of the hammocks, and to avoid mistaking one bed for another, he was feeling his way to the bedroom door. He found the door. But he stumbled over the hammock ropes, which were lower than he had thought, and the man who had been snoring until that moment turned over in his sleep and mumbled, It's Wednesday. Jose Arcadio, while pushing the bedroom door, couldn't prevent it from scraping against the uneven floor. In the pitch darkness, he suddenly realized that he had completely lost his way. In the tiny room lay the woman's mother, sister, sister's husband with their two children, and the woman herself, but perhaps she wasn't in that room. If the scent hadn't permeated every corner of the house, he could have found his way by it, but the woman's scent had, just as it had seeped into his own skin, penetrated every nook and cranny of the house with its full intensity. As Jose Arcadio stood still, pondering how he had found himself in such an empty state and let himself go, a hand feeling the darkness with fingers spread wide touched his face. Jose Arcadio wasn't surprised, because deep down he had been expecting it. He let himself go into that hand and did not object to being dragged to a place whose whereabouts were unknown. Then his clothes were stripped off, and in that bottomless darkness where his arms couldn't reach anything to hold onto, he was tossed from side to side like a sack of potatoes. It didn't smell like a woman here, it smelled like ammonia, and the more he tried to picture the woman's face, Ursula's face loomed before him. He vaguely realized that he was doing something he had wanted to do for a long time but never really thought could be done, yet he didn't know what he was doing, because he couldn't tell where his feet were, where his head was, whose feet and whose head they were, and he could no longer endure the rumbling rising from his kidneys as if glaciers were collapsing, the gas in his intestines, the fear, the maddening silence, and the terrifying loneliness, wanting both to escape and to stay there forever.",24.082,23.938,"Days later, in an unexpected manner, the woman called him to her house, where she was alone with her mother, and made him enter the bedroom under the pretext of showing him a card trick. Then she touched him with such freedom that he felt a disappointment after the initial shiver, and experienced more fear than pleasure. She asked him to come for her that night. He agreed, just to get it over with, knowing he wouldn't be able to go. But that night, in the burning bed, he realized that he had to go for her even if he wasn't capable. He dressed in the dark, hearing in the darkness the calm breathing of his brother, the dry cough of his father in the next room, the asthma of the chickens in the yard, the buzz of the mosquitoes, the thumping of his heart, and the overwhelming noise of the world that he hadn't noticed until then, and went out into the sleeping street. He wholeheartedly wished that the door would be barred, and not just ajar, as she had promised him. But it was open. He pushed it with the tip of his fingers and the hinges let out a mournful and articulated creak that had an icy resonance in his guts. From the moment he entered, sideways and trying not to make noise, he smelled the odor. He was still in the small living room where the woman's three brothers hung their hammocks in positions he didn't know and couldn't determine in the darkness, so he had to cross it by feel, push the bedroom door, and orient himself there in such a way that he wouldn't mistake the bed. He managed it. He stumbled over the hammock ropes, which were lower than he had supposed, and a man who had been snoring until then stirred in his sleep and said with a kind of disappointment: ""It was Wednesday. ""When he pushed the bedroom door, he couldn't prevent it from scraping the uneven floor. Suddenly, in the absolute darkness, he realized with an irremediable nostalgia that he was completely disoriented. In the narrow room slept the mother, another daughter with her husband and two children, and the woman who perhaps wasn't expecting him. He could have guided himself by the smell if the smell hadn't been all over the house, so deceptive and at the same time so defined as it had always been on her skin. He remained motionless for a long time, wondering in astonishment how he had managed to reach that abyss of helplessness, when a hand with all fingers extended, groping in the darkness, touched his face. He wasn't surprised, because without knowing it he had been expecting it. Then he entrusted himself to that hand, and in a terrible state of exhaustion let himself be led to a shapeless place where they took off his clothes and shook him like a sack of potatoes and turned him inside out and upside down, in an unfathomable darkness where his arms were superfluous, where it no longer smelled of woman but of ammonia, and where he tried to remember her face and found himself with Ursula's face, confusedly aware that he was doing something he had long wished could be done, but had never imagined could actually be done, without knowing how he was doing it because he didn't know where the feet and the head were, nor whose feet nor whose head, and feeling that he couldn't resist any longer the glacial murmur of his kidneys and the air in his guts, and the fear, and the bewildered urge to flee and at the same time to stay forever in that exasperated silence and that dreadful solitude.",49.33,49.259

She had been part of the exodus that ended with the founding of Macondo, dragged along by her family in order to separate her from the man who had raped her at fourteen and had continued to love her until she was twenty-two, but who never made up his mind to make the situation public because he was a man apart. He promised to follow her to the ends of the earth, but only later on, when he put his affairs in order, and she had become tired of waiting for him, always identifying him with the tall and short, blond and brunet men that her cards promised from land and sea within three days, three months, or three years. With her waiting she had lost the strength of her thighs, the firmness of her breasts, her habit of tenderness, but she kept the madness of her heart intact. Maddened by that prodigious plaything, José Arcadio followed her path every night through the labyrinth of the room. On a certain occasion he found the door barred, and he knocked several times, knowing that if he had the boldness to knock the first time he would have had to knock until the last, and after an interminable wait she opened the door for him. During the day, lying down to dream, he would secretly enjoy the memories of the night before. But when she came into the house, merry, indifferent, chatty, he did not have to make any effort to hide his tension, because that woman, whose explosive laugh frightened off the doves, had nothing to do with the invisible power that taught him how to breathe from within and control his heartbeats, and that had permitted him to understand why man are afraid of death.

While waiting, she lost the firmness of her thighs, the fullness of her breasts, her graceful charm, but she always kept her heart burning with passion. Fervent in his obsession, every night, José Arcadio sought her warmth by navigating through that maze. Sometimes, when he found the door locked, he knocked several times, knowing that if he dared to knock once, he had to knock until the end, and after persistently waiting, she opened the door for him. During the day, dozing off due to sleepiness, he silently savored the pleasure of the previous night. But when she stepped into the house, cheerful, innocent, and playful, he didn't have to exert himself to hide his fatigue, because the woman with the crisp laughter that had startled the pigeons was so satisfied that she taught him to breathe deeply, to keep his heart from pounding too hard, and allowed him to understand why men fear death so much.

The man promised to follow her to the ends of the earth, but later, after he had settled his affairs. The girl had grown tired of waiting, interpreting every man who appeared in the cards—whether he would come in three days, three months, or three years, whether by land or by sea—as the one who would come for her. Waiting had taken away the firmness of her hips, the perkiness of her breasts, and her affection, but her wild heart remained the same. Jose Arcadio, madly in love with that enormous toy, would dive into the labyrinth of the room after her every night. One time, he found the door bolted and, knowing that once he started he would see it through to the end, he knocked on the door several times.

He would stay awake waiting for him until dawn in the solitary bed that seemed to have a bottom of live coals, and they would keep on talking until it was time to get up, so that both of them soon suffered from the same drowsiness, felt the same lack of interest in alchemy and the wisdom of their father, and they took refuge in solitude. “Those kids are out of their heads,” Úrsula said. “They must have worms.” She prepared a repugnant potion for them made out of mashed wormseed, which they both drank with unforeseen stoicism, and they sat down at the same time on their pots eleven times in a single day, expelling some rose-colored parasites that they showed to everybody with great jubilation, for it allowed them to deceive Úrsula as to the origin of their distractions and drowsiness.

One afternoon the boys grew enthusiastic over the flying carpet that went swiftly by the laboratory at window level carrying the gypsy who was driving it and several children from the village who were merrily waving their hands, but José Arcadio Buendía did not even look at it. “Let them dream,” he said. “We’ll do better flying than they are doing, and with more scientific resources than a miserable bedspread.” In spite of his feigned interest, José Arcadio must understood the powers of the philosopher’s egg, which to him looked like a poorly blown bottle. He did not succeed in escaping from his worries. He lost his appetite and he could not sleep. He fell into an ill humor, the same as his father’s over the failure of his undertakings, and such was his upset that José Arcadio Buendía himself relieved him of his duties in the laboratory, thinking that he had taken alchemy too much to heart. Aureliano, of course, understood that his brother’s affliction did not have its source in the search for the philosopher’s stone but he could not get into his confidence. He had lost his former spontaneity. From an accomplice and a communicative person he had become withdrawn and hostile.

After wandering about among all kinds of contraptions with out becoming interested in any of them, he spotted something that was not a part of it all: a very young gypsy girl, almost a child, who was weighted down by beads and was the most beautiful woman that José Arcadio had ever seen in his life. She was in the crowd that was witnessing the sad spectacle of the man who had been turned into a snake for having disobeyed his parents.","For several days in a row, José Arcadio did not dare to leave the house. Just hearing the giggling of Pilar Ternera was enough to make him hide in the laboratory, where the handicrafts, the fruits of alchemy, were coming to life thanks to Úrsula's charity. José Arcadio Buendía warmly welcomed the wayward son and guided him as an apprentice in the alchemical work that he had thoroughly understood. One afternoon, the two brothers were very excited by the sight of a flying carpet passing by the laboratory window, carrying the gypsy driver and several village children who were happily waving, and José Arcadio Buendía did not even glance at the flying carpet. ""Let them dream,"" he said, ""we will fly higher than them with scientific means far superior to this pathetic flying carpet. "" Even though he had to pretend to be interested in the work, José Arcadio could never understand the grand possibilities of the alchemical furnace, which to him was simply a poorly made glass jar. He lost his appetite, suffered from insomnia, became irritable, just like his father when he faced failures in some tasks, and his erratic state forced his father to take over all the work in the alchemical furnace, thinking that the work was too exhausting for him. Aureliano, of course, understood that his brother's suffering had nothing to do with the alchemical furnace, but he could not get him to reveal the deeper issue. José Arcadio was no longer as lively as before. From being witty and open, he became secretive and difficult. Too fond of solitude, always angry at everything around him, one night, as usual, he left his bed empty and went out, but instead of going to Pilar Ternera's house, he went straight to the fair. After wandering through all the amusements, uninterested in any of them, he noticed someone not performing, a very young gypsy girl, almost still a child, wearing a necklace full of fake crystal gems. She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen until then. He was in the middle of a crowd engrossed in watching a man turn into a snake for not obeying his parents.",21.175,20.933,"Jose Arcadio couldn't step out of the house for a few days. As soon as he heard Pilar's cheerful laughter from the kitchen, he would take refuge in the laboratory where, with Ursula's permission, the alchemy experiments had regained momentum. Jose Arcadio Buendia welcomed his wayward son with joy and included him in the alchemical stone research he had finally decided to undertake. One evening, when a gypsy, who had seated the village children waving happily behind him, flew the carpet past the laboratory window, the boys' minds were captivated by the flying carpet, but Jose Arcadio Buendia didn't even turn his head to look. Let them think they are flying, he said. We will fly better than them, and not with a tattered blanket, but with scientific tools. Although Jose Arcadio seemed interested, he couldn't fathom the mystery of the alchemist's egg, which resembled a clumsily blown, crooked bottle. He couldn't rid himself of his worries. He stopped eating and drinking, and couldn't sleep. Just as his father would become sullen when his experiments failed, Jose Arcadio's face would also fall into a thousand pieces, so much so that Jose Arcadio Buendia thought the boy was too obsessed with this alchemy business and removed him from his duties in the laboratory. Aureliano knew that his brother's problem did not stem from searching for the philosopher's stone, but he couldn't get a word out of him. Jose Arcadio's former sincerity was gone; he had ceased to be someone who shared his secrets and talked, becoming instead a withdrawn, rude person. He harbored a bitter resentment against the whole world and avoided everyone. One night, as usual, he slipped out of bed, but instead of going to Pilar Ternera's house, he mingled with the noisy crowd of the fair. Among the myriad of shows, after wandering without turning his head to any of them, something unrelated to the exhibited skills caught his eye: It was a very young gypsy girl, almost a child, whose neck was weighed down by the beads she wore, and she was the most beautiful woman Jose Arcadio had ever seen in his life. The girl was standing among the crowd watching the tragic adventure of the man who turned into a snake for not obeying his parents.",17.673,17.396,"José Arcadio did not dare to leave his house for several days. It was enough for him to hear Pilar's boisterous laughter in the kitchen to run and take refuge in the laboratory, where the alchemy artifacts had come back to life with Úrsula's blessing. José Arcadio Buendía welcomed the lost son with joy and initiated him into the search for the philosopher's stone, which he had finally undertaken. One afternoon, the boys got excited about the flying carpet that swiftly passed by the laboratory window, carrying the gypsy driver and several village children who were cheerfully waving, and José Arcadio Buendía didn't even look at it. ""Let them dream,"" he said. ""We will fly better than they do with more scientific resources than that miserable bedspread."" Despite his feigned interest, José Arcadio never understood the powers of the philosophical egg, which simply seemed to him like a poorly made flask. He couldn't escape his worry. He lost his appetite and sleep, succumbed to bad temper, just like his father when one of his ventures failed, and his distress was so great that José Arcadio Buendía himself relieved him of his duties in the laboratory, believing he had taken alchemy too seriously. Aureliano, of course, understood that his brother's distress did not originate from the search for the philosopher's stone, but he couldn't get him to confide in him. He had lost his former spontaneity. From being a communicative accomplice, he became secretive and hostile. Anxious for solitude, bitten by a virulent resentment against the world, one night he left his bed as usual, but instead of going to Pilar Ternera's house, he mingled with the tumult of the fair. After wandering among all sorts of contraptions without being interested in any, he focused on something that wasn't part of the show: a very young gypsy girl, almost a child, laden with trinkets, the most beautiful woman José Arcadio had ever seen in his life. She was among the crowd watching the sad spectacle of the man who turned into a snake for disobeying his parents.",43.786,43.662
71,"José Arcadio paid no attention. While the sad interrogation of the snake-man was taking place, he made his way through the crowd up to the front row, where the gypsy girl was, and he stooped behind her. He pressed against her back. The girl tried to separate herself, but José Arcadio pressed more strongly against her back. Then she felt him. She remained motionless against him, trembling with surprise and fear, unable to believe the evidence, and finally she turned her head and looked at him with a tremulous smile. At that instant two gypsies put the snake-man into his cage and carried him into the tent. The gypsy who was conducting the show announced:","Hôsê Accađiô didn't pay attention. While the interrogation of the snake-man was taking place, he weaved through the crowd to reach the first place where he met the gypsy girl, stopping behind her. From behind, he wrapped his arms around her waist. She tried to break free, but Hôsê Accađiô held her tighter. So she was moved, standing still but still turning her back to him, trembling with surprise and fear, unable to believe it was real; finally, she turned her face, looking at him with a trembling smile. Meanwhile, two gypsy men shoved the snake-man into a bag and carried him inside the shop. A gypsy ringleader turned to the audience and said:",26.838,26.183,"Jose Arcadio showed no interest in the performance. While the pitiful interrogation of the snake man continued, he pushed through the crowd to the front row where the girl was standing, walked up, and stood right behind her. He pressed closely against the girl's back. When the girl tried to pull away, Jose Arcadio leaned in even more. It was then that the girl felt him completely. Unable to believe this was real, she leaned against the young man in shock and fear without moving, and finally, unable to resist, she turned her head and gave a timid smile. At that moment, two gypsies locked the snake man in his cage and took him to the tent. The gypsy running the show addressed the audience: Ladies and gentlemen, now we will show you the chilling ordeal of the woman who, as punishment for seeing something she shouldn't have, is beheaded every night at this exact hour for the past one hundred and fifty years.",16.673,16.033,"José Arcadio paid no attention.

The gypsy girl removed the starched lace corsets she had on and there she was, changed into practically nothing. She was a languid little frog, with incipient breasts and legs so thin that they did not even match the size of José Arcadio’s arms, but she had a decision and a warmth that compensated for her fragility. Nevertheless, José Arcadio could not respond to her because they were in a kind of public tent where the gypsies passed through with their circus things and did their business, and would even tarry by the bed for a game of dice. The lamp hanging from the center pole lighted the whole place up. During a pause in the caresses, José Arcadio stretched out naked on the bed without knowing what to do, while the girl tried to inspire him. A gypsy woman with splendid flesh came in a short time after accompanied by a man who was not of the caravan but who was not from the village either, and they both began to undress in front of the bed. Without meaning to, the woman looked at José Arcadio and examined his magnificent animal in repose with a kind of pathetic fervor.","Hôsê Accađiô and the girl did not watch the beheading act. They went to her place, where in desperate longing they indulged in kissing while undressing. The gypsy girl took off all her outer garments, petticoats, heavily padded corset, and fake crystal pearl necklace, and suddenly her once full breasts and wide hips disappeared. In reality, her body was like a dry branch, with a flat chest and thin thighs that were not even as big as Hôsê Accađiô's arms, but she had a bold demeanor and a warm scent that compensated. However, Hôsê Accađiô couldn't immediately respond to her fervor because they were in a public place, where gypsies frequently passed by, sometimes carrying circus equipment, sometimes in costume, and occasionally gathering beside the bed to play a game of dice. A lamp hanging from a pole in the middle of the yard illuminated the surroundings. When they stopped caressing each other, Hôsê Accađiô lay naked, stretched out on the bed, not knowing what else to do, while the girl tried to seduce him. Later, a sleek-skinned gypsy woman walked in, followed by a man who was neither part of the circus troupe nor from the village. Then both of them undressed right in front of the bed where Hôsê Accađiô was lying. Without intending to tease him, the woman looked at Hôsê Accađiô, filled with desire, eagerly admiring his magnificent resting organ. - Oh, my friend?",19.871,19.489,"Jose Arcadio and the gypsy girl did not watch the beheading scene. They went to the girl's tent, and while undressing, they began to kiss each other with frantic passion. When the gypsy girl took off her starched lace corset, she was left completely naked. Her newly budding breasts and her spindly legs, which were not even as thick as Jose Arcadio's arms, made her resemble a frail frog, but she had a boldness and warmth that made one forget her frailty. However, Jose Arcadio could not respond to the girl's advances, because the tent they entered was a busy place where the gypsies constantly came and went to take their circus equipment and do their work, and sometimes even stood by the bed to play dice. The lantern hanging from the central pole illuminated everything. When they paused their foreplay, as the girl, not knowing what to do, tried to arouse the completely naked Jose Arcadio lying on the bed, a gypsy woman with marvelous skin, followed by a man who was neither from the camp nor the villagers, entered the tent and started undressing by the bed.

She kept getting farther away from the village until she felt so far away that she did not think about returning.

One day, Amaranta's basket began to move on its own and made a complete turn in the room, to the consternation of Aureliano, who hurried to stop it. But his father was not disturbed. He put the basket back in its place and tied it to the leg of a table, convinced that the awaited event was imminent. It was on that occasion that Aureliano heard him say:",61.423,61.275

85,"PILAR TERNERA’S son was brought to his grand parents’ house two weeks after he was born. Úrsula admitted him grudgingly, conquered once more by the obstinacy of her husband, who could not tolerate the idea that an offshoot of his blood should be adrift, but he imposed the condition that the child should never know his true identity. Although he was given the name José Arcadio, they ended up calling him simply Arcadio so as to avoid confusion. At that time there was so much activity in the town and so much bustle in the house that the care of the children was relegated to a secondary level. They were put in the care of Visitación, a Guajiro Indian woman who had arrived in town with a brother in flight from a plague of insomnia that had been scourging their tribe for several years. They were both so docile and willing to help that Úrsula took them on to help her with her household chores. That was how Arcadio and Amaranta came to speak the Guajiro language before Spanish, and they learned to drink lizard broth and eat spider eggs without Úrsula’s knowing it, for she was too busy with a promising business in candy animals. Macondo had changed. The people who had come with Úrsula spread the news of the good quality of its soil and its privileged position with respect to the swamp, so that from the narrow village of past times it changed into an active town with stores and workshops and a permanent commercial route over which the first Arabs arrived with their baggy pants and rings in their ears, swapping glass beads for macaws. José Arcadio Buendía did not have a moment’s rest. Fascinated by an immediate reality that came to be more fantastic than the vast universe of his imagination, he lost all interest in the alchemist’s laboratory, put to rest the material that had become attenuated with months of manipulation, and went back to being the enterprising man of earlier days when he had decided upon the layout of the streets and the location of the new houses so that no one would enjoy privileges that everyone did not have. He acquired such authority among the new arrivals that foundations were not laid or walls built without his being consulted, and it was decided that he should be the one in charge of the distribution of the land. When the acrobat gypsies returned, with their vagabond carnival transformed now into a gigantic organization of games of luck and chance, they were received with great joy, for it was thought that José Arcadio would be coming back with them. But José Arcadio did not return, nor did they come with the snake-man, who, according to what Úrsula thought, was the only one who could tell them about their son, so the gypsies were not allowed to camp in town or set foot in it in the future, for they were considered the bearers of concupiscence and perversion. José Arcadio Buendía, however, was explicit in maintaining that the old tribe of Melquíades, who had contributed so much to the growth of the village with his age-old wisdom and his fabulous inventions, would always find the gates open. But Melquíades’ tribe, according to what the wanderers said, had been wiped off the face of the earth because they had gone beyond the limits of human knowledge.","Pila Tecnêra's son was brought to his grandparents' home two weeks after he was born. Ursula reluctantly accepted him, as once again she had to yield to her husband's eccentricity, who persistently held the belief that his descendants should not be left to fend for themselves in life. However, she set the condition that the child would never know his true origins. Although the child was named José Arcadio, the grandparents decided to avoid confusion by calling him simply Arcadio. At that time, there were many social activities outside the village and a lot of work inside the house, so child care became a secondary concern. The children were entrusted to Visitación, an indigenous girl who had come to the village with her brother, fleeing a plague of insomnia that had been ravaging their tribe for several years. Both siblings were gentle, well-behaved, and hardworking, so Ursula trusted them to help with household chores. Thus, Arcadio and Amaranta spoke the indigenous language before they knew how to speak Spanish, learned to sip lizard soup, and ate spider eggs without Ursula's knowledge, as she was busy with her promising candy animal business. Macondo had completely changed. Those who came with Ursula had learned to exploit the fertile land and the advantageous geographical position of Macondo compared to the swampy region. Consequently, the once desolate village quickly became a bustling town with shops, craft workshops, and a regular marketplace where the first Arabs, wearing pantoufles and earrings, came to trade fake crystal beads for long-tailed parrots. José Arcadio Buendía did not have a moment of rest. Excited by a reality that at this moment seemed more mystical to him than the vast world within his imagination, he lost all interest in his work at the alchemy lab, abandoning the metal substance that had been repeatedly heated and cooled for months to return to his energetic self who once decided to chart roads and build houses so that no one would enjoy more benefits than others. He had high prestige among the newcomers to the village, to the extent that those who wanted to dig foundations for houses or fence their gardens had to seek his advice first, and he was elected by everyone as the first person to decide on the redistribution of the village's land. When the gypsies returned with their magic tricks, this time their mobile stall had become a huge shop with games of chance, they were warmly welcomed because people thought that José Arcadio would return with them. But José Arcadio did not return, and these gypsies did not bring the snake-man, whom Úrsula thought would be the only one who could tell her the truth about her son, so she did not allow the gypsies to stop and open their shop, and in the future, they would not be allowed to set foot in the village because they were condemned as messengers of debauchery and corruption. However, José Arcadio Buendía showed great insight in thinking that the tribe of Melquíades, with their ancient knowledge and marvelous inventions that had greatly contributed to the growth of Macondo, should always be welcomed with open arms. But the tribe of Melquíades, according to the words of the wanderers, had been wiped off the face of the earth for daring to surpass the limits of knowledge that God had decreed for mankind.",22.841,22.676,"Pilar Ternera's son was brought to his grandfather's house two weeks after he was born. Ursula reluctantly took the child into the house, yielding to her husband's insistence that a child of their own blood should not be left out in the cold, but on the condition that the child would not learn his true identity. They named the boy Jose Arcadio, but to avoid confusion later, they started calling him simply Arcadio. At that time, there was such activity in the village and such hustle and bustle in the house that the care of the children was relegated to the background. The children were entrusted to a woman named Visitacion, one of the Guajiro Indians, who had come to the village with her brother, fleeing the insomnia plague that had ravaged their tribe for years. The Indian siblings were so meek and so willing to be subservient that Ursula had taken them in to help with the household chores. Thus, Arcadio and Amaranta began speaking the Guajiro language fluently before they even mastered Spanish, learning to eat lizard soup and spider eggs without Ursula's knowledge, who was absorbed in making and selling animal-shaped candies. Macondo had changed. Those who came with Ursula spread the word so enthusiastically about how much better this place was compared to the swamp, praising its fertile soil, that the once isolated village transformed into a bustling town with shops, workshops, and a constantly busy caravan route. The first to arrive via this route were Arabs with baggy trousers and earrings, who bartered large parrots for glass beads. Jose Arcadio Buendia had no time to scratch his head. Enchanted by the tangible reality that seemed even more fantastical than the boundless universe created by his imagination, Jose Arcadio Buendia stopped paying attention to his alchemy laboratory, set aside the materials he had painstakingly prepared over months, and became as proactive as he was in the days when he decided where the streets would lead and where the houses would be built to ensure no one was wronged. He established such dominance over the newcomers that no foundation was laid, nor any wall built without consulting him, and eventually, they decided to put him in charge of land distribution. When the acrobat gypsies, who had turned the old travelers' fair into a huge casino of fortune and gambling games, returned, they were greeted with great fanfare, thinking that Jose Arcadio had returned with them. However, Jose Arcadio did not return, and according to Ursula, the snake man, the only person who could tell where her son was, was also not there. As a result, the gypsies were not allowed to stay in the town because they were said to spread lust and perversion wherever they went, and they were warned never to set foot there again. However, Jose Arcadio Buendia did not forget to say that the doors of the town were always open to the tribe of Melquiades, who had greatly contributed to the development of the town with his infinite wisdom and unique inventions. Nevertheless, according to what the nomads said, Melquiades' tribe had been wiped off the face of the earth because it had surpassed the limits of human comprehension.",20.029,19.843,"Pilar Ternera's son was taken to his grandparents' house two weeks after he was born.

86,"Emancipated for the moment at least from the torment of fantasy, José Arcadio Buendía in a short time set up a system of order and work which allowed for only one bit of license: the freeing of the birds, which, since the time of the founding, had made time merry with their flutes, and installing in their place musical clocks in every house. They were wondrous clocks made of carved wood, which the Arabs had traded for macaws and which José Arcadio Buendía had synchronized with such precision that every half hour the town grew merry with the progressive chords of the same song until it reached the climax of a noontime that was as exact and unanimous as a complete waltz. It was also José Arcadio Buendía who decided during those years that they should plant almond trees instead of acacias on the streets, and who discovered, without ever revealing it, a way to make them live forever. Many years later, when Macondo was a field of wooden houses with zinc roofs, the broken and dusty almond trees still stood on the oldest streets, although no one knew who had planted them. While his father was putting the town in order and his mother was increasing their wealth with her marvelous business of candied little roosters and fish, which left the house twice a day strung along sticks of balsa wood, Aureliano spent interminable hours in the abandoned laboratory, learning the art of silverwork by his own experimentation. He had shot up so fast that in a short time the clothing left behind by his brother no longer fit him and he began to wear his father’s, but Visitación had to sew pleats in the shirt and darts in the pants, because Aureliano had not sequined the corpulence of the others. Adolescence had taken away the softness of his voice and had made him silent and definitely solitary, but, on the other hand, it had restored the intense expression that he had had in his eyes when he was born. He concentrated so much on his experiments in silverwork that he scarcely left the laboratory to eat. Worried ever his inner withdrawal, José Arcadio Buendía gave him the keys to the house and a little money, thinking that perhaps he needed a woman. But Aureliano spent the money on muriatic acid to prepare some aqua regia and he beautified the keys by plating them with gold. His excesses were hardly comparable to those of Arcadio and Amaranta, who had already begun to get their second teeth and still went about all day clutching at the Indians’ cloaks, stubborn in their decision not to speak Spanish but the Guajiro language. “You shouldn’t complain.” Úrsula told her husband. “Children inherit their parents’ madness.” And as she was lamenting her misfortune, convinced that the wild behavior of her children was something as fearful as a pig’s tail, Aureliano gave her a look that wrapped her in an atmosphere of uncertainty.","Escaping the torment of illusory desires, at least for the time being, José Arcadio Buendía managed to stabilize the village's way of life with discipline and labor, and allowed the birds that had enlivened the atmosphere with their songs since the village's founding to be released, replacing them with musical clocks installed in homes. These were precious clocks made of smoothly planed wood that the Arabs exchanged with the villagers for long-tailed parrots, and José Arcadio Buendía orchestrated them to run so precisely in unison that every half hour, the villagers were cheered by harmonious music that seemed to emanate from a single clock. José Arcadio Buendía was the one who, during those years, decided to plant almond trees along the roads instead of acacias, and he was also the one who discovered but never revealed the methods to make them thrive. Many years later, when the village of Macondo had become a settlement of wooden houses with tin roofs, the old almond trees still lined the ancient roads, covered in road dust, though by then no one knew who had planted them. While the father was busy organizing the communal affairs of the village and the mother was making chicken-shaped candies on sticks to sell at the market twice a day to supplement the family income, Aureliano was passionately absorbed in the abandoned laboratory, studying the craft of goldsmithing. He did it purely out of personal interest. In a short time, Aureliano grew so much that he could no longer fit into his older brother's clothes and had to wear his father's, but Visitación had to take in the sleeves and narrow the pant legs because he still did not have the robust build of his father and brother. Adolescence had taken away Aureliano's sweet voice and made him sullen, quiet, and solitary, but conversely, it had also returned to him the intense expressiveness that he had possessed since birth in his eyes. Aureliano was so intensely focused on his goldsmithing experiments that he hardly left the laboratory to eat. Worried about his son's extreme intellectual concentration, José Arcadio Buendía gave him the key to the door and some money, thinking that perhaps his son needed the company of a woman. But Aureliano used the money to buy hydrochloric acid to create a solution, and he made the keys shine with a layer of gold plating. Aureliano's peculiar traits were in harmony with Arcadio and Amaranta, who, though they had lost their baby teeth, still clung to the skirts of the Indian women and stubbornly refused to give up their native language for Spanish. ""I have nothing more to complain about,"" Úrsula said to her husband. ""Our children have inherited their parents' madness."" While she lamented her unfortunate fate, feeling that her sons' eccentricities were indeed as terrifying as a pig's tail, Aureliano dreamily watched her:",18.871,18.654,"At least for now, freed from the torment of his imagination, Jose Arcadio Buendia established such an order and work system in a short time that only one thing was free: the permission to release the birds, which had been bringing joy to life with their chirping since the founding days of the village, and replace them with a clock in every house. These were wooden clocks traded by the Arabs for parrots. Jose Arcadio Buendia set the clocks so perfectly that the town was enlivened every half hour by the successive chorus of the same tune, and when noon arrived, the sounds of a waltz rising uninterruptedly and in unison filled everywhere. It was also Jose Arcadio Buendia who decided to plant almond trees instead of acacias in the streets during those years and found a way to make the almonds immortal without ever revealing his secret. Years later, when Macondo was filled with wooden houses with zinc roofs, the almond trees, with their broken and dusty branches, stood in the oldest streets, long forgotten who had planted them. While his father was busy organizing the town and his mother was making money from the business of distributing rooster and fish-shaped candies attached to sandalwood sticks twice a day, Aureliano would lock himself in the abandoned laboratory for hours, teaching himself the art of silverwork. He had grown so quickly that, soon after, when his older brother's clothes no longer fit him, he started wearing his father's, but since he was not as stocky as the others, Visitacion would pleat the shirts and put darts in the pants. Puberty had taken away the softness of his voice, making the young man silent and introverted, but at the same time, it had restored the intense expression in his eyes that he had at birth. He had devoted himself to silverwork so much that he rarely left the laboratory, even to eat. Thinking that he might need a woman, Jose Arcadio Buendia gave him the keys to the house and some money. But Aureliano used the money to buy hydrochloric acid to make a solution for melting gold and decorated the keys with gold plating. Aureliano's excesses paled in comparison to what Amaranta and Arcadio did, who, despite starting to grow their seven-year molars, still clung to the Indian woman's skirt and stubbornly spoke in the Guajiro language instead of Spanish. Ursula would say to her husband, ""You have no right to complain; they take after their lineage, what can you do. "" While Ursula cursed her misfortune, believing that her children's wildness was as terrible as a pig's tail, Aureliano gave her such a look that she froze, not knowing what to do.",21.724,21.534,"Emancipated at least for the moment from the tortures of fantasy, José Arcadio Buendía quickly imposed a state of order and work, within which he allowed only one indulgence: the release of the birds that had cheered the time with their flutes since the founding, and the installation in their place of musical clocks in all the houses. They were precious carved wooden clocks that the Arabs exchanged for macaws, and which José Arcadio Buendía synchronized with such precision that every half hour the town was cheered by the progressive chords of the same piece, culminating in an exact and unanimous midday with the complete waltz. It was also José Arcadio Buendía who decided in those years that almond trees should be planted in the town's streets instead of acacias, and who discovered, without ever revealing them, the methods to make them eternal. Many years later, when Macondo was a camp of wooden houses with zinc roofs, the broken and dusty almond trees still endured in the oldest streets, although no one then knew who had planted them. While his father was putting the town in order and his mother was consolidating the domestic patrimony with her marvelous industry of sugar roosters and fish that twice a day left the house strung on balsa wood sticks, Aureliano spent endless hours in the abandoned laboratory, learning the art of silversmithing through pure investigation. He had grown so much that in a short time the clothes abandoned by his brother no longer fit him, and he began to wear his father's, but it was necessary for Visitación to sew tucks into the shirts and gussets into the pants because Aureliano had not inherited the corpulence of the others. Adolescence had taken away the sweetness of his voice and made him silent and definitively solitary, but in return, it had restored the intense expression he had in his eyes at birth. He was so concentrated on his silversmithing experiments that he barely left the laboratory to eat. Concerned about his self-absorption, José Arcadio Buendía gave him keys to the house and a little money, thinking that perhaps he needed a woman. But Aureliano spent the money on muriatic acid to prepare aqua regia and embellished the keys with a gold plating. His exaggerations were only comparable to those of Arcadio and Amaranta, who had already started to lose their teeth and still clung all day to the Indian blankets, stubborn in their decision not to speak Spanish but the Guajiro language. ""You have nothing to complain about,"" Úrsula told her husband. ""Children inherit the madness of their parents.""

90,"That Sunday, in fact, Rebeca arrived. She was only eleven years old. She had made the difficult trip from Manaure with some hide dealers who had taken on the task of delivering her along with a letter to José Arcadio Buendía, but they could not explain precisely who the person was who had asked the favor. Her entire baggage consisted of a small trunk, a little rocking chair with small hand-painted flowers, and a canvas sack which kept making a cloc-cloc-cloc sound, where she carried her parents’ bones. The letter addressed to José Arcadio Buendía was written is very warm terms by someone who still loved him very much in spite of time and distance, and who felt obliged by a basic humanitarian feeling to do the charitable thing and send him that poor unsheltered orphan, who was a second cousin of Úrsula’s and consequently also a relative of José Arcadio Buendía, although farther removed, because she was the daughter of that unforgettable friend Nicanor Ulloa and his very worthy wife Rebeca Montiel, may God keep them in His holy kingdom, whose remains the girl was carrying so that they might be given Christian burial. The names mentioned, as well as the signature on the letter, were perfectly legible, but neither José Arcadio, Buendía nor Úrsula remembered having any relatives with those names, nor did they know anyone by the name of the sender of the letter, much less the remote village of Manaure. It was impossible to obtain any further information from the girl. From the moment she arrived she had been sitting in the rocker, sucking her finger and observing everyone with her large, startled eyes without giving any sign of understanding what they were asking her. She wore a diagonally striped dress that had been dyed black, worn by use, and a pair of scaly patent leather boots. Her hair was held behind her ears with bows of black ribbon. She wore a scapular with the images worn away by sweat, and on her right wrist the fang of a carnivorous animal mounted on a backing of copper as an amulet against the evil eye. Her greenish skin, her stomach, round and tense as a drum. revealed poor health and hunger that were older than she was, but when they gave her something to eat she kept the plate on her knees without tasting anything. They even began to think that she was a deaf-mute until the Indians asked her in their language if she wanted some water and she moved her eyes as if she recognized them and said yes with her head.","Indeed, Rebecca arrived on a Sunday. The little girl was not yet eleven years old. She had to struggle to travel from Manaure to here with the fur traders who were tasked with delivering her and the letter to José Arcadio Buendía's house, but even these traders could not clearly explain who had asked them to do so. All of her belongings consisted of a small trunk containing clothes, a wooden rocking chair, and a burlap sack in which her parents' bones were kept, which would often clatter, clatter, clatter when they bumped into each other. The letter addressed to José Arcadio Buendía was written with affectionate words expressing the feelings of someone who, despite being separated for a long time, still loved him and, out of a very close affection, felt obliged to ask his family to take care of this orphaned girl with no place to go. It mentioned that the girl was a close relative of Úrsula and thus also somewhat related to José Arcadio Buendía, though a bit more distantly, because she was the daughter of an unforgettable friend named Nicanor Ulloa and his noble wife named Rebecca Montiel. These are the people who are now under God's protection in His paradise, and their bones have been collected so that his family could bury them in the graveyard of Christ's flock. The names mentioned as signatures in the letter were completely clear, but neither José Arcadio Buendía nor Úrsula remembered knowing anyone with those names, including the sender of the letter, and in the distant village of Manaure, there couldn't possibly be anyone with those names. Through the little girl, they also couldn't find any more detailed information. Since her arrival, the little girl sat on the rocking chair, sucking her thumb and with wide, fearful eyes, observing everyone, without showing whether she understood or didn't understand what people were asking her. The little girl wore a black-striped, worn-out diagonal fabric dress and varnished boots with holes, her hair tucked behind her ears with black ribbons. She also wore a sleeveless embroidered cloak, faded by sweat, and on her right wrist, she wore a wild animal's tooth set in a bronze base, which seemed like a protective amulet. Her skin was pale green, her belly round and swollen like a drum, all indicating that she was very sickly and had been starving for a long time. But when given food, she sat still, placed the bowl on her lap, and didn't taste it at all. Everyone assumed she was mute and deaf until the Indians asked her in their native language if she wanted water, and her eyes blinked as if she understood them, and she nodded to ask for water.",20.072,19.865,"Indeed, that Sunday arrived, Rebeca. She was only eleven years old. She had made a strenuous journey from Manaure to Macondo with leather merchants who had taken on the task of bringing the girl along with a letter addressed to Jose Arcadio Buendia, but who could not for the life of them remember who had entrusted the child to them. All her belongings consisted of a small trunk, a rocking chair decorated with tiny hand-painted flowers, and a sack that made a rattling noise with every swing, containing the bones of her mother and father. The letter addressed to Jose Arcadio was written with extremely heartfelt words by someone who still loved and respected him despite the long time and distance that had come between their friendship. The letter writer, being the daughter of Ursula's cousin's cousin and that unforgettable friend Nicanor Ulloa and his dear wife Rebeca Montiel, and thus distantly related to Jose Arcadio Buendia, wrote that by sending this homeless orphan girl to him, they believed they were fulfilling a humanitarian duty, and noted that they had placed the bones of the girl's parents in the sack so they could be buried according to Christian rites. The names mentioned in the letter, as well as the signature at the bottom, were clearly legible, but neither Jose Arcadio Buendia nor Ursula could figure out if they had a relative with that name. They also did not recognize the name of the sender. The village called Manaure had never reached their ears. It was not possible to learn anything from the girl either. As soon as the girl arrived, she sat in her rocking chair, sucking her finger, and began to watch everyone with her big, bewildered eyes, showing no sign that she understood the questions being asked. She wore an old, tattered dress that had once been striped but was later dyed black, and shoes with peeling patent leather. Her hair was gathered behind her ears with two black ribbons. She had on a sweat-faded cotton shirt and a copper-framed amulet made from a carnivorous animal's tooth on her right arm. Her skin, tinged with green, and her drum-tight, swollen belly were signs of an illness and poverty that had begun before she was born, but when food was placed in front of her, she simply held the plate on her knees without taking a single bite. They almost believed that the girl was deaf and mute, but finally, the Indians asked her in their language if she wanted water, and the girl blinked and nodded as if she recognized them, saying yes.",24.221,24.023,"On Sunday, indeed, Rebeca arrived. She was no more than eleven years old. She had made the arduous journey from Manaure with some fur traders who were tasked with delivering her along with a letter to the house of José Arcadio Buendía, but they could not precisely explain who had asked them to do the favor. All her luggage consisted of a small trunk of clothes, a small wooden rocking chair with hand-painted colorful flowers, and a canvas sack that made a constant cloc cloc cloc noise, in which she carried her parents' bones. The letter addressed to José Arcadio Buendía was written in very affectionate terms by someone who still loved him very much despite the time and distance and who felt compelled by a basic sense of humanity to do the charity of sending him this poor helpless orphan girl, who was Úrsula's second cousin and therefore also a relative of José Arcadio Buendía, although more distantly, because she was the daughter of that unforgettable friend Nicanor Ulloa and his very dignified wife Rebeca Montiel, whom God had in His holy kingdom, whose remains were enclosed with the letter so they could be given a Christian burial. Both the mentioned names and the signature of the letter were perfectly legible, but neither José Arcadio Buendía nor Úrsula remembered having relatives with those names nor did they know anyone named like the sender, much less in the remote town of Manaure. It was impossible to obtain any additional information through the girl. From the moment she arrived, she sat sucking her thumb in the rocking chair and observing everyone with her large frightened eyes, without giving any sign of understanding what she was being asked. She wore a black-dyed diagonal dress, worn from use, and some chipped patent leather boots. Her hair was held behind her ears with black ribbon bows. She wore a scapular with images faded by sweat and on her right wrist a carnivorous animal's fang mounted on a copper support as a charm against the evil eye. Her green skin, her round and tense belly like a drum, revealed poor health and a hunger older than herself, but when they gave her food, she kept the plate on her lap without tasting it. It was even believed that she was deaf-mute, until the Indians asked her in their language if she wanted some water, and she moved her eyes as if she recognized them and nodded yes with her head.",46.198,46.08
91,"They kept her, because there was nothing else they could do. They decided to call her Rebeca, which according to the letter was her mother’s name, because Aureliano had the patience to read to her the names of all the saints and he did not get a reaction from any one of them. Since there was no cemetery in Macondo at that time, for no one had died up till then, they kept the bag of bones to wait for a worthy place of burial, and for a long time it got in the way everywhere and would be found where least expected, always with its clucking of a broody hen. A long time passed before Rebeca became incorporated into the life of the family. She would sit in her small rocker sucking her finger in the most remote corner of the house. Nothing attracted her attention except the music of the clocks, which she would look for every half hour with her frightened eyes as if she hoped to find it someplace in the air. They could not get her to eat for several days. No one understood why she had not died of hunger until the Indians, who were aware of everything, for they went ceaselessly about the house on their stealthy feet, discovered that Rebeca only liked to eat the damp earth of the courtyard and the cake of whitewash that she picked of the walls with her nails. It was obvious that her parents, or whoever had raised her, had scolded her for that habit because she did it secretively and with a feeling of guilt, trying to put away supplies so that she could eat when no one was looking. From then on they put her under an implacable watch. They threw cow gall onto the courtyard and, rubbed hot chili on the walls, thinking they could defeat her pernicious vice with those methods, but she showed such signs of astuteness and ingenuity to find some earth that Úrsula found herself forced to use more drastic methods. She put some orange juice and rhubarb into a pan that she left in the dew all night and she gave her the dose the following day on an empty stomach. Although no one had told her that it was the specific remedy for the vice of eating earth, she thought that any bitter substance in an empty stomach would have to make the liver react. Rebeca was so rebellious and strong in spite of her frailness that they had to tie her up like a calf to make her swallow the medicine, and they could barely keep back her kicks or bear up under the strange hieroglyphics that she alternated with her bites and spitting, and that, according to what the scandalized Indians said, were the vilest obscenities that one could ever imagine in their language. When Úrsula discovered that, she added whipping to the treatment. It was never established whether it was the rhubarb or the beatings that had effect, or both of them together, but the truth was that in a few weeks Rebeca began to show signs of recovery. She took part in the games of Arcadio and Amaranta, who treated her like an older sister, and she ate heartily, using the utensils properly. It was soon revealed that she spoke Spanish with as much fluency as the Indian language, that she had a remarkable ability for manual work, and that she could sing the waltz of the clocks with some very funny words that she herself had invented. It did not take long for them to consider her another member of the family. She was more affectionate to Úrsula than any of her own children had been, and she called Arcadio, and Amaranta brother and sister, Aureliano uncle, and José Arcadio Buendía grandpa. So that she finally deserved, as much as the others, the name of Rebeca Buendía, the only one that she ever had and that she bore with dignity until her death.","There was no other way, so the family had to adopt the little girl. Everyone decided to call her Rebecca to match her mother's name because Aureliano had patiently sat in front of her reading all the saint names, but he didn't see any reaction, not even the slightest, on the girl's face. At that time, the village of Macondo didn't have a cemetery, because until then, no one had died, so the family had to keep the sack containing the remains until there was a proper place for burial. For quite a long time, they were scattered everywhere, found in the most unexpected places, often accompanied by the squawking of a scratching chicken. It took a long time for Rebecca to get used to life in this house. She sat on the rocking chair, sucking her thumb in the loneliest corner of the house. Only the music from the clock caught her attention. Every half hour, with startled eyes, she listened as if waiting for that music from some windy place. For several days, the family couldn't get her to eat. No one could understand how she didn't starve to death until the Indians, who knew everything because they quietly moved around the house, discovered that Rebecca didn't like to eat rice but instead liked to eat moist earth from the yard and wall soil that she scraped off with her fingers. It was clear that her parents or whoever raised her had scolded her for this bad habit, so she ate secretly, fully aware that it was a wrongdoing. She would sneak pieces of wall soil to eat when no one was looking. From then on, people paid more attention to her. They poured cow bile on the yard and smeared chili water on the walls, believing that these methods could curb the dangerous habit. But the girl was clever and skillfully found ways to hide the soil to eat, forcing Ursula to use even more effective measures. She mixed orange juice with rhubarb powder in a jar and left it out overnight, and the next morning at breakfast, she gave the girl a cup of it. Even though no one told her that this was a special remedy for eating soil, she thought that any bitter liquid on an empty stomach would affect the liver. Despite having rickets, Rebecca was so fierce and strong that they had to pin her down like a calf to give her the medicine, and they could hardly restrain her kicking legs or cover her mouth to stop the incomprehensible sounds accompanied by scratching and spitting, which, according to the Indians, were the most obscene words in their language. Knowing this, Ursula had to resort to using a whip while giving her the medicine. It will never be determined whether it was the rhubarb powder or the whippings, or both combined, that proved effective, but the fact was that within a few weeks, Rebecca began to show signs of recovery. Rebecca joined the games of Arcadio and Amaranta, who welcomed her as an older sister, and she ate heartily, skillfully using the utensils. She also quickly demonstrated that she spoke Spanish as fluently as the Indian language and had a knack for manual labor. She sang along with the waltz music from the clock, improvising beautiful lyrics. Soon, she was accepted as another member of the family. Ursula loved her more than her own children, and the girl called Amaranta and Arcadio her siblings, Aureliano her uncle, and José Arcadio Buendía her grandfather. So in the end, the girl truly deserved to bear the name Rebeca Buendía, a unique name of hers, and she proudly carried it throughout her life until her last breath.",20.802,20.652,"Since they had no other option, they kept the girl at home. Aureliano, trying to guess her name, patiently listed all the saints' names, but when he got no reaction from the girl, he finally called her by the name mentioned in the letter, and they called her Rebeca. Since no one had died yet and there was no cemetery in Macondo, they left the sack of bones in the open to find a suitable place to bury it. The sack kept getting caught on people's feet and, with a clattering sound similar to a hen clucking on its nest, would appear in the most unexpected places. It took Rebeca a very long time to adapt to family life. She would go to the farthest corners of the house, sucking her thumb while sitting in her rocking chair. She was interested in nothing but the chiming of the clock, and every half hour, she would nervously dart her eyes around as if trying to catch the sound in the air. For several days, they couldn't get her to eat a single bite. While they wondered how she hadn't died of starvation yet, the Indians, who silently roamed the house and knew everything that was going on, discovered that Rebeca was eating the damp earth from the yard and pieces of lime she scraped off the walls with her nails. Judging by the fact that she did this secretly and with a sense of guilt, hiding her stash to eat when no one was around, her parents or whoever raised her must have scolded her a lot for this habit. To break her of this bad habit, they spread cow manure in the yard and rubbed red pepper on the walls, but the girl showed such cunning and skill in finding earth that Ursula had to take even stricter measures. After placing the orange juice and rhubarb root in a pot and leaving it out in the frost all night, she made the girl drink it on an empty stomach the next morning. Although no one had said that this remedy would cure the habit of eating dirt, Ursula figured that if something bitter entered an empty stomach, the liver would react to it. Rebeca was so rebellious and, despite her frailty, so strong that even though they tied her hands and feet like a calf to make her swallow the medicine, she kept kicking, cursing in her native language with the most unmentionable words according to the Indians, and biting and spitting on anyone who came near her. When Ursula learned of this, she added the whip to her treatment method. Whether it was the rhubarb laxative, the beating, or both, it is unknown, but within a few weeks, Rebeca began to show signs of improvement. She joined the games of Arcadio and Amaranta, who saw her as a sister, and ate heartily, using the knife and fork properly. It was also soon understood that she spoke Spanish as well as the Indians' language, was very skilled in handicrafts, and accompanied the clock's chime with her own nonsensical words. The household soon began to see her as one of the family. She would cuddle up to Ursula more than her own children, call Arcadio and Amaranta her siblings, Aureliano her uncle, and Jose Arcadio Buendia her grandfather. Thus, in the end, she earned the right to take the name Rebeca Buendia like the other children, and she carried this name with honor until the end of her life.",18.651,18.496,"They stayed with her because there was no other choice. They decided to call her Rebeca, which according to the letter was her mother's name, because Aureliano had the patience to read the entire list of saints' names to her and she did not react to any of them. Since at that time there was no cemetery in Macondo, as no one had died until then, they kept the sack with the bones waiting for a worthy place to bury them, and for a long time they were in the way everywhere and were found where least expected, always with their clucking like a brooding hen. A long time passed before Rebeca joined the family life. She would sit in the little rocking chair sucking her thumb in the most secluded corner of the house. Nothing caught her attention except the music of the clocks, which she searched for with frightened eyes every half hour, as if expecting to find it somewhere in the air. They couldn't get her to eat for several days. Nobody understood how she hadn't died of hunger, until the indigenous people, who noticed everything because they roamed the house incessantly with their stealthy feet, discovered that Rebeca only liked to eat the damp earth from the patio and the lime cakes she scraped off the walls with her nails. It was evident that her parents, or whoever had raised her, had scolded her for this habit, as she practiced it secretly and with a sense of guilt, trying to hide the portions to eat them when no one was watching. From then on, they subjected her to relentless surveillance. They sprinkled cow bile in the patio and smeared hot pepper on the walls, believing they could defeat her pernicious habit with these methods, but she showed such signs of cunning and ingenuity to procure the earth that Úrsula was forced to employ more drastic measures. She would put orange juice with rhubarb in a pot and leave it out overnight, giving her the potion the next morning on an empty stomach. Although no one had told her that this was the specific remedy for the habit of eating earth, she thought that any bitter substance on an empty stomach had to make the liver react. Rebeca was so rebellious and strong despite her rickets that they had to hold her down like a calf to make her swallow the medicine, and they could barely restrain her tantrums and endure the convoluted hieroglyphics she alternated with bites and spit, which according to the scandalized indigenous people were the grossest obscenities conceivable in their language. When Úrsula found out, she complemented the treatment with lashings. It was never established whether it was the rhubarb or the beatings, or both combined, that took effect, but the truth is that within a few weeks Rebeca began to show signs of recovery. She participated in the games of Arcadio and Amaranta, who welcomed her as an older sister, and ate with appetite using the cutlery properly. It soon became apparent that she spoke Spanish as fluently as the indigenous language, that she had a remarkable skill for manual crafts, and that she sang the waltz of the clocks with a very funny lyric she had invented herself. They soon considered her as another member of the family. She was more affectionate with Úrsula than her own children ever were, and she called Amaranta and Arcadio little siblings, Aureliano uncle, and José Arcadio Buendía grandpa. Thus, she ended up deserving as much as the others the name of Rebeca Buendía, the only one she ever had and carried with dignity until her death.",44.538,44.462
92,"One night about the time that Rebeca was cured of the vice of eating earth and was brought to sleep in the other children’s room, the Indian woman, who slept with them awoke by chance and heard a strange, intermittent sound in the corner. She got up in alarm, thinking that an animal had come into the room, and then she saw Rebeca in the rocker, sucking her finger and with her eyes lighted up in the darkness like those of a cat. Terrified, exhausted by her fate, Visitación recognized in those eyes the symptoms of the sickness whose threat had obliged her and her brother to exile themselves forever from an age-old kingdom where they had been prince and princess. It was the insomnia plague.","One night, during the period when Rebecca was cured of her habit of eating dirt and was moved to sleep in the same room as the other children, the Indian girl who usually slept in the same room with them suddenly woke up and heard an unusual noise. The girl startled and sat up, thinking that some animal had entered the room, and at that moment she saw Rebecca sitting on the rocking chair, sucking her thumb with eyes shining like a cat's in the dark night. Panic-stricken by the dangerous disease, worried about the misfortune of her fate, Visitacion recognized in those eyes the symptoms of an illness whose threat had forced them, her and her brother, to forever bid farewell to the ancient kingdom where they had once been princess and prince. It was the insomnia plague.",23.308,22.608,"At the time when Rebeca overcame her habit of eating dirt and started sleeping in the same room with the other children, one night, the Indian woman who slept in the same room woke up and heard a strange clattering noise coming from the corner. Thinking that an animal had entered the room, she jumped up in a panic and saw Rebeca sitting in a rocking chair with her finger in her mouth, her eyes shining like a cat's in the dark. Visitacion, who had fallen victim to blind fate, saw with horror the signs of the disease that had once forced them to flee from the century-old kingdom where they were prince and princess, in Rebeca's eyes. It was the disease of insomnia.",16.772,15.714,"One night, around the time when Rebeca was cured of the habit of eating dirt and was taken to sleep in the room with the other children, the Indian woman who slept with them woke up by chance and heard a strange intermittent noise in the corner. Alarmed, she sat up, believing that an animal had entered the room, and then saw Rebeca in the rocking chair, sucking her thumb and with eyes glowing like those of a cat in the dark. Stunned with terror, troubled by the fatality of her destiny, Visitación recognized in those eyes the symptoms of the disease whose threat had forced her and her brother to exile themselves forever from a millennial kingdom in which they were princes. It was the plague of insomnia.",39.676,39.185
93,"Cataure, the Indian, was gone from the house by morning. His sister stayed because her fatalistic heart told her that the lethal sickness would follow her, no matter what, to the farthest corner of the earth. No one understood Visitación’s alarm. “If we don’t ever sleep again, so much the better,” José Arcadio Buendía said in good humor. “That way we can get more out of life.” But the Indian woman explained that the most fearsome part of the sickness of insomnia was not the impossibility of sleeping, for the body did not feel any fatigue at all, but its inexorable evolution toward a more critical manifestation: a loss of memory. She meant that when the sick person became used to his state of vigil, the recollection of his childhood began to be erased from his memory, then the name and notion of things, and finally the identity of people and even the awareness of his own being, until he sank into a kind of idiocy that had no past. José Arcadio Buendía, dying with laughter, thought that it was just a question of one of the many illnesses invented by the Indians’ superstitions. But Úrsula, just to be safe, took the precaution of isolating Rebeca from the other children.","Cataurê, Visitaxiôn's brother, ran away from home that night. His sister stayed because her fateful heart had told her that the deadly dangerous disease would follow her to the ends of the earth. No one understood Visitaxiôn's anxiety. ""If we can't sleep, all the better,"" José Arcadio Buendía said cheerfully, ""that way life will be more useful to us. "" But the Indian girl explained to them that the most frightening thing about insomnia was not the inability to sleep, because the body does not feel tired, but that if not treated in time, it would certainly lead to an even more serious disease, which is amnesia. That is, when the patient gets used to the state of insomnia, childhood memories will be erased from his mind, then the names and meanings of things, and finally his own identity and even the awareness of himself, will be erased from his memory, leaving everything to sink into an unprecedented state of idiocy. José Arcadio Buendía, feeling like laughing to death, remarked that the girl was talking about one of those diseases caused by the superstitions of the Indians. However, Úrsula, to be safe, carefully isolated Rebeca from the children.",21.808,21.389,"The next morning, they saw that the Indian Cataure had left the house. His sister did not go with him because a voice inside her said that even if he went to the other end of the world, this deadly disease would not leave him alone. No one could understand Visitacion's panic. Jose Arcadio Buendia, making a joke of it, said, The less we sleep, the better, that way we get more out of life. But the Indian woman explained at length that the most frightening aspect of the disease was not the sleeplessness, as it did not cause fatigue, but that it gradually became worse and led to memory loss. According to her, once someone got used to the sleeplessness, they first forgot memories from their childhood, then they gradually forgot the names and uses of objects, eventually they did not recognize people, forgot themselves, and fell into a void of memory without a past. Jose Arcadio Buendia, thinking it was one of the diseases stemming from Indian superstitions, laughed heartily. However, Ursula, just in case, separated Rebeca from the other children.",13.182,12.598,"Cataure, the Indian, did not wake up in the house. His sister stayed, because her fatalistic heart indicated to her that the lethal ailment would pursue her no matter what to the last corner of the earth. Nobody in the house understood Visitación's alarm. ""If we don't go back to sleep, even better,"" said José Arcadio Buendía, in good spirits. ""That way life will be more productive for us."" But the Indian woman explained to them that the most fearsome aspect of the insomnia disease was not the inability to sleep, since the body did not feel any fatigue, but its inexorable progression towards a more critical manifestation: forgetfulness. She meant that when the patient got used to their state of wakefulness, childhood memories began to fade from their memory, then the name and notion of things, and finally the identity of people and even the awareness of one's own self, until sinking into a kind of idiocy without a past.

96,"They had indeed contracted the illness of insomnia. Úrsula, who had learned from her mother the medicinal value of plants, prepared and made them all drink a brew of monkshood, but they could not get to sleep and spent the whole day dreaming on their feet. In that state of hallucinated lucidity, not only did they see the images of their own dreams, but some saw the images dreamed by others. It was as if the house were full of visitors. Sitting in her rocker in a corner of the kitchen, Rebeca dreamed that a man who looked very much like her, dressed in white linen and with his shirt collar closed by a gold button, was bringing her a bouquet of roses. He was accompanied by a woman with delicate hands who took out one rose and put it in the child’s hair. Úrsula understood that the man and woman were Rebeca’s parents, but even though she made a great effort to recognize them, she confirmed her certainty that she had never seen them. In the meantime, through an oversight that José Arcadio Buendía never forgave himself for, the candy animals made in the house were still being sold in the town. Children and adults sucked with delight on the delicious little green roosters of insomnia, the exquisite pink fish of insomnia, and the tender yellow ponies of insomnia, so that dawn on Monday found the whole town awake. No one was alarmed at first. On the contrary, they were happy at not sleeping because there was so much to do in Macondo in those days that there was barely enough time. They worked so hard that soon they had nothing else to do and they could be found at three o’clock in the morning with their arms crossed, counting the notes in the waltz of the clock. Those who wanted to sleep, not from fatigue but because of the nostalgia for dreams, tried all kinds of methods of exhausting themselves. They would gather together to converse endlessly, to tell over and over for hours on end the same jokes, to complicate to the limits of exasperation the story about the capon, which was an endless game in which the narrator asked if they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and when they answered yes, the narrator would say that he had not asked them to say yes, but whether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and when they answered no, the narrator told them that he had not asked them to say no, but whether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and when they remained silent the narrator told them that he had not asked them to remain silent but whether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and no one could leave because the narrator would say that he had not asked them to leave but whether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and so on and on in a vicious circle that lasted entire nights.","Indeed, the insomnia epidemic had spread to this place. Thanks to learning from her mother, Ucsula knew about some plants with healing properties. She crushed the leaves of the aconite plant to extract the juice for everyone to drink, but it was ineffective; no one could sleep, and instead, everyone spent the entire day dreaming while awake. In that state of wakeful dreaming, not only did people see the figures from their own dreams, but they also saw the figures from others' dreams. It was as if the house was crowded with guests. Sitting on the rocking chair placed in the kitchen corner, Rebecca dreamed of a man who looked very much like her, dressed in white linen clothes, with a gold button at his collar, bringing her a rose branch. A woman with delicate hands walking beside him plucked a rose and pinned it in the girl's hair. Ucsula understood that they were Rebecca's parents, but despite her efforts to recognize them, she had to admit that she had never seen them before. Meanwhile, due to an unfortunate oversight that José Arcadio Buendía would never forgive himself for: the animal-shaped candies produced in the house continued to be sold at the market. Children and adults delighted in sucking on the green chicken-shaped candies that had caught the insomnia, the pink fish-shaped candies that had caught the insomnia, the yellow horse-shaped candies that had caught the insomnia, so the dawn of the second day found the entire village awake. At first, no one panicked. On the contrary, everyone was delighted to be unable to sleep, because there was so much work to be done that they hardly had enough time. They worked so much that soon there was nothing left to do, and at three in the morning, they all sat with folded arms, counting each chime from the clocks. Those who wanted to sleep, not because they felt tired but because they missed their usual sleep, tried every necessary method to bring sleep to themselves, but all were ineffective. They gathered to chat endlessly, to repeat a single funny story for hours and hours, to drive everyone crazy with the story of the Capon chicken, which was a never-ending game where the storyteller would ask if the listeners wanted to hear the story of the Capon chicken, and when they answered yes, he would say he didn't ask them to say yes but if they wanted to hear the story of the Capon chicken, and when they answered no, he would say he didn't ask them to say no but if they wanted to hear the story of the Capon chicken, and when they stayed silent, he would say he didn't ask them to stay silent but if they wanted to hear the story of the Capon chicken, and no one could leave because the storyteller would say he didn't ask them to leave but if they wanted to hear the story of the Capon chicken, and so it went on in a vicious cycle throughout the long nights.",25.235,25.064,"Indeed, they had fallen victim to the affliction of insomnia. Ursula, who had learned the healing properties of plants from her mother, immediately brewed some aconite syrup and gave it to everyone to drink, but none of them could sleep, and they spent the evening daydreaming while standing. In this hallucinatory wakefulness, they not only saw the people in their own dreams but also those who appeared in others' dreams. It was as if a crowd of guests had filled the house. Rebeca, sitting in the rocking chair in the corner of the kitchen, saw a man who looked very much like her, dressed in white linens, bringing a bouquet of roses from under the top button of his shirt. The woman next to the man pulled a rose from the bouquet with her elegant hands and placed it in the child's hair. Ursula deduced that the man and woman were Rebeca's parents, but despite her efforts to recall where she knew them from, she ultimately concluded that she had never seen them in her life. While all this was happening, Jose Arcadio Buendia, having been careless and not taken precautions, allowed the animal-shaped sweets made at home to continue being sold in the town. Everyone from seven to seventy was sucking on those irresistible green roosters infected with insomnia, those beautiful pink fish soaked in insomnia, and those sweet little yellow foals dipped in insomnia. Thus, the sun that rose on Monday morning found the entire town awake. At first, no one panicked. On the contrary, they were happy not to sleep, because at that time there was so much work to be done in Macondo that no one had time to keep up. They worked so much that soon they were crossing their arms and counting the clock's chimes at three in the morning. Those who wanted to sleep not out of fatigue but simply because they missed dreaming tried every method they could think of to exhaust themselves and fall asleep. They gathered together and engaged in endless conversations, repeated the same jokes for hours on end, and stretched out the barren rooster story as much as they could. It was a tale that stretched on and on, the storyteller would ask, ""Shall I tell you the tale of the barren rooster?"" If they said yes, he would say, ""I didn't ask you to say yes, I asked if you wanted me to tell the tale of the barren rooster."" If the listeners said no, the storyteller would say, ""I didn't ask you to say no, I asked if you wanted the tale of the barren rooster,"" and he would get out of it that way. If no one made a sound, the storyteller would say, ""I didn't ask you to be silent, I asked if you wanted me to tell the tale of the barren rooster,"" and he would start all over again. If someone tried to leave, the storyteller would say, ""Did I tell you to leave? I asked if you wanted the tale of the barren rooster,"" and he would make them sit down, and thus the tale would go on and on, night after night, without end.",17.741,17.548,"They had indeed contracted the disease of insomnia. Úrsula, who had learned from her mother the medicinal value of plants, prepared and made everyone drink a concoction of aconite, but they did not manage to sleep; instead, they spent the whole day dreaming awake. In that state of hallucinatory lucidity, they not only saw the images of their own dreams, but also those dreamed by others. It was as if the house had been filled with visitors. Sitting in her rocking chair in a corner of the kitchen, Rebeca dreamed that a man very much like her, dressed in white linen and with the collar of his shirt closed by a gold button, brought her a bouquet of roses. He was accompanied by a woman with delicate hands who took a rose and placed it in the girl's hair. Úrsula understood that the man and woman were Rebeca's parents, but although she made a great effort to recognize them, she confirmed her certainty that she had never seen them before. Meanwhile, due to a carelessness that José Arcadio Buendía never forgave himself for, the little candy animals made in the house continued to be sold in the town. Children and adults delightedly sucked on the delicious green roosters of insomnia, the exquisite pink fish of insomnia, and the tender yellow horses of insomnia, so that the dawn of Monday found the whole town awake. At first, no one was alarmed. On the contrary, they were glad not to sleep, because there was so much to do in Macondo that time was barely enough. They worked so much that soon they had nothing left to do, and they found themselves at three in the morning with their arms crossed, counting the number of notes in the waltz of the clocks. Those who wanted to sleep, not out of tiredness but out of nostalgia for dreams, resorted to all kinds of exhausting methods.

All strangers walking the streets of Macondo during that time had to ring the bells to inform the sick that they were healthy. During their stay, they were not allowed to eat or drink anything because it was beyond doubt that the disease spread through the mouth, and moreover, all food and drink had been contaminated with insomnia. In this way, the epidemic was confined within the village's boundaries.

98,"It was Aureliano who conceived the formula that was to protect them against loss of memory for several months. He discovered it by chance. An expert insomniac, having been one of the first, he had learned the art of silverwork to perfection. One day he was looking for the small anvil that he used for laminating metals and he could not remember its name. His father told him: “Stake.” Aureliano wrote the name on a piece of paper that he pasted to the base of the small anvil: stake. In that way he was sure of not forgetting it in the future. It did not occur to him that this was the first manifestation of a loss of memory, because the object had a difficult name to remember. But a few days later be, discovered that he had trouble remembering almost every object in the laboratory. Then he marked them with their respective names so that all he had to do was read the inscription in order to identify them. When his father told him about his alarm at having forgotten even the most impressive happenings of his childhood, Aureliano explained his method to him, and José Arcadio Buendía put it into practice all through the house and later on imposed it on the whole village. With an inked brush he marked everything with its name: table, chair, clock, door, wall, bed, pan. He went to the corral and marked the animals and plants: cow, goat, pig, hen, cassava, caladium, banana. Little by little, studying the infinite possibilities of a loss of memory, he realized that the day might come when things would be recognized by their inscriptions but that no one would remember their use. Then he was more explicit. The sign that he hung on the neck of the cow was an exemplary proof of the way in which the inhabitants of Macondo were prepared to fight against loss of memory: This is the cow. She must be milked every morning so that she will produce milk, and the milk must be boiled in order to be mixed with coffee to make coffee and milk. Thus they went on living in a reality that was slipping away, momentarily captured by words, but which would escape irremediably when they forgot the values of the written letters.","Aureliano was the first person to find a remedy for memory loss. He discovered it by chance. As the person who had suffered from insomnia the longest in the village, he had trained to achieve a high level of skill in the craft of goldsmithing. One day, he was looking for a small anvil to thin metal and suddenly forgot where it was. Your father told you to call it a tas. Aureliano immediately wrote the word tas on a piece of paper and stuck it on the anvil stand. That way, he believed he would not forget its name in the future. He did not realize that forgetting the name was the first sign of amnesia, but simply thought it was because the tool had a very difficult name to remember. But a few days later, he discovered that he could not remember the names of the tools in the laboratory. So he wrote their names on each object, so just reading the name would allow him to recognize them. When his father shared his worry about forgetting all the deep memories from his childhood, Aureliano explained his method to him, and José Arcadio Buendía then applied this method to everyone in the house, and later to all the villagers. Using a branch dipped in ink, he wrote the name of each object: table, chair, clock, door, wall, bed, frying pan. Then he went to the garden and wrote on each animal and plant: cow, goat, pig, hen, cassava, taro, plantain. By exploring the infinite possibilities of amnesia, he gradually realized that a day might come when people would recognize objects by their written names but would not remember their uses in life. So it was necessary to write more clearly. The sign hanging on the cow's neck was a typical example of how the people of Macondo used this method to combat amnesia. This is a cow; every morning it must be milked, and the milk must be boiled to mix with coffee to make coffee with milk. Thus, the villagers lived in a slippery reality that could not be etched into memory, fleetingly recognized by the words written on paper but disappearing when the meanings of the words were forgotten.",27.355,27.154,"Aureliano accidentally discovered the formula that would prevent memory loss for at least a few months. Since he was one of the first to contract the disease, he had become an expert in this field and had also achieved perfect mastery in the art of silver processing. One day, while looking for the small anvil he used to hammer metal foils, he couldn't remember its name. He asked his father, and his father said ""Iskaça."" Aureliano wrote this down on a piece of paper and stuck it to the handle of the anvil: Iskaça. This way, he wouldn't forget it again. Since the name of the thing was already peculiar, it didn't occur to him that this might be the first sign of memory loss. But a few days later, he realized that he could hardly remember the names of any of the objects in the laboratory. So, he wrote down the names of all of them and stuck the labels on; now, when he looked at them, he knew what they were. When his father complained that he had come to forget even the most important memories of his childhood, Aureliano shared the method he had found with his father, and Jose Arcadio Buendia first applied it at home, then throughout the entire town. He dipped the brush in ink and wrote the name of everything on it: table, chair, clock, pot, wall, bed, pan. He went to the pen and labeled every animal and plant there with tags like cow, goat, pig, chicken, cassava, caladium, and banana. As he studied how far memory loss could go over time, he realized that they could deduce the names of objects from the tags, but would forget what they were used for. Then he took it a step further. The note he hung around the cow's neck is concrete evidence of how prepared the people of Macondo were against memory loss: This is called a cow. It needs to be milked every morning so that it gives milk, and the milk must be boiled to mix with coffee to make café con leche.

99,"At the beginning of the road into the swamp they put up a sign that said MACONDO and another larger one on the main street that said GOD EXISTS. In all the houses keys to memorizing objects and feelings had been written. But the system demanded so much vigilance and moral strength that many succumbed to the spell of an imaginary reality, one invented by themselves, which was less practical for them but more comforting. Pilar Ternera was the one who contributed most to popularize that mystification when she conceived the trick of reading the past in cards as she had read the future before. By means of that recourse the insomniacs began to live in a world built on the uncertain alternatives of the cards, where a father was remembered faintly as the dark man who had arrived at the beginning of April and a mother was remembered only as the dark woman who wore a gold ring on her left hand, and where a birth date was reduced to the last Tuesday on which a lark sang in the laurel tree. Defeated by those practices of consolation, José Arcadio Buendía then decided to build the memory machine that he had desired once in order to remember the marvelous inventions of the gypsies. The artifact was based on the possibility of reviewing every morning, from beginning to end, the totality of knowledge acquired during one’s life. He conceived of it as a spinning dictionary that a person placed on the axis could operate by means of a lever, so that in a very few hours there would pass before his eyes the notions most necessary for life. He had succeeded in writing almost fourteen thousand entries when along the road from the swamp a strange-looking old man with the sad sleepers’ bell appeared, carrying a bulging suitcase tied with a rope and pulling a cart covered with black cloth. He went straight to the house of José Arcadio Buendía.","Right at the entrance to the village of Macondo, a sign was erected that read: Macondo, and on the central road of the village, an even larger sign was erected that said ""God Exists"". To remember objects as well as human emotions, signs were hung in houses labeling each object and each type of emotion. But this memory system required so much observation and mental effort that many people surrendered to the joy of an imaginary world, one they themselves invented, which was more of a world of consolation than a world of action for them. Pilar Ternera contributed significantly to the spread of this deception when she sensed how to read the past in the cards, just as she had previously read the future through them. Using this method, the insomniacs began to live in a world constructed of vague, uncertain images in the cards, where the father almost remembered himself as a tanned man who had just arrived here at the beginning of April, and the mother almost remembered herself as a young woman with jet-black hair, still wearing a gold label on her left hand, and where a birthday seemed to have just been celebrated last Tuesday, with the lark's song still echoing in the laurel tree. Defeated by these comforting tricks, José Arcadio Buendía resolved to create a memory machine he had always wished for, to remember the marvelous inventions of the gypsies. Every morning, this machine was supposed to be capable of reviewing all the knowledge acquired in life from beginning to end. He imagined it as a self-rotating dictionary that a person sitting at the axis, using a crank, could make the knowledge of life appear before their eyes in just a few hours. He wrote fourteen thousand index cards. At that very moment, on the road from the swamp to the village, an eccentric old man appeared, holding a small bell that rang with the sad sound of a sleepy person, carrying a bulging suitcase tied carefully with ropes, pushing a small cart covered with dark patches of cloth. He went straight to the house of José Arcadio Buendía.",24.044,23.803,"They placed a sign that read Macondo at the beginning of the road leading to the swamp. They hung a sign that read God Exists on the main street. In all the houses, writings were put up to remind people of objects and emotions. But this system required such great attention and strong nerves that most people succumbed to the enchantment of a self-invented, useless but comforting imaginary reality. Pilar Ternera, who once read the future by laying out cards, now played the biggest role in spreading this deception by claiming to read the past. In this way, those afflicted by the insomnia plague began to live in a world built on the uncertain possibilities of the cards. According to the cards, someone's father was the dark-skinned man who arrived at the beginning of April, someone's mother was the dark-skinned woman who wore a gold ring on her left hand, and someone's birthday was the last Tuesday when the skylark perched on the laurel branch and sang. In the face of these means of distraction, Jose Arcadio Buendio, who had fallen into despondency, decided to create the memory machine he had once planned to make in order to remember the unique inventions of the gypsies. This marvel, created by human hands, was based on the idea of refreshing all the knowledge acquired throughout a lifetime every morning from start to finish. He was designing it in the form of a rotating dictionary. By turning the handle mounted on the axis of the dictionary, the wheel would spin, and the most essential information in a person's life would pass before their eyes within a few hours. Just as he was finishing writing almost fourteen thousand articles, a strange-looking person appeared, pulling a black cloth-covered handcart with a tightly packed suitcase tied with a rope in his hand, and ringing the mournful bell of the sleepers, coming from the road out of the swamp.

He gave José Arcadio Buendía a drink of a pleasantly scented liquid, and immediately his memory brightened.

It was Melquíades.",59.21,59.079
101,"While Macondo was celebrating the recovery of its memory, José Arcadio Buendía and Melquíades dusted off their old friendship. The gypsy was inclined to stay in the town. He really had been through death, but he had returned because he could not bear the solitude. Repudiated by his tribe, having lost all of his supernatural faculties because of his faithfulness to life, he decided to take refuge in that corner of the world which had still not been discovered by death, dedicated to the operation of a daguerreotype laboratory. José Arcadio Buendía had never heard of that invention. But when he saw himself and his whole family fastened onto a sheet of iridescent metal for an eternity, he was mute with stupefaction. That was the date of the oxidized daguerreotype in which José Arcadio Buendía appeared with his bristly and graying hair, his card board collar attached to his shirt by a copper button, and an expression of startled solemnity, whom Úrsula described, dying with laughter, as a “frightened general.” José Arcadio Buendía was, in fact, frightened on that dear December morning when the daguerreotype was made, for he was thinking that people were slowly wearing away while his image would endure an a metallic plaque. Through a curious reversal of custom, it was Úrsula who got that idea out of his head, as it was also she who forgot her ancient bitterness and decided that Melquíades would stay on in the house, although she never permitted them to make a daguerreotype of her because (according to her very words) she did not want to survive as a laughingstock for her grandchildren. That morning she dressed the children in their best clothes, powdered their faces, and gave a spoonful of marrow syrup to each one so that they would all remain absolutely motionless during the nearly two minutes in front of Melquíades fantastic camera. In the family daguerreotype, the only one that ever existed, Aureliano appeared dressed in black velvet between Amaranta and Rebeca. He had the same languor and the same clairvoyant look that he would have years later as he faced the firing squad. But he still had not sensed the premonition of his fate. He was an expert silversmith, praised all over the swampland for the delicacy of his work. In the workshop, which he shared with Melquíades’ mad laboratory, he could barely be heard breathing. He seemed to be taking refuge in some other time, while his father and the gypsy with shouts interpreted the predictions of Nostradamus amidst a noise of flasks and trays and the disaster of spilled acids and silver bromide that was lost in the twists and turns it gave at every instant. That dedication to his work, the good judgment with which he directed his attention, had allowed Aureliano to earn in a short time more money than Úrsula had with her delicious candy fauna, but everybody thought it strange that he was now a full-grown man and had not known a woman. It was true that he had never had one.","While Macondo was celebrating the recovery of its memory, José Arcadio Buendía and Melquíades rekindled their old friendship, which had long been covered in the dust of time. The gypsy decided to stay in the village. Indeed, he had been in the realm of the dead and had fled back here because he could no longer bear the loneliness. Abandoned by his tribe, stripped of his supernatural powers, all of this seemed like a punishment for his loyalty to life. He had resolved to flee to this corner of the world, unnoticed by death, and devoted himself to the profession of daguerreotype photography. José Arcadio Buendía had never heard of this invention. But when he saw himself and his family eternally captured on a shimmering metal plate, he stood there in a daze. A photograph from that time, now tarnished, still exists, showing José Arcadio Buendía with graying curly hair, a brass button fastening the collar of his shirt, and an expression of solemn fear that made Úrsula laugh and describe him as ""a terrified general."" Indeed, José Arcadio Buendía was terrified on that December morning when the photograph was taken, because he thought that people would gradually disappear as his image appeared on the metal plate. By a strange reversal of habits, it was Úrsula who had planted this idea in his mind, and she, who had forgotten her previous discomforts, agreed to let Melquíades stay in their house, although she never allowed him to photograph her because (as she said) she did not want to exist in such a way to mock her grandchildren. That morning, she dressed beautifully to visit the children, applied powder to them, and then gave each one a spoonful of marrow porridge so they could stand still for two minutes in front of Menkyadet's camera. In the photograph of the long-lost family, Aureliano, dressed in black wool, stood between Amaranta and Rebeca. He bore a melancholic look and sharp eyes that, many years later, remained unchanged when he faced the firing squad; at that time, he still had no premonition of his fate. He had become a skilled jeweler admired throughout the region. In the workshop, which was set up alongside Menkyadet's noisy laboratory, it seemed as if he had escaped into another era to work to the point where he could no longer hear himself breathe; meanwhile, his father and Menkyadet loudly debated Nostradamus's prophecies. The words echoed amidst the clinking of bottles and cups containing solutions, and the misfortune of spilled acid and scattered silver spoons caused by occasional elbow bumps and slips. The wholehearted dedication to work, the correct concept guiding all his interests, had allowed him in a short time to earn a sum of money larger than what Ursula had earned from her delicious animal-shaped candies, but everyone was surprised that although he was already a grown man, he still hadn't known a woman. In truth, he had never been with anyone.",24.049,23.876,"While the people of Macondo were celebrating their regained memories, Jose Arcadio Buendia and Melquiades rekindled their dormant friendship. The gypsy intended to stay in the town. He had indeed gone to the other world, but had returned because he couldn't bear the loneliness. Rejected by his tribe, having lost his supernatural powers due to his attachment to life, he decided to retreat to this remote corner where death had not yet been discovered and dedicate himself to taking photographs on zinc plates. Jose Arcadio Buendia was unaware of this invention. But he was struck dumb with amazement when he saw himself and all his family members depicted forever on an iridescent metal plate. The photograph, which showed Jose Arcadio Buendia with his grizzled and spiky hair, his shirt fastened with a cardboard collar held by a copper button, and that bewildered seriousness that Ursula mocked by saying he looked like a frightened general, dated back to that time. On that clear December morning when the photograph was taken, Jose Arcadio Buendia, thinking that while everyone else would slowly fade away, he would remain forever on a metal plate, was genuinely scared. This time, contrary to the usual, it was Ursula who calmed him down and erased this thought from his mind, deciding to let Melquiades stay in the house, having forgotten her old grudge, but she never agreed to have her photograph taken, as she (in her own words) did not want to become a source of amusement for her grandchildren. That morning, she dressed the children in their holiday clothes, powdered their faces, and gave each of them a spoonful of marrow broth so they could stand still for about two minutes in front of Melquiades' incredible machine without moving a muscle. In that unique family photograph, Aureliano, dressed in black velvet, was standing between Amaranta and Rebeca. On his face was that reluctant expression, reflecting his clairvoyant sensitivity, which he would have years later when he faced the firing squad. But he had not yet foreseen what would happen to him. He was a master silversmith, renowned throughout the swampy region for the delicacy of his work. He worked silently in the workshop he shared with Melquiades. While his father and the gypsy, amidst the clinking of bottles and trays, the spilling acids, and the constant shimmer of silver bromide appearing and disappearing on the photographic plate, loudly tried to decipher Nostradamus' prophecies, Aureliano seemed to escape and take refuge in another time. Due to his dedication and meticulousness in his work, Aureliano soon earned more money than Ursula did from her sweets, but everyone found it strange that, despite being a grown man, he had no relationships with any women. Indeed, he had not yet touched a woman's hand.",21.955,21.78,"While Macondo celebrated the reconquest of memories, José Arcadio Buendía and Melquíades dusted off their old friendship.

But when he saw himself and his entire family captured in an eternal age on an iridescent metal plate, he was left speechless with astonishment. From that time dated the rusted daguerreotype in which José Arcadio Buendía appeared with bristly and ashen hair, the stiff collar of his shirt fastened with a copper button, and an expression of astonished solemnity, which Úrsula described, laughing to death, as ""a frightened general. ""In truth, José Arcadio Buendía was frightened on that clear December morning when they took the daguerreotype, because he thought that people would gradually wear out as their image passed onto the metal plates.

102,"Several months later saw the return of Francisco the Man, as ancient vagabond who was almost two hundred years old and who frequently passed through Macondo distributing songs that he composed himself. In them Francisco the Man told in great detail the things that had happened in the towns along his route, from Manaure to the edge of the swamp, so that if anyone had a message to send or an event to make public, he would pay him two cents to include it in his repertory. That was how Úrsula learned of the death of her mother, as a simple consequence of listening to the songs in the hope that they would say something about her son José Arcadio. Francisco the Man, called that because he had once defeated the devil in a duel of improvisation, and whose real name no one knew, disappeared from Macondo during the insomnia plague and one night he appeared suddenly in Catarino’s store. The whole town went to listen to him to find out what had happened in the world. On that occasion there arrived with him a woman who was so fat that four Indians had to carry her in a rocking chair, and an adolescent mulatto girl with a forlorn look who protected her from the sun with an umbrella. Aureliano went to Catarino’s store that night. He found Francisco the Man, like a monolithic chameleon, sitting in the midst of a circle of bystanders. He was singing the news with his old, out-of-tune voice, accompanying himself with the same archaic accordion that Sir Walter Raleigh had given him in the Guianas and keeping time with his great walking feet that were cracked from saltpeter. In front of a door at the rear through which men were going and coming, the matron of the rocking chair was sitting and fanning herself in silence. Catarino, with a felt rose behind his ear, was selling the gathering mugs of fermented cane juice, and he took advantage of the occasion to go over to the men and put his hand on them where he should not have. Toward midnight the heat was unbearable. Aureliano listened to the news to the end without hearing anything that was of interest to his family. He was getting ready to go home when the matron signaled him with her hand.","A few months later, old Francisco - The Man, a nearly two-hundred-year-old wanderer who often passed through Macondo to spread songs he composed himself, returned to the village. In these songs, old Francisco - The Man recounted in detail the events that happened along his journeys, from the village of Manaure to the remotest corners of the swampy regions, so if anyone wanted to send a message or announce an event, they could pay him two cents to include it in his program. Thanks to this, one night Úrsula listened to his songs with the hope that they would mention José Arcadio, and she accidentally learned of her mother's passing. He was called Francisco - The Man because in a singing contest he had defeated the devil, and besides, no one knew his real name. During the insomnia epidemic that plagued the village of Macondo, he quietly disappeared, and now, without any prior notice, he was back in Catarino's store. The whole village flocked to hear him to see what new things had happened in the world. On this occasion, accompanying him was a fat woman sitting on a rocking chair carried by four Indian porters, with a lonely-looking mixed-race girl holding an umbrella to shade her. That night, Aureliano went to Catarino's store. He saw old Francisco - The Man, like a petrified chameleon, sitting among the curious crowd listening to his tales... With a wheezing voice accompanied by an old accordion, which had been given to him by Mr. Oante Rahch on the island of Goadana. He sang to tell the news, while his large, rough, cracked feet from walking through sulfur mines kept stomping to keep the rhythm. The madam sat on a rocking chair, fanning herself at the back door where some men were coming and going. With a felt rose tucked behind his ear, Catarino sold glasses of guarapo - nearly everyone placed their hands on him right where they shouldn't. As the night wore on, the heat became unbearable. Aureliano sat and listened to the news until the end of the program but found nothing useful for his family. As he was preparing to go home, the madam pointed her finger, signaling to him:",16.933,16.612,"A few months later, Francisco the Devil-Breaker showed up. This two-hundred-year-old vagabond would come and go to Macondo every now and then, spreading the folk songs he wrote and composed himself. In these songs, Francisco the Devil-Breaker would recount the events that happened in the towns along the road from Manaure to the edge of the swamp. Therefore, anyone who wanted to convey a message or announce something from one town to another would slip two coins into Francisco's palm, and he would include the news in his song. Listening to these songs in the hope of hearing news from her son Jose Arcadio, Ursula learned of her mother's death in this way. Francisco, who became famous as Francisco the Devil-Breaker for defeating the devil in an impromptu folk song contest and whose real name no one knew, had slipped away from Macondo during the insomnia plague. One night, just as suddenly as he had left, he appeared in Catarino's shop. When he arrived this time, there was a woman with him who was so fat that she couldn't lift herself up and walk. Four Native Americans were carrying the woman from place to place with a rocking chair that they could barely move, and a melancholy-faced young mestizo girl was staying by the woman's side with an umbrella to keep the sun off her head. That night, Aureliano went to Cacarino's shop. Francisco was sitting in the middle of a circle of listeners, like a chameleon carved from a single piece of stone, playing that same old accordion given to him by Sir Walter Raleigh in Guiana, tapping the rhythm with his feet, which were cracked from saltpeter and accustomed to stomping, and singing news with his familiar, raspy voice. In front of the large door at the back, where people were constantly coming and going, the owner of the rocking chair sat silently, fanning herself. Catarino, with an artificial rose tucked behind his ear, was selling pitcher after pitcher of sugarcane juice to the gathered crowd, while also taking the opportunity to grope the men here and there. By midnight, the heat became unbearable. Aureliano listened to the news until the end, but heard nothing that concerned his family. Just as he was about to head home, a fat woman gestured and called him over.",20.429,20.171,"Months later, Francisco the Man returned, an elderly wanderer of almost 200 years who frequently passed through Macondo, spreading the songs he composed himself. In them, Francisco the Man recounted with meticulous details the news that occurred in the towns along his route, from Manaure to the edges of the swamp, so that if someone had a message to send or an event to publicize, they paid him two cents to include it in his repertoire. This was how Úrsula learned of her mother's death, purely by chance, one night when she was listening to the songs hoping they would say something about her son José Arcadio. Francisco the Man, so called because he defeated the devil in a duel of improvised songs, and whose real name no one knew, disappeared from Macondo during the insomnia plague and one night reappeared without any announcement in Catarino's store.

Aureliano went to Catarino's store that night. He found Francisco the Man, like a monolithic chameleon, sitting in the middle of a circle of curious onlookers. He sang the news with his old, hoarse voice, accompanying himself with the same archaic accordion that Sir Walter Raleigh had given him in Guiana, while he kept the rhythm with his large, salt-cracked walking feet. In front of a back door through which some men were entering and leaving, the matron of the rocker was sitting and fanning herself in silence.

104,"Aureliano threw a coin into the hopper that the matron had in her lap and went into the room without knowing why. The adolescent mulatto girl, with her small bitch’s teats, was naked on the bed. Before Aureliano sixty-three men had passed through the room that night. From being used so much, kneaded with sweat and sighs, the air in the room had begun to turn to mud. The girl took off the soaked sheet and asked Aureliano to hold it by one side. It was as heavy as a piece of canvas. They squeezed it, twisting it at the ends until it regained its natural weight. They turned over the mat and the sweat came out of the other side. Aureliano was anxious for that operation never to end. He knew the theoretical mechanics of love, but he could not stay on his feet because of the weakness of his knees, and although he had goose pimples on his burning skin he could not resist the urgent need to expel the weight of his bowels. When the girl finished fixing up the bed and told him to get undressed, he gave her a confused explanation: “They made me come in. They told me to throw twenty cents into the hopper and hurry up.” The girl understood his confusion. “If you throw in twenty cents more when you go out, you can stay a little longer,” she said softly. Aureliano got undressed, tormented by shame, unable to get rid of the idea that-his nakedness could not stand comparison with that of his brother. In spite of the girl’s efforts he felt more and more indifferent and terribly alone. “I’ll throw in other twenty cents,” he said with a desolate voice. The girl thanked him in silence. Her back was raw. Her skin was stuck to her ribs and her breathing was forced because of an immeasurable exhaustion. Two years before, far away from there, she had fallen asleep without putting out the candle and had awakened surrounded by flames. The house where she lived with the grandmother who had raised her was reduced to ashes. Since then her grandmother carried her from town to town, putting her to bed for twenty cents in order to make up the value of the burned house. According to the girl’s calculations, she still had ten years of seventy men per night, because she also had to pay the expenses of the trip and food for both of them as well as the pay of the Indians who carried the rocking chair. When the matron knocked on the door the second time, Aureliano left the room without having done anything, troubled by a desire to weep. That night he could not sleep, thinking about the girl, with a mixture of desire and pity. He felt an irresistible need to love her and protect her. At dawn, worn out by insomnia and fever, he made the calm decision to marry her in order to free her from the despotism of her grandmother and to enjoy all the nights of satisfaction that she would give the seventy men. But at ten o’clock in the morning, when he reached Catarino’s store, the girl had left town.","Aureliano put two dimes into the dish the woman held at her side and then stepped into the room without knowing what to do. The mixed-race girl was lying naked on the bed with breasts that looked like a dog's. That night, before Aureliano entered, sixty-three men had already passed through this room. The air in the room, thickened by the sweat and breath of so many people, had started to condense into a muddy substance. The girl stripped the soaking wet bed sheet and asked Aureliano to hold one end. It was extremely heavy. The two of them twisted the ends of the sheet until it was wrung dry. They tilted the bed, and sweat streamed down the tilted side, dripping onto the floor. Aureliano fervently wished that this task would never end. In theory, he knew the art of lovemaking, but his knees were weak, and despite his skin being covered in goosebumps and feeling feverish, he couldn't suppress the urgent need to pass gas. When the bed was made, the girl ordered him to undress, and he clumsily explained, ""They told me to come in. They told me to put two dimes in the money dish and not to delay."" The girl understood his anxiety. ""If you put two more dimes at the exit, you can stay a few more minutes,"" she said gently. Aureliano undressed, looking miserable with shame, unable to shake off the thought that his naked body could not compare to his brother's robust physique. Despite the girl's attempts to be seductive, he still felt lonely, terribly lonely. ""I'll add two more cents,"" he said in a dejected voice. The girl quietly thanked him. Her back was bright red. Her skin clung to her bones, revealing each rib, and her breath was rapid and erratic, full of exhaustion. Two years ago, in a distant village, the girl had fallen asleep without extinguishing a candle, and when she awoke, she was right next to the fire. The house where she lived with her grandmother, who had raised her since she was a baby, had turned to ashes. Since then, her grandmother had taken her from village to village, forcing her to sleep with men for two cents each time to save up enough to compensate for the value of the burned house. According to the girl's calculations, she still had more than ten years to go, offering herself every night to seventy men, because besides paying her grandmother, she also had to earn enough to cover travel expenses, food for both of them, and wages for the Indians who carried the rocking chair. When the madam knocked on the door for the second time, Aureliano left the room without having done anything, feeling so pained he wanted to cry. That night, he did not sleep, only thinking about the girl with a mix of love and pity. He felt both love and a desire to protect the girl. It was an intense feeling that could not be stopped. At dawn, exhausted from lack of sleep and fever, he made a healthy decision: he would marry the girl to free her from her grandmother's control and to enjoy with her the nights of pleasure she had to share with seventy men. But at ten in the morning, when he arrived at Catarino's store, the girl had already left the village.",25.523,25.38,"Aureliano, without understanding why, threw the money into the bowl on the woman's lap and entered the room. The young mestizo girl was lying completely naked with tiny dog-like breasts. That night, sixty-three men had been with her before Aureliano. The air in the room had started to thicken with sweat and breath, becoming almost muddy. The girl pulled the soaking sheet and handed one end to Aureliano. The sheet had become as heavy as a sailcloth. They twisted it from both ends, wringing out the water until it returned to its normal weight. They flipped the mattress over, but the sweat had soaked through to the other side as well. Aureliano was hoping these tasks would never end. Although he knew about love games from hearsay, his legs were so weak that he could barely stand, and despite being in his adolescence, his face was burning like fire and he was almost about to wet himself out of fear. When the girl made the bed and told him to undress, Aureliano started to stammer: They forced me in here. They said, throw twenty cents into the bowl and be quick about it. The girl understood his confusion. In a soft voice, she said, if you throw another twenty cents when you leave, you can stay inside longer. Aureliano, comparing his own naked state with his brother's, undressed, sinking into the ground with shame. No matter how much effort the girl put in, Aureliano became increasingly indifferent, increasingly withdrawn. In a miserable voice, he muttered, I'll throw in another twenty cents. The girl thanked him quietly. Her back was peeling from lying down so much. Her skin clung to her ribs, and she was breathless from deadly exhaustion. Two years ago, in a place far away, he had fallen asleep without extinguishing the candle and woke up surrounded by flames. The house he lived in with his grandmother had burned down to ashes. After that, his grandmother started taking him from town to town, and to make up for the burned house, she had him sleep with anyone who could pay twenty cents. According to the girl's calculations, she needed to sleep with seventy people a night for another ten years, because she had to cover the travel and food expenses not only for herself and her grandmother but also for the Indians carrying the rocking chair. When Mama knocked on the door for the second time, Aureliano, unable to accomplish anything, left the room on the verge of tears. That night, he spent thinking about the girl, on one hand with desire, on the other with pity, until morning. He felt an irresistible urge to love and protect her. At dawn, exhausted from sleeplessness and the fire of desire, he made his decision: He would marry her to save her from her tyrannical grandmother and to savor those fulfilling nights shared by seventy men alone. However, when he arrived at Catarino's shop at ten in the morning, the girl had already left town.",21.161,20.967,"Aureliano tossed a coin into the piggy bank that the matron had on her lap and entered the room without knowing why.

105,"Time mitigated his mad proposal, but it aggravated his feelings of frustration. He took refuge in work. He resigned himself to being a womanless man for all his life in order to hide the shame of his uselessness. In the meantime, Melquíades had printed on his plates everything that was printable in Macondo, and he left the daguerreotype laboratory to the fantasies of José Arcadio Buendía who had resolved to use it to obtain scientific proof of the existence of God. Through a complicated process of superimposed exposures taken in different parts of the house, he was sure that sooner or later he would get a daguerreotype of God, if He existed, or put an end once and for all to the supposition of His existence. Melquíades got deeper into his interpretations of Nostradamus. He would stay up until very late, suffocating in his faded velvet vest, scribbling with his tiny sparrow hands, whose rings had lost the glow of former times. One night he thought he had found a prediction of the future of Macondo. It was to be a luminous city with great glass houses where there was no trace remaining of the race of the Buendía. “It’s a mistake,” José Arcadio Buendía thundered. “They won’t be houses of glass but of ice, as I dreamed, and there will always be a Buendía, per omnia secula seculorum.” Úrsula fought to preserve common sense in that extravagant house, having broadened her business of little candy animals with an oven that went all night turning out baskets and more baskets of bread and a prodigious variety of puddings, meringues, and cookies, which disappeared in a few hours on the roads winding through the swamp. She had reached an age where she had a right to rest, but she was nonetheless more and more active. So busy was she in her prosperous enterprises that one afternoon she looked distractedly toward the courtyard while the Indian woman helped her sweeten the dough and she saw two unknown and beautiful adolescent girls doing frame embroidery in the light of the sunset. They were Rebeca and Amaranta. As soon as they had taken off the mourning clothes for their grandmother, which they wore with inflexible rigor for three years, their bright clothes seemed to have given them a new place in the world. Rebeca, contrary to what might have been expected, was the more beautiful. She had a light complexion, large and peaceful eyes, and magical hands that seemed to work out the design of the embroidery with invisible threads. Amaranta, the younger, was somewhat graceless, but she had the natural distinction, the inner tightness of her dead grandmother. Next to them, although he was already revealing the physical drive of his father, Arcadio looked like a child. He set about learning the art of silverwork with Aureliano, who had also taught him how to read and write. Úrsula suddenly realized that the house had become full of people, that her children were on the point of marrying and having children, and that they would be obliged to scatter for lack of space. Then she took out the money she had accumulated over long years of hard labor, made some arrangements with her customers, and undertook the enlargement of the house. She had a formal parlor for visits built, another one that was more comfortable and cool for daily use, a dining room with a table with twelve places where the family could sit with all of their guests, nine bedrooms with windows on the courtyard and a long porch protected from the heat of noon by a rose garden with a railing on which to place pots of ferns and begonias. She had the kitchen enlarged to hold two ovens. The granary where Pilar Ternera had read José Arcadio’s future was torn down and another twice as large built so that there would never be a lack of food in the house. She had baths built is the courtyard in the shade of the chestnut tree, one for the women and another for the men, and in the rear a large stable, a fenced-in chicken yard, a shed for the milk cows, and an aviary open to the four winds so that wandering birds could roost there at their pleasure. Followed by dozens of masons and carpenters, as if she had contracted her husband’s hallucinating fever, Úrsula fixed the position of light and heat and distributed space without the least sense of its limitations. The primitive building of the founders became filled with tools and materials, of workmen exhausted by sweat, who asked everybody please not to molest them, exasperated by the sack of bones that followed them everywhere with its dull rattle. In that discomfort, breathing quicklime and tar, no one could see very well how from the bowels of the earth there was rising not only the largest house is the town, but the most hospitable and cool house that had ever existed in the region of the swamp. José Buendía, trying to surprise Divine Providence in the midst of the cataclysm, was the one who least understood it. The new house was almost finished when Úrsula drew him out of his chimerical world in order to inform him that she had an order to paint the front blue and not white as they had wanted. She showed him the official document. José Arcadio Buendía, without understanding what his wife was talking about, deciphered the signature.","Time gradually soothed Auréliano's naive intentions, but it deepened his sense of failure. He buried himself in work. He resolved to remain single for life, to bury the shameful thought of considering himself useless. Meanwhile, Melquíades had finished recording on his films everything that could be captured in the village of Macondo and had left the darkroom to the passions of José Arcadio Buendía, who had decided to use it for a scientific experiment to prove the existence of God. Through a complex process of presenting photographs taken at different locations in the house, he was convinced that sooner or later there would be a photograph of God, if God indeed existed, and at the same time, it would end all speculation about His existence. Melquíades delved deeper into the teachings of Nostradamus. He worked until dusk, suffocating in his faded felt coat, with his tiny sparrow-like hands, the rings on his fingers having lost their luster from times past, scribbling on sheets of paper. One night, he thought he had found a prophecy about the future of Macondo. It could become a radiant city, with enormous crystal buildings, where there would be no trace of the Buendía lineage. "" That is a mistake,"" José Arcadio Buendía angrily said. "" Those are not crystal buildings, but ice buildings, as I have seen in my dreams, and no matter how many centuries pass, there will always be a Buendía. "" In that bizarre house, Úrsula was the one trying to maintain a normal atmosphere by expanding the business of making candy figurines, with an oven that in one night produced baskets and baskets of bread, and batches of puddings, cakes, and biscuits that within a few hours spread throughout the paths of the swampy region. Though she was of an age to rest, she became even more active. So busy with these profitable tasks, that one afternoon, while the Indian girl helping her mixed honey into the dough, she looked out into the yard and saw two beautiful, unfamiliar young women sitting and embroidering under the sunset light. They were Rebeca and Amaranta. They had just finished mourning their grandmother, a mourning they had persistently observed for three long years, and now their colorful clothes seemed to place them in a new phase of life. Completely contrary to what might await her in the future, Rebecca was the most beautiful girl. She had skin as white as celery, large and deep eyes, and dexterous hands that seemed to be weaving invisible threads on an embroidered tapestry. Amaranta, the younger girl, though slightly less graceful, had a natural elegance, an inner tranquility inherited from her late grandmother. Beside the two girls was Arcadio. Despite having inherited his father's stature, Arcadio was still just a little boy. He decided to learn the trade of a jeweler under the guidance of Aureliano, who, besides teaching the trade, also taught the boy to read and write. Immediately, Ursula realized that her house would soon be cramped, that her children were of marriageable age and would have children of their own, and due to lack of space, they would be forced to scatter. So she took the money she had saved over many years of hard work, made contracts with her clients, and began expanding the house. She decided to build two living rooms, one of which would be fully equipped and more airy for daily use, and a dining room large enough to accommodate a big dining table with twelve seats for family and guests to dine together, nine bedrooms all with windows opening to the yard, and a long corridor with balconies holding pots of ferns and begonias, outside of which was a rose garden shielding from the harsh midday sun. She also decided to demolish the old kitchen to build two ovens; to dismantle the old corn warehouse where Pila Tecnêra had read José Arcadio's fortune through the cards, to construct a new warehouse twice as large, sufficient to store food supplies for many years. She decided to erect a male bathhouse and a female bathhouse, and at the end of the yard, a large stable, a chicken coop with wire mesh, a milking barn, and an aviary with open doors to welcome birds that could freely come and go. Followed by dozens of carpenters and masons, as if she had caught her husband's gold fever, Úrsula arranged the positions for light and ventilation, dividing the spaces without forgetting their boundaries. The house, originally built by the pioneering ancestors, suddenly became crowded with saws, chisels, and construction materials, and the tired, sweaty workers were asking everyone else not to disturb the objects, unaware that they themselves were the ones causing all the disruption. They went mad because of the bag of human bones that rattled, clattering everywhere they went. In the unpleasant scene of having to breathe the strong smell of lime and tar, no one understood why a house was rising from the ground, not only larger than any seen in the village but also the most hospitable and coolest ever in the entire swamp region. José Arcadio Buendía, who thought he would astonish the Almighty with the great changes, was the one who understood it the least. When the house was nearly complete, Úrsula pulled him out of his dream world to inform him that there was an order requiring the front walls of all houses to be painted blue instead of white, as the villagers preferred. She showed him the paper with the official order written on it. José Arcadio Buendía, still not understanding what his wife was saying, was trying to read the signature:",19.589,19.474,"As time extinguished this mad desire to marry, it also increased his sense of emptiness. He threw himself into his work with all his might. To hide the shame of his uselessness, he vowed to remain without a woman for life. Meanwhile, Melquiades had printed everything in Macondo that could be photographed onto zinc plates and had left the photo lab to Jose Arcadio Buendia, who had decided to use it to scientifically prove the existence of God. Jose Arcadio Buendia was convinced that by taking overlapping photographs in different parts of the house, he would eventually capture an image of God, if He existed, or put an end to the claims about God's existence. Melquiades devoted himself entirely to interpreting Nostradamus's prophecies. He would sit until late hours, gasping for breath in his faded velvet vest, scribbling with his sparrow-like hands adorned with rings that had lost their former brilliance. One night, he thought he had found a prophecy foretelling the future of Macondo. Macondo will be a town full of glittering large houses made of glass, and there will be no trace left of the Buendia lineage. Jose Arcadio Buendia roared, ""That's wrong, the houses will be made of ice as I saw in my dream, not glass, and the Buendia lineage will endure as long as the world exists, per omnia secula seculorum."" Ursula was doing her best to maintain common sense in this house full of excesses. Meanwhile, she had expanded her candy-making business, establishing a large bakery. The bakery worked all night, producing baskets of bread, buns, and cookies, and the goods from the oven were transported and sold out within hours along the roads winding through the swamp. Ursula had reached the age where she could sit back and rest, yet she was working harder with each passing day. She was so engrossed in her money-making ventures that one day, while adding sugar to the dough with the Indian woman, her eyes drifted to the garden, where she saw two beautiful girls she didn't recognize, sitting under the sun and working on embroidery. These were Rebeca and Amaranta. As soon as they discarded the mourning clothes they had stubbornly worn for three years after their grandmother's death, the colorful clothes they wore seemed to have earned them a whole new place in the world. Contrary to expectations, the more beautiful of the girls was Rebeca. She was a fair-skinned girl with large, calming eyes, and skillful hands that seemed to embroider patterns with invisible threads. The younger Amaranta was a bit rough, but she had inherited her late grandmother's natural charm and resilience. Although it was clear she would be as tall and imposing as her father, Arcadio looked like a child next to them. Arcadio had learned to read and write from Aureliano and was now trying to master silverwork. It suddenly dawned on Úrsula that the house was filled with grown-ups, and she realized that her children were almost old enough to get married and start their own families, and that they would scatter due to the lack of space in the house. So, she took out the money she had saved up over the years, collected a bit more from her customers, and set about expanding the house. She added a guest room for occasional visitors, a daily sitting room, a dining room with a table that could seat twelve people, nine bedrooms overlooking the garden, and a terrace that would be shaded by the rose garden in the afternoon heat, with ferns and begonia pots lined up along its railings. She also enlarged the kitchen to fit two stoves. The pantry where Pilar Ternera had read José Arcadio's fortune was demolished and replaced with a new pantry twice its size to ensure there would never be a shortage of food in the house. Ursula had two outhouses built under the shade of the chestnut tree in the garden, one for women and the other for men, a large barn in the back garden, a chicken coop surrounded by wire mesh, a shed for the milk-giving cows, and an aviary open to the wind from all sides so that the passing birds could perch as they pleased. Just like her husband, who seemed to be in a feverish delirium, Ursula would follow with a troop of masons and carpenters, deciding where the light and heat would come from, and without worrying about keeping the job small, she was creating a spacious place. The primitive structure built by the village founders was filled with tools, materials, and workers who, tired of the clattering bone sack that followed them wherever they went, would tell anyone who would listen not to be a hindrance. In the chaos where the smell of quicklime and tar filled the entire town and everyone's lungs, no one noticed how not only the largest structure in the town but also the coolest house ever built in the swampy region, with its doors always open to guests, suddenly rose as if it had sprouted from the ground. In the chaos, Jose Arcadio Buendia, who tried to catch God off guard and take His picture, was the person who understood the least about how the house was built and completed. As the house neared completion, Ursula informed her husband, pulling him out of his dream world, that she had received orders to paint the facade blue instead of white as they wanted. She showed the official document. Not understanding what his wife was talking about, Jose Arcadio Buendia read the signature at the bottom of the paper.",23.83,23.734,"The passage of time calmed his reckless purpose, but aggravated his sense of frustration. He took refuge in work. He resigned himself to being a man without a woman for his entire life to hide the shame of his uselessness. Meanwhile, Melquíades finished capturing everything that could be captured in Macondo on his plates, and abandoned the daguerreotype laboratory to the delusions of José Arcadio Buendía, who had resolved to use it to obtain scientific proof of the existence of God. Through a complicated process of superimposed exposures taken in different parts of the house, he was sure he would sooner or later make a daguerreotype of God, if He existed, or put an end once and for all to the supposition of His existence. Melquíades delved into the interpretations of Nostradamus. He stayed up very late, suffocating in his faded velvet vest, scribbling papers with his tiny sparrow-like hands, whose rings had lost the luster of another era. One night he thought he found a prediction about the future of Macondo. It would be a luminous city, with large glass houses, where no trace of the Buendía lineage remained. “It’s a mistake,” thundered José Arcadio Buendía. “They won’t be glass houses but ice houses, as I dreamed, and there will always be a Buendía, for centuries and centuries.” In that extravagant house, Úrsula struggled to preserve common sense, having expanded the candy animal business with an oven that produced baskets and baskets of bread all night and a prodigious variety of puddings, meringues, and sponge cakes, which vanished in a few hours through the swamp’s pathways. She had reached an age where she had the right to rest, but was, however, increasingly active. She was so busy with her prosperous enterprises that one afternoon she looked distractedly towards the patio while the Indian woman helped her sweeten the dough, and saw two unknown and beautiful adolescents embroidering in a hoop by the twilight light. They were Rebeca and Amaranta. They had just taken off their grandmother’s mourning clothes, which they had kept with inflexible rigor for three years, and the colored clothes seemed to have given them a new place in the world. Rebeca, contrary to what might have been expected, was the most beautiful. She had a clear complexion, large and calm eyes, and magical hands that seemed to weave the embroidery’s pattern with invisible threads. Amaranta, the younger one, was a bit graceless, but she had the natural distinction, the inner poise of the dead grandmother. Next to them, although already revealing his father’s physical drive, Arcadio seemed like a child. He had dedicated himself to learning the art of silversmithing with Aureliano, who had also taught him to read and write. Úrsula suddenly realized that the house was filled with people, that her children were about to marry and have children, and that they would be forced to disperse due to lack of space. Then she took out the money accumulated over long years of hard work, made commitments with her clients, and undertook the expansion of the house. She arranged for the construction of a formal living room for visitors, another more comfortable and cool for daily use, a dining room for a table with twelve places where the family could sit with all their guests; nine bedrooms with windows facing the patio and a long corridor protected from the midday glare by a rose garden, with a handrail for placing fern pots and begonia planters. She arranged to expand the kitchen to build two ovens, to destroy the old barn where Pilar Ternera had read José Arcadio’s future, and to build another twice as large so that food would never be lacking in the house. She arranged to build in the patio, under the shade of the chestnut tree, a bathroom for women and another for men, and at the back a large stable, a wired chicken coop, a milking stable, and an aviary open to the four winds so that the aimless birds could settle as they pleased. Followed by dozens of masons and carpenters, as if she had contracted her husband’s hallucinatory fever, Úrsula ordered the positioning of the light and the conduct of the heat, and distributed the space without the slightest sense of its limits. The primitive construction of the founders was filled with tools and materials, with workers overwhelmed by sweat, who asked everyone to please not get in the way, without realizing that it was they who were in the way, exasperated by the bag of human bones that followed them everywhere with its dull rattling. In that discomfort, breathing quicklime and tar molasses, no one quite understood how from the bowels of the earth emerged not only the largest house that would ever be in the town, but the most hospitable and cool that there ever was in the swamp’s domain. José Arcadio Buendía, trying to surprise Divine Providence in the midst of the cataclysm, was the one who understood it the least. The new house was almost finished when Úrsula pulled him out of his chimerical world to inform him that there was an order to paint the facade blue, not white as they wanted.

He set up a table and a chair that he had bought from Jacob, nailed up on the wall the shield of the republic that he had brought with him, and on the door he painted the sign: Magistrate.

The founders of Macondo, determined to drive out the invaders from the town, took their eldest sons with them and went to Jose Arcadio Buendia, saying they were at his command. But Jose Arcadio Buendia objected, saying that humiliating a man in front of his family was not manly. He explained that Don Apolinar had brought his wife and daughters with him. Therefore, he decided to resolve the matter amicably.",26.26,25.805,"He carried him down the middle of the street, suspended by his lapels, until he set him on his two feet on the path to the swamp.

Later, two more carts arrived with the furniture, trunks, and household utensils. He installed the family in the Hotel de Jacob while he found a house, and reopened the office protected by the soldiers. The founders of Macondo, determined to expel the invaders, went with their eldest sons to offer their services to José Arcadio Buendía. But he opposed it, as he explained, because Don Apolinar Moscote had returned with his wife and daughters, and it was not a man's thing to humiliate others in front of their family. So he decided to resolve the situation amicably.",48.797,48.524

Úrsula had got that idea from the afternoon when she saw Rebeca and Amaranta changed into adolescents, and it could almost have been said that the main reason behind the construction was a desire to have a proper place for the girls to receive visitors. In order that nothing would be lacking in splendor she worked like a galley slave as the repairs were under way, so that before they were finished she had ordered costly necessities for the decorations, the table service, and the marvelous invention that was to arouse the astonishment of the town and the jubilation of the young people: the pianola. They delivered it broken down, packed in several boxes that were unloaded along with the Viennese furniture, the Bohemian crystal, the table service from the Indies Company, the tablecloths from Holland, and a rich variety of lamps and candlesticks, hangings and drapes.

Ursula had cherished that idea ever since the afternoon she saw Rebeca and Amaranta had become young ladies, and it could almost be said that the main reason for building the new house was the desire to provide the girls with a worthy place to receive guests. While carrying out the reconstruction of the house, Ursula toiled like a convict so that no obstacle could extinguish that brilliant, radiant purpose. Therefore, before these tasks were completed, she had already sent for the purchase of decorations and food containers, all of which were expensive items. Among them was a marvelous object that had astonished the entire village and delighted the youth, which was the automatic piano. People transported its parts to the house. These parts were placed in several crates and were unpacked along with furniture made in Vienna, mirrors produced in Bohemia, dishes from the West Indies Company, Dutch tablecloths, and a series of oil lamps and candles, vases, floral silk wall hangings, and carpets.

So that nothing would be lacking, she gathered her skirt at her waist and worked hard like a laborer in the house's renovation. Even before the craftsmen had finished their work, Ursula spared no expense to furnish the house from top to bottom, ordering a heap of items, bringing in tableware, and acquiring a new invention that left the entire village in awe and thrilled the young people: the Laterna.

125,"Pietro Crespi was young and blond, the most handsome and well mannered man who had ever been seen in Macondo, so scrupulous in his dress that in spite of the suffocating heat he would work in his brocade vest and heavy coat of dark cloth. Soaked in sweat, keeping a reverent distance from the owners of the house, he spent several weeks shut up is the parlor with a dedication much like that of Aureliano in his silverwork. One morning, without opening the door, without calling anyone to witness the miracle, he placed the first roll in the pianola and the tormenting hammering and the constant noise of wooden lathings ceased in a silence that was startled at the order and neatness of the music. They all ran to the parlor. José Arcadio Buendía was as if struck by lightning, not because of the beauty of the melody, but because of the automatic working of the keys of the pianola, and he set up Melquíades’ camera with the hope of getting a daguerreotype of the invisible player. That day the Italian had lunch with them. Rebeca and Amaranta, serving the table, were intimidated by the way in which the angelic man with pale and ringless hands manipulated the utensils. In the living room, next to the parlor, Pietro Crespi taught them how to dance. He showed them the steps without touching them, keeping time with a metronome, under the friendly eye of Úrsula, who did not leave the room for a moment while her daughters had their lesson. Pietro Crespi wore special pants on those days, very elastic and tight, and dancing slippers, “You don’t have to worry so much,” José Arcadio Buendía told her. “The man’s a fairy.” But she did not leave off her vigilance until the apprenticeship was over and the Italian left Macondo. Then they began to organize the party. Úrsula drew up a strict guest list, in which the only ones invited were the descendants of the founders, except for the family of Pilar Ternera, who by then had had two more children by unknown fathers. It was truly a high-class list, except that it was determined by feelings of friendship, for those favored were not only the oldest friends of José Arcadio Buendía’s house since before they undertook the exodus and the founding of Macondo, but also their sons and grandsons, who were the constant companions of Aureliano and Arcadio since infancy, and their daughters, who were the only ones who visited the house to embroider with Rebeca and Amaranta. Don Apolinar Moscote, the benevolent ruler whose activity had been reduced to the maintenance from his scanty resources of two policemen armed with wooden clubs, was a figurehead. In older to support the household expenses his daughters had opened a sewing shop, where they made felt flowers as well as guava delicacies, and wrote love notes to order. But in spite of being modest and hard-working, the most beautiful girls in Iowa, and the most skilled at the new dances, they did not manage to be considered for the party.","Piêtrô Crêspi was a young man with red hair, one of the most handsome and educated individuals in Macondo, who took such pride in his appearance that, despite the sweltering heat, he always wore a tight-fitting silk suit and a thick woolen overcoat. Sweating profusely, trying to maintain a clear distance from his hosts, he stayed for several weeks in a closed room, with a passion identical to Aureliano's in the jewelry workshop. One morning, without opening the door, without calling upon any divine witness, he placed a music roll in the automatic piano, and pure, melodious music began to play, causing the harsh hammering and constant clattering of the wooden planks to suddenly cease in the startling silence. Everyone hurriedly rushed to the living room. José Arcadio Buendía became excited not because of the enchanting beauty of the music but because the automatic piano was playing the keys by itself, and he placed Melquiades' camera in the living room, hoping to capture a photograph of the invisible musician. That day, the Italian maestro had lunch with the family. Rebeca and Amaranta, who were serving, were both charmed by the gentle and graceful demeanor of the refined man as his ringless, pale green hands handled the silverware at the table. In the dining room connected to the living room, Piêtrô Crêspi taught the two girls to dance. Keeping time with a metronome, he taught them to move their feet without touching their bodies, under the endearing supervision of Úrsula, who never left the living room while her daughters were learning to dance. During those days, Piêtrô Crêspi wore special, soft, tight-fitting clothes and a pair of dancing shoes. "" You have nothing to worry about,"" José Arcadio Buendía told his wife. ""This fellow is just a hermaphrodite. "" However, she continued to keep watch until her daughters' dance lessons were over and the Italian man had left Macondo. So she began preparing for the celebration. Úrsula made a list of the guests to be invited to the party, selecting only the descendants of the founders of Macondo, excluding the family of Pilar Ternera, who by then had two more illegitimate children. In fact, it was a unique selection determined by friendships, as those chosen were not only close friends of the José Arcadio Buendía family since before the migration that led to the founding of Macondo but also because their descendants had been childhood friends of Aureliano and Arcadio. Their daughters were the only girls who regularly visited to embroider with Rebeca and Amaranta. Don Apolinar Moscote, a kind-hearted official whose duties were limited to maintaining two policemen armed only with batons and supporting them within his modest means, was merely an authority figure in name. To ensure daily expenses, his daughters had to open a small shop where they made felt flowers, prepared guava jelly, and wrote love letters for the young men and women in the village. Despite their humility and good manners, his daughters—beautiful and the most graceful dancers of the new dances in the village—could not find a way to be invited to the celebration.",21.448,21.259,"In Macondo, no man had ever been seen who was so handsome, so charming, and so well-mannered. He was also very particular about his attire. He never took off his embroidered waistcoat and dark jacket, even if he was melting from the heat and sweat. Maintaining a certain distance from the household and sweating profusely, he shut himself in the guest room for weeks, working with the same dedication that Aureliano had for his silver engravings. One morning, without opening the door or calling anyone to witness the miracle, he inserted the first strip into the lantern. The irritating sounds of hammers and saws suddenly ceased as those who were astonished by the orderly and smooth sound of the music dropped whatever they were holding. Everyone rushed to the living room. Jose Arcadio Buendia was thunderstruck. His astonishment was not due to the beauty of the tune, but to the fact that the hurdy-gurdy operated on its own. Without wasting any time, Jose Arcadio set up Melquiades' camera in the hope of capturing a picture of the invisible hands playing this devilish invention. The Italian joined them at the table that day. Rebeca and Amaranta, who were serving at the table, watched in admiration as this angelic man used the cutlery with his ringless white hands with great finesse. In the sitting room adjacent to the parlor, Pietro Crespi was teaching them how to dance. He showed the girls how to move their feet without touching them, keeping time with a metronome under the friendly gaze of Ursula, who never left the room while they were taking lessons. On the days they had lessons, Pietro Crespi wore special trousers made of tight and flexible fabric, and soft-soled shoes. Jose Arcadio Buendia would say to his wife, ""Don't worry, dear."" ""This man is not a man, but a creature of the spirits."" ""He won't harm the girls."" Nevertheless, Ursula remained cautious until the dance lessons ended and the Italian left Macondo. Then they began preparing for the party. Ursula made a list of those to be invited. Everyone descended from the founders of the village was invited to this party, except for the family of Pilar Ternera, who had recently given birth to two more children of unknown paternity: If friendship had not been the main criterion in the selection, there would have been no complaints about the invitation list. But those invited were not only the old friends of the Jose Arcadio Buendia family from before the great migration and the founding of Macondo; the sons and grandsons of these friends, who had been friends with Aureliano and Arcadio since childhood, and the daughters who embroidered with Rebeca and Amaranta were also included in the list. Even the name of kind-hearted Don Apolinar Moscote, who could do no more than support two policemen with wooden batons on his limited budget, was not mentioned. To cover the household expenses, the girls had opened a tailor shop. At the same time, they were making and selling velvet flowers, guava pear sweets, and offering writing services for those who wanted love letters written. But no matter how much they were the most beautiful, most industrious, and most humble girls in the village, or how skillful they were in the new dances, they still couldn't manage to get invited to the party.",20.642,20.474,"Pietro Crespi was young and blond, the most handsome and well-mannered man that had been seen in Macondo, so meticulous in his dress that despite the suffocating heat he worked in a brocaded vest and a thick dark cloth coat. Soaked in sweat, keeping a reverent distance from the owners of the house, he spent several weeks locked in the living room, with a dedication similar to Aureliano's in his goldsmith workshop. One morning, without opening the door, without summoning any witness to the miracle, he placed the first roll in the pianola, and the tormenting hammering and the constant clatter of the wooden slats ceased in a silence of astonishment, before the order and cleanliness of the music. Everyone rushed to the living room. José Arcadio Buendía seemed struck not by the beauty of the melody, but by the autonomous keystrokes of the pianola, and he installed Melquíades' camera in the living room with the hope of obtaining a daguerreotype of the invisible performer. That day the Italian had lunch with them. Rebeca and Amaranta, serving the table, were intimidated by the fluidity with which that angelic man with pale hands and no rings handled the cutlery.

Pietro Crespi wore special pants in those days, very flexible and tight, and dance slippers. "" You don't have to worry so much,"" José Arcadio Buendía told his wife. "" This man is a sissy.

Don Apolinar Moscote, the benevolent ruler whose actions were reduced to supporting two policemen armed with wooden clubs with his meager resources, was an ornamental authority. To cope with household expenses, his daughters opened a sewing workshop, where they made felt flowers, guava snacks, and love notes on request.

126,"While Úrsula and the girls unpacked furniture, polished silverware, and hung pictures of maidens in boats full of roses, which gave a breath of new life to the naked areas that the masons had built, José Arcadio Buendía stopped his pursuit of the image of God, convinced of His nonexistence, and he took the pianola apart in order to decipher its magical secret. Two days before the party, swamped in a shower of leftover keys and hammers, bungling in the midst of a mix-up of strings that would unroll in one direction and roll up again in the other, he succeeded in a fashion in putting the instrument back together. There had never been as many surprises and as much dashing about as in those days, but the new pitch lamps were lighted on the designated day and hour. The house was opened, still smelling of resin and damp whitewash, and the children and grandchildren of the founders saw the porch with ferns and begonias, the quiet rooms, the garden saturated with the fragrance of the roses, and they gathered together in the parlor, facing the unknown invention that had been covered with a white sheet. Those who were familiar with the piano, popular in other towns in the swamp, felt a little disheartened, but more bitter was Úrsula’s disappointment when she put in the first roll so that Amaranta and Rebeca could begin the dancing and the mechanism did not work. Melquíades, almost blind by then, crumbling with decrepitude, used the arts of his timeless wisdom in an attempt to fix it. Finally José Arcadio Buendía managed, by mistake, to move a device that was stuck and the music came out, first in a burst and then in a flow of mixed-up notes. Beating against the strings that had been put in without order or concert and had been tuned with temerity, the hammers let go. But the stubborn descendants of the twenty-one intrepid people who plowed through the mountains in search of the sea to the west avoided the reefs of the melodic mix-up and the dancing went on until dawn.","While Úrsula and the girls opened the box to take out the utensils, the shiny bowls, dishes, cups, and hung on the walls the paintings of noble ladies standing on boats filled with caged flowers, and with these tasks, the mother and her daughters breathed new life into the polished rooms created by the masons, José Arcadio Buendía abandoned his quest to find the image of God, admitting the nonexistence of the deity, and dismantled the automatic piano to understand its mysteries. After many days of fumbling with the tangle of wires stretching out at one end only to coil back at the other, and a heap of surplus pegs and levers, José Arcadio Buendía managed to reassemble the automatic piano, but did so very poorly. He completed this task two days before the celebration. Never before had there been so much anxiety and bustling in this house as in those days. Yet the new lamps, freshly lit with tar, still shone brightly at the appointed day and hour. The house was wide open, still fragrant with the smell of pine resin and damp lime. The descendants of the founders of Macondo familiarized themselves with the hallways adorned with potted ferns and begonias, the serene rooms, the garden fragrant with roses, and then gathered in the living room before the machine, previously unknown, covered with a white cloth. Those who were familiar with the commonly used pianos in the villages around the swamp felt a bit uneasy. But the most bitter disappointment was Úrsula's when a music roll was placed in the automatic piano for Rebeca and Amaranta to start the dance, but the mechanism did not move at all. Menkyađêt, now almost blind, tried to recall the skills from his vast repository of ancient knowledge to repair the automatic piano. Finally, purely by chance, José Arcadio Buendía managed to make a dead machine turn, and thus the music that initially sounded mournful began to flow like a stream of sound composed of incomprehensible notes. The piano hammers struck chaotically. They kept hitting the strings, which were arranged haphazardly, without any order, causing them to vibrate with a trembling, fearful sound. But the stubborn descendants of the twenty-one brave souls who once traversed the forest heading west to find the sea, managed to overcome the difficult spots caused by changes in the music, and thus the dance lasted until morning.",16.15,15.894,"While Ursula and the girls were arranging the furniture that brought life back to the rooms crafted by the skillful hands of the builders, polishing the silver, and adorning the empty walls with beautiful girl pictures in boats filled with roses, Jose Arcadio Buendia, having firmly believed in God's absence and giving up on searching for Him, dismantled the lantern to uncover its magical secret. Two days before the party, even though he ended up with a bunch of extra screws, keys, and bolts, and the springs he wound in one direction unwound in another, he managed to reassemble the parts of the lantern. There had never been as much astonishment, hustle, and chaos as in those days. Still, the newly arrived chandeliers with arms were lit and prepared at the specified day and time of the invitation. The doors of the house, which still smelled of resin and whose whitewash had not yet dried, were opened, and the children and grandchildren of the village founders toured the terrace adorned with fern and begonia pots, the huge silent rooms, and the garden filled with the scent of roses. Then they gathered in the hall to see the unknown invention covered with a white sheet. Those who had seen pianos in other villages of the marsh were disappointed when they saw this instrument that resembled a piano. But the disappointment of Ursula, who had set up the machine so that Amaranta and Rebeca could dance, was worse than all of theirs when the machine didn't work. Melquiades, who had become feeble and blind with age, tried to operate the machine using the skills of his infinite mind. Finally, while Jose Arcadio was fiddling with the organ grinder, he accidentally managed to set the jammed part in motion, and first a noise, then music in the form of mixed notes was heard. The keys striking the springs, which were tied backwards and not properly adjusted, eventually gave up. But the young people, descendants of the twenty-one brave souls who had dared to cross the mountains to the west in search of the sea, did not give up in front of this cacophony and the dance continued until morning.",17.436,17.16,"While Úrsula and the girls unpacked furniture, polished the dishes, and hung pictures of maidens in boats laden with roses, breathing new life into the bare spaces built by the masons, José Arcadio Buendía gave up the pursuit of the image of God, convinced of its nonexistence, and disassembled the player piano to decipher its secret magic. Two days before the party, bogged down in a mess of leftover pegs and hammers, fumbling among a tangle of strings that he unwound from one end only to have them wind up again at the other, he managed to roughly reassemble the instrument. There were never as many shocks and scurrying about as in those days, but the new tar lamps were lit on the scheduled date and time.

At last, José Arcadio Buendía accidentally moved a stuck device, and the music came out first in spurts, and then in a stream of convoluted notes. Striking against the strings placed without rhyme or reason and tuned with recklessness, the hammers went haywire. But the stubborn descendants of the twenty-one intrepid men who had explored the mountains seeking the sea to the west, eluded the pitfalls of the melodic mishmash, and the dance lasted until dawn.",35.821,35.64
127,"Pietro Crespi came back to repair the pianola. Rebeca and Amaranta helped him put the strings in order and helped him with their laughter at the mix-up of the melodies. It was extremely pleasant and so chaste in its way that Úrsula ceased her vigilance. On the eve of his departure a farewell dance for him was improvised with the pianola and with Rebeca he put on a skillful demonstration of modern dance, Arcadio and Amaranta matched them in grace and skill. But the exhibition was interrupted because Pilar Ternera, who was at the door with the onlookers, had a fight, biting and hair pulling, with a woman who had dared to comment that Arcadio had a woman’s behind. Toward midnight Pietro Crespi took his leave with a sentimental little speech, and he promised to return very soon. Rebeca accompanied him to the door, and having closed up the house and put out the lamps, she went to her room to weep. It was an inconsolable weeping that lasted for several days, the cause of which was not known even by Amaranta. Her hermetism was not odd. Although she seemed expansive and cordial, she had a solitary character and an impenetrable heart. She was a splendid adolescent with long and firm bones, but she still insisted on using the small wooden rocking chair with which she had arrived at the house, reinforced many times and with the arms gone. No one had discovered that even at that age she still had the habit of sucking her finger. That was why she would not lose an opportunity to lock herself in the bathroom and had acquired the habit of sleeping with her face to the wall. On rainy afternoons, embroidering with a group of friends on the begonia porch, she would lose the thread of the conversation and a tear of nostalgia would salt her palate when she saw the strips of damp earth and the piles of mud that the earthworms had pushed up in the garden. Those secret tastes, defeated in the past by oranges and rhubarb, broke out into an irrepressible urge when she began to weep. She went back to eating earth. The first time she did it almost out of curiosity, sure that the bad taste would be the best cure for the temptation. And, in fact, she could not bear the earth in her mouth. But she persevered, overcome by the growing anxiety, and little by little she was getting back her ancestral appetite, the taste of primary minerals, the unbridled satisfaction of what was the original food. She would put handfuls of earth in her pockets, and ate them in small bits without being seen, with a confused feeling of pleasure and rage, as she instructed her girl friends in the most difficult needlepoint and spoke about other men, who did not deserve the sacrifice of having one eat the whitewash on the walls because of them. The handfuls of earth made the only man who deserved that show of degradation less remote and more certain, as if the ground that he walked on with his fine patent leather boots in another part of the world were transmitting to her the weight and the temperature of his blood in a mineral savor that left a harsh aftertaste in her mouth and a sediment of peace in her heart. One afternoon, for no reason, Amparo Moscote asked permission to see the house. Amaranta and Rebeca, disconcerted by the unexpected visit, attended her with a stiff formality. They showed her the remodeled mansion, they had her listen to the rolls on the pianola, and they offered her orange marmalade and crackers. Amparo gave a lesson in dignity, personal charm, and good manners that impressed Úrsula in the few moments that she was present during the visit. After two hours, when the conversation was beginning to wane, Amparo took advantage of Amaranta’s distraction and gave Rebeca a letter. She was able to see the name of the Estimable Señorita Rebeca Buendía, written in the same methodical hand, with the same green ink, and the same delicacy of words with which the instructions for the operation of the pianola were written, and she folded the letter with the tips of her fingers and hid it in her bosom, looking at Amparo Moscote with an expression of endless and unconditional gratitude and a silent promise of complicity unto death.","Piêtrô Crêspi returned to repair the automatic piano. Rebecca and Amaranta helped him arrange the order of the strings, and they joined him in laughing at the tricky parts of the waltzes. He displayed such a respectable and noble demeanor that Úrsula did not feel the need to supervise her daughters' dance lessons. The night before his departure, an impromptu dance with the newly repaired automatic piano was organized to bid him farewell. He and Rebecca performed the modern dances exceptionally well. Accadio and Amaranta were no less graceful and lively in their movements. But the performance had to be stopped because Pila Tecnera, who was outside the door with the curious onlookers, got into a fight with a woman who dared to comment that Accadio had a woman's buttocks. At midnight, Pietro Crespi bid farewell to the family with an emotional speech, promising to return soon. Rebecca saw him to the main door, and after closing all the doors and turning off the house lights, she went to her room to cry. It was a mournful cry that lasted several days, the reason for which no one knew, not even Amaranta. She was always a mysterious person, and that was not unusual. Despite her seemingly open and polite exterior, she was actually a lonely person with an inscrutable heart. She was a splendid adolescent girl, slender and fond of sitting on the wooden rocking chair she had brought to the house, which had been repaired many times and lacked armrests. No one discovered that at her age she still had the habit of sucking her thumb. Therefore, she never missed an opportunity to be alone in the bathroom and maintained the habit of sleeping facing the wall. On rainy afternoons, while sitting and embroidering with a group of girlfriends in the hallway with begonias, she would suddenly lose track of the lively conversation, letting a tear of longing roll down her cheek and salt her tongue as she looked at the wet patches of earth and the small mounds of clay that worms pushed up in the garden. When she began to cry, those secret pleasures, once defeated by orange juice mixed with rhubarb powder in previous years, resurfaced in an uncontrollable desire. She ate earth again as she had before. At first, she ate it almost out of curiosity, believing that the unpleasant taste of the earth would be an effective remedy against her desire. And indeed, she could not stand the earth in her mouth. But as her growing craving overcame her, she forced herself to endure it. It was the old craving, the fondness for eating minerals, the eager joy of consuming primal food. She stuffed pieces of earth into her pockets and secretly ate them one by one without being seen. She ate them, feeling both a sense of blissful satisfaction and bitter resentment while teaching her girlfriends the most intricate embroidery stitches and talking about men who were unworthy of the sacrifices she made, such as eating wall lime for them. These pieces of earth became less ancient and more distinct, representing the only man worthy of such self-destruction, as if the ground he trod with his elegant varnished boots somewhere else in the world transmitted to the girl the weight and warmth of his blood in the taste of minerals, leaving a bitter sensation in her mouth and a lasting sediment of peace in her heart. One afternoon, without any particular reason, Amparo Moscote suddenly asked to visit the house. Amaranta and Rebeca, bewildered by the unannounced visit, reluctantly received her. They showed her the newly renovated house, let her listen to music from the automatic piano, and offered her oranges with biscuits. Amparo presented herself as a cheerful and well-mannered young lady, which moved Úrsula during the moments she sat with them to entertain the guest. After two hours, when the conversation had begun to wane, Amparo took advantage of Amaranta's distraction to hand Rebeca a letter. The girl only had time to see the line: ""To the distinguished Miss Rebeca Buendía,"" written in neat handwriting, with blue ink and a spacing style that was both airy and pleasing to the eye, similar to the instructions for using the automatic piano. Then she carefully folded and tucked the letter into her bodice with her fingers. She looked at Amparo Moscote with a gaze that conveyed immense gratitude and silently vowed to fulfill the wish until her dying day.",22.459,22.332,"Pietro Crespi came again to repair the lantern. Rebeca and Amaranta helped him with their smiles to arrange the springs and separate the tangled melodies. Their demeanor was so pleasant and innocent that eventually Ursula gave up waiting for them to come to their senses. On the evening Pietro Crespi was to leave, a lantern party was organized in his honor, and Crespi demonstrated his mastery of modern dances with Rebeca. Arcadio and Amaranta were not falling behind them either. However, this beautiful show was interrupted; because Pilar Ternera, who was among those watching from the door, got into a hair-pulling fight with a woman who dared to say that Arcadio had a woman's buttocks. Towards midnight, Pietro Crespi bid farewell with a tearful speech, promising to return soon. Rebeca escorted him to the door. After closing the windows and doors and turning off the lights, she went up to her room and started crying. This endless crying, the reason for which even Amaranta did not know, lasted for days. Rebeca's introversion was not surprising. Despite appearing friendly and sincere, she was an introverted girl who never revealed what was in her heart to anyone. Although she was a tall, sturdy-boned, healthy young girl, she could never give up the rocking chair she brought with her on her first arrival, which had been reinforced with nail upon nail for years and now had its arms broken off. Despite being a grown girl, no one knew that she hadn't given up the habit of sucking her finger. To hide this from everyone, she had made it a habit to lock herself in the bathroom frequently and to sleep with her face turned to the wall. On rainy afternoons, while sitting with her friends on the begonia-filled terrace doing embroidery, she would lose track of the conversation when her eyes fell on the mounds of earth raised by worms, and a tear loaded with homesickness would fall from the corner of her eye. The hidden tastes that had been conquered and forgotten years ago with oranges and jams surfaced with an irresistible force as soon as Rebeca began to cry. She started eating soil again. The first time, she ate the soil out of sheer curiosity because she saw disgust as the best remedy to prevent her mind from being swayed. Indeed, the taste of soil in her mouth was disgusting at first. However, as curiosity gnawed at her insides, she too ate soil and gradually discovered the ancestral taste, savoring the pure flavors of basic nutrients. She filled her pockets with handfuls of soil; while teaching her friends the most difficult needlework, or talking about other men who weren't worth the sacrifice of eating wall plaster, she secretly ate soil with a passion mixed with pleasure and anger. When she ate soil, it felt as if the only person worth such degradation was closer, more tangible. The soil on which his delicate leather shoes stepped on the other side of the world, the mineral that left a bitter taste in her mouth after eating it, seemed to carry the warmth and density of his blood to Rebeca, giving her heart peace. One day, Amparo Moscote suddenly appeared and asked for permission to tour the house. Amaranta and Rebeca, stunned by this unexpected visit, welcomed Amparo with an icy formal demeanor. They showed her the repaired and renovated house, played the lantern, and offered orange marmalade with biscuits. In the short time Ursula came to their side, Amparo quickly won her favor with her dignity, charm, and manners. After two hours had passed and a shortage of topics to talk about began, Amparo took advantage of Amaranta's distraction to slip a letter into Rebeca's hand. When Rebeca glanced at it, she saw the words ""Dear Miss Rebeca Buendia"" written in that pearl-like handwriting, with that green ink, and those meticulous words, explaining how to operate the lantern. She folded the letter with her fingertips, looked at Amparo Moscote with a gaze that promised eternal and unconditional gratitude and friendship until death, and tucked the letter into her chest.",16.74,16.583,"Pietro Crespi went back to fixing the pianola. Rebeca and Amaranta helped him arrange the strings and joined in his laughter at the complexity of the waltzes. He was extremely affectionate, and so honest by nature that Úrsula gave up her vigilance. The night before his trip, a dance was improvised with the restored pianola to bid him farewell, and he gave a virtuosic demonstration of modern dances with Rebeca. Arcadio and Amaranta matched them in grace and skill. But the exhibition was interrupted because Pilar Ternera, who was at the door with the curious onlookers, got into a biting and hair-pulling fight with a woman who dared to comment that young Arcadio had a woman's buttocks. Around midnight, Pietro Crespi said goodbye with a sentimental little speech and promised to return very soon. Rebeca accompanied him to the door, and after closing the house and turning off the lamps, she went to her room to cry. It was an inconsolable cry that lasted for several days, and whose cause not even Amaranta knew. Her secrecy was not strange. Although she seemed expansive and cordial, she had a solitary character and an impenetrable heart. She was a splendid teenager, with long and firm bones, but she insisted on continuing to use the little wooden rocking chair she had arrived with, often reinforced and now devoid of arms. No one had discovered that even at that age she still had the habit of sucking her thumb. That's why she never missed a chance to lock herself in the bathroom, and she had acquired the habit of sleeping with her face turned against the wall. On rainy afternoons, while embroidering with a group of friends in the begonia corridor, she would lose the thread of the conversation and a tear of nostalgia would salt her palate when she saw the streaks of damp earth and the mounds of mud built by the worms in the garden. Those secret tastes, once defeated by oranges with rhubarb, burst into an irrepressible longing when she began to cry. She went back to eating dirt. The first time she did it almost out of curiosity, sure that the bad taste would be the best remedy against the temptation. And indeed, she couldn't stand the dirt in her mouth. But she persisted, overcome by the growing urge, and little by little she recovered the ancestral appetite, the taste for primary minerals, the unblemished satisfaction of the original food. She would stuff handfuls of dirt into her pockets and eat it grain by grain without being seen, with a confused feeling of joy and rage, while she trained her friends in the most difficult stitches and talked about other men who did not deserve the sacrifice of eating the lime off the walls for them. The handfuls of dirt made the only man who deserved such degradation less remote and more certain, as if the ground he walked on with his fine patent leather boots in another part of the world transmitted to her the weight and temperature of his blood in a mineral taste that left a rough ember in her mouth and a sediment of peace in her heart. One afternoon, without any reason, Amparo Moscote asked for permission to see the house. Amaranta and Rebeca, bewildered by the unexpected visit, attended to her with a hard formality. They showed her the renovated mansion, played the pianola rolls for her, and offered her orangeade with cookies. Amparo gave a lesson in dignity, personal charm, and good manners, which impressed Úrsula in the brief moments she attended the visit. After two hours, when the conversation began to languish, Amparo took advantage of a momentary distraction by Amaranta and handed a letter to Rebeca. She managed to see the name of the very distinguished Miss Rebeca Buendía, written in the same methodical handwriting, the same green ink, and the same precious arrangement of words as the instructions for operating the pianola, and she folded the letter with her fingertips and hid it in her bodice, looking at Amparo Moscote with an expression of endless and unconditional gratitude and a silent promise of complicity until death.",53.002,52.946
128,"The sudden friendship between Amparo Moscote and Rebeca Buendía awakened the hopes of Aureliano. The memory of little Remedios had not stopped tormenting him, but he had not found a chance to see her.

The presence of Amparo Moscote in the house was like a premonition. “She has to come with her,” Aureliano would say to himself in a low voice. “She has to come.” He repeated it so many times and with such conviction that one afternoon when he was putting together a little gold fish in the work shop, he had the certainty that she had answered his call.

Rebeca waited for her love at four in the afternoon, embroidering by the window. She knew that the mailman’s mule arrived only every two weeks, but she always waited for him, convinced that he was going to arrive on some other day by mistake. It happened quite the opposite: once the mule did not come on the usual day. Mad with desperation, Rebeca got up in the middle of the night and ate handfuls of earth in the garden with a suicidal drive, weeping with pain and fury, chewing tender earthworms and chipping her teeth on snail shells.

She knew that the mailman's donkey only came to the village once every fortnight, but she always hoped, telling herself that by mistake it might come any day. But the opposite happened: one time the donkey did not come on the scheduled day. So the girl went mad with disappointment. In the middle of the night, she woke up to eat handfuls of earth from the flower garden. In her desperate desire to commit suicide, she cried bitterly, both in sorrow and anger, while chewing on soft worms and crunching the shells of snails. She vomited until morning. She collapsed from exhaustion. She lost her sanity, and her heart pounded restlessly without shame.

Yet she always waited for him, believing that one day, unexpectedly, he would come. But the exact opposite happened; one time, the mule did not appear on the usual day. Driven mad by despair, Rebeca rushed into the garden in the middle of the night, consumed by a desire to commit suicide, and ate handfuls of soil while crying out of pain and anger. She chewed on soft, slippery worms, crushing snail shells with her teeth. She vomited until dawn. Fever took over her head, she lost consciousness, and began to say whatever came to her mind without any sense of shame or sin.

134,"Aureliano was the only one capable of understanding such desolation. That afternoon, while Úrsula was trying to rescue Rebeca from the slough of delirium, he went with Magnífico Visbal and Gerineldo Márquez to Catarino’s store. The establishment had been expanded with a gallery of wooden rooms where single women who smelled of dead flowers lived. A group made up of an accordion and drums played the songs of Francisco the Man, who had not been seen in Macondo for several years. The three friends drank fermented cane juice. Magnífico and Gerineldo, contemporaries of Aureliano but more skilled in the ways of the world, drank methodically with the women seated on their laps. One of the women, withered and with goldwork on her teeth, gave Aureliano a caress that made him shudder. He rejected her. He had discovered that the more he drank the more he thought about Remedios, but he could bear the torture of his recollections better. He did not know exactly when he began to float. He saw his friends and the women sailing in a radiant glow, without weight or mass, saying words that did not come out of their mouths and making mysterious signals that did not correspond to their expressions. Catarino put a hand on his shoulder and said to him: “It’s going on eleven.” Aureliano turned his head, saw the enormous disfigured face with a felt flower behind the ear, and then he lost his memory, as during the times of forgetfulness, and he recovered it on a strange dawn and in a room that was completely foreign, where Pilar Ternera stood in her slip, barefoot, her hair down, holding a lamp over him, startled with disbelief.","Aureliano was the only one who understood the boundless suffering. That afternoon, while Úrsula was trying to treat Rebeca from her stupor, he, along with Magnífico Visbal and Hernando Márquez, went to Catarino's eatery. The eatery had been expanded with a row of wooden rooms, rooms for the single women who wore makeup. A band consisting of drums and accordion played songs by old Francisco - The Man who had disappeared from the village of Macondo years ago. The three friends drank guarapo. Magnífico and Márquez were contemporaries of Aureliano, but they were more worldly than him in the ways of revelry. Both of them drank freely with the girls sitting on their laps. One of those girls, the withered one with gold teeth, had actively flirted with Aureliano. But he did not like her. He realized that the more he drank, the more he missed Remedios intensely, but the tormenting longing was more bearable. He did not know when he started to feel light and buoyant. He saw his friends along with the floating women swimming in the radiant reflected light, speaking words that seemed not to come from their mouths, making mystical movements that seemed disconnected from their gestures. Mr. Catarinô placed his hand on his back and said, ""It's almost eleven o'clock."" Aurêlianô turned his face around and saw a large, distorted face with a felt flower tucked behind the ear, and he immediately lost his memory as he had previously suffered from amnesia. Then he remembered that: on a distant early morning in a completely unfamiliar room to him, where Pila Tecnêra was present, dressed in underwear, barefoot, with disheveled hair, holding an oil lamp illuminating his face, and she was half-believing, half-doubting in astonishment:",22.195,21.877,"Aureliano was the only person who could understand what such great despair meant. That afternoon, while Ursula was trying to bring Rebeca to her senses, Aureliano went to Catarino's shop with Magnifico Visbal and Gerineldo Marquez. Additions were made to the shop over time, wooden rooms that smelled of faded flowers and were occupied by women with untied hair were added. A tin jazz band consisting of an accordion and a drum was playing the songs of Devil-Breaker Francisco, who hadn't visited Macondo for a few years. The three buddies got drunk on sugarcane juice. Magnifico and Gerineldo, who were Aureliano's age but more experienced, had pulled a woman each onto their laps and were drinking continuously. When the worn-out woman with gold teeth tried to caress Aureliano, he shivered from head to toe. He pushed the woman away. He realized that the more he drank, the more he remembered Remedios, but as he drank, he could better endure the pain brought by the memories. He didn't know when his feet left the ground. His friends and the women were flying in a bright void, floating in the air as if they had no weight. They were uttering words that didn't come out of their mouths, making mysterious gestures that contradicted the expressions on their faces. Catarino put his hand on his shoulder and said, ""It's almost eleven o'clock. ""Aureliano turned his head. He saw Catarino's huge, misshapen face, the velvet flower tucked behind his ear, and the film broke. Just like during the period when they had sleeping sickness and forgot everything, everything in his mind was suddenly erased. Then he came to himself at an unknown hour in an unknown room. Pilar Ternera, in her undershirt, barefoot, her hair falling over her shoulders, stood there holding the lamp towards him, astonished in disbelief.",16.501,16.14,"Aureliano was the only one capable of understanding such desolation. That afternoon, while Úrsula was trying to rescue Rebeca from the mangrove of delirium, he went with Magnífico Visbal and Gerineldo Márquez to Catarino's store. The establishment had been expanded with a gallery of wooden rooms where women who smelled of dead flowers lived alone. An ensemble of accordion and drums played the songs of Francisco the Man, who had disappeared from Macondo several years ago. The three friends drank fermented guarapo. Magnífico and Gerineldo, contemporaries of Aureliano but more experienced in worldly matters, drank methodically with women sitting on their laps. One of them, withered and with gold-capped teeth, gave Aureliano a shuddering caress. He rejected her. He had discovered that the more he drank, the more he remembered Remedios, but he could better endure the torture of her memory. He didn't know at what moment he began to float. He saw his friends and the women navigating in a radiant reverberation, without weight or volume, saying words that didn't come from their lips and making mysterious signals that didn't correspond to their gestures. Catarino put a hand on his back and said, ""It's going to be eleven."" Aureliano turned his head, saw the enormous disfigured face with a felt flower in the ear, and then he lost his memory, as in the times of oblivion, and regained it in a foreign dawn and in a room that was completely unfamiliar to him, where Pilar Ternera was in a slip, barefoot, disheveled, lighting him with a lamp and stunned with disbelief.",55.505,55.375

She cleaned his face with a damp cloth, took of his clothes, and then got completely undressed and lowered the mosquito netting so that her children would not see them if they woke up. She had become tired of waiting for the man who would stay, of the men who left, of the countless men who missed the road to her house, confused by the uncertainty of the cards. During the wait her skin had become wrinkled, her breasts had withered, the coals of her heart had gone out. She felt for Aureliano in the darkness, put her hand on his stomach and kissed him on the neck with a maternal tenderness. “My poor child,” she murmured. Aureliano shuddered. With a calm skill, without the slightest misstep, he left his accumulated grief behind and found Remedios changed into a swamp without horizons, smelling of a raw animal and recently ironed clothes. When he came to the surface he was weeping. First they were involuntary and broken sobs. Then he emptied himself out in an unleashed flow, feeling that something swollen and painful had burst inside of him. She waited, snatching his head with the tips of her fingers, until his body got rid of the dark material that would not let him live. They Pilar Ternera asked him: “Who is it?” And Aureliano told her. She let out a laugh that in other times frightened the doves and that now did not even wake up the children. “You’ll have to raise her first,” she mocked, but underneath the mockery Aureliano found a reservoir of understanding. When he went out of the room, leaving behind not only his doubts about his virility but also the bitter weight that his heart had borne for so many months, Pilar Ternera made him a spontaneous promise.","He wore clothes stained with mud and vomited food. Pila Tecnêra, who was then living alone with her two youngest children, did not ask him a word. She took him to bed. With a wet cloth, she wiped his face, undressed him, and then she undressed herself, letting down the mosquito net so the little children wouldn't see if they woke up. She was tired of waiting for a man to stay, then waiting for the men who had left, then hoping that all were mistaken due to the inaccuracy of the cards. While waiting, her skin wrinkled, her breasts sagged, and her heart no longer burned with the fervor of old love. She groped for Aureliano in the dark and kissed his neck with the affectionate tenderness of a mother: ""Oh, my poor little boy. ""Aureliano shuddered with a languid touch, noiselessly, he left behind the shores of pain and met Remedios, who had turned into a vast lake with no horizon, redolent of young animals and freshly ironed clothes. When he found himself drifting aimlessly on that lake, he wept. At first, they were sobs of pent-up, bitter anguish. Then he awkwardly swam in a boundless source of water, feeling something both slightly painful and achingly about to burst inside his stomach. By flicking his head with her finger, she waited until his body expelled a grayish substance that left him exhausted. At that moment, Pila Tecnera asked him: ""Who is that?"". Aureliano told her the name of that person. She let out a laugh, the kind of laugh that used to startle the pigeons but now did not wake the children. ""Then you must marry the girl."" She mocked him. But in that mockery, Aureliano found a quiet place of sympathy. When he left the room, he had left behind not only the uncertainty about his own strength but also the bitter weight that had been choking his heart for many months.

She was tired of waiting for a man who would stay for good, of men who left, and of countless men who lost their way to her house, and the inconsistency of the cards had confused her mind. During the years she spent waiting, her skin had wrinkled, her breasts had sagged, and the fire in her heart had extinguished. In the dark, she groped for Aureliano. She pressed her hand on his stomach and kissed his neck with maternal affection, murmuring, ""Poor child."" Aureliano shivered. With a silent, calm skillfulness, without making the slightest wrong move, he released all the pain that had accumulated inside him, and Remedios turned into an endless swamp smelling of wild animals and freshly ironed clothes within him. Aureliano was crying when he surfaced from the mire. At first, he was sobbing uncontrollably, in short bursts. Then, as if something painful inside him had swollen and suddenly burst, he emptied out. The woman, scratching his head with her fingertips, patiently waited until he expelled the darkness consuming his life from his body. Then, she asked, ""Who?"" Aureliano told her who he was. Pilar Ternera, with her usual laughter that always startled the pigeons, this time laughed without waking even the children. ""Are you going to be a nanny or a husband?"" she mocked.

140,"She kept her promise. But it was a bad moment, because the house had lost its peace of former days. When she discovered Rebeca’s passion, which was impossible to keep secret because of her shouts, Amaranta suffered an attack of fever. She also suffered from the barb of a lonely love. Shut up in the bathroom, she would release herself from the torment of a hopeless passion by writing feverish letters, which she finally hid in the bottom of her trunk. Úrsula barely had the strength to take care of the two sick girls. She was unable, after prolonged and insidious interrogations, to ascertain the causes of Amaranta’s prostration. Finally, in another moment of inspiration, she forced the lock on the trunk and found the letters tied with a pink ribbon, swollen with fresh lilies and still wet with tears, addressed and never sent to Pietro Crespi. Weeping with rage, she cursed the day that it had occurred to her to buy the pianola, and she forbade the embroidery lessons and decreed a kind of mourning with no one dead which was to be prolonged until the daughters got over their hopes. Useless was the intervention of José Arcadio Buendía, who had modified his first impression of Pietro Crespi and admired his ability in the manipulation of musical machines. So that when Pilar Ternera told Aureliano that Remedios had decided on marriage, he could see that the news would only give his parents more trouble. Invited to the parlor for a formal interview, José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula listened stonily to their son’s declaration. When he learned the name of the fiancée, however, José Arcadio Buendía grew red with indignation. “Love is a disease,” he thundered. “With so many pretty and decent girls around, the only thing that occurs to you is to get married to the daughter of our enemy.” But Úrsula agreed with the choice. She confessed her affection for the seven Moscote sisters. for their beauty, their ability for work, their modesty, and their good manners, and she celebrated her son’s prudence. Conquered by his wife’s enthusiasm, José Arcadio Buendía then laid down one condition: Rebeca, who was the one he wanted, would marry Pietro Crespi. Úrsula would take Amaranta on a trip to the capital of the province when she had time, so that contact with different people would alleviate her disappointment. Rebeca got her health back just as soon as she heard of the agreement, and she wrote her fiancé a jubilant letter that she submitted to her parents’ approval and put into the mail without the use of any intermediaries. Amaranta pretended to accept the decision and little by little she recovered from her fevers, but she promised herself that Rebeca would marry only over her dead body.","- I promise to go talk to the girl, - she said, - and you will see that bringing her to you is not difficult at all. She fulfilled her promise at an inopportune moment because Buendía's house had lost the tranquility of the earlier days. When she discovered Rebeca's passion, which could not be kept secret because the girl kept screaming incessantly, Amaranta also became feverish. The girl also felt the painful thorn of lonely love. Locking herself in the bathroom, the girl calmed the storm of a hopeless passion by writing passionate letters that she contentedly hid at the bottom of a chest. Úrsula barely had the strength to take care of her two sick daughters. During the long and delicate inquiries, she still could not understand what had led Amaranta to such a state of decline. Finally, in a moment of sudden insight, she broke the chest's lock and found the letters tied with a pink ribbon, swollen with fresh lilies, still smudged with tears, meant to be sent but never to be sent to Pietro Crespi. Weeping with indignation, she cursed the moment she got the idea to buy the automatic piano, banned the embroidery lessons, and declared mourning, a mourning without a dead person, for a long period until her daughters' disillusionment passed. José Arcadio Buendía, who had by then corrected his initial impression of Pietro Crespi and admired his skillful use of musical machines, intervened in the matter, but all his efforts were in vain. So when Pilar Ternera informed Aureliano that Remedios was ready to get married, he understood that this news would end all the distress for his parents. But that very news put him face to face with the actual situation. Invited to the clinic to attend a regular seminar, José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula calmly listened to their son's expressions. When he learned the name of his son's lover, José Arcadio Buendía's face turned red with shame. ""Love is a plague,"" he angrily thundered. ""There are so many beautiful and respectable girls for you, yet you go and take the daughter of my enemy."" But Úrsula approved of her son's choice. She expressed her affection and admiration for the seven Moscote sisters, all of whom were beautiful, hardworking, well-mannered, and well-educated. And she congratulated her son on his wise choice of a lifelong partner. Persuaded by his wife's enthusiasm, José Arcadio Buendía set one condition: Rebeca, who was suitable, would marry Pietro Crespi. During a trip when there is time, Úrsula will take Amaranta to the city so that interacting with a different crowd will gradually help her feel better, and she will wake up from her delusion. Rebecca recovered very quickly when she learned of the family's unanimous opinion and immediately wrote a cheerful letter to inform her lover of her parents' official decision, then she put it in the mailbox without needing an intermediary anymore. Amaranta pretended to comply with her parents' decision and gradually recovered from the fever, but she kept telling herself that if Rebeca wanted to marry Pietro Crespi, she would have to step over her dead body.",24.08,23.916,"He also kept his word. However, it coincided with a bad time; the old order and harmony at home were no longer there. When Rebeca's love fever, which could no longer be kept secret due to her shouting and yelling, was revealed, a fire also ignited in Amaranta's heart. She too was burning with the pain of a secret love. She would lock herself in the bathroom, pour her hopeless love into passionate letters, and then hide the letters at the bottom of her chest. Ursula was exhausted from dealing with the illness of the two girls who had fallen into bed. No matter what she did, she could not learn Amaranta's trouble. Finally, it came to her mind. This time, she went and rummaged through Amaranta's chest and found a stack of letters tied with a pink ribbon, written to Pietro Crespi but never sent, swollen by the lilies placed between them that had not yet dried, and wet with tears that had not yet dried. Crying with rage, she cursed the day she thought of becoming a laterna, banned the girls' embroidery lessons, and declared mourning until the girls lost all hope, even though there was no death in sight. Jose Arcadio Buendia, who changed his initial negative impression of Pietro Crespi and admired his skill with musical instruments, also failed to calm his wife. Just at that moment, when Pilar Ternera informed Aureliano that Remedios was willing to marry, this event added fuel to the fire. Aureliano realized that bringing up this matter to his parents would only serve to upset them further. Jose Arcadio Buendia and Ursula, who were called to the living room to discuss a private and important matter, listened to their son's words without making a sound. However, when Jose Arcadio Buendia heard the name of the prospective bride, he turned red and purple. Love is a terrible affliction, he shouted at the top of his lungs. With so many decent and honorable girls around, you choose to marry the daughter of our sworn enemy. Ursula, on the other hand, found this choice quite appropriate. She praised the beauty, manners, industriousness, and politeness of the Moscote sisters, saying she loved all seven of them, and congratulated her son. Seeing his wife's delight, Jose Arcadio Buendia saw no other way but to concede and put forth a condition: Since the man was also in favor, Pietro Crespi and Rebeca would also marry. Ursula would take Amaranta to the capital at the first opportunity; the different environment and different people would console the girl. As soon as she heard the news, Rebeca's illness vanished. She sat down and wrote a letter to her fiancé, sharing the good news. After showing the letter to her parents and getting their approval, she mailed it herself without needing an intermediary. Amaranta seemed to accept the family's decision. In time, her health improved, but she swore that Rebeca would only marry over her dead body.",13.616,13.362,"He fulfilled it. But at a bad time, because the house had lost the peace of other days. Upon discovering Rebeca's passion, which could not be kept secret due to her screams, Amaranta suffered a bout of fever.

Locked in the bathroom, she relieved the torment of a hopeless passion by writing feverish letters that she contented herself with hiding at the bottom of the trunk.

Finally, in another moment of inspiration, she forced the lock of the trunk and found the letters tied with pink ribbons, swollen with fresh lilies and still wet with tears, addressed to but never sent to Pietro Crespi. Crying with fury, she cursed the hour she thought of buying the player piano, prohibited embroidery classes, and decreed a sort of mourning without a dead person that was to last until the daughters gave up their hopes. José Arcadio Buendía's intervention was useless, as he had changed his first impression of Pietro Crespi and admired his skill in handling musical machines. So when Pilar Ternera told Aureliano that Remedios was determined to marry, he understood that the news would further trouble his parents. But he faced the situation. Summoned to the sitting room for a formal interview, José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula listened impassively to their son's declaration. However, upon hearing the name of the bride, José Arcadio Buendía flushed with indignation. “Love is a plague,” he thundered. “With so many pretty and decent girls, the only thing you can think of is to marry the enemy's daughter.” But Úrsula agreed with the choice.

141,"The following Saturday José Arcadio Buendía put on his dark suit, his celluloid collar, and the deerskin boots that he had worn for the first time the night of the party, and went to ask for the hand of Remedios Moscote. The magistrate and his wife received him, pleased and worried at the same time, for they did not know the reason for the unexpected visit, and then they thought that he was confused about the name of the intended bride. In order to remove the mistake, the mother woke Remedios up and carried her into the living room, still drowsy from sleep. They asked her if it was true that she had decided to get married, and she answered, whimpering, that she only wanted them to let her sleep. José Arcadio Buendía, understanding the distress of the Moscotes, went to clear things up with Aureliano. When he returned, the Moscotes had put on formal clothing, had rearranged the furniture and put fresh flowers in the vases, and were waiting in the company of their older daughters. Overwhelmed by the unpleasantness of the occasion and the bothersome hard collar, José Arcadio Buendía confirmed the fact that Remedios, indeed, was the chosen one. “It doesn’t make sense,” Don Apolinar Moscote said with consternation. “We have six other daughters, all unmarried, and at an age where they deserve it, who would be delighted to be the honorable wife of a gentleman as serious and hard-working as your son, and Aurelito lays his eyes precisely on the one who still wets her bed.” His wife, a well-preserved woman with afflicted eyelids and expression, scolded his mistake. When they finished the fruit punch, they willingly accepted Aureliano’s decision. Except that Señora Moscote begged the favor of speaking to Úrsula alone. Intrigued, protesting that they were involving her in men’s affairs, but really feeling deep emotion, Úrsula went to visit her the next day. A half hour later she returned with the news that Remedios had not reached puberty. Aureliano did not consider that a serious barrier. He had waited so long that he could wait as long as was necessary until his bride reached the age of conception.","A week later, José Arcadio Buendía dressed in a dark wool suit, a collared shirt, and the chamois leather boots he had worn on the night of the new house celebration, went to ask for Remedios Moscote's hand in marriage for his son. The magistrate and his wife welcomed him with a mix of joy and worry, because they did not know the purpose of this sudden visit, and then they thought he might have mistaken the name of the chosen daughter. To avoid any misunderstanding, the mother woke Remedios and carried her into the living room. The little girl was still half-asleep. They asked her if she really wanted to get married, and she cried and replied that she just wanted everyone to leave her alone so she could sleep. José Arcadio Buendía, understanding the Moscotes' confusion, went home to explain everything to Aureliano. When he returned to the magistrate's house, the Moscotes had dressed according to protocol, rearranged the furniture, and replaced the flowers in the vase. Weary from doing something against his will and from the tight collar that was choking him, José Arcadio Buendía confirmed that Remedios was indeed the one Aureliano had chosen to marry. ""It's not going well at all,"" Apolinar Moscote said sadly. ""We still have six daughters, all of whom are unmarried and of marriageable age, and they would all be delighted to become the proper wives of respectable and hardworking young men like the one in your family, but unfortunately, Aureliano only fancies the little girl who still wets the bed."" His wife, a woman who still retained a graceful charm, with slightly melancholic eyes and demeanor, had opposed his foolish words. When everyone finished drinking the fruit juice, the Moscotes couple happily accepted Aureliano's proposal. However, Mrs. Moscote requested to speak privately with Mrs. Úrsula. Partly out of curiosity, partly out of self-pity for being troubled by men's issues, but actually very fearful and emotional, Úrsula visited Mrs. Moscote the next day. Half an hour later, she returned with the news that Remedios was not yet of age. Aureliano did not consider this a major obstacle. He had waited long enough that he could wait as long as necessary until the girl reached puberty.",24.774,24.552,"The following Saturday, Jose Arcadio Buendia dressed in his best clothes. He put on his navy blue suit, attached his cardboard collar, wore the deerskin boots he had worn on the night of the first party, and went to ask Remedios Moscote's father for her hand in marriage by God's command. The magistrate and his wife were both pleased and uneasy because they did not know the reason for this unexpected visit. After the reason for the visit was explained, they came to the conclusion that there was a mistake in the name of the prospective bride. To clear up this mistake, the woman woke Remedios from her sleep, took the drowsy child in her arms, and brought her. They asked the girl whether her intention to marry was genuine, and she, half asleep and half awake, said that at that moment, all she wanted was to sleep. Understanding the concerns of the Moscotes, Jose Arcadio Buendia went to ask Aureliano about the truth of the matter. When he returned, the Moscotes were dressed up, had rearranged the chairs and sofas in the guest room, placed flowers in vases, and were waiting with their eldest daughters lined up beside them. Feeling uncomfortable both from the unpleasantness of the situation and the stiff collar that was choking him, Jose Arcadio Buendia confirmed that the prospective bride was indeed Remedios: Don Apolinar Moscote, too stunned to know what to say, remarked, Is this for real? We have six more daughters. And they are all of marriageable age, all single, and all would be delighted to become the wife of a sensible, hardworking young man like your son. Aureliano, on the other hand, sets his eyes on someone who still wets their pants. His wife, a woman with sad eyes and a sad face, who remains steadfast even if the mosque collapses, immediately scolded her husband for his indiscretion. After drinking the fruit liqueur, they gladly accepted Aureliano's decision. Only, Senora Moscote said she wanted to speak with Ursula woman to woman. Grumbling about being involved in men's business with her dough-covered hands, but also feeling deeply moved, Ursula got up the next day and went to see Senora Moscote. Half an hour later, she returned with the news that Remedios was not yet of age. Aureliano did not see this as a serious obstacle at all. He had waited so long for his bride that he could wait until she came of age.",20.206,19.966,"On the following Saturday, José Arcadio Buendía put on the dark wool suit, the celluloid collar, and the suede boots that he had worn for the first time on the night of the party, and went to ask for the hand of Remedios Moscote. The magistrate and his wife received him both pleased and troubled, because they were unaware of the purpose of the unexpected visit, and then they thought that he had confused the name of the intended bride. To clear up the mistake, the mother woke Remedios and carried her in her arms to the living room, still dazed from sleep. They asked her if she was truly determined to get married, and she replied, whimpering, that she only wanted to be left to sleep. José Arcadio Buendía, understanding the confusion of the Moscotes, went to clarify things with Aureliano. When he returned, the Moscote couple had dressed in formal clothes, rearranged the furniture, and put fresh flowers in the vases, and they awaited him in the company of their older daughters. Weighed down by the ingratitude of the occasion and the discomfort of the stiff collar, José Arcadio Buendía confirmed that, indeed, Remedios was the chosen one. ""This makes no sense,"" said a dismayed don Apolinar Moscote. ""We have six more daughters, all single and of marriageable age, who would be delighted to be the worthy wives of serious and hardworking gentlemen like your son, and Aurelito sets his eyes precisely on the only one who still wets the bed."" His wife, a well-preserved woman with sorrowful eyelids and gestures, reproached him for his impropriety. When they finished drinking the fruit shake, they had gladly accepted Aureliano's decision. Only that Mrs. Moscote begged the favor of speaking alone with Úrsula. Intrigued, protesting that she was being entangled in men's affairs, but actually intimidated by the emotion, Úrsula went to visit her the next day. Half an hour later she returned with the news that Remedios was prepubescent. Aureliano did not consider it a serious obstacle. He had waited so long that he could wait as long as necessary, until the bride was of childbearing age.",50.222,50.096
142,"The newfound harmony was interrupted by the death of Melquíades. Although it was a foreseeable event, the circumstances were not. A few months after his return, a process of aging had taken place in him that was so rapid and critical that soon he was treated as one of those useless great-grandfathers who wander about the bedrooms like shades, dragging their feet, remembering better times aloud, and whom no one bothers about or remembers really until the morning they find them dead in their bed. At first José Arcadio Buendía helped him in his work, enthusiastic over the novelty of the daguerreotypes and the predictions of Nostradamus. But little by little he began abandoning him to his solitude, for communication was becoming Increasingly difficult. He was losing his sight and his hearing, he seemed to confuse the people he was speaking to with others he had known in remote epochs of mankind, and he would answer questions with a complex hodgepodge of languages. He would walk along groping in the air, although he passed between objects with an inexplicable fluidity, as if be were endowed with some instinct of direction based on an immediate prescience. One day he forgot to put in his false teeth, which at night he left in a glass of water beside his bed, and he never put them in again. When Úrsula undertook the enlargement of the house, she had them build him a special room next to Aureliano’s workshop, far from the noise and bustle of the house, with a window flooded with light and a bookcase where she herself put in order the books that were almost destroyed by dust and moths, the flaky stacks of paper covered with indecipherable signs, and the glass with his false teeth, where some aquatic plants with tiny yellow flowers had taken root. The new place seemed to please Melquíades, because he was never seen any more, not even in the dining room, He only went to Aureliano’s workshop, where he would spend hours on end scribbling his enigmatic literature on the parchments that he had brought with him and that seemed to have been made out of some dry material that crumpled like puff paste. There he ate the meals that Visitación brought him twice a day, although in the last days he lost his appetite and fed only on vegetables. He soon acquired the forlorn look that one sees in vegetarians. His skin became covered with a thin moss, similar to that which flourished on the antique vest that he never took off, and his breath exhaled the odor of a sleeping animal. Aureliano ended up forgetting about him, absorbed in the composition of his poems, but on one occasion he thought he understood something of what Melquíades was saying in his groping monologues, and he paid attention. In reality, the only thing that could be isolated in the rocky paragraphs was the insistent hammering on the word equinox, equinox, equinox, and the name of Alexander von Humboldt. Arcadio got a little closer to him when he began to help Aureliano in his silverwork. Melquíades answered that effort at communication at times by giving forth with phrases in Spanish that had very little to do with reality. One afternoon, however, he seemed to be illuminated by a sudden emotion. Years later, facing the firing squad, Arcadio would remember the trembling with which Melquíades made him listen to several pages of his impenetrable writing, which of course he did not understand, but which when read aloud were like encyclicals being chanted. Then he smiled for the first time in a long while and said in Spanish: “When I die, burn mercury in my room for three days.” Arcadio told that to José Arcadio Buendía and the latter tried to get more explicit information, but he received only one answer: “I have found immortality.” When Melquíades’ breathing began to smell, Arcadio took him to bathe in the river on Thursday mornings. He seemed to get better. He would undress and get into the water with the boys, and his mysterious sense of orientation would allow him to avoid the deep and dangerous spots. “We come from the water,” he said on a certain occasion. Much time passed in that way without anyone’s seeing him in the house except on the night when he made a pathetic effort to fix the pianola, and when he would go to the river with Arcadio, carrying under his arm a gourd and a bar of palm oil soap wrapped in a towel. One Thursday before they called him to go to the river, Aureliano heard him say: “I have died of fever on the dunes of Singapore.” That day he went into the water at a bad spot and they did not find him until the following day, a few miles downstream, washed up on a bright bend in the river and with a solitary vulture sitting on his stomach. Over the scandalized protests of Úrsula, who wept with more grief than she had had for her own father, José Arcadio Buendía was opposed to their burying him. “He is immortal,” he said, “and he himself revealed the formula of his resurrection.” He brought out the forgotten water pipe and put a kettle of mercury to boil next to the body, which little by little was filling with blue bubbles. Don Apolinar Moscote ventured to remind him that an unburied drowned man was a danger to public health. “None of that, because he’s alive,” was the answer of José Arcadio Buendía, who finished the seventy-two hours with the mercurial incense as the body was already beginning to burst with a livid fluorescence, the soft whistles of which impregnated the house with a pestilential vapor. Only then did he permit them to bury him, not in any ordinary way, but with the honors reserved for Macondo’s greatest benefactor. It was the first burial and the best-attended one that was ever seen in the town, only surpassed, a century later, by Big Mama’s funeral carnival. They buried him in a grave dug in the center of the plot destined for the cemetery, with a stone on which they wrote the only thing they knew about him: MELQUÍADES. They gave him his nine nights of wake. In the tumult that gathered in the courtyard to drink coffee, tell jokes, and play cards. Amaranta found a chance to confess her love to Pietro Crespi, who a few weeks before had formalized his promise to Rebeca and had set up a store for musical instruments and mechanical toys in the same section where the Arabs had lingered in other times swapping knickknacks for macaws, and which the people called the Street of the Turks. The Italian, whose head covered with patent leather curls aroused in women an irrepressible need to sigh, dealt with Amaranta as with a capricious little girl who was not worth taking seriously.","The house regained its peaceful and warm atmosphere, and it was only disrupted when Melquiades passed away. Although his death was an obvious event, the exact timing of it was unpredictable. After returning for a few months, a rapid and intense aging process occurred in the old man’s body, to the extent that he was immediately regarded as one of those decrepit old men, wandering around like shadows in the room, heavily dragging his feet, mumbling loudly about the glorious memories of his life. In reality, old people were those who were not cared for or remembered by anyone until one day, they were found dead, stiff on their beds in the morning. At first, José Arcadio Buendía helped him, fascinated by the novelty of photography and the prophecies of Nostradamus. But gradually, he left him alone in his own lonely world, because communication between the two became increasingly difficult. He became more and more blind and deaf, as if he mistook the people talking to him for those he knew in the distant past of humanity, and he answered their questions with rambling sentences mixing various languages together. As if guided by direct intuition, he groped through the air as he walked. Even though he had to weave between objects, he never knocked them over. One day, he forgot to put in his false teeth, which were still soaking in a cup of water next to his bedside. and he never used them again. When Úrsula decided to expand the house, she made him a private room right next to Aureliano’s jewelry workshop. This room is far from the noise and kitchen work, with a window letting in abundant light into the room and a bookshelf filled with books almost tattered by dust and gnawed by cockroaches, scraps of paper densely covered with illegible writing, and a water jug containing false teeth that had tiny yellow flowers blooming on water lettuce, all arranged by Úrsula herself. The new room seemed to please old Melquíades because he was never seen leaving his room, not even during mealtimes when he was absent from the dining room. He only went to Aureliano's workshop and stayed there for hours and hours to write incomprehensible literature on parchment. It seemed as though these parchments would crack because they were made from a material as dry as puff pastry. There, he ate the meals brought by Visitación twice a day, although in his final days he did not like to eat and only consumed vegetables. Not long after, he bore the lonely and sorrowful appearance of those who eat vegetarian. A layer of young moss, identical to the thick moss on his all-season coat that he never took off, had covered his skin, and his breath reeked of the farts of a sleeping animal. Aureliano also forgot him, as he was engrossed in writing his poems. But there were times when he thought he understood a few things the old man said during his aimless monologues, and he listened intently. In truth, the only thing he could distinguish in the old man's incomprehensible words was the endless repetition of the word Equinox and the name Alexander von Humboldt. Arcadio was closer to him when he helped Aureliano in the goldsmith's workshop. Melquiades responded to this effort to communicate by occasionally bursting out in long strings of Spanish that had little to do with the reality of life. However, there was one afternoon when he suddenly became cheerful for a moment. In later years, standing before the firing squad, Arcadio remembered his horror when he heard Melquiades read a few pages of the manuscript. Of course, he did not understand their meaning, but when he heard the old man read them aloud, he felt they sounded like the Pope's decrees. After that, for the first time in many years, he smiled and said in Spanish: ""When I die, burn me in a fire of mercury for three days right in this room."" Arcadio recounted this to José Arcadio Buendía, who then tried every way possible to get Melquiades to explain more clearly, but he only received a terse reply: ""I have reached the level of immortality."" When Melquiades' breath became foul, Arcadio took him to bathe in the river every Thursday morning. He seemed to get better. He took off his clothes and waded into the river to bathe with the children, and his mystical intuition guided him to avoid the dangerous rocky parts of the river. ""We are all born from water,"" he once said. He lived like that for quite a long time, although no one saw him in the house except when he made a great effort to repair the automatic piano. When he went to the river with Arcadio, he carried a water scoop made from a gourd shell and a bar of soap wrapped in a towel tucked under his arm. One Thursday, before they called him to go to the river, Aureliano heard him say: ""I died of malaria on the sand dunes of Singapore."" That day, he waded into the river along a dangerous path, and they did not find him until the next morning when his body washed up on a sunlit islet a few kilometers downstream, with a lone hawk perched on his belly. Despite Ursula's loud protests, who cried for him more bitterly than for her own father, José Arcadio Buendía resisted the villagers' intention to bury him immediately. ""He is immortal,"" he said, ""and he himself has revealed the method of resurrection."" He revived the forgotten water pipes and boiled a cauldron of mercury beside the corpse, which was increasingly covered in greenish blisters. Don Apolinar Moscote boldly reminded him that not burying a drowned body immediately would endanger the health of the villagers. ""That's not true, because he is still alive."" That was José Arcadio Buendía's reply, who carried out the full sixty-two hours of burning mercury beside the corpse, and when the greenish blisters on the body began to burst like popcorn with a popping sound, filling the house with an unpleasant smell. Only then did he allow the burial, but not in any ordinary way, but with the solemn ceremonies befitting the greatest benefactor of Macondo. It was the first and most moving funeral ever seen in the village, and it was only overshadowed by the funeral of the Great Mother nearly a century later. He was buried in a raised grave in the center of the plot of land the village had designated as the cemetery, with a tombstone bearing the only thing known about him: MELQUIADES. They held nine nights of mourning for him. In the crowd gathered outside to drink coffee, chat, and play cards, Amaranta found an opportunity to confess her love to Pietro Crespi, who had officially proposed to Rebeca a few weeks earlier and had set up a music and leather toy shop at the spot where the Arabs used to stay to trade trinkets for long-tailed parrots, and the villagers still called it Turkish Street. The Italian, with his golden curly hair that made women sigh with longing, did not have to think much to treat Amaranta like a mischievous little girl.",23.867,23.792,"The newly established order at home was disrupted by Melquiades' death. Melquiades' death was not an unexpected event, but it happened under unexpected circumstances. A few months after his arrival, the poor man suddenly deteriorated so much that he quickly turned into a useless old grandfather who wandered like a shadow in the bedrooms, dragged his feet while walking, never stopped talking about the old days, and whose existence everyone forgot until he was found dead in his bed. In the beginning, Jose Arcadio Buendia, who had taken an interest in photography and Nostradamus' prophecies, was helping him. But as it became increasingly difficult for them to understand each other, Jose Arcadio also started to leave Melquiades alone. Melquiades had become blind and deaf. He confused the people he talked to with those he had known long ago, and answered questions with words formed from a mishmash of various languages. He wandered around breathing deeply, and although he moved among objects, he walked without touching anything as if he had an instinctive sense of direction. One day, he forgot to put on his dentures that he had placed in the glass of water by his bedside the night before; and then he never wore them again. When Ursula decided to expand the house, she had Melquiades build a room next to Aureliano's workshop, away from the noise and commotion of the house. She had a window installed that let in plenty of light, had a bookshelf made, and personally cleaned and arranged on the shelves the books that were almost falling apart from dust and moths, the bundles of papers filled with scribbles, the glass holding his dentures and tiny yellow-flowered water plants rooting at the bottom. Melquiades must have liked his new place very much because he was never seen around again; he even stopped coming to the dining room. He only went to Aureliano's workshop and spent hours writing on the dry parchment papers that crumbled like starched cloth, which he brought with him. He also ate the meals that Visitacion brought him twice a day there. Recently, he had lost his appetite and had started eating nothing but vegetables. Soon, a sorrowful pallor, like that of vegetarians, settled on his face. His skin developed a thin layer of moss, like the old vest he never took off. His breath began to smell like that of sleeping animals. Aureliano, who was entirely absorbed in his rhyming, gradually forgot about him. Only once did something comprehensible come to his ears from Melquiades' endless monologues, and he listened. In fact, the only thing that could be gleaned from Melquiades' mumblings was the constantly repeated word equinox, equinox, equinox, and the name Alexander von Humboldt. When Arcadio began to help Aureliano with his silver work, he got a bit closer to Melquiades. Melquiades responded to his attempts to get closer with nonsensical answers in Spanish. But one day, on an overly emotional evening, the clouds enveloping his brain seemed to part for a moment. Years later, as Arcadio stood before the firing squad, he would remember the shiver he felt on the day Melquiades sat him down and read a few pages of writings that he didn't understand but which sounded like sacred commands when read aloud. After Melquiades finished reading, he smiled for the first time in a long while and spoke in Spanish: When I die, boil mercury in my room for three days, Arcadio, he hinted these to Jose Arcadio Buendia. Although he tried to learn something more detailed; he could not get any words from Melquiades other than, I have attained the secret of immortality. When Melquiades' breath started to smell bad, Arcadio began taking him to the river on Thursday mornings. Bathing seemed to do him good. Melquiades would undress and dive into the water with the young men. With that mysterious sense of direction, he stayed away from deep and dangerous places. Once he said, ""We are originally water. We all originated from water,"" he said. This went on for a long time. Other than the night of the party where he made a pitiful effort to operate the lantern, and the days he went to the river with Arcadio, carrying a gourd, a towel, and almond oil soap under his arm, no one saw him. One Thursday morning, when Aureliano went to take him to the river, he heard him say, ""I died of fever on the beaches of Singapore."" That day, Melquiades dove into a place in the water where he shouldn't have, and he never came back up. They found his body only the next day, several miles away. The current had made a bend there and thrown him ashore. When they found him, a vulture was perched on his belly. Despite all of Ursula's resistance, who had not shed so many tears even when her own father died, Jose Arcadio Buendia did not allow Melquiades to be buried. He kept saying that Melquiades was immortal and that he himself had revealed the secret of resurrection after death. He brought out an alembic that had been forgotten in a corner and placed the pot of boiling mercury, bubbling with blue bubbles, next to the corpse. Don Apolinar Moscote dared to remind him that keeping a drowned person unburied was harmful to public health. Jose Arcadio Buendia, saying, ""You are mistaken, sir, because he is alive,"" boiled the mercury burner for exactly seventy-two hours until the corpse shone brightly and seemed about to explode, and a pestilent odor filled the house. Only after seventy-two hours had passed did he allow them to bury him, and not haphazardly, but with a grand funeral that could be conceived for the greatest man of Macondo. It was the first and most crowded funeral in the village. A more grandiose one would only be seen a century later at the funeral procession of the Great-Grandmother. They buried him in a pit dug in the middle of the area they had designated as the cemetery. They placed a stone at his head and wrote the only thing they knew about him: MELQUIADES. They kept vigil for nine nights. Taking advantage of the chaos created by the crowd that gathered in the garden to drink coffee, tell jokes, and play cards, Amaranta found an opportunity to declare her love to Pietro Crespi. A few weeks earlier, Pietro Crespi had formalized the promise he made to Rebeca, and opened a shop selling musical instruments and mechanical toys in a place where Arabs used to trade trinkets with parrot monstrosities and villagers called Turkish Street. The handsome Italian, whose head adorned with shiny curls made every woman's heart skip a beat, treated Amaranta as if she were a spoiled child not worth taking seriously.",21.007,20.918,"The regained harmony was only interrupted by the death of Melquíades. Although it was a foreseeable event, the circumstances were not. A few months after his return, he had undergone such a rapid and critical aging process that he was soon considered one of those useless great-grandfathers who wander like shadows through the bedrooms, dragging their feet, reminiscing aloud about better times, and whom no one really cares about or remembers until the day they are found dead in bed.

In reality, the only thing he could isolate from the stony paragraphs was the insistent hammering of the word equinox equinox equinox, and the name Alexander Von Humboldt. Arcadio got a little closer to him when he started helping Aureliano in the silversmithing. Melquíades reciprocated that effort of communication by sometimes uttering phrases in Spanish that had very little to do with reality.

Years later, in front of the firing squad, Arcadio would remember the tremor with which Melquíades made him listen to several pages of his impenetrable writing, which he of course did not understand, but which, when read aloud, seemed like sung encyclicals.

Arcadio told José Arcadio Buendía, and he tried to get more explicit information, but only got one response: ""I have achieved immortality."" When Melquíades's breath began to smell, Arcadio took him to bathe in the river on Thursday mornings. He seemed to improve. He would undress and get into the water along with the boys, and his mysterious sense of orientation allowed him to avoid deep and dangerous spots. ""We are of the water,"" he said on one occasion. Thus, a long time passed without anyone seeing him in the house, except for the night he made a touching effort to repair the player piano, and when he went to the river with Arcadio carrying under his arm the gourd and the corozo soap ball wrapped in a towel. One Thursday, before they called him to go to the river, Aureliano heard him say: ""I have died of fever in the sands of Singapore."" That day he went into the water by a wrong path and was not found until the next morning, several kilometers downstream, stranded in a luminous bend with a solitary buzzard perched on his belly. Against the scandalized protests of Úrsula, who mourned him more deeply than her own father, José Arcadio Buendía opposed burying him. ""He is immortal,"" he said, ""and he himself revealed the formula for resurrection.""

Don Apolinar Moscote dared to remind him that an unburied drowned body was a danger to public health. ""None of that, since he is alive,"" was José Arcadio Buendía's reply, who completed the seventy-two hours of mercurial fumigations when the corpse was already beginning to burst into a livid bloom, whose faint whistles filled the house with a pestilent vapor. Only then did he allow him to be buried, but not just in any way, but with the honors reserved for the greatest benefactor of Macondo. It was the first and most attended burial ever seen in the town, surpassed only a century later by the funeral carnival of the Mamá Grande. He was buried in a tomb erected in the center of the land designated for the cemetery, with a headstone that bore the only thing known about him: MELQUÍADES. They held his nine nights of wake. In the tumult gathered in the courtyard to drink coffee, tell jokes, and play cards, Amaranta found an opportunity to confess her love to Pietro Crespi, who a few weeks earlier had formalized his engagement to Rebeca and was setting up a store of musical instruments and wind-up toys in the same area where the Arabs, who once traded trinkets for macaws, vegetated, and which people knew as the Street of the Turks.

The Italian was so impressed by the dramatics of the threat that he could not resist the temptation to mention it to Rebeca. That was how Amaranta’s trip, always put off by Úrsula’s work, was arranged in less than a week. Amaranta put up no resistance, but when she kissed Rebeca good-bye she whispered in her ear:","Amaranta felt hurt, and she furiously told Pietro Crespi that she was determined to stop her sister's wedding, even if they had to drag her dead body out of the house.

146,"With the absence of Úrsula, with the invisible presence of Melquíades, who continued his stealthy shuffling through the rooms, the house seemed enormous and empty. Rebeca took charge of domestic order, while the Indian woman took care of the bakery. At dusk, when Pietro Crespi would arrive, preceded by a cool breath of lavender and always bringing a toy as a gift, his fiancée would receive the visitor in the main parlor with doors and windows open to be safe from any suspicion. It was an unnecessary precaution, for the Italian had shown himself to be so respectful that he did not even touch the hand of the woman who was going to be his wife within the year. Those visits were filling the house with remarkable toys. Mechanical ballerinas, music boxes, acrobatic monkeys, trotting horses, clowns who played the tambourine: the rich and startling mechanical fauna that Pietro Crespi brought dissipated José Arcadio Buendía’s affliction over the death of Melquíades and carried him back to his old days as an alchemist. He lived at that time in a paradise of disemboweled animals, of mechanisms that had been taken apart in an attempt to perfect them with a system of perpetual motion based upon the principles of the pendulum. Aureliano, for his part, had neglected the workshop in order to teach little Remedios to read and write. At first the child preferred her dolls to the man who would come every afternoon and who was responsible for her being separated from her toys in order to be bathed and dressed and seated in the parlor to receive the visitor. But Aureliano’s patience and devotion finally won her over, up to the point where she would spend many hours with him studying the meaning of the letters and sketching in a notebook with colored pencils little houses with cows in the corral and round suns with yellow rays that hid behind the hills.","The house seemed to grow larger and emptier without Úrsula at home and with the death of Melquíades, but it seemed as if his shadow still flitted through the rooms. Rebeca took care of the household chores, while the Indian girl managed the candy shop. In the early evening, when Pietro Crespi, dressed in clothes scented with lavender, arrived, always bringing a toy as a gift, his beloved would receive him in the parlor with all the doors wide open to avoid any suspicion. This was an unnecessary precaution because the young Italian had shown himself to be so noble that he did not dare to hold the hand of the girl who would be his wife a year before their wedding. Those visits gradually filled the house with toys. Dancing dolls that moved with a wind-up key, music boxes, monkeys performing tricks on a wire, galloping horses, drumming clowns—this was a rich and marvelous collection of semi-mechanical toys that consoled José Arcadio Buendía in his sorrow over Melquíades' death and brought him back to the time when he was eager about alchemy. Thus, he lived in a world of dissected animals and machines taken apart to study and perfect a system of continuous movement based on the principles of the pendulum clock. As for himself, Aureliano abandoned his work in the goldsmith's shop to teach little Remedios how to read and write. At first, the little girl demanded that the guest who often visited in the afternoons bring her doll parts, and she would be a reprehensible child if people made her sit in the room and entertain guests. But with perseverance and dedication, Aureliano managed to entice the little girl to the point where she would sit with him for hours, absorbing the lessons and using colored pencils to draw on a small board pictures of little houses with cows grazing in the yard and a round sun perched atop the mountain, radiating golden rays.",22.189,21.895,"On one hand, the absence of Ursula, and on the other, the invisible presence of Melquiades wandering through the rooms dragging his feet, turned the house into a vast, empty ruin. Rebeca managed the house, and the Indian woman ran the oven. At twilight, when Pietro Crespi arrived with the heartwarming scent of lavender and the gift toys he never failed to bring, his fiancée would take him to the guest room, opening all the doors and windows wide so no one would think ill of them. This was an unnecessary precaution, as the Italian had shown himself to be so measured and respectful that he wouldn't even touch the hand of the girl who would become his wife within a year. Crespi's visits filled the house with beautiful toys. Dancing ballerinas when wound up, musical boxes that played by themselves, monkeys that jumped and somersaulted, galloping horses, tambourine-playing clowns, and many more. The various, mind-boggling toy animals brought by Pietro Crespi pulled Jose Arcadio Buendia out of the sorrow he felt from Melquiades' death and returned him to his old days of fascination with alchemy. For a while, he spent his time in a world of gutted animals, trying to perfect them by dismantling their mechanisms and turning them into perpetual motion machines using pendulum principles. As for Aureliano, he stopped doing any work, claiming he was teaching Remedios to read and write. At first, the child didn't want to leave her toys and preferred her dolls over washing and dressing up to wait in the guest room for this man who moved into their house every day.

At dusk, when Pietro Crespi arrived preceded by a fresh breath of lavender and always bringing a toy as a gift, his fiancée received him in the main room with doors and windows open to be safe from any suspicion. It was an unnecessary precaution, because the Italian had proven to be so respectful that he didn't even touch the hand of the woman who would be his wife within a year. Those visits gradually filled the house with marvelous toys. The wind-up dancers, the music boxes, the acrobat monkeys, the trotting horses, the drumming clowns, the rich and astonishing mechanical fauna that Pietro Crespi brought, dispelled José Arcadio Buendía's grief over Melquíades' death, and transported him back to his old alchemist days. He then lived in a paradise of gutted animals, dismantled mechanisms, trying to perfect them with a continuous motion system based on the principles of the pendulum. Aureliano, for his part, had neglected the workshop to teach little Remedios to read and write. At first, the girl preferred her dolls to the man who came every afternoon, and who was the reason she was taken away from her games to be bathed, dressed, and seated in the living room to receive the visit. But Aureliano's patience and devotion eventually won her over, to the point that she spent many hours with him studying the meaning of letters and drawing in a notebook with colored pencils, little houses with cows in the corrals, and round suns with yellow rays that hid behind the hills.",51.999,51.863

162,"José Arcadio Buendía finally got what he was looking for: he connected the mechanism of the clock to a mechanical ballerina, and the toy danced uninterruptedly to the rhythm of her own music for three days. That discovery excited him much more than any of his other harebrained undertakings. He stopped eating. He stopped sleeping. Only the vigilance and care of Rebeca kept him from being dragged off by his imagination into a state of perpetual delirium from which he would not recover. He would spend the nights walking around the room thinking aloud, searching for a way to apply the principles of the pendulum to oxcarts, to harrows, to everything that was useful when put into motion. The fever of insomnia fatigued him so much that one dawn he could not recognize the old man with white hair and uncertain gestures who came into his bedroom. It was Prudencio Aguilar. When he finally identified him, startled that the dead also aged, José Arcadio Buendía felt himself shaken by nostalgia. “Prudencio,” he exclaimed. “You’ve come from a long way off!” After many years of death the yearning for the living was so intense, the need for company so pressing, so terrifying the neatness of that other death which exists within death, that Prudencio Aguilar had ended up loving his worst enemy. He had spent a great deal of time looking for him. He asked the dead from Riohacha about him, the dead who came from the Upar Valley, those who came from the swamp, and no one could tell him because Macondo was a town that was unknown to the dead until Melquíades arrived and marked it with a small black dot on the motley maps of death. José Arcadio Buendía conversed with Prudencio Aguilar until dawn. A few hours later, worn out by the vigil, he went into Aureliano’s workshop and asked him: “What day is today?” Aureliano told him that it was Tuesday. “I was thinking the same thing,” José Arcadio Buendía said, “but suddenly I realized that it’s still Monday, like yesterday. Look at the sky, look at the walls, look at the begonias. Today is Monday too.” Used to his manias, Aureliano paid no attention to him. On the next day, Wednesday, José Arcadio Buendía went back to the workshop. “This is a disaster,” he said. “Look at the air, listen to the buzzing of the sun, the same as yesterday and the day before. Today is Monday too.” That night Pietro Crespi found him on the porch, weeping for Prudencio Aguilar, for Melquíades, for Rebeca’s parents, for his mother and father, for all of those he could remember and who were now alone in death. He gave him a mechanical bear that walked on its hind legs on a tightrope, but he could not distract him from his obsession. He asked him what had happened to the project he had explained to him a few days before about the possibility of building a pendulum machine that would help men to fly and he answered that it was impossible because a pendulum could lift anything into the air but it could not lift itself. On Thursday he appeared in the workshop again with the painful look of plowed ground. “The time machine has broken,” he almost sobbed, “and Úrsula and Amaranta so far away!” Aureliano scolded him like a child and he adopted a contrite air. He spent six hours examining things, trying to find a difference from their appearance on the previous day in the hope of discovering in them some change that would reveal the passage of time. He spent the whole night in bed with his eyes open, calling to Prudencio Aguilar, to Melquíades, to all the dead, so that they would share his distress. But no one came. On Friday. before anyone arose, he watched the appearance of nature again until he did not have the slightest doubt but that it was Monday. Then he grabbed the bar from a door and with the savage violence of his uncommon strength he smashed to dust the equipment in the alchemy laboratory, the daguerreotype room, the silver workshop, shouting like a man possessed in some high-sounding and fluent but completely incomprehensible language. He was about to finish off the rest of the house when Aureliano asked the neighbors for help. Ten men were needed to get him down, fourteen to tie him up, twenty to drag him to the chestnut tree in the courtyard, where they left him tied up, barking in the strange language and giving off a green froth at the mouth. When Úrsula and Amaranta returned he was still tied to the trunk of the chestnut tree by his hands and feet, soaked with rain and in a state of total innocence. They spoke to him and he looked at them without recognizing them, saying things they did not understand. Úrsula untied his wrists and ankles, lacerated by the pressure of the rope, and left him tied only by the waist. Later on they built him a shelter of palm brandies to protect him from the sun and the rain.","Finally, José Arcadio Buendía accomplished what he wanted to do. He connected the dancing doll to the clockwork mechanism, and it danced to the music for three consecutive days. This achievement made him happier than any of his previous exhausting endeavors. He did not eat. He did not sleep. Without Úrsula by his side to care for and look after him, he let himself drift into an imaginary world, which led him to a state of constant excitement. He spent long sleepless nights pacing back and forth in the room, muttering calculations, trying to apply the principles of the clock pendulum to ox carts, to plows, in short, to anything that could be set in motion. The fever from insomnia exhausted him so much that one early morning he could not recognize an old man with white hair who suddenly entered the bedroom with a bewildered gesture. It was Prudencio Aguilar. When he recognized Prudencio Aguilar, he was surprised to see that the dead also aged over the years. José Arcadio Buendía shivered with nostalgia. ""Ah, Prudencio,"" he exclaimed, ""how did you manage to come here from so far away?"" After so many years in the realm of the dead, how intense was the longing for the living, how pressing was the need for companionship, how terrifying was the proximity of another death that already existed within the realm of the dead, which Prudencio Aguilar had just wished upon his worst enemy. Prudencio Aguilar had spent a long time searching for him. Prudencio Aguilar inquired about him through the dead souls in Riohacha, through the dead souls in the Uga valley, through the dead souls from the marshlands, but no dead soul gave him the correct answer, because Macondo at that time was still a village unknown to the dead souls. It was not until Melquíades arrived and pointed out a black dot on the multicolored maps of death. José Arcadio Buendía talked with Prudencio until dawn. A few hours later, exhausted from lack of sleep, José Arcadio Buendía entered Aureliano's workshop and asked him, ""What day is it today?"" Aureliano replied to his father that it was Tuesday. ""I thought so too,"" José Arcadio Buendía said. ""But immediately I understood that today was still Monday, just like yesterday."" ""Look at the sky, look at the statues, look at the begonias."" ""Today is still Monday."" Accustomed to such nonsensical words, Aureliano did not listen to him. The next day, on Wednesday morning, José Arcadio Buendía entered the workshop again. ""This is a disaster,"" he said, ""Look at the wind, listen to the buzzing of the sun, just like yesterday, and the day before."" That night, Pietro Crespi found him in the hallway, crying with the dry sobs of an old man, crying for Prudencio Aguilar, crying for Melquíades, crying for Rebeca's parents, crying for his own parents, crying for everyone he could remember who was now lonely in death. Pietro Crespi gave him a wind-up bear that walked on two legs on a wire, but even this gift did not cheer him up. He asked Pietro about the plan he had given him days before, which was about the possibility of building a machine based on the principle of a clock pendulum that could lift any object into the air, allowing humans to fly. And Pietro replied that it was impossible because a clock pendulum could lift any object into the air but could not lift itself. On the hundredth day, he was back in the jewelry workshop with the miserable look of the earth being scraped. ""The time machine is broken,"" he sobbed, ""and Úrsula and Amaranta are very far away."" Aureliano scolded his father like a child, and he obediently listened. For six continuous hours, he inspected objects, trying to find some difference from the previous day to prove that time was still flowing sequentially. All night, he lay in bed with his eyes wide open, calling out to Prudencio Aguilar, calling out to Melquíades, calling out to all the dead to come and share his desolation. But no one came. On the sixth day, just before everyone woke up, he observed all the external signs of nature, watching until he was sure that it was still Monday. So he grabbed the wooden bar used to block the door and with his inherent brutal strength, he smashed to pieces the alchemical laboratory equipment, the goldsmith's workshop, and the camera. Then, like a demon, he screamed in a language that was both resonant and incessant, yet utterly incomprehensible. He was ready to destroy the entire house when fortunately, Aureliano had called the neighbors for help. It took ten strong men to bring him down, fourteen to tie him up, and twenty to drag him to the chestnut tree in the middle of the yard, where they left him tied up, free to bark out strange words and spit out green phlegm. When Ursula and Amaranta returned, he was still tightly bound to the tree, soaked and completely deranged. The mother and daughter spoke to him, but he did not recognize his own kin. He spoke to them about something incomprehensible. Ursula untied the ropes around his wrists and ankles, where the flesh had become calloused from the tight bindings, leaving him only tied at the waist. After that, they set up a makeshift palm leaf hut to shield him from the rain and sun.",24.846,24.75,"Jose Arcadio Buendia finally achieved his goal. He connected the clockwork mechanism to a ballerina, and the toy danced to its own rhythm for three days and three nights. This invention captivated his mind more than all his other absurd pursuits. He stopped eating and drinking. He couldn't sleep. Only Rebeca's care and affection kept him from falling into a madness from which he could never recover. He paced his room, thinking out loud until dawn, searching for ways to apply the law of the pendulum to anything that could be made useful by movement, such as carts and rakes. His sleeplessness had weakened and exhausted him so much that he did not recognize the white-haired, shaky man who entered his room at dawn. It was Prudencio Aguilar. When Jose Arcadio Buendia finally realized who he was, he shivered with a homesick longing, surprised that even the dead could age. Prudencio! he cried out. How far you have come! After so many years of death, the longing for the living was so intense, the desire to exchange a few words so great, and the proximity of the other death within death so terrifying that Prudencio Aguilar had finally come to love his mortal enemy. He had searched for him for years. He had asked the dead coming from Riohacha, he had asked the dead coming from the Upar Valley, he had asked the dead coming from the swamp. He had received no news, because until Melquiades came and marked it as a tiny dot on the maps of death, Macondo was unknown in the land of the dead. Jose Arcadio Buendia talked with Prudencio Aguilar until dawn. A few hours later, exhausted from sleeplessness, he went to Aureliano's workshop and asked, What day is it today? Aureliano said it was Tuesday. Jose Arcadio Buendia said, I thought so too, but then I realized that it's still not Monday like yesterday. Look at the sky, look at the walls, today is also Monday. Aureliano, who was used to his eccentricities, didn't pay any attention. The next day, which was Wednesday, Jose Arcadio Buendia entered the workshop again. This is a disaster, he said. Look at the weather, listen to the buzzing of the sun, everything is just like yesterday and the day before. Today is also Monday. That night, Pietro Crespi found him on the terrace, crying for Prudencio Aguilar, for Melquiades, for Rebeca's parents, for his own parents, for everyone he knew who was now facing death. Even though Crespi gave him a toy bear that walked on its hind legs and performed tricks on a rope, he couldn't free Jose Arcadio Buendia from his obsession: He asked about the status of the pendulum mechanism he had described a few days ago, which was supposed to help people fly. Buendia said it couldn't be done because the pendulum could lift everything into the air, but there was no way it could lift itself. On Thursday, with a face wrinkled from pain like freshly plowed soil, he went back to the workshop. He would cry if someone touched him. ""The time machine is broken,"" he said, almost sobbing. And Ursula and Amaranta are so far away! Aureliano scolded him as if reprimanding a child. Upon this, Buendia adopted an attitude as if he regretted what he had done. He examined his surroundings for six hours without rest; he struggled to find a change that would prove the passage of time. He spent the whole night in his bed without blinking, calling out to Prudencio Aguilar, Melquiades, and all the dead, inviting them to share his pain. But no one came. On Friday, he went outside before anyone woke up; he watched nature until he was completely convinced that it was Monday. Then, grabbing the iron door handle, with the full crushing force of his unprecedented strength, he smashed everything in the alchemy laboratory, the photo studio, and the silver workshop to pieces. On the one hand, he was shouting something in a high-pitched and incomprehensible language. Aureliano saw that things were getting out of hand and that if he let it go, his father would destroy the house, so he asked for help from the neighbors. It took ten people to bring Jose Arcadio to the ground, fourteen people to tie his hands and feet, and twenty people to drag him to the chestnut tree in the garden. When they tied him to the tree and left him, he was shouting something in an unknown language, and green foam was coming out of his mouth. When Ursula and Amaranta returned, Jose Arcadio Buendia was tied to the chestnut tree by his hands and feet: he was soaking wet from the rain and had completely lost his mind. Ursula and Amaranta tried to talk to him. He did not recognize them and said something in a language they did not understand. Ursula untied his wrists and feet, which had been cut by the ropes. She left only his waist tied. Later on, they made a shelter out of palm leaves to protect him from the sun and rain.",26.838,26.742,"José Arcadio Buendía finally achieved what he was seeking: he connected a wind-up dancer to the clock mechanism, and the toy danced nonstop to its own music for three days. That discovery excited him much more than any of his wild enterprises. He stopped eating. He stopped sleeping. Without Úrsula's vigilance and care, he let himself be dragged by his imagination into a state of perpetual delirium from which he would never recover. He spent the nights pacing the room, thinking out loud, looking for ways to apply the principles of the pendulum to ox carts, plowshares, to everything that could be useful when set in motion. The fever of insomnia wore him out so much that one early morning he couldn't recognize the old man with a white head and uncertain gestures who entered his bedroom. It was Prudencio Aguilar. When he finally identified him, amazed that even the dead aged, José Arcadio Buendía was shaken by nostalgia. “Prudencio,” he exclaimed, “how did you end up so far away!” After many years of death, the longing for the living was so intense, the need for company so urgent, the proximity of the other death that existed within death so terrifying, that Prudencio Aguilar had ended up loving his worst enemy. He had been looking for him for a long time. He asked the dead from Riohacha about him, the dead who arrived from the Valley of Upar, those who came from the swamp, and no one gave him an answer, because Macondo was an unknown town to the dead until Melquíades arrived and marked it with a black dot on the colorful maps of death. José Arcadio Buendía talked with Prudencio Aguilar until dawn. A few hours later, exhausted from the vigil, he entered Aureliano's workshop and asked him, “What day is today?” Aureliano replied that it was Tuesday. “That's what I thought,” said José Arcadio Buendía. “But suddenly I realized that it is still Monday like yesterday. Look at the sky, look at the walls, look at the begonias. Today is also Monday.” Used to his quirks, Aureliano paid no attention to him. The next day, Wednesday, José Arcadio Buendía returned to the workshop. “This is a disaster,” he said. “Look at the air, hear the hum of the sun, just like yesterday and the day before. Today is also Monday.” That night, Pietro Crespi found him in the corridor, crying with the graceless sob of the old, crying for Prudencio Aguilar, for Melquíades, for Rebeca's parents, for his father and mother, for all those he could remember who were then alone in death. He gave him a wind-up bear that walked on two legs on a wire, but he couldn't distract him from his obsession. He asked him what had happened to the project he had explained to him days before, about the possibility of building a pendulum machine that would allow man to fly, and he replied that it was impossible because the pendulum could lift anything into the air but could not lift itself. On Thursday he reappeared in the workshop with a painful look of scorched earth. “The time machine has broken down,” he almost sobbed, “and Úrsula and Amaranta are so far away!” Aureliano scolded him like a child, and he adopted a submissive air. He spent six hours examining things, trying to find a difference from the way they looked the day before, eager to discover in them some change that would reveal the passage of time. He spent the whole night in bed with his eyes open, calling out to Prudencio Aguilar, to Melquíades, to all the dead, to come and share his unease. But no one came. On Friday, before anyone got up, he went back to watch the appearance of nature until he had no doubt that it was still Monday. Then he grabbed a door bar and with the wild violence of his immense strength, he smashed the alchemy apparatus, the daguerreotype cabinet, the goldsmith's workshop into dust, shouting like a madman in a high-sounding and fluent but completely incomprehensible language. He was about to finish off the rest of the house when Aureliano asked the neighbors for help. It took ten men to knock him down, fourteen to tie him up, twenty to drag him to the chestnut tree in the yard, where they left him tied up, barking in a strange language and foaming green at the mouth. When Úrsula and Amaranta arrived, he was still tied hand and foot to the trunk of the chestnut tree, soaked by the rain and in a state of total innocence. They spoke to him, and he looked at them without recognizing them and said something incomprehensible. Úrsula untied his wrists and ankles, ulcerated by the pressure of the ropes, and left him tied only by the waist. Later they built him a palm shelter to protect him from the sun and rain.",58.43,58.388

164,"AURELIANO BUENDÍA and Remedios Moscote were married one Sunday in March before the altar Father Nicanor Reyna had set up in the parlor. It was the culmination of four weeks of shocks in the Moscote household because little Remedios had reached puberty before getting over the habits of childhood. In spite of the fact that her mother had taught her about the changes of adolescence, one February afternoon she burst shouting into the living room, where her sisters were chatting with Aureliano, and showed them her panties, smeared with a chocolate-colored paste. A month for the wedding was agreed upon. There was barely enough time to teach her how to wash herself, get dressed by herself, and understand the fundamental business of a home. They made her urinate over hot bricks in order to cure her of the habit of wetting her bed. It took a good deal of work to convince her of the inviolability of the marital secret, for Remedios was so confused and at the same time so amazed at the revelation that she wanted to talk to everybody about the details of the wedding night. It was a fatiguing effort, but on the date set for the ceremony the child was as adept in the ways of the world as any of her sisters. Don Apolinar Moscote escorted her by the arm down the street that was decorated with flowers and wreaths amidst the explosion of rockets and the music of several bands, and she waved with her hand and gave her thanks with a smile to those who wished her good luck from the windows. Aureliano, dressed in black, wearing the same patent leather boots with metal fasteners that he would have on a few years later as he faced the firing squad, had an intense paleness and a hard lump in his throat when he met the bride at the door of the house and led her to the altar. She behaved as naturally, with such discretion, that she did not lose her composure, not even when Aureliano dropped the ring as he tried to put it on her finger. In the midst of the. murmurs and confusion of the guests, she kept her arm with the fingerless lace glove held up and remained like that with her ring finger ready until the bridegroom managed to stop the ring with his foot before it rolled to the door, and came back blushing to the altar. Her mother and sisters suffered so much from the fear that the child would do something wrong during the ceremony that in the end they were the ones who committed the impertinence of picking her up to kiss her. From that day on the sense of responsibility, the natural grace, the calm control that Remedios would have in the face of adverse circumstances was revealed. It was she who, on her own initiative, put aside the largest piece that she had cut from the wedding cake and took it on a plate with a fork to José Arcadio Buendía. Tied to the trunk of the chestnut tree, huddled on a wooden stool underneath the palm shelter, the enormous old man, discolored by the sun and rain, made a vague smile of gratitude and at the piece of cake with his fingers, mumbling an unintelligible psalm. The only unhappy person in that noisy celebration, which lasted until dawn on Monday, was Rebeca Buendía. It was her own frustrated party. By an arrangement of Úrsula’s, her marriage was to be celebrated on the same day, but that Friday Pietro Crespi received a letter with the news of his mother’s imminent death. The wedding was postponed. Pietro Crespi left for the capital of the province an hour after receiving the letter, and on the road he missed his mother, who arrived punctually Saturday night and at Aureliano’s wedding sang the sad aria that she had prepared for the wedding of her son. Pietro Crespi returned on Sunday midnight to sweep up the ashes of the party, after having worn out five horses on the road in an attempt to be in time for his wedding. It was never discovered who wrote the letter. Tormented by Úrsula, Amaranta wept with indignation and swore her innocence in front of the altar, which the carpenters had not finished dismantling.","One Sunday in March, Aureliano Buendía and Remedios Moscote were married before the altar of God, which Father Nicanor Reyna had set up right in the Buendía family's living room. It was a period of intense activity lasting four consecutive weeks in the Moscote household, because little Remedios reached puberty before she had abandoned her childhood habits. Although her mother had explained the sudden changes of puberty to her, one February afternoon she suddenly panicked and cried out, showing her sisters, who were sitting and embroidering, a slip stained with a slimy chocolate-colored substance. The wedding date was set for a month later. There was hardly enough time to teach the girl how to wash herself, dress herself, and understand the essential tasks of family life. They made her urinate on heated bricks to cure her bedwetting. It was very difficult to convince her of the inviolability of the bridal chamber, because Remedios was both very frightened and very excited by the instructions to the point that she wanted everyone to talk about the wedding night in all its details. It was a tremendous effort, but on the day chosen for the wedding, the girl appeared as worldly-wise as any of her older sisters. Mr. Apolina Moscote took his daughter by the arm and led her through the village streets adorned with flowers, resonating with the sound of firecrackers and joyful cranes. The little girl waved and smiled in thanks to those who wished her luck and happiness from their windows. Aureliano, dressed in a black wool suit, wearing dark brown boots with spurs, the same boots he would wear years later when facing the firing squad, with a pale, ashen face and a throat tight with emotion, greeted his bride at the door and led her to the altar. The young girl behaved so naturally and appropriately that she maintained her composure even when Aureliano, while placing the ring on her finger, dropped it. In the noisy atmosphere filled with whispers and in the initial moments of confusion among the guests, the bride held up her hand, wearing a stocking that left her toes exposed, and kept her ring finger extended, waiting until the groom, with his booted foot, stopped the ring from rolling out the door and picked it up, his face flushed as he returned to the altar. Her mother and sisters were anxiously worried that the girl might make a mistake, even a small gesture, during the ceremony, and when the ceremony concluded, they were the ones who rushed over, despite the presence of all the guests, to lift her up and shower her with passionate kisses. From that day on, she demonstrated that she was a person of submissive, tactful, and calm nature in the face of family conflicts. She was the one who initiated the wedding feast and took the best piece of the wedding cake, placed it on a plate with a fork, and brought it to José Arcadio Buendía. Tied to the chestnut tree, hunched over on a wooden chair in the palm-thatched hut, the old, fat man with skin bleached by the sun and rain gave a distracted, grateful smile, took the piece of cake, and began to hum an incomprehensible hymn. The only person not happy at the grand wedding that lasted until the early hours of the second day was Rebeca Buendía. Her joyous day did not come to pass. According to an agreement with Úrsula, her wedding was also to be held on the same day as Aureliano's, but on Friday, Pietro Crespi received a letter informing him that his mother was dying. Their wedding was postponed. An hour after receiving the letter, Pietro Crespi left for the city immediately, and on his way, he did not meet his mother, who was also on her way to the village of Macondo to arrive in time for Saturday night. At Aureliano's wedding, she sang a sad song she had composed specifically for her son's wedding. Piêtrô Crêspi returned at midnight on Sunday to clean up the cigarette butts from the party after he had raced like the wind, causing five horses to collapse along the way, trying to make it back in time for his own wedding. The letter writer would never be discovered. Scolded by Úrsula, Amaranta wept bitterly, swearing on her life and before the altar of God, which the carpenters had not yet removed.",24.818,24.696,"Aureliano Buendia and Remedios Moscote entered into matrimony on a Sunday in March, in front of the altar set up in the guest room by Father Nicanor Reyna. Thus concluded the stormy four weeks that had turned the Moscote family upside down due to Remedios' transition to adolescence without abandoning her childhood habits. Her mother had sat her down and explained at length how to transition to young womanhood, but still, one day in February, while Aureliano was sitting and chatting with his sisters-in-law, Remedios had burst into the room, showing her underwear stained with a chocolate-colored liquid. It was decided that the wedding would take place one month from that date. During this time, the household was at their wits' end trying to teach Remedios to bathe herself, dress herself, and manage some basic household chores. They heated up bricks and placed them under him to make him stop wetting his pants. It took a lot of effort to make her understand that she shouldn't talk to anyone about the privacy of a married couple, because Remedios was so bewildered and confused by what her mother had taught her that she wanted to tell everyone about what would happen on her wedding night. Preparing the girl for marriage was not a task that just anyone could handle. Still, by the time the wedding day arrived, the girl had become at least as aware as her older sisters. Don Apolinar Moscote took his daughter by the arm and began to walk down the street adorned with flowers and wreaths, where several brass bands were lined up along the way, amidst the noise of fireworks being set off here and there. Gelin, pencerelerden sarkan, kendisine iyi dileklerde bulunan konu komşuya gülümseyerek el sallıyordu. Tepeden tırnağa siyahlar giyinmiş, ayaklarına da birkaç yıl sonra idam mangasının önüne çıkarken de giyeceği parlak deri çizmeleri çekmiş olan Aureliano'nun benzi, kül gibiydi. Evin kapısında gelini karşılayıp mihrabın önüne götürürken boğazına bir düğüm takıldı. Remedios öyle kendine güvenli bir tavırdaydı ki, Aureliano yüzüğü parmağına takayım derken düşürünce bile hiç istifini bozmadı. Konukların şaşkınlığına, salonu bir anda dolduran fısıltılara aldırmadan, damat bey, yüzüğü tam kapıdan dışarı yuvarlanacağı sırada ayağıyla durdurup kan ter içinde mihrabın önüne gelinceye dek, Remedios, dantel eldivenli yüzüksüz elini havada hazır bekletti. Annesiyle ablaları tören sırasında kızın bir densizlik yapmasından öylesine korkuyorlardı ki, gelin bu işin içinden yüzünün akıyla çıkınca, kendilerini tutamayıp kucakladıkları gibi öpücüklere boğdular onu. Remedios's sense of responsibility, grace, delicacy, and ability to remain calm in difficult situations showed itself even from that day. It was she who thought on her own to put the largest slice of the wedding cake on a plate and bring it along with a fork to Jose Arcadio Buendia. The large man, tied to the trunk of the chestnut tree, huddled on the wooden bench under the palm shade, his color faded from the sun and rain, smiled faintly as if to thank her and mumbled an incomprehensible prayer while gobbling down the cake with his hands. The only hopeless person at the wedding, which lasted with music and dancing until Monday morning, was Rebeca Buendia. It was her darkest day. Ursula had planned to marry her off on the same day. However, on Friday, a letter arrived for Pietro Crespi, informing him that his mother was on her deathbed. As a result, the wedding was postponed. Pietro Crespi departed for the capital one hour after receiving the news of the death. Mother and son passed by each other in opposite directions without noticing, the woman arrived home at the expected hour on Saturday evening and sang the sorrowful aria she had prepared for her son's wedding at Aureliano's wedding. Having exhausted five horses to make it to his own wedding on time, Pietro Crespi found, upon his return on Sunday night, that the wedding festivities had ended, leaving only remnants behind. It was never discovered who wrote the letter. Ursula cornered Amaranta, but the girl swore her innocence in front of the altar that the carpenters had yet to dismantle.",16.515,16.363,"Aureliano Buendía and Remedios Moscote were married on a Sunday in March before the altar that Father Nicanor Reyna had built in the visitors' room.

165,"Father Nicanor Reyna—whom Don Apolinar Moscote had brought from the swamp to officiate at the wedding—was an old man hardened by the ingratitude of his ministry. His skin was sad, with the bones almost exposed, and he had a pronounced round stomach and the expression of an old angel, which came more from, simplicity than from goodness. He had planned to return to his pariah after the wedding, but he was appalled at the hardness of the inhabitants of Macondo, who were prospering in the midst of scandal, subject to the natural law, without baptizing their children or sanctifying their festivals. Thinking that no land needed the seed of God so much, he decided to stay on for another week to Christianize both circumcised and gentile, legalize concubinage, and give the sacraments to the dying. But no one paid any attention to him. They would answer him that they had been many years without a priest, arranging the business of their souls directly with God, and that they had lost the evil of original sin. Tired of preaching in the open, Father Nicanor decided to undertake the building of a church, the largest in the world, with life-size saints and stained-glass windows on the sides, so that people would come from Rome to honor God in the center of impiety. He went everywhere begging alms with a copper dish. They gave him a large amount, but he wanted more, because the church had to have a bell that would raise the drowned up to the surface of the water. He pleaded so much that he lost his voice. His bones began to fill with sounds. One Saturday, not even having collected the price of the doors, he fell into a desperate confusion. He improvised an altar in the square and on Sunday he went through the town with a small bell, as in the days of insomnia, calling people to an open-air mass. Many went out of curiosity. Others from nostalgia. Others so that God would not take the disdain for His intermediary as a personal insult. So that at eight in the morning half the town was in the square, where Father Nicanor chanted the gospels in a voice that had been lacerated by his pleading. At the end, when the congregation began to break up, he raised his arms signaling for attention.","Father Nicanor Reyna - the person brought here by Apolinar Moscote to perform the wedding ceremony - was a patient man in his exceedingly dull and monotonous work. He had a sorrowful complexion that clung to his bones, a round, protruding belly, and the overly gentle, almost foolish demeanor of an old deity. He intended to return to his parish immediately after the wedding, but he was astonished by the excessively rustic and uncouth nature of the people of Macondo, who had proliferated abundantly, living blindly according to natural laws, refusing to baptize their children or give them saint names for the holidays. Believing that this land needed God's seeds more than anywhere else, the priest decided to stay another week to convert this village into a village of the Lord, to conduct weddings for couples living together as they pleased, and to baptize those who were gravely ill. But no one listened to the priest. They told the priest that for many years they had lived without the guidance of a pastor, that they resolved their spiritual issues directly with God, and that they had completely abandoned their sinful habits. Weary of preaching in the wilderness, Father Nicanô decided to build the largest church in the world, with life-sized statues and walls inlaid with colorful glass. Such a grand church would attract believers from as far as Rome, bringing glory to God right in the heart of this godless land. The priest went around the village with a brass plate in hand to collect donations. The villagers gave a lot, but the priest wanted more, because the church needed a bell whose sound could make the bodies of drowned people rise to the surface. The priest pleaded so much that he became hoarse. His bones ached as if ants were crawling inside them. One Saturday, unable to get anything, not even fruits or food left at the door, the priest became fearful out of despair. He hastily set up an altar in the middle of the square, and on Sunday, ringing a bell as if during a time of rampant insomnia, he went around the village urging everyone to attend the rustic mass. Many people came out of curiosity. Others came out of longing. Some attended the mass to avoid having God see their neutral stance as personal opposition. So at eight in the morning, half the village had gathered in the square to watch Father Nicanô, hoarse from pleading, reciting the Gospel. At the end of the mass, as the attendees began to disperse, the priest raised his hands high to signal everyone to listen:",17.425,17.179,"Father Nicanor Reyna, whom Don Apolinar Moscote brought from the swamp to conduct his wedding ceremony, was an old man hardened by the ingratitude of his profession. His skin was so pale it seemed as if his bones were about to burst out from within. He had a round belly and an angelic expression on his face that stemmed more from simplicity than goodness. After the wedding, he intended to return to his homeland. However, when he saw that the people of Macondo had shelved both virtue and sin, forgotten what baptism and feast days were, his heart could not bear such depravity. Believing that there could be no place more in need of God's love and fear, and that no more virgin soil could be found to sow God's seed, he decided to stay another week, to baptize anyone circumcised or uncircumcised, to marry long-time couples before God, and to pray over the dead. But no one paid any attention. Whoever he approached, they said that they had managed just fine without a priest for all these years, and that they conducted their affairs with God without any intermediaries for their souls. When Father Nicanor grew tired of going from street to street preaching, he thought of building a church. This was going to be a church like no other in the world, adorned with stained glass on both sides, featuring life-sized depictions of saints, and people would travel all the way from Rome to this land of non-believers to find their God. He took a copper bowl in his hand and went out to collect donations. Everyone was giving generously from their hearts, and what was given was not insignificant at all, but it was impossible to satisfy the holy father's greed. He said it had to be a bell strong enough to bring the drowned to the surface and loud enough to make an impact wherever it struck. His voice became hoarse from pleading, and he could no longer speak. When he couldn't express his voice outwardly, it spread inwardly, and his bones and marrow began to resonate. On a Saturday when he couldn't even gather enough money for the doors, he went mad with despair, not knowing what to do, he set up a pulpit in the middle of the village, and on Sunday, like in the days of his insomnia, he took a rattle in his hand and called everyone, whether they heard or not, to an open-air mass. Most went out of curiosity. Some went out of longing for the old days, and some so that God wouldn't consider ignoring His messenger an insult to Himself. Thus, at eight in the morning, half the village gathered in the square and listened to the sermon given by Father Nicanor, whose voice was hoarse from begging. Finally, as the gathered crowd began to slowly disperse, Father Nicanor raised his arms as if to indicate he was about to say something important.",15.824,15.605,"Father Nicanor Reyna —whom Don Apolinar Moscote had brought from the swamp to officiate the wedding— was an old man hardened by the ingratitude of his ministry.

But no one paid him any attention. They replied that for many years they had been without a priest, dealing with the matters of the soul directly with God, and had lost the malice of mortal sin. Tired of preaching in the desert, Father Nicanor set out to build a temple, the largest in the world, with life-sized saints and colored glass in the walls, so that people would come from Rome to honor God in the center of impiety.

167,"The boy who had helped him with the mass brought him a cup of thick and steaming chocolate, which he drank without pausing to breathe. Then he wiped his lips with a handkerchief that he drew from his sleeve, extended his arms, and closed his eyes. Thereupon Father Nicanor rose six inches above the level of the ground. It was a convincing measure. He went among the houses for several days repeating the demonstration of levitation by means of chocolate while the acolyte collected so much money in a bag that in less than a month he began the construction of the church. No one doubted the divine origin of the demonstration except José Arcadio Buendía, who without changing expression watched the troop of people who gathered around the chestnut tree one morning to witness the revelation once more. He merely stretched on his stool a little and shrugged his shoulders when Father Nicanor began to rise up from the ground along with the chair he was sitting on.","The little boy who earlier helped the priest conduct the mass now brought him a cup of thick, steaming hot chocolate, which the priest drank in one continuous gulp. After that, the priest took the handkerchief tucked in his wide sleeve to wipe his mouth, spread his arms wide, and closed his eyes tightly. Thus, Father Nicanô lifted himself twelve centimeters off the ground. It was an easily acceptable trick. In a few days, the priest went to every house to remind people of the experiment of lifting oneself off the ground through the neural stimulation power of chocolate. Meanwhile, the altar boy had collected so much money in the sack that in less than a month, the construction of the church had begun. No one doubted the divine origin of that demonstration, except for José Arcadio Buendía, who, without moving, observed the chaotic crowd surrounding the chestnut tree one morning to once again see the priest lift himself off the ground.

And Father Nicanor suddenly rose about fifteen centimeters off the ground. There could be no more convincing proof of God's greatness. After going door to door for a few more days and downing hot cocoa, he repeated this flying trick. When the bag in the sacristan boy's hand was stuffed full, he started the construction of the church within a month. No one doubted that God's hand was in the priest's flying, except for Jose Arcadio Buendia, who watched the crowd gathered around the chestnut tree to see the flying demonstration again without moving a muscle.

Father Nicanor took advantage of the circumstance of his being the only person who had been able to communicate with him to try to inject the faith into his twisted mind. Every afternoon he would sit by the chestnut tree preaching in Latin, but José Arcadio Buendía insisted on rejecting rhetorical tricks and the transmutation of chocolate, and he demanded the daguerreotype of God as the only proof. Father Nicanor then brought him medals and pictures and even a reproduction of the Veronica, but José Arcadio Buendía rejected them as artistic objects without any scientific basis. He was so stubborn that Father Nicanor gave up his attempts at evangelization and continued visiting him out of humanitarian feelings. But then it was José Arcadio Buendía who took the lead and tried to break down the priest’s faith with rationalist tricks. On a certain occasion when Father Nicanor brought a checker set to the chestnut tree and invited him to a game, José Arcadio Buendía would not accept, because according to him he could never understand the sense of a contest in which the two adversaries have agreed upon the rules. Father Nicanor, who had never seen checkers played that way, could not play it again. Ever more startled at José Arcadio Buendía’s lucidity, he asked him how it was possible that they had him tied to a tree.","Thus it was known that the incomprehensible demonic language of José Arcadio Buendía was Latin. Father Nicanor took advantage of the opportunity, being the only one who could communicate with José Arcadio Buendía, to instill Christian faith into his deranged mind. Every afternoon, the priest would sit by the chestnut tree and preach in Latin, but José Arcadio Buendía, delighted, would not acknowledge the old worn paths nor the changing color of chocolate and demanded to see a picture of God, considering it as the ultimate proof. So Father Nicanor brought him badges and pictures and even a reproduction of a cloth embroidered with the image of Saint Veronica, but José Arcadio dismissed them as handicrafts without scientific basis. He was so stubborn that Father Nicanor had to abandon his intention of converting him to Christianity. However, in terms of personal affection, the priest still visited him regularly. But at that time, José Arcadio Buendía took the initiative to attack and intended to break the priest's faith with rational arguments. There were times when Father Nicanor brought a chessboard with all the pieces to the chestnut tree to invite him to play checkers. José Arcadio Buendía did not play, as he could never understand the meaning of a contest in which the two opponents had agreed on the principles. Father Nicanor, who had never seen anyone play chess in such a manner, also did not return to play checkers. Day by day, Father Nicanor admired José Arcadio Buendía's intelligence more and more. He asked him how he could be tied to the tree like that.",29.207,28.932,"Thus, it was understood that the hocus-pocus spoken by Jose Arcadio Buendia was Latin. Father Nicanor, taking advantage of being the only person who could communicate with him, tried to inject the belief in God into his deranged mind: Now, he went to the chestnut tree every day, preaching in Latin. However, Jose Arcadio Buendia paid no attention to the babble, did not care about the cocoa miracle, and insisted that he wanted a photograph of God as the only proof. Upon this, Father Nicanor brought medallions, icons, and even a Veronica handkerchief. But Jose Arcadio Buendia did not accept them, saying they were artistic things without a scientific basis. He was so adamant that in the end, Father Nicanor gave up trying to call him to the righteous path and continued to visit him purely out of human compassion. But then Jose Arcadio Buendia rolled up his sleeves and tried to undermine the priest's faith by trapping him in logical dilemmas. One day, Father Nicanor brought a chess set under the chestnut tree and invited Jose Arcadio to play. Jose Arcadio Buendia did not respond to this invitation, saying that there was no point in playing a game according to pre-agreed rules. Having never seen chess played without rules, Father Nicanor never mentioned chess again. Astonished by Jose Arcadio Buendia's rational conversation, he asked how they had managed to tie him to the tree.",18.87,18.443,"That was how it was discovered that the devilish jargon of José Arcadio Buendía was Latin.

Father Nicanor did not agree: the growing generosity of the faithful permitted him to make more optimistic calculations. To the mute Indignation of Rebeca, who could not finish her lunch, Úrsula celebrated Amaranta’s idea and contributed a considerable sum for the work to move faster. Father Nicanor felt that with another contribution like that the church would be ready within three years. From then on Rebeca did not say another word to Amaranta, convinced that her initiative had not the innocence that she attempted to give it. “That was the least serious thing I could have done,” Amaranta answered her during the violent argument they had that night. “In that way I won’t have to kill you for three years.” Rebeca accepted the challenge.","Rebecca hurriedly blocked any comments about this matter.

From that moment on, Rebeca refused to speak to Amaranta, telling herself that Amaranta's provocative attitude was not as innocent as she had thought.

Believing that Amaranta's intentions were not as pure as they seemed, Rebeca never spoke to her again.

175,"When Pietro Crespi found out about the new postponement, he went through a crisis of disappointment, but Rebeca gave him a final proof of her loyalty. “We’ll elope whenever you say,” she told him. Pietro Crespi, however, was not a man of adventure. He lacked the impulsive character of his fiancée and he considered respect for one’s given word as a wealth that should not be squandered. Then Rebeca turned to more audacious methods. A mysterious wind blew out the lamps in the parlor and Úrsula surprised the lovers kissing in the dark. Pietro Crespi gave her some confused explanations about the poor quality of modern pitch lamps and he even helped her install a more secure system of illumination for the room. But the fuel failed again or the wicks became clogged and Úrsula found Rebeca sitting on her fiancé’s lap. This time she would accept no explanation. She turned the responsibility of the bakery over to the Indian woman and sat in a rocking chair to watch over the young people during the visits, ready to win out over maneuvers that had already been old when she was a girl. “Poor Mama,” Rebeca would say with mock indignation, seeing Úrsula yawn during the boredom of the visits. “When she dies she’ll go off to her reward in that rocking chair.” After three months of supervised love, fatigued by the slow progress of the construction, which he went to inspect every day, Pietro Crespi decided to give Father Nicanor the money he needed to finish the church. Amaranta did not grow impatient. As she conversed with her girl friends every afternoon when they came to embroider on the porch, she tried to think of new subterfuges. A mistake in calculation spoiled the one she considered the most effective: removing the mothballs that Rebeca had put in her wedding dress before she put it away in the bedroom dresser. She did it when two months were left for the completion of the church. But Rebeca was so impatient with the approach of the wedding that she wanted to get the dress ready earlier than Amaranta had foreseen. When she opened the dresser and unfolded first the papers and then the protective cloth, she found the fabric of the dress and the stitches of the veil and even the crown of orange blossoms perforated by moths. Although she was sure that she had put a handful of mothballs in the wrappings, the disaster seemed so natural that she did not dare blame Amaranta. There was less than a month until the wedding, but Amparo Moscote promised to sew a new dress within a week. Amaranta felt faint that rainy noontime when Amparo came to the house wrapped in the froth of needlework for Rebeca to have the final fitting of the dress. She lost her voice and a thread of cold sweat ran down the path of her spine. For long months she had trembled with fright waiting for that hour, because if she had not been able to conceive the ultimate obstacle to Rebeca’s wedding, she was sure that at the last moment, when all the resources of her imagination had failed, she would have the courage to poison her. That afternoon, while Rebeca was suffocating with heat inside the armor of thread that Amparo Moscote was putting about her body with thousands of pins and infinite patience, Amaranta made several mistakes in her crocheting and pricked her finger with the needle, but she decided with frightful coldness that the date would be the last Friday before the wedding and the method would be a dose of laudanum in her coffee.","When Pietro Crespi learned that his wedding was postponed again, he fell into a state of despair. In contrast, Rebeca demonstrated her loyalty. ""We will elope whenever you decide,"" she said. However, Pietro Crespi was not one to take risks. He lacked the passionate nature of a lover and was overly scrupulous, treating promises as treasures that could not be squandered. So Rebeca resorted to bolder tactics. A strange wind blew out the lamp in the living room, and Úrsula caught the two of them kissing in the dark. Pietro Crespi clumsily explained to her about the poor quality of modern candles that burned with tar and helped her set up a more reliable lighting system in the living room. But another time, the lamp was either filled with the wrong oil or the wick slipped. Úrsula caught Rebeca sitting on her lover's lap again. So she refused to listen to any more excuses. She assigned the Indian girl to watch over the candy store and sat in the rocking chair herself to supervise the lovers' conversations, determined not to be outdone by the old tricks she was familiar with from her own youth. ""Poor mother!"", Rebecca said with all the resentment mixed with a bit of humor as she watched Ursula yawning in the tense atmosphere of the visit. ""When I die, I might just go on this rocking chair."" After three months of living in a love that was closely monitored, disheartened by the delays in the construction work that he visited every day, Pietro Crespi agreed to contribute the money Father Nicanor needed to complete the church building. Amaranta did not lose heart. While sitting and chatting with the sisters who often came to the house in the afternoons to embroider or knit on the porch, she tried to come up with new schemes. A mistake ruined the scheme she thought was the most effective. It was the plan to steal the mothballs that Rebecca had placed in her bridal gown before storing it in the chest in the bedroom. Amaranta would do it when there were less than two months left until the church construction was completed. But Rebecca was so eager for her wedding day to come that she wanted to prepare her bridal gown earlier than Amaranta had planned. When she opened the chest, then the wrapping paper, and finally the silk covering, she found the satin wedding dress, a veil, and an orange blossom crown, all eaten to dust by moths. Although she was sure she had placed two packets of mothballs wrapped in handkerchiefs in the dress, the misfortune seemed entirely accidental, so she did not dare blame Amaranta. With less than a month until the wedding, it was no problem because she had Amparo Moscote who could sew the bridal gown in just a week. One rainy afternoon, Amparo, wearing a raincoat, entered the house to give the final fitting of the bridal gown for Rebecca, and Amaranta felt so furious she wanted to die. Her voice faltered, and a cold sweat ran down her spine. For many months she had lived in anxious anticipation of that moment. Because if she did not successfully create a decisive obstacle to prevent Rebecca's wedding, she was certain that, in the final moment when all other schemes had failed, she would have the courage to poison Rebecca. That afternoon, while Rebecca was suffocating from the heat in the satin dress being fitted by Amparo, who was calmly pinning it to fit her body, Amaranta had pricked her fingers several times with the crochet hook. But with terrifying coldness, she decided that the day to poison Rebecca would be the Friday closest to the wedding day, and the method would be a drop of opium dissolved in coffee.",20.931,20.781,"Pietro Crespi was devastated when he heard that their wedding had been postponed again. Rebeca encouraged him by proving her loyalty once more. ""If you want, we can elope,"" she said. But Pietro Crespi was not the kind of man to jump into an adventure with his eyes closed. He didn't have a trace of his fiancée's boldness. Respecting a given word was his most valuable treasure. Upon this, Rebeca began to employ bolder methods. Once, when a gust of wind from an unknown source extinguished the lamps in the guest room, Ursula caught the two lovers kissing in the dark. Pietro Crespi was flustered, complained that these newfangled lamps were useless, and even helped Ursula to equip the room with a more reliable lighting system. But whether it was due to the poor quality of the kerosene or defective wicks, the lamps went out again, and this time Ursula caught Rebeca in her fiancé's lap. There was no more room for excuses. She dumped the bakery work on the Indian woman and, to prevent the usual tricks she herself had once played on her own mother, sat in the rocking chair and watched them until Crespi left. Seeing Ursula yawn from boredom, Rebeca would pretend to be angry and say, ""Poor mother, she'll go to heaven with this rocking chair when she dies."" In the third month of their supervised courtship, tired of the lack of progress in the construction, Pietro Crespi decided to give Father Nicanor the money needed to complete the church. Amaranta was not worried at all. Every day, she sat on the terrace with her friends, embroidering, talking with them, and devising new tricks. The trick she thought would be most effective was foiled by a miscalculation: Amaranta removed the mothballs from Rebeca's wedding dress, which was stored in the console in her bedroom. There were two months left until the church was completed. However, the plan didn't go as expected, and with the wedding approaching, an increasingly impatient Rebeca decided to start preparing her wedding dress earlier than Amaranta had anticipated. When she pulled out the drawer and opened the papers and then the bundle, she saw that moths had riddled the dress, the veil's threads, and even the bridal crown made of orange blossoms with holes. She had no doubt that she had put handfuls of mothballs into the bundle, but this disaster was so typical that she couldn't bring herself to blame Amaranta. There was less than a month left until the wedding. Fortunately, Amparo Moscote promised to have a new wedding dress ready within a week. On that rainy afternoon when Amparo came to do Rebeca's final fitting, Amaranta almost fainted. Her breath was cut off, and cold sweat ran down her back. For months, she had been waiting in fear for that moment to arrive. Because if the last resort to prevent Rebeca from getting married failed, she had no doubt that she would dare to poison her at the last moment. That day, while Rebeca, wrapped in the fabric armor that Amparo had wound around her body with thousands of pins and infinite patience, stood breathless from the heat, Amaranta lost track of her work, embroidered incorrectly, pricked her finger with a needle, but with a terrifying calmness decided that the last day would be the Friday before the wedding. She would poison Rebeca with the spirit of opium she would add to her coffee.",18.709,18.526,"When Pietro Crespi learned of the new postponement, he suffered a crisis of disappointment, but Rebeca gave him a definitive proof of loyalty. ""We will elope whenever you decide,"" she said to him. However, Pietro Crespi was not a man of adventures. He lacked the impulsive character of his fiancée, and considered respect for one's word as a capital that could not be squandered. Then Rebeca resorted to bolder methods. A mysterious wind would extinguish the lamps in the visiting room, and Úrsula would catch the couple kissing in the dark. Pietro Crespi gave clumsy explanations about the poor quality of modern tar lamps and even helped install safer lighting systems in the room. But again, the fuel would fail or the wicks would get stuck, and Úrsula would find Rebeca sitting on her fiancé's lap. She ended up not accepting any explanation. She entrusted the responsibility of the bakery to the Indian woman and sat in a rocking chair to supervise the couple's visits, determined not to be defeated by maneuvers that were already old in her youth. ""Poor mom,"" Rebeca would say with mocking indignation, seeing Úrsula yawn in the drowsiness of the visits. "" When she dies, she'll haunt that rocking chair. "" After three months of supervised love, bored with the slow construction that he inspected every day, Pietro Crespi decided to give Father Nicanor the money he needed to finish the temple. Amaranta did not grow impatient. While conversing with the friends who came every afternoon to embroider or knit in the corridor, she tried to conceive new tricks. A miscalculation ruined what she considered the most effective: removing the mothballs that Rebeca had placed on her wedding dress before storing it in the bedroom dresser. She did it when there were less than two months left for the temple's completion. But Rebeca was so impatient with the proximity of the wedding that she wanted to prepare the dress earlier than Amaranta had anticipated. When she opened the dresser and first unwrapped the papers and then the protective cloth, she found the satin of the dress, the lace of the veil, and even the orange blossom crown pulverized by moths. Although she was sure she had put two handfuls of mothballs in the wrapping, the disaster seemed so accidental that she did not dare to blame Amaranta. There was less than a month left for the wedding, but Amparo Moscote committed to sewing a new dress in a week. Amaranta felt faint on the rainy noon when Amparo entered the house wrapped in a froth of lace to give Rebeca the final fitting of the dress. She lost her voice, and a thread of cold sweat ran down the channel of her spine.

176,"A greater obstacle, as impassable as it was unforeseen, obliged a new and indefinite postponement. One week before the date set for the wedding, little Remedios woke up in the middle of the night soaked in a hot broth which had exploded in her insides with a kind of tearing belch, and she died three days later, poisoned by her own blood, with a pair of twins crossed in her stomach. Amarante suffered a crisis of conscience. She had begged God with such fervor for something fearful to happen so that she would not have to poison Rebeca that she felt guilty of Remedios’ death. That was not the obstacle that she had begged for so much. Remedios had brought a breath of merriment to the house. She had settled down with her husband in a room near the workshop, which she decorated with the dolls and toys of her recent childhood, and her merry vitality overflowed the four walls of the bedroom and went like a whirlwind of good health along the porch with the begonias: She would start singing at dawn. She was the only person who dared intervene in the arguments between Rebeca and Amaranta. She plunged into the fatiguing chore of taking care of José Arcadio Buendía. She would bring him his food, she would help him with his daily necessities, wash him with soap and a scrubbing brush, keep his hair and beard free of lice and nits, keep the palm shelter in good condition and reinforce it with waterproof canvas in stormy weather. In her last months she had succeeded in communicating with him in phrases of rudimentary Latin. When the son of Aureliano and Pilar Ternera was born and brought to the house and baptized in an intimate ceremony with the name Aureliano José, Remedios decided that he would be considered their oldest child. Her maternal instinct surprised Úrsula. Aureliano, for his part, found in her the justification that he needed to live. He worked all day in his workshop and Remedios would bring him a cup of black coffee in the middle of the morning. They would both visit the Moscotes every night. Aureliano would play endless games of dominoes with his father-in-law while Remedios chatted with her sisters or talked to her mother about more important things. The link with the Buendías consolidated Don Apolinar Moscote’s authority in the town. On frequent trips to the capital of the province he succeeded in getting the government to build a school so that Arcadio, who had inherited the educational enthusiasm of his grandfather, could take charge of it. Through persuasion he managed to get the majority of houses painted blue in time for the date of national independence. At the urging of Father Nicanor, he arranged for the transfer of Catarino’s store to a back street and he closed down several scandalous establishments that prospered in the center of town. Once he returned with six policemen armed with rifles to whom he entrusted the maintenance of order, and no one remembered the original agreement not to have armed men in the town. Aureliano enjoyed his father-in-law’s efficiency. “You’re going to get as fat as he is,” his friends would say to him. But his sedentary life, which accentuated his cheekbones and concentrated the sparkle of his eyes, did not increase his weight or alter the parsimony of his character, but, on the contrary, it hardened on his lips the straight line of solitary meditation and implacable decision. So deep was the affection that he and his wife had succeeded in arousing in both their families that when Remedios announced that she was going to have a child. even Rebeca and Amaranta declared a truce in order to knit items in blue wool if it was to be a boy and in pink wool in case it was a girl. She was the last person Arcadio thought about a few years later when he faced the firing squad.","A major obstacle, very brutal and also very unexpected, came crashing down, forcing the wedding to be postponed once again, with no idea of when it would finally take place. Just one week before the wedding, suddenly at midnight, Remedios woke up vomiting and having diarrhea, her body drenched in the hot, foul-smelling contents from her stomach, and after three days, she died from poisoning by her own blood, carrying a twin fetus in her womb. Amaranta tormented herself with guilt. She had fervently prayed to God for something terrible to happen so that she wouldn't have to poison Rebeca, and thus she felt guilty for Remedios's death. This was not the obstacle she had prayed for. Remedios had brought a new, joyful breeze into the house. She and her husband moved into the room next to the jewelry workshop, and she decorated their living space with all her childhood dolls and toys. Her youthful vitality spread beyond the four walls, like a refreshing breeze blowing through the corridors adorned with pots of begonias. From the moment she woke up, she would sing. She was the only one in the house who dared to intervene in the arguments between Rebeca and Amaranta. She took on the responsibility of caring for José Arcadio Buendía. She brought food to her father-in-law, diligently attended to him during his bathroom needs, bathed him with soap and scrubbing pads, kept his beard and hair free from lice, and maintained and repaired his palm-leaf hut during stormy seasons. In the final months of her life, she communicated with him using simple Latin phrases. When Aureliano's son with Pilar Ternera was born, brought home, and named Aureliano José, Remedios decided to acknowledge the boy as her own firstborn. Her maternal affection greatly surprised Úrsula. For his part, Aureliano found in her the essential justification for his life. He worked all day in the workshop, and Remedios would bring him a cup of unsweetened coffee in the middle of the morning. Every night, they would visit the Moscotes. Aureliano would engross himself in playing dominoes with his father-in-law while Remedios chatted cheerfully with her sisters-in-law and discussed adult matters with her mother. The close relationship with the Buendía family strengthened Don Apolinar Moscote's authority in the village. During his frequent trips to the provincial capital, he had secured government approval to open a school, which was managed by Arcadio, who had inherited his grandfather's passion for teaching. Through persuasive measures, he managed to get most of the houses in the village painted blue to celebrate Independence Day. In response to Father Nicanor's suggestions, he decided to relocate Catarino's eatery to a secluded street and shut down several noisy establishments that had sprung up in the village center. On one of his trips back from the provincial capital, he brought along six armed policemen. These were the men he entrusted with maintaining order. However, no one reminded him of his promise to José Arcadio Buendía that he would not use armed police in the village. Aureliano was very fond of his resourceful father-in-law. ""You'll end up as plump as he is,"" his friends told him. But the leisure that had once puffed up his cheeks and concentrated the light in his eyes did not increase his body weight nor did it disrupt his pride; on the contrary, it only accentuated the lines on his lips, a sign of deep thought and unshakable determination. The deep affection between him and his wife awakened the feelings of both families to such an extent that when Remedios announced she was pregnant, even Rebeca and Amaranta reconciled to weave a blue linen if it was a boy and a pink linen if it was a girl. She was the last person Arcadio thought of a few years later when he stood before the firing squad.",24.148,24.008,"An unexpected and unsolvable new obstacle postponed the wedding once more and indefinitely. A week before the wedding day, little bride Remedios woke up in the middle of the night, submerged in the warmth of water that burst with a pain as if something was being torn from inside her. Three days later, she passed away from blood poisoning along with the twins lying head to toe in her womb. Amaranta was writhing in guilt. She had prayed so fervently for a terrible event to occur so that she wouldn't have to poison Rebeca, that she blamed herself for Remedios' death. This was not the obstacle she had desperately awaited. Remedios had brought joy to the house. She had decorated a room near the workshop with dolls and toys from her recent childhood and settled there with her husband. Her cheerful and lively spirit transcended the four walls of the bedroom and had become like a breeze of health on the begonia terrace. She would start singing at dawn. She was the only one who dared to intervene in the fights between Rebeca and Amaranta. He had also taken care of Jose Arcadio Buendia. He would bring him his food, help him with his daily needs, wash and brush his hands and face, pick out the lice and fleas from his hair and beard, and if the weather turned bad, he would reinforce the shelter made of palm leaves with a canvas. In recent months, he had picked up Latin and had even started to speak broken Latin with Jose Arcadio. When Pilar Ternera's son, born of Aureliano, was brought home and baptized with the name Aureliano Jose in a ceremony held among the family, Remedios decided to embrace him as her first child. Her maternal instinct surprised Ursula. As for Aureliano, the sole meaning and purpose of his life had become his wife: He worked in his workshop all day, and around noon, Remedios would bring him his coffee. Every evening, they would go together to the Moscotes' house. Aureliano would engage in endless domino games with his father-in-law, while Remedios would chat with her sisters or consult her mother on more important matters. Becoming related to the Buendia family had solidified Don Apolinar Moscote's respectability in the village. By frequently traveling to the capital, he managed to get the government to take action and succeeded in having a school built, which would be headed by Arcadio, who had inherited his grandfather's passion for teaching. With sweet talk, he persuaded the villagers to paint most of the houses blue for the national independence day. Under the pressure of Father Nicanor, he had Catarino's shop moved to a back street and closed down the dens of iniquity that had opened in the heart of the village. On his trips to the capital, he brought armed mounted police to ensure security; no one even remembered the initial agreement not to allow armed men into the village. Aureliano was pleased with his father-in-law's dominance. His friends teased him, saying, ""You'll get as fat as he is."" However, the monotonous life that made his cheekbones more prominent and intensified the sparkle in his eyes did not make him gain weight; instead, it deepened the thoughtful line at the corner of his lips and the expression of determination. They had endeared themselves so much to both the boy's and the girl's side that when Remedios announced she was going to have a child, even Rebeca and Amaranta set aside their quarrels and grievances and took up knitting, blue if it was a boy and pink if it was a girl. A few years later, while standing before the firing squad, the last person to cross Arcadio's mind was Remedios.",22.782,22.638,"A major obstacle, as insurmountable as it was unforeseen, forced a new and indefinite postponement. A week before the scheduled wedding date, little Remedios woke up at midnight drenched in a hot broth that exploded in her insides with a kind of tearing burp, and died three days later poisoned by her own blood with a pair of twins lodged in her belly. Amaranta suffered a crisis of conscience. She had prayed to God with such fervor for something dreadful to happen so she wouldn't have to poison Rebeca, that she felt guilty for Remedios' death. That was not the obstacle she had prayed so much for. Remedios had brought a breath of joy to the house. She had settled with her husband in a room near the workshop, which she decorated with the dolls and toys of her recent childhood, and her cheerful vitality overflowed the four walls of the room and swept like a gust of good health through the begonia corridor. She sang from dawn. She was the only person who dared to mediate in the disputes between Rebeca and Amaranta. She took on the costly task of attending to José Arcadio Buendía. She brought him food, assisted him in his daily needs, washed him with soap and scrub, kept his hair and beard free of lice and nits, maintained the palm shed in good condition, and reinforced it with waterproof tarps during stormy times. In her last months, she had managed to communicate with him in rudimentary Latin phrases. When the son of Aureliano and Pilar Ternera was born and brought to the house and baptized in an intimate ceremony with the name Aureliano José, Remedios decided he should be considered her eldest son. Her maternal instinct surprised Úrsula. Aureliano, for his part, found in her the justification he needed to live. He worked all day in the workshop and Remedios brought him a bowl of unsweetened coffee mid-morning. They both visited the Moscotes every night. Aureliano played endless games of dominoes with his father-in-law, while Remedios conversed with her sisters or dealt with adult matters with her mother. The bond with the Buendía family consolidated the authority of don Apolinar Moscote in the town. In frequent trips to the provincial capital, he managed to get the government to build a school for Arcadio to run, who had inherited his grandfather's educational enthusiasm. He persuaded most of the houses to be painted blue for the national independence celebration. At the urging of Father Nicanor, he arranged for Catarino's shop to be moved to a remote street and closed several scandalous places that thrived in the town center. Once he returned with six policemen armed with rifles to maintain order, without anyone remembering the original commitment not to have armed people in the town. Aureliano was pleased with his father-in-law's efficiency. "" You're going to get as fat as he is,"" his friends told him. But the sedentary lifestyle, which accentuated his cheekbones and concentrated the glow in his eyes, did not increase his weight nor alter the calmness of his character, and on the contrary, it hardened the straight line of solitary meditation and implacable decision on his lips. So deep was the affection that he and his wife had managed to awaken in both families, that when Remedios announced she was going to have a child, even Rebeca and Amaranta made a truce to knit in blue wool, in case it was a boy, and in pink wool, in case it was a girl. She was the last person Arcadio thought of, a few years later, in front of the firing squad.",48.422,48.351
177,"Úrsula ordered a mourning period of closed doors and windows, with no one entering or leaving except on matters of utmost necessity. She prohibited any talking aloud for a year and she put Remedios’ daguerreotype in the place where her body had been laid out, with a black ribbon around it and an oil lamp that was always kept lighted. Future generations, who never let the lamp go out, would be puzzled at that girl in a pleated skirt, white boots, and with an organdy band around her head, and they were never able to connect her with the standard image of a great-grandmother. Amaranta took charge of Aureliano José. She adopted him as a son who would share her solitude and relieve her from the involutary laudanum that her mad beseeching had thrown into Remedios’ coffee. Pietro Crespi would tiptoe in at dusk, with a black ribbon on his hat, and he would pay a silent visit to Rebeca, who seemed to be bleeding to death inside the black dress with sleeves down to her wrists. Just the idea of thinking about a new date for the wedding would have been so irreverent that the engagement turned into an eternal relationship, a fatigued love that no one worried about again, as if the lovers, who in other days had sabotaged the lamps in order to kiss, had been abandoned to the free will of death. Having lost her bearings, completely demoralized, Rebeca began eating earth again.","Ursula decided to mourn her for a year. She ordered all the doors to be closed, no one to enter or leave except in unavoidable circumstances, forbade loud talking, and personally hung Remedios' picture at the place where her body was laid out, placing an oil lamp that would burn continuously in front of the picture. Future generations, who never let the oil lamp go out, were puzzled by the picture of the girl in a puffed dress, white boots, and a bow in her hair, unable to reconcile that image with their own imagination of an aunt. Amaranta took in Aureliano José and raised him as her own son. He would be the one to share her loneliness and console her from the torment of her fervent prayers that had inadvertently caused the opium to fall into Remedios' coffee. In the evenings, Pietro Crespi, wearing a mourning band on his hat, would tiptoe into the house to quietly visit Rebeca, a Rebeca who seemed to be bleeding out in her black dress with sleeves that covered the backs of her hands. The mere thought of rescheduling the wedding was already considered highly improper, thus their romantic relationship became an eternal one, a weary love that no one wanted to tend to, as if the lovers who had turned off the lights to kiss in the dark had drifted apart by the will of death. Completely disoriented and having lost her sanity, Rebeca began eating earth again.",22.525,22.144,"Ursula declared mourning by locking the windows and doors, and she did not allow anyone to enter or leave the house unless it was very important. She banned speaking loudly for a year and placed a photograph of Remedios, tied with a black ribbon, and an oil lamp that was never extinguished at the head of her bed. The later generations who kept the lamp burning without ever extinguishing it would look long and hard at the picture of this girl in a pleated skirt, white boots, and an organza ribbon in her hair, unable to reconcile it with the image of a typical great-great-grandmother. Amaranta took on the care of Aureliano Jose. She embraced him like a son who would share her loneliness and save her from the torment of having caused Remedios' death with her frantic prayers. In the afternoons, Pietro Crespi would come, tiptoeing in his black ribboned hat, to check on Rebeca, whose heart was bleeding in her long-sleeved black dress. Even thinking about setting a new date for the wedding seemed like such a great disrespect that their engagement turned into an endless relationship. The days when they played various games to turn off the lamps just to kiss were long gone; their love had now been abandoned to death, a breathless romance that no one cared about anymore. Having lost all her hope and all her supports, Rebeca started eating soil again.",19.332,18.927,"Úrsula arranged a mourning period with doors and windows closed, no entry or exit for anyone except for indispensable matters; she forbade speaking out loud for a year, and placed the daguerreotype of Remedios in the spot where the body was laid out, with a black ribbon across it and an oil lamp lit forever. Future generations, who never let the lamp go out, would be puzzled by that girl with ruffled skirts, white boots, and an organdy bow in her hair, whom they could not reconcile with the academic image of a great-grandmother. Amaranta took charge of Aureliano José. She adopted him as a son who would share her solitude and relieve her of the involuntary laudanum that her frantic supplications had poured into Remedios' coffee. Pietro Crespi would tiptoe in at dusk, with a black ribbon on his hat, and pay a silent visit to a Rebeca who seemed to be bleeding out inside the black dress with sleeves down to her wrists. The mere idea of thinking about a new date for the wedding would have been so irreverent that the engagement turned into an eternal relationship, a love of exhaustion that no one cared for anymore, as if the lovers who once disassembled lamps to kiss had been abandoned to the whim of death. Lost and completely demoralized, Rebeca went back to eating earth.",50.129,49.96
178,"Suddenly—when the mourning had gone on so long that the needlepoint sessions began again—someone pushed open the street door at two in the afternoon in the mortal silence of the heat and the braces in the foundation shook with such force that Amaranta and her friends sewing on the porch, Rebeca sucking her finger in her bedroom, Úrsula in the kitchen, Aureliano in the workshop, and even José Arcadio Buendía under the solitary chestnut tree had the impression that an earthquake was breaking up the house. A huge man had arrived. His square shoulders barely fitted through the doorways. He was wearing a medal of Our Lady of Help around his bison neck, his arms and chest were completely covered with cryptic tattooing, and on his right wrist was the tight copper bracelet of the niños-en-cruz amulet. His skin was tanned by the salt of the open air, his hair was short and straight like the mane of a mule, his jaws were of iron, and he wore a sad smile. He had a belt on that was twice as thick as the cinch of a horse, boots with leggings and spurs and iron on the heels, and his presence gave the quaking impression of a seismic tremor. He went through the parlor and the living room, carrying some half-worn saddlebags in his hand, and he appeared like a thunderclap on the porch with the begonias where Amaranta and her friends were paralyzed, their needles in the air. “Hello,” he said to them in a tired voice, threw the saddlebags on a worktable, and went by on his way to the back of the house. “Hello,” he said to the startled Rebecca, who saw him pass by the door of her bedroom. “Hello,” he said to Aureliano, who was at his silversmith’s bench with all five senses alert. He did not linger with anyone. He went directly to the kitchen and there he stopped for the first time at the end of a trip that had begun of the other side of the world. “Hello,” he said. Úrsula stood for a fraction of a second with her mouth open, looked into his eyes, gave a cry, and flung her arms around his neck, shouting and weeping with joy. It was José Arcadio. He was returning as poor as when he had left, to such an extreme that Úrsula had to give him two pesos to pay for the rental of his horse. He spoke a Spanish that was larded with sailor slang. They asked where he had been and he answered: “Out there.” He hung his hammock in the room they assigned him and slept for three days. When he woke up, after eating sixteen raw eggs, he went directly to Catarino’s store, where his monumental size provoked a panic of curiosity among the women. He called for music and cane liquor for everyone, to be put on his bill. He would Indian-wrestle with five men at the same time. “It can’t be done,” they said, convinced that they would not be able to move his arm. “He has niños-en-cruz.” Catarino, who did not believe in magical tricks of strength, bet him twelve pesos that he could not move the counter. José Arcadio pulled it out of its place, lifted it over his head, and put it in the street. It took eleven men to put it back. In the heat of the party he exhibited his unusual masculinity on the bar, completely covered with tattoos of words in several languages intertwined in blue and red. To the women who were besieging him and coveting him he put the question as to who would pay the most. The one who had the most money offered him twenty pesos. Then he proposed raffling himself off among them at ten pesos a chance. It was a fantastic price because the most sought-after woman earned eight pesos a night, but they all accepted. They wrote their names on fourteen pieces of paper which they put into a hat and each woman took one out. When there were only two pieces left to draw, it was established to whom they belonged.","The mourning had been going on for quite some time, to the point where the family had to reorganize the prayer sessions at home. At two in the afternoon on a quiet, unbearably hot day, someone suddenly pushed open the door leading to the main road, causing the doors to creak with such force that it shook the entire house where Amaranta and her friends were sitting and embroidering in the hallway, Rebeca was sucking her thumb in the bedroom, Úrsula was busy in the kitchen, Aureliano was diligently working in the goldsmith's workshop, and José Arcadio Buendía was sitting alone under the chestnut tree; everyone felt a shiver as if there was an earthquake. A burly man came to the house. His broad back seemed too large to fit through the door. Around his neck, he wore a chain with a medallion of Saint Remedios the Virgin. His chest and arms were covered in tattoos of cemetery images. On his wrist, he wore a bronze statue of the crucified Jesus. He had weather-beaten dark skin, short and shaggy hair like a mule's mane, a strong, protruding jaw, and sad eyes. His belt was twice as thick as a horse's rein. His short boots had spurs and were reinforced with iron. And his presence gave everyone the shiver of an impending earthquake. He walked through the living room, then the waiting room, carrying old bags in his hands. Then, like a thunderclap, he appeared in the hallway where the begonias were placed, where Amaranta and her friends, who were sewing, were so startled that they raised their hands holding the needles. ""Hello,"" he said to the girls in a tired voice, then threw the bags onto the desk. After that, he hurriedly walked into the inner house. ""Hello,"" he said to Rebeca, who was looking at him in panic as he passed by the bedroom window. ""Hello,"" he said to Aureliano in the jewelry workshop, who was straining all five senses to listen. He went straight into the kitchen, and here for the first time, he paused at the end of a journey around the world. ""Hello,"" he said. Ursula stood still for a second, her mouth agape, staring straight into his eyes. She let out a cry and then jumped up to hug his neck, crying and shouting with joy. It was José Arcadio. He returned as poor as when he left, to the point that Ursula had to give him two pesos to pay for the horse rental. He spoke Spanish mixed with sailor slang. When people asked him where he had been, he answered, ""Over there."" He hung a hammock in the room reserved for him and slept for three days straight. When he woke up, after eating sixteen boiled eggs, he went straight to Catarino's eatery. There, his massive body sparked lively and curious discussions among the women. He organized a party with music and strong liquor for everyone. He challenged five men to arm wrestle him simultaneously. ""No way,"" they said when they realized they couldn't budge his arm, ""because you have the crucified Jesus helping you""... Catarino, who still didn't believe in his strength, bet him twelve pesos if he could lift his counter. José Arcadio lifted the counter, balanced it on his head, and carried it out to the middle of the street. It took eleven strong men to carry it back to its original place. In the lively, festive atmosphere, José Arcadio stood on the counter, showing off his muscular body covered in tattoos with blue and red writing in various languages. Turning to the women surrounding him, with insatiable greed, he asked who would pay more. The wealthiest woman gave him several dozen pesos. So he organized a raffle with tickets costing ten pesos each. It was an exorbitant price because the most popular woman could only earn eight pesos a night. But all the women accepted the price. They wrote their names on fourteen tickets, mixed them up, put them all in a hat, and then each woman drew a ticket. When only two tickets were left, he approached the women who were about to draw.",22.783,22.651,"One completely unexpected day -the mourning had lasted so long that the lacework sessions had started again- at noon, when the heat descended with a deadly fervor, someone slammed the street door wide open, and the house shook to its very foundations. Amaranta, who was embroidering with her friends on the terrace, Rebeca, who was sucking her finger in the bedroom, Ursula in the kitchen, Aureliano in his workshop, and even Jose Arcadio Buendia under the chestnut tree, all thought there was an earthquake and the house was collapsing on top of them. A burly man had arrived. His broad shoulders couldn't fit through the doors. On his thick neck, reminiscent of wild bulls, hung a Madonna medallion for good luck. His arms and chest were covered with indistinguishable tattoos. On his right wrist, there was a copper bracelet with a ninos-en-cruz amulet hanging from it. His skin was tanned from being outdoors. His hair was very short and smooth like a mule's mane. He had a strong and large chin. He was smiling sadly. The belt around his waist was twice as thick as a horse's girth. He wore boots with knee pads and iron-tipped spurs. He made the ground shake with his steps, as if the earth trembled when he walked. He swung his worn-out saddlebags as he walked across the living room and the sitting room. He burst into the begonia terrace where Amaranta and her friends froze with needles in hand, as if struck by lightning. In a tired voice, he said hello to the girls, placed the saddlebags on the table, and walked towards the back of the house. He also said hello to Rebeca, who was surprised to see him passing by her bedroom. He waved a hello to Aurelio, who was sitting on pins and needles in the silver workshop. He didn't linger with anyone. He went straight to the kitchen and, for the first time since the beginning of his journey from the other end of the world, took a break. Hello, he said. Ursula stood there for a moment with her mouth open, looked into his eyes, screamed, and then hugged him around the neck, crying with joy. It was Jose Arcadio. He had returned penniless, just as he had left. Ursula even had to pay for the horse he had rented. He spoke Spanish mixed with sailor's slang. When they asked him where he had been, he replied, ""Way over there. "" He set up his hammock in the room given to him and slept for three days and three nights. When he woke up, after swallowing sixteen raw eggs one after another, he headed straight to Catarino's shop. The women who saw his gigantic figure were instantly filled with curiosity. Jose Arcadio ordered music to be played and treated everyone to cane liquor. He was also saying that he would wrestle with five people at once. The people there, realizing that they couldn't even bend his arm, let alone bring him down, dismissed it saying, ""No way."" He was wearing a Ninos-en-cruz amulet. Catarino, who didn't believe in gaining strength through amulets or magic, bet twelve pesos that he couldn't move the counter. Jose Arcadio lifted the counter, carried it over his head, and placed it in the middle of the street. It took eleven people, sweating profusely, to put the counter back in its place. Just as the fun was reaching its peak, Jose Arcadio revealed and displayed his unprecedented mark, covered in red and blue tattoos in various languages. He told the women clinging to him that he would stay with whoever gave him the most money. The wealthiest among them gave twenty pesos. Upon this, Jose Arcadio suggested that the women each give ten pesos and draw lots for him. This was an unprecedented fee, because even the most successful woman would earn at most eight pesos a night. Nevertheless, they accepted the proposal. They wrote their names on fourteen pieces of paper and put them into a hat. Each woman drew a lot. When only two pieces of paper remained, it was already clear to whom they belonged.",22.962,22.829,"Suddenly —when the mourning had lasted so long that the cross-stitch sessions had already resumed— someone pushed the street door at two in the afternoon, in the deadly silence of the heat, and the beams trembled with such force in the foundations that Amaranta and her friends embroidering in the corridor, Rebeca sucking her thumb in the bedroom, Úrsula in the kitchen, Aureliano in the workshop, and even José Arcadio Buendía under the solitary chestnut tree, had the impression that an earthquake was unsettling the house. A colossal man was arriving. His square shoulders barely fit through the doors. He had a small medallion of the Virgin of Remedies hanging on his bison neck, his arms and chest completely embroidered with cryptic tattoos, and on his right wrist the tight copper bracelet of the children-on-the-cross. His skin was tanned by the salt of the outdoors, his hair short and cropped like a mule's mane, his jaws ironclad, and his gaze sad. He had a belt twice as thick as a horse's girth, boots with gaiters and spurs, and with ironed heels, and his presence gave the tremulous impression of a seismic shake. He crossed the living room and the sitting room, carrying in his hand some half-destroyed saddlebags, and appeared like thunder in the corridor of begonias, where Amaranta and her friends were paralyzed with their needles in the air. “Hello,” he said to them with a tired voice, and threw the saddlebags on the work table and passed by towards the back of the house. “Hello,” he said to the frightened Rebeca who saw him pass by her bedroom door. “Hello,” he said to Aureliano, who was with all five senses alert at the goldsmith's bench. He did not linger with anyone. He went directly to the kitchen, and there he stopped for the first time at the end of a journey that had started on the other side of the world. “Hello,” he said. Úrsula stayed with her mouth open for a fraction of a second, looked him in the eyes, screamed and jumped to his neck, shouting and crying with joy. It was José Arcadio. He returned as poor as he had left, to the extent that Úrsula had to give him two pesos to pay for the horse's rental. He spoke Spanish mixed with sailor's jargon. They asked him where he had been, and he answered: “Around. ”He hung the hammock in the room they assigned to him and slept for three days. When he woke up, and after drinking sixteen raw eggs, he went straight to Catarino's store, where his monumental bulk provoked a panic of curiosity among the women.

José Arcadio ripped it from its place, lifted it over his head, and put it out on the street. It took eleven men to bring it back in. In the heat of the party, he displayed on the counter his unbelievable masculinity, entirely tattooed with a blue and red tangle of inscriptions in various languages. To the women who besieged him with their greed, he asked who paid more. The one who had the most offered twenty pesos. Then he proposed to raffle himself among all at ten pesos a number. It was an exorbitant price, because the most sought-after woman earned eight pesos in a night, but they all accepted.

179,"“Five pesos more from each one,” José Arcadio proposed, “and I’ll share myself with both.","- Pay an extra five dollars per ticket, - José Arcadio urged, - and then I'll split it between the two of you.",7.047,3.633,"Jose Arcadio, ""Both of you cough up another five each, and I'll stay with both of you,"" he said.",7.981,4.12,—Five more pesos each —proposed José Arcadio— and I'll split myself between both of you.,8.856,3.298
180,"He made his living that way. He had been around the world sixty-five times, enlisted in a crew of sailors without a country. The women who went to bed with him that night in Catarino’s store brought him naked into the dance salon so that people could see that there was not a square inch of his body that was not tattooed, front and back, and from his neck to his toes. He did not succeed in becoming incorporated into the family. He slept all day and spent the night in the red-light district, making bets on his strength. On the rare occasions when Úrsula got him to sit down at the table, he gave signs of radiant good humor, especially when he told about his adventures in remote countries. He had been shipwrecked and spent two weeks adrift in the Sea of Japan, feeding on the body of a comrade who had succumbed to sunstroke and whose extremely salty flesh as it cooked in the sun had a sweet and granular taste. Under a bright noonday sun in the Gulf of Bengal his ship had killed a sea dragon, in the stomach of which they found the helmet, the buckles, and the weapons of a Crusader. In the Caribbean he had seen the ghost of the pirate ship of Victor Hugues, with its sails torn by the winds of death, the masts chewed by sea worms, and still looking for the course to Guadeloupe. Úrsula would weep at the table as if she were reading the letters that had never arrived and in which José Arcadio told about his deeds and misadventures. “And there was so much of a home here for you, my son,” she would sob, “and so much food thrown to the hogs!” But underneath it an she could not conceive that the boy the gypsies took away was the same lout who would eat half a suckling pig for lunch and whose flatulence withered the flowers. Something similar took place with the rest of the family. Amaranta could not conceal the repugnance that she felt at the table because of his bestial belching. Arcadio, who never knew the secret of their relationship, scarcely answered the questions that he asked with the obvious idea of gaining his affection. Aureliano tried to relive the times when they slept in the same room, tried to revive the complicity of childhood, but José Arcadio had forgotten about it, because life at sea had saturated his memory with too many things to remember. Only Rebeca succumbed to the first impact. The day that she saw him pass by her bedroom she thought that Pietro Crespi was a sugary dandy next to that protomale whose volcanic breathing could be heard all over the house. She tried to get near him under any pretext. On a certain occasion José Arcadio looked at her body with shameless attention and said to her “You’re a woman, little sister.” Rebeca lost control of herself. She went back to eating earth and the whitewash on the walls with the avidity of previous days, and she sucked her finger with so much anxiety that she developed a callus on her thumb. She vomited up a green liquid with dead leeches in it. She spent nights awake shaking with fever, fighting against delirium, waiting until the house shook with the return of José Arcadio at dawn. One afternoon, when everyone was having a siesta, she could no longer resist and went to his bedroom. She found him in his shorts, lying in the hammock that he had hung from the beams with a ship’s hawser. She was so impressed by his enormous motley nakedness that she felt an impulse to retreat. “Excuse me,” she said, “I didn’t know you were here.” But she lowered her voice so as not to wake anyone up. “Come here,” he said. Rebeca obeyed. She stopped beside the hammock in an icy sweat, feeling knots forming in her intestines, while José Arcadio stroked her ankles with the tips of his fingers, then her calves, then her thighs, murmuring: “Oh, little sister, little sister.” She had to make a supernatural effort not to die when a startlingly regulated cyclonic power lifted her up by the waist and despoiled her of her intimacy with three clashes of its claws and quartered her like a little bird. She managed to thank God for having been born before she lost herself in the inconceivable pleasure of that unbearable pain, splashing in the steaming marsh of the hammock which absorbed the explosion of blood like a blotter.","He lived that way. He had circled the earth sixty-five times, living with exiled sailors. The women who slept with him that night in Catarino's shop had taken him stark naked to the dance hall so everyone could see his body, not a single millimeter without a tattoo: tattoos in the front, tattoos in the back, tattoos from his neck down to his toes. He could not integrate into family life. He slept all day, and at night he stayed up gambling and testing his strength in the poor worker's neighborhood. On rare occasions, Úrsula managed to get him to sit at the dinner table. He came across as a likable person, especially when recounting his adventurous tales in distant lands. He had been shipwrecked and drifted for several weeks on the Japanese sea, surviving by eating the salted and sun-cooked flesh of a friend who had died of sunstroke, which had turned into a sweet-tasting jerky. One scorching afternoon in the Bay of Bengal, his ship defeated a sea dragon, inside which they found a helmet, belt buckles, and the weapons of an ocean explorer. In the Caribbean Sea, he had seen the ghost of the pirate Victor Hugo's ship, with its tattered sail and worm-eaten hull, forever lost on its way to the island of Guadeloupe. Sitting at the table, Úrsula sobbed as if she were reading letters never sent to her, in which José Arcadio recounted his triumphs and failures. ""Here, the houses are so spacious, my child,"" she wept, ""and there's so much food that we have to throw it to the pigs. But you're never home for me to rely on..."" Yet deep down, she couldn't accept that the boy taken away by the gypsies had become this crude man who devoured half a suckling pig at lunch and whose hot breath withered the plants. The other family members thought similarly of him. Amaranta couldn't hide her disgust whenever he burped at the table. Arcadio, who never knew of his father-son relationship with José Arcadio, barely responded to his attempts to win his son's affection. Aureliano tried to revive the old days when they shared a room and reminisced about their childhood pranks, but José Arcadio had forgotten everything, as his sailor's life, filled with countless memories, had saturated his mind. Only Rebeca submitted to him from the very first moment. That afternoon, seeing him pass by her window, she thought Pietro Crespi was just a plump man compared to the extremely robust José Arcadio, whose volcanic breath filled the house. She found excuses to be near him. There were times when José Arcadio shamelessly ogled her body and said, ""You are very womanly, my dear."" Rebeca could no longer control herself. She resumed eating earth and wall lime with the same craving as before and sucked her thumb until it became calloused. She vomited a green liquid mixed with clotted blood. All night she lay awake, trembling with fever, battling her longing, waiting for dawn; the whole house shook with José Arcadio's footsteps as he returned. One afternoon, while the whole family was taking a nap, she couldn't bear it any longer and sneaked into José Arcadio's bedroom. She saw him awake, wearing shorts, lying on a hammock tied with large iron rings and ship ropes. His muscular bare body moved her so much that she instinctively stopped and intended to leave. ""Sorry""… she stammered, ""I didn't know you were here"". But she lowered her voice immediately so as not to wake anyone else. ""Come in,"" he said. Rebeca obediently complied. She stood right next to the hammock, sweating coldly, feeling her stomach knotting up, while José Arcadio caressed her wrist with his five fingers, then her groin, then her buttocks, whispering: ""Oh, little one. Oh, little one."" The girl had to muster all her strength to avoid dying when a storm-like but very gentle force lifted her by the waist, undressed her, and laid her down like a small bird. She only had time to thank God for her existence before her consciousness was submerged in the soft, ecstatic pleasure that overwhelmed the pain, making her writhe in the steaming hammock. The hammock, like a blotting paper, immediately absorbed the blood from her virginity.",18.889,18.747,"He was earning his bread in this way. He had mingled with homeless sailors and had circled the globe exactly sixty-five times. That night, the women he slept with at Catarino's shop stripped him naked in the middle of the night and took him down to the dance hall, showing that from his neck to his toes, both front and back, he was covered in tattoos with no space left for even a pin to prick. Jose Arcadio could not mix with the family. He would sleep soundly all day and go to the red-light district at night, betting on his strength. On the days when Ursula could coax him to sit at the table, he would cheerfully recount his adventures in distant lands. Once, their ship had wrecked, and they had stayed on a raft in the Sea of Japan for two weeks, surviving by eating their friends who had died from sunstroke and whose flesh, cooked by the sun, tasted somewhat bitter and somewhat sweet. On a hot afternoon in the Bay of Bengal, their boat struck and killed a sea dragon, and when they cut open the dragon's belly, they found a crusader's helmet, metal buckles, and weapons. In the Caribbean Sea, he had seen Victor Hugues' ghost ship, whose sails had been torn by death, whose masts had been gnawed by worms, still trying to find its way to Guadeloupe. As Jose Arcadio recounted these tales, Ursula would cry as if reading letters from her son in exile that had never arrived, saying, ""Here you had a place above our heads, my son."" She would lament, ""I always gave the meals I set aside for you to the pigs!"" Yet she could not wholeheartedly believe that this giant of a man, who could devour half a pig in one sitting and still seem unfazed, was the same person as the young man kidnapped by the gypsies. The other family members shared more or less the same feelings. Amaranta did not hide her disgust at his animal-like belching at the table. Arcadio, who knew nothing of the true nature of their bond, would dismissively answer his questions, which were meant to win his affection. Aureliano was trying to relive the days when they slept in the same room, to recall childhood memories. However, Jose Arcadio, whose mind was filled with a multitude of memories from his days at sea, had long forgotten his childhood. The only one who couldn't shake off the impact of seeing him for the first time was Rebeca. The day Rebeca saw him passing by the bedroom, she thought that next to this symbol of masculinity, whose presence was felt in every corner of the house like a volcano about to erupt, Pietro Crespi seemed like a delicate dandy. She tried to get close to Jose Arcadio at every opportunity. Once, Jose Arcadio looked her up and down with a brazen gaze and said, ""You've become quite a woman, sister. ""Rebeca couldn't control herself anymore. With the fervor of old days, she started eating dirt again, tearing off and swallowing the plaster from the walls. She sucked her finger so persistently that it eventually became calloused. She was bringing up a green bile in which leech larvae swam. Burning with fever throughout the nights, she tried to stay conscious while waiting for Jose Arcadio's return, which shook the house at dawn. One afternoon, when everyone was taking a siesta, she couldn't stand it any longer and went to Jose Arcadio's room. She found him lying in his hammock, which was tied to the ceiling beams with ship moorings, wearing only his underwear. Rebeca, affected by Jose Arcadio's impressive nakedness, suddenly wanted to flee. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here, she said, lowering her voice so no one would wake up. Jose Arcadio said, Come here. Rebeca went and stood by the hammock. As Jose Arcadio murmured, My little one, my little one, while caressing her ankles, then her legs, then her calves with his fingertips, cold sweat poured down Rebeca's body, and a knot of pain twisted in her intestines. When an unimaginable force grabbed her by the waist and tore her clothes to shreds in three swift moves, seating her on him like a fledgling bird, Rebeca exerted supernatural strength not to die. Before she lost herself in the unbearable pleasure of that excruciating pain and sank into the mist of the hammock that absorbed the gushing blood like a sponge, she thanked God for being born.",17.091,16.939,"That was how he made a living. He had circled the globe sixty-five times, enlisted in a crew of stateless sailors. The women who slept with him that night in Catarino's tent took him naked to the dance hall so that everyone could see that he didn't have a millimeter of his body without a tattoo, front and back, from his neck to his toes. He couldn't integrate into the family. He slept all day and spent the night in the red-light district performing feats of strength. On the rare occasions when Úrsula managed to get him to sit at the table, he showed a radiant charm, especially when recounting his adventures in distant lands. He had shipwrecked and spent two weeks adrift in the Sea of Japan, feeding on the body of a companion who succumbed to sunstroke, whose salted and re-salted flesh, cooked in the sun, had a grainy and sweet taste. On a radiant midday in the Bay of Bengal, his ship had defeated a sea dragon in whose belly they found the helmet, buckles, and weapons of a crusader. He had seen in the Caribbean the ghost of Victor Hugues' corsair ship, with sails torn by the winds of death, the rigging gnawed by sea cockroaches, and forever lost on the course to Guadeloupe. Úrsula cried at the table as if she were reading the letters that never arrived, in which José Arcadio recounted his exploits and misadventures. “And so much house here, my son,” she sobbed. “And so much food thrown to the pigs! ”But deep down, she couldn't conceive that the boy taken by the gypsies was the same brute who ate half a piglet at lunch and whose flatulence withered the flowers. Something similar happened to the rest of the family. Amaranta couldn't hide the disgust his bestial belches caused her at the table. Arcadio, who never knew the secret of his parentage, barely answered the questions he asked with the evident purpose of winning his affections. Aureliano tried to revive the times when they slept in the same room, tried to restore the complicity of childhood, but José Arcadio had forgotten them because the life at sea had saturated his memory with too many things to remember. Only Rebeca succumbed to the first impact. The afternoon she saw him pass in front of her bedroom, she thought Pietro Crespi was a dandy weakling compared to that prime male whose volcanic breath was felt throughout the house. She sought his proximity with any excuse. On one occasion, José Arcadio looked at her body with blatant attention and said, “You are very much a woman, little sister. ”Rebeca lost control of herself. She went back to eating earth and lime from the walls with the avidity of old days, and sucked her thumb with such anxiety that a callus formed on it. She vomited a green liquid with dead leeches. She spent sleepless nights shivering with fever, fighting delirium, waiting until the house trembled with José Arcadio's return at dawn. One afternoon, when everyone was napping, she couldn't resist any longer and went to his bedroom. She found him in his underwear, awake, lying in the hammock he had hung from the beams with ship mooring cables. His enormous tattooed nakedness impressed her so much that she felt the urge to retreat. “Excuse me,” she apologized. “I didn't know you were here. ”But she lowered her voice so as not to wake anyone. “Come here,” he said. Rebeca obeyed. She stopped next to the hammock, sweating ice, feeling knots form in her stomach, while José Arcadio caressed her ankles with his fingertips, then her calves, and then her thighs, murmuring, “Oh, little sister; oh, little sister. ”She had to make a supernatural effort not to die when an astonishingly regulated cyclonic force lifted her by the waist, stripped her of her intimacy with three claw swipes, and dismembered her like a little bird. She managed to thank God for being born before losing consciousness in the inconceivable pleasure of that unbearable pain, splashing in the steaming swamp of the hammock that absorbed the explosion of her blood like blotting paper.",46.62,46.557

195,"That opinion, which Úrsula understood only some months later, was the only sincere one that Aureliano could express at that moment, not only with respect to marriage, but to anything that was not war. He himself, facing a firing squad, would not understand too well the concatenation of the series of subtle but irrevocable accidents that brought him to that point. The death of Remedios had not produced the despair that he had feared. It was, rather, a dull feeling of rage that grades ally dissolved in a solitary and passive frustration similar to the one he had felt during the time he was resigned to living without a woman. He plunged into his work again, but he kept up the custom of playing dominoes with his father-in-law. In a house bound up in mourning, the nightly conversations consolidated the friendship between the two men. “Get married again. Aurelito,” his father-in-law would tell him. “I have six daughters for you to choose from.” On one occasion on the eve of the elections, Don Apolinar Moscote returned from one of his frequent trips worried about the political situation in the country. The Liberals were determined to go to war. Since Aureliano at that time had very confused notions about the difference between Conservatives and Liberals, his father-in-law gave him some schematic lessons. The Liberals, he said, were Freemasons, bad people, wanting to hang priests, to institute civil marriage and divorce, to recognize the rights of illegitimate children as equal to those of legitimate ones, and to cut the country up into a federal system that would take power away from the supreme authority. The Conservatives, on the other hand, who had received their power directly from God, proposed the establishment of public order and family morality. They were the defenders of the faith of Christ, of the principle of authority, and were not prepared to permit the country to be broken down into autonomous entities. Because of his humanitarian feelings Aureliano sympathized with the Liberal attitude with respect to the rights of natural children, but in any case, he could not understand how people arrived at the extreme of waging war over things that could not be touched with the hand. It seemed an exaggeration to him that for the elections his father-in-law had them send six soldiers armed with rifles under the command of a sergeant to a town with no political passions. They not only arrived, but they went from house to house confiscating hunting weapons, machetes, and even kitchen knives before they distributed among males over twenty-one the blue ballots with the names of the Conservative candidates and the red ballots with the names of the Liberal candidates. On the eve of the elections Don Apolinar Moscote himself read a decree that prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages and the gathering together of more than three people who were not of the same family. The elections took place without incident. At eight o’clock on Sunday morning a wooden ballot box was set up in the square, which was watched over by the six soldiers. The voting was absolutely free, as Aureliano himself was able to attest since he spent almost the entire day with his father-in-law seeing that no one voted more than once. At four in the afternoon a roll of drums in the square announced the closing of the polls and Don Apolinar Moscote sealed the ballot box with a label crossed by his signature. That night, while he played dominoes with Aureliano, he ordered the sergeant to break the seal in order to count the votes. There were almost as many red ballots as blue, but the sergeant left only ten red ones and made up the difference with blue ones. Then they sealed the box again with a new label and the first thing on the following day it was taken to the capital of the province. “The Liberals will go to war,” Aureliano said. Don Apolinar concentrated on his domino pieces. “If you’re saying that because of the switch in ballots, they won’t,” he said. “We left a few red ones in so there won’t be any complaints.” Aureliano understood the disadvantages of being in the opposition. “If I were a Liberal,” he said, “I’d go to war because of those ballots.” His father-in-law looked at him over his glasses.","In the following months, Úrsula finally understood that the statement was the only sincere answer that Aureliano could have given at that moment. It was not only a response to the matter of marriage but also to any issue unrelated to the war. When facing the execution squad's rifles, even he did not fully understand why a series of ironic coincidences had led him to that situation. The death of Remedios did not lead him to a terrifying agitation. Rather, it was merely a silent anger that gradually seeped into a quiet and lonely despondency, similar to the despondency he felt during the days he resolved to remain single. He immersed himself in work again but still kept the habit of visiting his father-in-law to play dominoes: ""Aureliano, get married,"" his father-in-law told him. ""I have six daughters for you to choose from."" Once, perhaps the event occurred before the election day, Don Apolinar Moscote returned to the village from the province, full of anxiety about the political situation of the country. The Liberals were ready to plunge into the fight. Since Aureliano still had vague notions about the differences between the Conservatives and the Liberals at that time, his father-in-law explained the general outlines to him. Free men, he said, are Masons, wicked people who support hanging priests, advocate equal marriage and divorce, recognize the equality of illegitimate and legitimate children, and favor dividing the country into states that are federated to strip local powers and concentrate them in the supreme government. In contrast, the Royalists, who have received power directly from God, protect the established public order and family morals, are the defenders of Christ, protect the foundations of power, and do not allow the country to be divided into free states. Due to humanitarian sentiments, Aureliano sympathized with the liberal attitude of recognizing the rights of illegitimate children, but in any case, he could not understand why people had to go to war over intangible matters. He felt his father-in-law was being extreme when he requested his superiors to send six soldiers under the command of a sergeant to Macondo, a village without political passions, to protect the election. The soldiers not only came to the village, but they also went house to house, confiscating hunting weapons, machetes, and even kitchen knives, before distributing to men aged twenty-one and over a green ballot with the names of the Royalist candidates and a pink ballot with the names of the Liberal candidates. Before the election day, Apolinar Moscote himself read a decree prohibiting the sale of liquor and gatherings of more than three people unless they were from the same household for forty-eight hours starting from midnight on Saturday. The election proceeded smoothly. As early as eight o'clock on Sunday morning, a wooden box guarded by six soldiers was placed in the square. People voted freely, just as Aureliano could see for himself when he, along with his father-in-law, stood guard all day to ensure that no one could vote more than once. At four in the afternoon, a drum roll in the square signaled the end of the election day, and Apolinar Moscote sealed the ballot box with a cross-marked tape bearing his signature. That night, while playing dominoes with Aureliano, he ordered the sergeant to open the box and count the votes. The number of pink and green ballots was roughly equal, but the sergeant left only ten pink ballots and replaced the rest with green ones to make up the difference. Then the sergeant resealed the ballot box with a new label, and the next morning it was hurriedly taken to the provincial capital. "" The Liberals will rise up in civil war,"" Aureliano said. Apolinar did not take his eyes off his domino tiles. ""If you mean because of the ballot change, they won't rise up,"" he said, ""some pink ballots were left to keep them from complaining. ""Aureliano understood the disadvantages of the opposing side. ""If I were a Liberal,"" he said, ""I would rise up precisely because of this ballot change."" His father-in-law looked at him over his glasses.",26.831,26.719,"These words, which Ursula could only understand a month later, were the only ones Aureliano could sincerely utter at that moment. What he said encompassed not only the topic of marriage but everything unrelated to the war. Even he couldn't fully comprehend the series of insignificant but irreversible events that led him to that point when he stood before the firing squad. Remedios's death had not caused the devastation in Aureliano that he had feared. He felt a silent rage that gradually turned into an inward resentment during the period he lived without a woman. He had returned to his work but had not given up his habit of playing dominoes with his father-in-law. The conversations held in the mourning house from evening to evening brought the two men closer together and strengthened their friendship. His father-in-law would say, ""Remarry, Aurelito."" ""Look, I have six more daughters."" ""Choose the one you like and take her."" The night of the elections, Don Apolinar Moscote, who had just returned from one of his frequent trips, was quite pessimistic about the political situation in the country. The Liberals were determined to fight. At that time, since Aureliano did not have sufficient knowledge about the distinction between Conservatives and Liberals, his father-in-law briefly explained to him what was what. According to Moscote, the Liberals were Freemasons, bad people, who would hang and strangle priests, disregard religious rules, come up with new inventions like civil marriage and divorce, grant the same rights to illegitimate children as to other children, and weaken the power of the state by dividing the country with a federal system. However, the Conservatives, who derived their power directly from God, wanted to defend the established order, ensure public order, and protect the sanctity and morality of the family institution. They were the guardians of our Lord Jesus' religion, the defenders of the principle of sovereignty, and they would not allow the country to be divided into autonomous administrative regions; they would ensure the integrity of the homeland. Aureliano, influenced by his humane feelings, sided with the Liberals because of their stance on illegitimate children. But he could never understand how discussions about intangible matters could bring the parties to the brink of war. He also attributed the arrival of six armed soldiers, led by a sergeant, to a village where no one had any political passion, during election time, to his father-in-law's meddling. When the soldiers arrived in the village, they did not remain idle. They went from house to house and collected all the weapons they could find. They even took bread knives along with cane knives. Then they distributed blue ballots with the names of Conservative candidates and red ballots for the Liberals to men over twenty-one years old. On the evening before the elections, Don Apolinar Moscote read a proclamation banning the sale of alcoholic beverages and the gathering of more than three people from different families. The elections passed without incident. At eight on Sunday morning, a ballot box was placed in the square. Six soldiers stood guard at the ballot box. The election was conducted in an atmosphere of great freedom and maturity. Aureliano, since he was with his father-in-law who did not leave the ballot box to ensure no one voted more than once, witnessed these free and mature elections with his own eyes. At four in the afternoon, the end of voting was announced with a drum played in the square. Don Apolinar Moscote sealed the ballot box, labeled it, and signed the label. That night, while playing dominoes with Aureliano, Moscote told the sergeant to break the seal of the ballot box and count the votes. From the box came an equal number of blue and red ballots, but the sergeant left only ten red ballots in the box and filled the difference with blue ones. Then they sealed the box again and sent it to the capital without delay the next morning. The Liberals will declare war, said Aureliano. Don Apolinar was completely focused on the domino tiles. If you're saying this because we changed the votes, don't worry, they won't start a war, he said. We left a few red ballots so that no one would have anything to say. Aureliano was slowly understanding the disadvantages of being in opposition. If I were a liberal, I would go to war over these votes; he said. His father-in-law scrutinized him over his glasses.",26.822,26.71,"That opinion, which Úrsula only understood some months later, was the only sincere one that Aureliano could express at that moment, not only regarding marriage but any matter that wasn't war. He himself, in front of the firing squad, did not quite understand how the series of subtle but irrevocable coincidences that led him to that point had unfolded. Remedios' death did not produce the shock he feared. It was rather a dull feeling of rage that gradually dissolved into a solitary and passive frustration, similar to what he experienced in the times when he was resigned to living without a woman. He plunged back into work, but kept the habit of playing dominoes with his father-in-law. In a house silenced by mourning, the nightly conversations consolidated the friendship between the two men. ""Remarry, Aurelito,"" his father-in-law would say. ""I have six daughters to choose from. "" On one occasion, on the eve of the elections, Don Apolinar Moscote returned from one of his frequent trips, worried about the country's political situation. The liberals were determined to go to war. Since Aureliano had very confused notions at that time about the differences between conservatives and liberals, his father-in-law gave him schematic lessons. The liberals, he said, were masons; people of bad character, supporters of hanging priests, implementing civil marriage and divorce, recognizing equal rights for natural children as for legitimate ones, and tearing the country apart into a federal system that stripped the supreme authority of its powers. The conservatives, on the other hand, who had received power directly from God, advocated for the stability of public order and family morals; they were the defenders of the faith of Christ, the principle of authority, and were not willing to allow the country to be dismembered into autonomous entities. Out of humanitarian sentiments, Aureliano sympathized with the liberal stance regarding the rights of natural children, but still did not understand how it came to the point of waging a war over things that could not be touched with hands. It seemed an exaggeration to him that his father-in-law had six soldiers armed with rifles, led by a sergeant, sent for the elections in a town without political passions. Not only did they arrive, but they went from house to house confiscating hunting weapons, machetes, and even kitchen knives, before distributing the blue ballots with the names of the conservative candidates and the red ballots with the names of the liberal candidates among men over twenty-one years old. On the eve of the elections, Don Apolinar Moscote himself read an edict that prohibited, from midnight on Saturday and for forty-eight hours, the sale of alcoholic beverages and the gathering of more than three people who were not from the same family. The elections passed without incident. From eight o'clock on Sunday morning, the wooden ballot box was set up in the square, guarded by the six soldiers. Voting took place with complete freedom, as Aureliano himself could verify, who spent almost the entire day with his father-in-law ensuring that no one voted more than once. At four in the afternoon, a drum roll in the square announced the end of the day, and Don Apolinar Moscote sealed the ballot box with a label crossed with his signature. That night, while playing dominoes with Aureliano, he ordered the sergeant to break the label to count the votes. There were almost as many red ballots as blue ones, but the sergeant left only ten red ones and made up the difference with blue ones. Then they resealed the ballot box with a new label and the next day, first thing in the morning, they took it to the provincial capital. "" The liberals will go to war,"" said Aureliano. Don Apolinar did not take his eyes off his domino pieces. ""If you say it because of the ballot changes, they won't,"" he said. "" Some red ones are left so there are no complaints. ""Aureliano understood the disadvantages of the opposition. ""If I were a liberal,"" he said, ""I would go to war over this ballot issue. "" His father-in-law looked at him over the rim of his glasses.",52.316,52.257

197,"What really caused indignation in the town was. not the results of the elections but the fact that the soldiers had not returned the weapons. A group of women spoke with Aureliano so that he could obtain the return of their kitchen knives from his father-in-law. Don Apolinar Moscote explained to him, in strictest confidence, that the soldiers had taken the weapons off as proof that the Liberals were preparing for war. The cynicism of the remark alarmed him. He said nothing, but on a certain night when Gerineldo Márquez and Magnífico Visbal were speaking with some other friends about the incident of the knives, they asked him if he was a Liberal or a Conservative.

199,"On the following day, at the urging of his friends, he went to see Dr. Alirio Noguera to be treated for a supposed pain in his liver. He did not even understand the meaning of the subterfuge. Dr. Alirio Noguera had arrived in Macondo a few years before with a medicine chest of tasteless pills and a medical motto that convinced no one: One nail draws another. In reality he was a charlatan. Behind his innocent façade of a doctor without prestige there was hidden a terrorist who with his short legged boots covered the scars that five years in the stocks had left on his legs. Taken prisoner during the first federalist adventure, he managed to escape to Curaçao disguised in the garment he detested most in this world: a cassock. At the end of a prolonged exile, stirred up by the exciting news that exiles from all over the Caribbean brought to Curaçao, he set out in a smuggler’s schooner and appeared in Riohacha with the bottles of pills that were nothing but refined sugar and a diploma from the University of Leipzig that he had forged himself. He wept with disappointment. The federalist fervor, which the exiles had pictured as a powder keg about to explode, had dissolved into a vague electoral illusion. Embittered by failure, yearning for a safe place where he could await old age, the false homeopath took refuge in Macondo. In the narrow bottle-crowded room that he rented on one side of the square, he lived several years off the hopelessly ill who, after having tried everything, consoled themselves with sugar pills. His instincts of an agitator remained dormant as long as Don Apolinar Moscote was a figurehead. He passed the time remembering and fighting against asthma. The approach of the elections was the thread that led him once more to the skein of subversion. He made contact with the young people in the town, who lacked political knowledge, and he embarked on a stealthy campaign of instigation. The numerous red ballots that appeared is the box and that were attributed by Don Apolinar Moscote to the curiosity that came from youth were part of his plan: he made his disciples vote in order to show them that elections were a farce. “The only effective thing,” he would say, “is violence.” The majority of Aureliano’s friends were enthusiastic over the idea of liquidating the Conservative establishment, but no one had dared include him in the plans, not only because of his ties with the magistrate, but because of his solitary and elusive character. It was known, furthermore, that he had voted blue at his father-in-law’s direction. So it was a simple matter of chance that he revealed his political sentiments, and it was purely a matter of curiosity, a caprice, that brought him to visit the doctor for the treatment of a pain that he did not have. In the den that smelled of camphorated cobwebs he found himself facing a kind of dusty iguana whose lungs whistled when he breathed. Before asking him any questions the doctor took him to the window and examined the inside of his lower eyelid. “It’s not there,” Aureliano said, following what they told him. He pushed the tips of his fingers into his liver and added: “Here’s where I have the pain that won’t let me sleep.” Then Dr. Noguera closed the window with the pretext that there was too much sun, and explained to him in simple terms that it was a patriotic duty to assassinate Conservatives. For several days Aureliano carried a small bottle of pills in his shirt pocket. He would take it out every two hours, put three pills in the palm of his hand, and pop them into his mouth for them to be slowly dissolved on his tongue. Don Apolinar Moscote made fun of his faith in homeopathy, but those who were in on the plot recognized another one of their people in him. Almost all of the sons of the founders were implicated, although none of them knew concretely what action they were plotting. Nevertheless, the day the doctor revealed the secret to Aureliano, the latter elicited the whole plan of the conspiracy. Although he was convinced at that time of the urgency of liquidating the Conservative regime, the plot horrified him. Dr. Noguera had a mystique of personal assassination. His system was reduced to coordinating a series of individual actions which in one master stroke covering the whole nation would liquidate the functionaries of the regime along with their respective families, especially the children, in order to exterminate Conservatism at its roots. Don Apolinar Moscote, his wife, and his six daughters, needless to say, were on the list.","The very next day, at the request of his friends, he went to see Dr. Alirio Noguera to have him examine his liver pain. He didn't even know why he was doing it. Dr. Alino Noguera had come to the village of Macondo a few years ago, bringing with him a cabinet of tasteless pills and an unconvincing advertisement sign: Fight poison with poison. In reality, it was a joke. Behind the mild exterior of a mediocre doctor was the face of a terrorist who wore knee-high boots to cover the scars on his ankles, marks from five years in prison. From the very first federalist adventure, he had been arrested, escaped to Curaçao disguised in the clothes he hated most in the world: a priest's cassock. After a long exile, filled with excitement by the news brought by exiles from all over the Caribbean to Curaçao, he sneaked onto a smuggling ship and then appeared in Riohacha with a cabinet of pills, which were actually just refined sugar tablets, and a fake medical degree from the University of Leipzig that he had forged himself: He wept bitterly. The revolutionary fervor of the federalists, defined by the exiles as a powder keg about to explode, gradually cooled in the illusion of futile elections. Bitter from that failure, longing for a safe place to spend his old age, the doctor who treated illness with illness fled to the village of Macondo. In a cramped room filled with empty bottles, rented from across the square, he lived for several years with an incurable disease, convincing himself that he could be consoled with sugar pills. His rebellious spirit had settled as Apolinar Moscote became more of a puppet authority. Time passed, and he lived in reminiscence, treating asthma. The upcoming election was the trigger for him to find a way to act rebelliously again. He had close relations with the village youth, who were very politically unaware, and threw himself into secret rebellious activities. The majority of the pink ballots in the box were from the enthusiastic youth. This was part of his plan: to force his disciples to vote to show them that elections were a farce. ""The only thing that works,"" he said, ""is violence. "" Most of Aureliano's friends were eager to sweep away the royalist regime, but none dared to involve him in the plan, not only because of his relationship with his father-in-law but also because of his solitary and indifferent nature. Moreover, they knew he had voted green as directed by his father-in-law. So it was merely a coincidence that revealed his political thoughts, and it was a completely curious impulse that led him to the absurd idea of visiting the doctor to treat a non-existent ailment. In the cramped room reeking of cheap camphor, there was a man who looked exactly like a moldy iguana wheezing. Before he could ask anything, the doctor pulled him to the window and examined his lower eyelid. ""It's not there,"" Aureliano said, following his friends' instructions. Pressing his finger on his abdomen where his liver was, he said, ""This is where it hurts so much I can't sleep. "" So Dr. Noguera closed the window, claiming it was too bright, and in simple terms explained to him why eliminating the royalists was a patriot's duty. For several days, Aureliano carried a tube of pills in his shirt pocket. Every two hours, he would take out the tube, pour three pills into his palm, and pop them all into his mouth, letting them dissolve slowly on his tongue. Apolinar Moscote mocked his faith in the method of treating illness with illness, but those plotting rebellion recognized him as one of their own. Almost all the sons of Macondo's founders were in the secret organization, but none knew exactly how the actions they were preparing would unfold. However, on the day the doctor revealed the secret to Aureliano, he volunteered to join the uprising. Although he agreed at the time that the royalist regime had to be quickly destroyed, the doctor's plan of action disgusted him. Dr. Noguera was a great fan of individual terrorism. His method of action involved coordinating a series of individual acts so that in a large-scale national uprising, the royalist officials and their entire families, especially their children, would be exterminated to eradicate the royalist lineage. Of course, Apolinar Moscote, his wife, and daughters were all on the terrorist list.",24.819,24.707,"The next day, upon the insistence of his friends, he went to Dr. Alirio Noguera, supposedly to cure the pain in his liver. He couldn't understand why he needed to lie about being sick. Dr. Alirio Noguera had come to Macondo a few years earlier with a box of unpleasant pills and a saying that no one could make sense of: ""A nail drives out another nail,"" he said. In fact, he was a charlatan. Behind the guise of a doctor with no respectability, a terrorist was hidden. The short boots he always wore covered the marks left on his legs by five years of shackles. He had been arrested during the first actions of the Federalists, had to disguise himself in the form he most opposed in the world, and managed to escape to Curaçao by wearing a priest's robe. After living in exile for many years, he could no longer stay put upon hearing news from fellow exiles spread across the Caribbean coming to Curaçao, and he took a smuggler's boat to Riohacha. He had nothing but pills made of powdered sugar and a fake diploma from Leipzig University. He cried in disappointment at what he saw. The federalist force, which the smugglers had endlessly described as a boiling cauldron ready to explode, had dissipated in an obscure election frenzy. The fake doctor, devastated by the defeat and seeking a place to spend the rest of his life in peace, took refuge in Macondo. In a room filled with rented bottles of pills in a corner of the area, he lived off the desperate patients who, after trying every remedy, consoled themselves with sugar pills for a few years. During the years when Don Apolinar Moscote supposedly governed, there was no sign of incitement from the doctor. He spent his time reminiscing about the old days and battling asthma. With the approach of the elections, things got out of hand, and the doctor found himself once again in the role of an agitator. He established relationships with the village youths who were completely unaware of politics and continuously ran an incitement campaign. The red votes that came out of the ballot box, which Don Apolinar Moscote interpreted as a youthful whim, were part of the doctor's plan. He had made the young people vote to prove that the elections were nothing but a sham. The only thing that has an effect is acts of violence, he would say. Most of Aureliano's friends intended to overthrow the Conservative government. However, no one dared to reveal their plans to him. They couldn't open up to him not only because he was the son-in-law of the justice of the peace, but also because he was a reserved person. Moreover, it was known that he voted blue just because his father-in-law wanted him to. In short, Aureliano's political stance was revealed purely by chance. Although he was perfectly healthy, he went to the doctor out of sheer curiosity. When Aureliano entered the room that smelled of camphor and was covered in cobwebs, he found himself in front of someone who resembled a dusty lizard, wheezing with every breath. Without asking him anything, the doctor took him to the window and looked inside his lower eyelid. Aureliano said, ""My problem isn't there."" They had advised him to say it that way. Pressing the tips of his fingers against his liver, he added, The pain that keeps me awake at night is right here. Upon this, Dr. Noguera, pretending to be bothered by the sun, closed the curtain and explained to Aureliano in simple terms that he could understand that killing the Conservatives was an act of patriotism. Aureliano carried a bottle of medicine in his shirt pocket for several days. Every two hours, he would take out the bottle, take three pills into his palm, and slowly suck on them. Don Apolinar Moscote mocked him for believing in old wives' remedies, but those involved in the assassination plot considered him one of their own. Although none of them knew exactly what action would be taken, almost all the sons of the village founders had joined the organization. However, the day the doctor hinted at what was to be done, Aureliano understood the plan. Although he believed that the Conservative regime needed to be overthrown, he was frightened by what was being planned. Dr. Noguera was fixated on assassinations. These actions, which would be triggered at the push of a button, would plan the killing of individuals one by one, ultimately leading to the elimination of those running the regime along with their families, especially their children, thereby eradicating Conservatism throughout the country. Needless to say, Don Apolinar Moscote, his wife, and his six daughters were also on this list.",20.263,20.13,"The next day, at the insistence of his friends, he went to visit Dr. Alirio Noguera to treat a supposed liver pain.

Captured in the first federalist adventure, he managed to escape to Curaçao disguised in the outfit he most detested in this world: a cassock. After a prolonged exile, spurred on by the exalted news brought to Curaçao by exiles from all over the Caribbean, he boarded a smugglers' schooner and appeared in Riohacha with the vials of globules that were nothing more than refined sugar, and a diploma from the University of Leipzig forged by himself.

So it was a simple coincidence that revealed his political feelings, and it was pure curiosity that got him involved in the whim of visiting the doctor to treat a pain he didn't have.

202,"Only six months later did Aureliano learn that the doctor had given up on him as a man of action because he was a sentimental person with no future, with a passive character, and a definite solitary vocation. They tried to keep him surrounded, fearing that he would betray the conspiracy. Aureliano calmed them down: he would not say a word, but on the night they went to murder the Moscote family they would find him guarding the door. He showed such a convincing decision that the plan was postponed for an indefinite date. It was during those days that Úrsula asked his opinion about the marriage between Pietro Crespi and Amaranta, and he answered that these were not times to be thinking about such a thing. For a week he had been carrying an old-fashioned pistol under his shirt. He kept his eyes on his friends. In the afternoon he would go have coffee with José Arcadio and Rebeca, who had begun to put their house in order, and from seven o’clock on he would play dominoes with his father-in-law. At lunchtime he was chatting with Arcadio, who was already a huge adolescent, and he found him more and more excited over the imminence of war. In school, where Arcadio had pupils older than himself mixed in with children who were barely beginning to talk, the Liberal fever had caught on. There was talk of shooting Father Nicanor, of turning the church into a school, of instituting free love. Aureliano tried to calm down his drive. He recommended discretion and prudence to him. Deaf to his calm reasoning, to his sense of reality, Arcadio reproached him in public for his weakness of character. Aureliano waited. Finally, in the beginning of December, Úrsula burst into the workshop all upset.","Six months later, Aureliano learned that the doctor did not believe he was a man of action, had no hope for him, considering him a sentimental person, overly gentle and lonely. They tried to monitor him because they feared he would reveal the rebellion plans. To put them at ease, Aureliano promised not to say a word. But the night they came to assassinate the Moscote family, they found him standing guard at the entrance. He showed such a decisive attitude that the assassination plan had to be postponed indefinitely. It was during these days that Úrsula asked his opinion about the marriage of Pietro Crespi and Amaranta, and he replied that now was not the time to think about it. For more than a week, he had been hiding an old-fashioned revolver under his shirt, always on guard against his friends. In the afternoon, he would go to drink coffee with José Arcadio and Rebeca, who were now starting to decorate their house, and then from seven in the evening, he would play dominoes with his father-in-law. At lunchtime, he talked with Arcadio, who was now a robust young man, and noticed that the young man increasingly showed eager enthusiasm for the impending civil war. Arcadio had kindled a fervent admiration for the idea of freedom in the school, where he had gathered not only older students but also young children who could barely speak. The young man spoke about shooting Father Nicanor, turning the church into a school, and recognizing sexual freedom. Aureliano was worried about his nephew's violent ideas. He advised him to be cautious and discreet. Ignoring his uncle's sensible arguments and practical thoughts, Arcadio openly criticized his uncle's cowardice. Aureliano waited and waited. Finally, at the beginning of December, Úrsula suddenly rushed into the goldsmith's workshop in a panic:",27.289,27.026,"Aureliano only learned six months later that the doctor had looked at his emotional, introverted, solitary nature and concluded that he could not be a man of action. His friends did not leave Aureliano's side, fearing he might reveal their plans, so they did not leave him alone. Aureliano reassured them. He would not let a single word slip, but on the night they came to kill Moscote and his family, they would find him standing guard at the door. He was so determined in this matter that the assassination plan was postponed to an indefinite date. It was precisely during those days that Ursula asked what he thought about Pietro Crespi and Amaranta getting married, and Aureliano said it was not the time to worry about their marriage. For a week, he had been carrying an old model pistol under his shirt; he did not take his eyes off his friends. In the evenings, he would go to visit Jose Arcadio and Rebeca, who had started tidying up their house, and after seven o'clock, he would play dominoes with his father-in-law. At lunch, he would chat with Arcadio, who was now a grown young man, and he saw that Arcadio was very excited about the outbreak of war. In the school where Arcadio taught, there were students older than him. Those who had just learned to speak and those with hair and beard intertwined were together. The fire of liberalism had also engulfed the school. There was talk of Father Nicanor being shot, the church being turned into a school, and free love being recognized. Aureliano tried to calm Arcadio's outbursts. He advised him to be sensible and moderate. However, Arcadio ignored his rational views and realism, and accused him of being unprincipled in front of everyone. Aureliano waited. Finally, one day in early December, Ursula, trembling all over, burst into the workshop.",25.601,25.342,"Only six months later did Aureliano learn that the doctor had written him off as a man of action, deeming him a sentimentalist with no future, a passive character, and a defined solitary vocation. They tried to corner him, fearing he would denounce the conspiracy. Aureliano reassured them: he wouldn't say a word, but the night they went to kill the Moscote family, they would find him defending the door. He demonstrated such a convincing resolve that the plan was postponed indefinitely. It was around that time that Úrsula sought his opinion on the marriage of Pietro Crespi and Amaranta, and he replied that the times were not right for thinking about that. For a week, he had been carrying an archaic pistol under his shirt. He was watching his friends. In the afternoons, he would go for coffee with José Arcadio and Rebeca, who were starting to organize their house, and from seven o'clock, he played dominoes with his father-in-law. At lunchtime, he conversed with Arcadio, who was already a monumental adolescent, and found him increasingly excited about the imminence of war. At school, where Arcadio had students older than him mixed with children who were just beginning to speak, the liberal fever had taken hold. There was talk of executing Father Nicanor, converting the temple into a school, and implementing free love. Aureliano tried to temper his impulses. He recommended discretion and prudence.

The only one who knew it immediately was Don Apolinar Moscote, but he did not give the news even to his wife while the army platoon that was to occupy the town by surprise was on its way. They entered noiselessly before dawn, with two pieces of light artillery drawn by mules, and they set up their headquarters in the school. A 6 P.M. curfew was established. A more drastic search than the previous one was undertaken, house by house, and this time they even took farm implements. They dragged out Dr. Noguera, tied him to a tree in the square, and shot him without any due process of law. Father Nicanor tried to impress the military authorities with the miracle of levitation and had his head split open by the butt of a soldier’s rifle. The Liberal exaltation had been extinguished into a silent terror. Aureliano, pale, mysterious, continued playing dominoes with his father-in-law. He understood that in spite of his present title of civil and military leader of the town, Don Apolinar Moscote was once more a figurehead. The decisions were made by the army captain, who each morning collected an extraordinary levy for the defense of public order. Four soldiers under his command snatched a woman who had been bitten by a mad dog from her family and killed her with their rifle butts. One Sunday, two weeks after the occupation, Aureliano entered Gerineldo Márquez’s house and with his usual terseness asked for a mug of coffee without sugar. When the two of them were alone in the kitchen, Aureliano gave his voice an authority that had never been heard before. “Get the boys ready,” he said. “We’re going to war.” Gerineldo Márquez did not believe him.","Indeed, the civil war had been raging for three months. The curfew law was enforced nationwide. Don Apolinar Moscote was the only one who knew in time that the fighting had broken out, but he didn't reveal it even to his wife, while a platoon of soldiers had rushed in to occupy the village and set up a garrison. The soldiers quietly entered the village before dawn, bringing with them two light cannons pulled by mules, and established a garrison right at the school. They blew the curfew horn as early as six in the evening. This time, they searched each house more terrifyingly than before, confiscating everything from sickles onwards. They dragged Dr. Noguera away, tied him to a tree, and shot him without trial. Father Nicanor wanted to awe the military authorities with his mystical ability to levitate, but a soldier struck him on the head with the butt of his rifle, causing it to bleed. The excitement of the Liberals was extinguished in silent anxiety. Aureliano, pale and inscrutable, continued to play dominoes with his father-in-law. He understood that although Don Apolinar Moscote was nominally the leader of civil and military affairs in the village, he was once again just a puppet official. All matters in the village were decided by an army captain. Every morning, this captain personally collected extraneous taxes to fund the maintenance of public security. Four soldiers under his command looted the home of a woman bitten by a rabid dog and beat her to death with rifle butts right in the middle of the street. Two weeks after the soldiers occupied the village, one Sunday, Aureliano walked into Herinendo Marquez's house with his usual dazed look and asked for a cup of coffee without sugar. When they were alone, unlike on other days, Aureliano authoritatively said, ""Prepare the boys, we are going to war.""

The only one who received news of the events immediately was Don Apolinar Moscote. But even though the army unit that occupied the village had set out, he hadn't even told his wife about it. The soldiers entered the village before dawn with two light cannons pulled by mules and set up headquarters in the school. A curfew was imposed after six in the evening. A much more meticulous investigation was conducted than the previous one, all the houses were searched thoroughly, and even agricultural tools were confiscated. They dragged Dr. Noguera to the square, tied him to a tree, and shot him without any questioning. Father Nicanor tried to impress the military authorities with the miracle of flying, but one of the soldiers brought down the butt of his rifle, splitting his head in two. The enthusiasm of the Liberals turned into this silent horror. The sallow-faced, silent Aureliano continued his domino games with his father-in-law. Although he held the title of the so-called civilian and military leader of the village, Don Apolinar Moscote had once again lost his respect. The decisions were made by the captain, and extraordinary meetings were held every morning to maintain order. One day, four of the soldiers under his command forcibly took a woman who had been bitten by a rabid dog from her family and beat her to death with their rifle butts. Two weeks after the occupation, on a Sunday, Aureliano went to Gerineldo Marquez's house and, in his usual taciturn manner, asked for a cup of plain coffee.

214,"Arcadio gave a very personal interpretation to the instructions. He invented a uniform with the braid and epaulets of a marshal, inspired by the prints in one of Melquíades’ books, and around his waist he buckled the saber with gold tassels that had belonged to the executed captain. He set up the two artillery pieces at the entrance to town, put uniforms on his former pupils, who had been amused by his fiery proclamations, and let them wander through the streets armed in order to give outsiders an impression of invulnerability. It was a double-edged deception, for the government did not dare attack the place for ten months, but when it did it unleashed such a large force against it that resistance was liquidated in a half hour. From the first day of his rule Arcadio revealed his predilection for decrees. He would read as many as four a day in order to decree and institute everything that came into his head. He imposed obligatory military service for men over eighteen, declared to be public property any animals walking the streets after six in the evening, and made men who were overage wear red armbands. He sequestered Father Nicanor in the parish house under pain of execution and prohibited him from saying mass or ringing the bells unless it was for a Liberal victory. In order that no one would doubt the severity of his aims, he ordered a firing squad organized in the square and had it shoot at a scarecrow. At first no one took him seriously. They were, after all, schoolchildren playing at being grown-ups. But one night, when Arcadio went into Catarino’s store, the trumpeter in the group greeted him with a fanfare that made the customers laugh and Arcadio had him shot for disrespect for the authorities. People who protested were put on bread and water with their ankles in a set of stocks that he had set up in a schoolroom. “You murderer!” Úrsula would shout at him every time she learned of some new arbitrary act. “When Aureliano finds out he’s going to shoot you and I’ll be the first one to be glad.” But it was of no use. Arcadio continued tightening the tourniquet with unnecessary rigor until he became the cruelest ruler that Macondo had ever known. “Now let them suffer the difference,” Don Apolinar Moscote said on one occasion. “This is the Liberal paradise.” Arcadio found out about it. At the head of a patrol he assaulted the house, destroyed the furniture, flogged the daughters, and dragged out Don Apolinar Moscote. When Úrsula burst into the courtyard of headquarters, after having gone through the town shouting shame and brandishing with rage a pitch-covered whip, Arcadio himself was preparing to give the squad the command to fire.","Accadio responded to that advice in his own way. He tailored a military uniform with marshal's epaulets and fringes, modeled after the illustrations in Menkyadet's book, and strapped to his waist the gold-inlaid sword of the executed captain. He placed two cannons right at the village gate, dressed his former students—who had been driven mad by his fiery proclamations—in uniforms, and had them swagger around the village armed, giving strangers the impression that this was an impregnable military position. It was a double-edged game because it prevented the government from daring to attack the square for ten months, but it also meant that when the government did order an attack, the military used such overwhelming force that they crushed the resistance within half an hour. From the very first day of exercising his power, Accadio revealed himself to be an arrogant person. Every day, he would read orders until four in the afternoon to command and arrange everything according to his will. He enforced military conscription on those aged eighteen and above, declared the requisition of any animals still wandering the streets after six in the evening, and required elderly men to wear a red armband. Imprisoning Father Nicanor in the monastery with the threat of shooting him and forbidding him from performing mass and ringing the bells unless it was to celebrate the victory of the Liberal faction. To ensure that no one doubted the seriousness of his policies, he ordered a firing squad to practice shooting at a scarecrow in the square right in front of the public. At first, no one took it seriously. It was just the students playing at being adults. But one night, when Arcadio entered Catarino's restaurant, the trumpet player greeted him with a mocking fanfare that made the crowd burst into laughter, so he ordered the man to be shot for disrespecting authority. For those who dared to oppose him, he ordered them to be handcuffed and locked in a jail that was once a classroom, feeding them only bland bread and water. ""You are a murderer,"" Ursula scolded him whenever she learned of a new act of cruelty by her grandson. ""If Aureliano knew, he would kill you, and I would be the first in this village to feel satisfied."" But her scoldings were in vain. Arcadio continued to tighten the screws of his oppressive machine until he became the bloodiest authority Macondo had ever seen. ""Now we suffer from the struggle,"" Don Apolinar Moscote said on several occasions: ""This is the Paradise of the Liberals."" Arcadio knew. Leading a squad of soldiers, he broke into houses, smashed furniture, beat the daughters, and dragged Don Apolinar Moscote along. Just as Arcadio was about to personally order the firing squad to shoot Don Apolinar Moscote, Ursula, after angrily shouting and waving a tarred leather whip to part the crowd, made a commotion in the barracks yard: ""You scoundrel, have some respect!""",17.267,17.05,"Arcadio interpreted these words as it suited him. He fashioned a uniform for himself. He rummaged through Melquiades' books from cover to cover and acquired a jacket with braids and epaulettes, like a marshal's uniform. He secured the sword at his waist with gold-embroidered buckles he had stripped from the captain who was executed by firing squad. He positioned the cannons at the entrance of the village, outfitted his former students who had risen up with uniforms, and sent them out into the streets with fiery speeches. In this way, he wanted to create the impression among outsiders that the village was defended by invincible forces. This was a double-edged deception. Because the government did not dare to attack the village for ten months; and when they finally did, they attacked with such overwhelming force that the village's resistance crumbled within half an hour. Arcadio revealed his keen interest in proclamations from the very first day of his administration. He would announce everything that came to his mind through a proclamation, sometimes issuing four decrees in a single day. He mandated compulsory military service for those over eighteen, declared that animals wandering aimlessly after six in the evening would be considered public property, and required the elderly to wear a red armband. He had cornered Peder Nicanor, threatened him with torture, and forbidden him from holding services and ringing the bell unless it was for the victory of the Liberals. To ensure that no one doubted the decisiveness of his orders, he lined up a firing squad in the village square and had a scarecrow shot. At first, no one took him seriously. After all, they were all just children pretending to be important. But one night, Arcadio went to Catarino's shop. When the drummer saw him, he greeted him with a tremolo. The people there started to laugh. Arcadio, losing his temper, had the drummer shot for disrespecting the authorities. He also imprisoned those who opposed this by locking their ankles between two logs and giving them nothing but bread and water. When Ursula learned of his arbitrary actions, she would shout in his face, Murderer! When Aureliano hears about what you've done, he'll have you shot, and I'll be the first to cheer. But what was the use of her wishes? Arcadio increased the pressure more and more, squeezing the people tighter and tighter. In the end, he became the most ruthless ruler Macondo had ever seen. One day, Don Apolinar Moscote made a mistake, saying they should beat their heads against the wall to understand the difference. This is what they call the Liberal paradise, he said. These words reached Arcadio's ears. He led the patrols to raid Moscote's house, smashed his belongings, and had his daughters whipped. He dragged Don Apolinar Moscote outside. When Ursula heard what had happened, she went mad with rage. Grabbing the whip, she ran to the headquarters, shouting and cursing. As Ursula burst into the courtyard, Arcadio was about to give the order to fire.",13.172,12.883,"Arcadio gave a very personal interpretation to the recommendation. He invented a uniform with marshal's stripes and epaulets, inspired by the illustrations in one of Melquíades' books, and hung the saber with golden tassels of the executed captain at his waist. He placed the two artillery pieces at the entrance of the town, uniformed his former students, exacerbated by his incendiary proclamations, and let them wander armed through the streets to give outsiders an impression of invulnerability. It was a double-edged trick because the government did not dare attack the plaza for ten months, but when it did, it unleashed such a disproportionate force that it crushed the resistance in half an hour. From the first day of his mandate, Arcadio revealed his fondness for decrees. He read up to four daily to order and arrange everything that crossed his mind. He implemented mandatory military service from the age of eighteen, declared animals that roamed the streets after six in the evening to be of public utility, and imposed on adult men the obligation to wear a red armband. He confined Father Nicanor in the parish house under threat of execution and forbade him from saying mass or ringing the bells except to celebrate liberal victories. To ensure no one doubted the severity of his intentions, he ordered a firing squad to train in the public square by shooting at a scarecrow. At first, no one took him seriously. After all, they were just schoolboys playing at being grown-ups. But one night, when Arcadio entered Catarino's store, the band's trumpeter greeted him with a fanfare that provoked the laughter of the customers, and Arcadio had him executed for disrespecting authority. Those who protested were put on bread and water with their ankles in a stock he installed in a room of the school. ""You are a murderer!"" Úrsula would shout at him every time she learned of a new atrocity. ""When Aureliano finds out, he will have you executed, and I will be the first to rejoice."" But it was all in vain. Arcadio continued tightening the screws of unnecessary rigor until he became the cruelest ruler Macondo had ever known. ""Now suffer the difference,"" said Don Apolinar Moscote on one occasion. ""This is the liberal paradise."" Arcadio found out. Leading a patrol, he stormed the house, destroyed the furniture, beat the daughters, and dragged Don Apolinar Moscote away. When Úrsula burst into the barracks courtyard, after crossing the town clamoring with shame and brandishing a tarred whip in rage, Arcadio himself was about to give the order to fire to the firing squad.",40.427,40.301
215,"“I dare you to, bastard!” Úrsula shouted.","Just as Arcadio was about to personally order the firing squad to shoot Don Apolinar Moscote, Ursula, after angrily shouting and waving a tarred leather whip to part the crowd, made a commotion in the barracks yard: ""You scoundrel, have some respect!""",2.872,1.031,"""Hit me if you dare, you son of a bitch!"" he shouted. Without giving Arcadio a chance to open his mouth, she shouted, ""Alright, you murderer!"" and brought down the whip.",4.579,2.331,"—Dare, bastard! —shouted Úrsula.",21.344,15.686
216,"Before Arcadio had time to read she let go with the first blow of the lash. “I dare you to, murderer!” she shouted. “And kill me too, son of an evil mother. That way I won’t have the eyes to weep for the shame of having raised a monster.” Whipping him without mercy, she chased him to the back of the courtyard, where Arcadio curled up like a snail in its shell. Don Apolinar Moscote was unconscious, tied to the post where previously they had had the scarecrow that had been cut to pieces by shots fired in fun. The boys in the squad scattered, fearful that Úrsula would go after them too. But she did not even look at them. She left Arcadio with his uniform torn, roaring with pain and rage, and she untied Don Apolinar Moscote and took him home. Before leaving the headquarters she released the prisoners from the stocks.","Before Arcadio could react, she lashed him with the whip, ""You murderer. You are too insolent,"" she screamed. ""You might as well kill me too, you scoundrel. That way, I won't have to cry in shame for having raised a traitor."" She continued to whip him mercilessly, chasing him to the end of the yard, making him squirm like a snail. Don Apolinar Moscote stood petrified, tied to the post where the scarecrows had previously been blown to bits by the firing squad's bullets. The boys of the execution squad scattered because they were afraid Ursula would beat them to death. But she didn't even look at them. Leaving Arcadio in his disheveled, ragged military uniform, groaning in pain and anger, she went to untie Don Apolinar Moscote and led him home. Before leaving the barracks, she also released the political prisoners.",19.432,18.789,"Without giving Arcadio a chance to open his mouth, she shouted, ""Alright, you murderer!"" and brought down the whip. ""Kill me too, son of a devilish mother."" ""Kill me so I don't have to shed tears for raising a monster."" Ursula was bringing down the whip mercilessly. Whipping and whipping, she chased Arcadio to the back yard. Arcadio shrank into a corner like a snail retreating into its shell. Don Apolinar Moscote, who was tied to the place where the scarecrow they had previously shot and shattered for fun stood, had passed out. The children in the firing squad scattered like chicks out of fear that Ursula might beat them too. However, Ursula didn't even look at them. She left Arcadio, whose collar and cuffs were torn, screaming in pain and anger; she went and untied Don Apolinar Moscote and took him home. Before leaving the headquarters, she also freed the prisoners who were tied to the log.",23.872,23.392,"Before Arcadio had time to react, she delivered the first lash. ""Dare, murderer,"" she shouted. ""And kill me too, you son of a bad mother. That way I won't have eyes to cry over the shame of having raised a monster."" Whipping him mercilessly, she chased him to the back of the yard, where Arcadio curled up like a snail. Don Apolinar Moscote was unconscious, tied to the post where they had previously kept the scarecrow, torn apart by training shots. The boys of the platoon scattered, fearful that Úrsula would end up venting her anger on them. But she didn't even look at them. She left Arcadio with his uniform dragging, roaring in pain and rage, and untied Don Apolinar Moscote to take him to his house. Before leaving the barracks, she released the prisoners from the stocks.",46.116,45.803
217,"From that time on she was the one who ruled in the town. She reestablished Sunday masses, suspended the use of red armbands, and abrogated the harebrained decrees. But in spite of her strength, she still wept over her unfortunate fate. She felt so much alone that she sought the useless company of her husband, who had been forgotten under the chestnut tree. “Look what we’ve come to,” she would tell him as the June rains threatened to knock the shelter down. “Look at the empty house, our children scattered all over the world, and the two of us alone again, the same as in the beginning.” José Arcadio Buendía, sunk in an abyss of unawareness, was deaf to her lamentations. At the beginning of his madness he would announce his daily needs with urgent Latin phrases. In fleeting clear spells of lucidity, when Amaranta would bring him his meals he would tell her what bothered him most and would accept her sucking glasses and mustard plasters in a docile way. But at the time when Úrsula went to lament by his side he had lost all contact with reality. She would bathe him bit by bit as he sat on his stool while she gave him news of the family. “Aureliano went to war more than four months ago and we haven’t heard anything about him,” she would say, scrubbing his back with a soaped brush. “José Arcadio came back a big man, taller than you, and all covered with needle-work, but he only brought shame to our house.” She thought she noticed, however, that her husband would grow sad with the bad news. Then she decided to lie to him. ‘Rou won’t believe what I’m going to tell you,” she said as she threw ashes over his excrement in order to pick it up with the shovel. “God willed that José Arcadio and Rebeca should get married, and now they’re very happy.” She got to be so sincere in the deception that she ended up by consoling herself with her own lies. “Arcadio is a serious man now,” she said, “and very brave, and a fine-looking young man with his uniform and saber.” It was like speaking to a dead man, for José Arcadio Buendía was already beyond the reach of any worry. But she insisted. He seemed so peaceful, so indifferent to everything that she decided to release him. He did not even move from his stool. He stayed there, exposed to the sun and the rain, as if the thongs were unnecessary, for a dominion superior to any visible bond kept him tied to the trunk of the chestnut tree. Toward August, when winter began to last forever, Úrsula was finally able to give him a piece of news that sounded like the truth.","Since that time, she has been the ruler of Macondo village. She restored the Sunday mass, abolished the wearing of red armbands, and disbanded the violent patrols. But during her moments of rest, she still lamented her unfortunate fate. She felt so lonely that she had to seek out her forgotten husband under the chestnut tree. ""My dear, look at our plight, isn't it tragic,"" she said to him as the July downpours threatened to topple the palm-leaf hut. ""Look at the deserted house, our children scattered across the world, and once again it's just the two of us together like in the beginning."" José Arcadio Buendía was perpetually lost in a deep unconscious state, unresponsive as stone to her laments. In the early days of his madness, he would use incomprehensible Latin phrases to communicate his daily essential needs to everyone. During brief moments of lucidity, when Amaranta brought him food, he would inform her of his greatest discomforts, and he obediently took mustard seed medicine and allowed her to perform bloodletting. But during the period when Úrsula lamented beside him, he had completely lost the ability to interact with reality. He sat in the chair while she bathed him, one part at a time. As she bathed him, she told him stories about the household. ""Aureliano has been at war for four months now, and we still haven't received any news about him,"" she said while scrubbing him with soap. ""José Arcadio has returned; he is a real man, taller than even you, and covered in tattoos."" ""He came back only to bring shame to our family."" However, she noticed that her husband seemed saddened by the bad news. So she changed her tone and began to lie to him, ""Don't believe what I just said,"" she said, while sprinkling ashes over his excrement to scoop it up. ""God wants José Arcadio and Rebeca to marry, and now they are living very happily."" Then she became so sincere in her lies that she herself felt comforted by her own deceptions. ""Arcadio has become a respectable young man,"" she said, ""very brave and very handsome in his uniform with a sword at his side."" All these words were spoken as if to a dead person, for José Arcadio Buendía was serene, very serene, beyond all worries and concerns. But she did not stop. She found him so gentle, so much like everyone else, that she untied him. He remained in the chair, as if the restraints were no longer necessary, because it seemed that a force stronger than any visible bonds had tied him to the chestnut tree. Around August, when the winter began to drag on, Úrsula was able to give him some news:",17.917,17.672,"From that day on, Ursula was the one who governed the village. She reinstated the Sunday masses, opposed the wearing of red armbands, and repealed the absurd decrees. Despite all her strength, she couldn't help but cry over the misfortunes that befell her. She felt such great loneliness that she even sought solace in chatting with her husband forgotten under the chestnut tree. On days when the June rains poured as if they would destroy the arbor, she would say, Look at what we've come to. Look at this house, it's deserted. Our children have scattered in all directions. It's just you and me left alone. Just like in the beginning. Jose Arcadio Buendia, who had already fallen into the abyss of unconsciousness, couldn't even hear what his wife was saying. In the early days of his madness, he would express his daily needs in Latin words. When the clouds enveloping his mind parted, even if only for short periods, he spoke sensibly, and when Amaranta brought his meal, he would tell her what was bothering him and did not object to her applying a mustard plaster or using a cupping glass on his back. When Ama Ursula started to lament to him, Jose Arcadio Buendia had already severed all ties with reality. Ursula would slowly clean him without moving him from his place, while also informing him about what was happening within the family. As she scrubbed her husband's back with soap, she would say, ""It's been four months since Aureliano went to war, and we haven't heard a word from him.""""Jose Arcadio has grown into a big man and returned.""""Even you would look small next to him.""""He has tattoos all over his body.""""Unfortunately, he does nothing but bring us disgrace. "" Upon hearing the bad news, Ursula felt as if her husband was saddened. So she decided to lie to him. While sprinkling ash over her husband's filth before scooping it up with a shovel, she said, ""Look, I'll tell you something you won't believe.""""God wanted Jose Arcadio and Rebeca to get married, and now there's no end to their happiness."" He narrated these deceptions so sincerely that in the end, he began to console himself with his own lies. Arcadio has become a dignified man now, he would say. Brave, oh so brave. Handsome, oh so handsome. You should see him when he puts on his uniform and straps on his sword. Yet, talking to him was no different than talking to a dead man, indistinguishable. Because Jose Arcadio Buendia seemed so harmless, so withdrawn from the world, that Ursula decided to unravel him. After being unraveled, Jose Arcadio Buendia did not move from his place. As if bound to the trunk of the chestnut tree by invisible bonds stronger than any rope, he sat there, come rain or shine. Towards August, when it seemed like winter would never end, Ursula was able to give him news that resembled reality:",15.378,15.147,"From then on, it was she who ruled the town. She reinstated Sunday mass, suspended the use of red armbands, and disqualified the arbitrary edicts. But despite her strength, she continued to mourn the misfortune of her fate. She felt so alone that she sought the useless company of her husband forgotten under the chestnut tree. ""Look at what we've come to,"" she would say, while the June rains threatened to bring down the palm shelter. ""Look at the empty house, our children scattered around the world, and the two of us alone again like at the beginning."" José Arcadio Buendía, sunk in an abyss of unconsciousness, was deaf to her laments. At the onset of his madness, he would announce his daily urgencies with pressing Latin phrases. In fleeting moments of lucidity, when Amaranta brought him food, he would communicate his most bothersome grievances and would submit docilely to her cupping and mustard plasters. But by the time Úrsula went to lament by his side, he had lost all contact with reality. She would bathe him in parts while he sat on the little stool, giving him news of the family. ""Aureliano has gone to war, it's been more than four months now, and we haven't heard from him,"" she would say, scrubbing his back with a soapy sponge. ""José Arcadio came back, a big man taller than you and all embroidered in cross-stitch, but he only came to bring shame to our house."" She thought she observed, however, that her husband grew sad with the bad news. So she opted to lie to him.

219,"Amaranta and Pietro Crespi had, in fact, deepened their friendship, protected by Úrsula, who this time did not think it necessary to watch over the visits. It was a twilight engagement. The Italian would arrive at dusk, with a gardenia in his buttonhole, and he would translate Petrarch’s sonnets for Amaranta. They would sit on the porch, suffocated by the oregano and the roses, he reading and she sewing lace cuffs, indifferent to the shocks and bad news of the war, until the mosquitoes made them take refuge in the parlor. Amaranta’s sensibility, her discreet but enveloping tenderness had been wearing an invisible web about her fiancé, which he had to push aside materially with his pale and ringless fingers in order to leave the house at eight o’clock. They had put together a delightful album with the postcards that Pietro Crespi received from Italy. They were pictures of lovers in lonely parks, with vignettes of hearts pierced with arrows and golden ribbons held by doves. “I’ve been to this park in Florence,” Pietro Crespi would say, going through the cards. “A person can put out his hand and the birds will come to feed.” Sometimes, over a watercolor of Venice, nostalgia would transform the smell of mud and putrefying shellfish of the canals into the warm aroma of flowers. Amaranta would sigh, laugh, and dream of a second homeland of handsome men and beautiful women who spoke a childlike language with ancient cities of whose past grandeur only the cats among the rubble remained. After crossing the ocean in search of it, after having confused passion with the vehement stroking of Rebeca, Pietro Crespi had found love. Happiness was accompanied by prosperity. His warehouse at that time occupied almost a whole block and it was a hothouse of fantasy, with reproductions of the bell tower of Florence that told time with a concert of carillons, and music boxes from Sorrento and compacts from China that sang five-note melodies when they were opened, and all the musical instruments imaginable and all the mechanical toys that could be conceived. Bruno Crespi, his younger brother, was in charge of the store because Pietro Crespi barely had enough time to take care of the music school. Thanks to him the Street of the Turks, with its dazzling display of knickknacks, became a melodic oasis where one could forget Arcadio’s arbitrary acts and the distant nightmare of the war. When Úrsula ordered the revival of Sunday mass, Pietro Crespi donated a German harmonium to the church, organized a children’s chorus, and prepared a Gregorian repertory that added a note of splendor to Father Nicanor’s quiet rite. No one doubted that he would make Amaranta a fortunate mate. Not pushing their feelings, letting themselves be borne along by the natural flow of their hearth they reached a point where all that was left to do was set a wedding date. They did not encounter any obstacles. Úrsula accused herself inwardly of having twisted Rebecca’s destiny with repeated postponements and she was not about to add more remorse. The rigor of the mourning for Remedios had been relegated to the background by the mortifications of the war, Aureliano’s absence, Arcadio’s brutality, and the expulsion of José Arcadio and Rebeca. With the imminence of the wedding, Pietro Crespi had hinted that Aureliano José, in whom he had stirred up a love that was almost filial, would be considered their oldest child. Everything made Amaranta think that she was heading toward a smooth happiness. But unlike Rebeca, she did not reveal the slightest anxiety. With the same patience with which she dyed tablecloths, sewed lace masterpieces, and embroidered needlepoint peacocks, she waited for Pietro Crespi to be unable to bear the urges of his heart and more. Her day came with the ill-fated October rains. Pietro Crespi took the sewing basket from her lap and he told her, “We’ll get married next month.” Amaranta did not tremble at the contact with his icy hands. She withdrew hers like a timid little animal and went back to her work.","Indeed, Amaranta and Pietro Crespi had a deep friendship. Both were lovingly cared for by Úrsula. This time she felt it was unnecessary to sit and watch over the young couple as they conversed. It was a love in the twilight. The Italian man, with an ivory white gardenia flower standing out on his lapel, would come to the house in the afternoon and translate Petrarch's sonnets into Spanish for Amaranta. The two of them would sit in the hallway, thick with the scent of roses and begonias. He read poetry, she wove lace, unaware of the shocking events and bad news from the front, until the mosquitoes bit them so fiercely that they had to run into the living room. Amaranta's gentle affection, with her subtly tender words, was like an invisible spider web that gradually enveloped her beloved, so much so that by eight o'clock in the evening, he had to use his pale, ringed fingers to untangle himself and go home. The two of them had made a wonderful album with postcards sent from Italy to Pietro Crespi. These were photographs of lovers in secluded gardens, decorated with drawings of hearts pierced by arrows and golden ribbons entwining pairs of doves. ""I know this park in Florence,"" he said, as he flipped through the postcards."" As soon as one extends a hand, the birds immediately swoop down to eat. ""Sometimes, in front of a nursery, nostalgia transformed the smell of mud and rotten fish in the canals of Venice into a gentle floral fragrance. Amaranta sighed, laughed, and dreamed of a second homeland filled with magnificent young men and women speaking the language of children, in ancient cities whose former glory now only lingered in the form of cats prowling among the ruins. After crossing the vast ocean in his quest, after mistaking it for the passionate moments with Rebeca, Pietro Crespi had now found love. Joy brought with it wealth, and now his shop occupied nearly an entire block. It was a gigantic, magical display case that restored Florentine alarm clocks, which, each time they struck the hour, would ring out a chorus of bells, sold Chinese powder boxes that delighted the fingers when opened, and offered every imaginable musical instrument and wind-up toy one could dream of. Bruno Crespi, his youngest son, sat watching over the store because he was not yet capable of handling the music class. Thanks to Pietro Crespi, the Turkish street quickly transformed the splendid display of precious goods into a serene and melodious place to forget the brutal actions of Arcadio and the perpetual gloom of war. When Úrsula decided to restore the Sunday mass ceremonies, Pietro Crespi donated a children's organ to the church and prepared a song that would brighten Father Nicanor's somber mass. No one doubted anymore that Amaranta would be a happy wife. Allowing the feelings of the couple to naturally blossom from their hearts, without any urging, they reached the peak of love with only the wedding date left to be set. They did not encounter any obstacles. Úrsula silently blamed herself for the indefinite postponement of the wedding, which had altered Rebeca's fate. To this day, she had not yet overcome the shame. The serious mourning for Remedios had to take a back seat due to the deaths caused by the war, Aureliano's absence, Arcadio's brutality, and the expulsion of José Arcadio and Rebeca from the house. Before the upcoming wedding, it was Pietro Crespi who earnestly requested to consider Aureliano José, whom he cherished like his own child, as his firstborn. Everything made everyone think that Amaranta was heading towards an easy happiness. But, unlike Rebeca, she did not reveal the desires of her heart. With the same feeling she had while weaving tablecloths, lace trims, and embroidering peacocks on the cross, she waited for Pietro Crespi, unable to suppress the urgent demands of his heart. His fateful hour came during the unfortunate rainy days of October. Pietro Crespi removed her hand from the embroidery frame and held her hand in his for a long time. ""I can't wait any longer,"" he told her. ""Let's get married next month."" Amaranta did not tremble when her hand touched his cold hand. She slowly withdrew her hand from his. Like an evasive animal, she resumed her work.",17.698,17.55,"Indeed, Amaranta and Pietro Crespi had advanced their friendship. Ursula, who no longer saw it necessary to watch over them, also supported this friendship. Everyone considered them as engaged. The Italian, arriving at dusk with a daffodil pinned to his jacket collar, would translate Petrarch's poems for Amaranta. They would sit on the terrace, breathless from the scent of hydrangeas and roses, -without caring whether there was a war or bad news- one reading poetry, the other sewing lace cuffs, until the mosquitoes made the terrace uninhabitable and drove them inside. Amaranta's sensible and modest demeanor, her measured but sincere closeness, had woven an invisible net around her fiancé. When Pietro Crespi reluctantly left the house at eight in the evening, it was as if he was pushing aside this net with his ringless fingers to make his way. They had placed the postcards sent to Pietro Crespi from Italy into an album. The cards had pictures of lovers holding hands in deserted parks. In the corners, there were hearts pierced by arrows and golden ribbons in the beaks of doves. While looking at the cards, Pietro Crespi would say, I went to this park when I was in Florence. In that park, you take some feed in your hand, open your palm, and feed the birds. Sometimes, while looking at a watercolor painting of Venice, homesickness would turn the slimy mud of the canals, the acrid smell of sticky jellyfish, into the scent of flowers in the Italian's nose. Amaranta would sigh, laugh, and dream of a second homeland filled with old cities where handsome men and beautiful women speaking a childlike language lived, and where only cats roamed the garbage dumps of its former glory. After crossing oceans to find this second homeland and confusing passion with love through Rebeca's fiery embraces, Pietro Crespi had found true love. Alongside happiness, he had also attained wealth. At that time, his shop and warehouse extended from one street to the next. From a model of the bell tower in Florence, which rang tiny bells every hour, to musical boxes from Sorrento, to cabinets from China that played music when opened, the shop had everything imaginable, from every kind of musical instrument to every conceivable type of mechanical toy. Since Pietro Crespi could only spare time to give music lessons, the shop was run by his brother, Bruna Crespi. Thanks to Pietro Crespi, Turkish Street turned into an oasis of melodies that made people forget Arcadio's whimsical behavior and the nightmare of the distant war. When Ursula resumed the Sunday services, Pietro Crespi donated a small German organ to the church. He formed a children's choir and prepared a Gregorian repertoire that added grandeur to Father Nicanor's silent mass. There was no doubt that Amaranta was his perfect match. Without forcing their emotions, letting themselves flow naturally, they reached a point where there was nothing left to do but set the wedding date. There were no obstacles in their way. Ursula, feeling guilty for having altered Rebeca's fate by continually postponing her marriage, was now careful to avoid creating new sorrows. The progression of the war, Aureliano's absence, Arcadio's cruelty, and the expulsion of Jose Arcadio and Rebeca from the house had pushed the mourning for Remedios into the background. In those days leading up to the wedding, Pietro Crespi had begun to accept Aureliano Jose, who was as attached to him as a son, as his first child. All the events around her seemed to herald a carefree, perfect happiness for Amaranta. However, unlike Rebeca, Amaranta showed no signs of excitement. Just as she patiently dyes the tablecloths, quietly knits the unique lace, and embroiders peacocks from needlework, she was eagerly awaiting the moment when Pietro Crespi could no longer ignore the voice of his heart. The day she had been waiting for came with the autumn rains at the beginning of October. Pietro Crespi took the sewing box from her lap and said, ""We are getting married next month."" When his ice-cold hands touched hers, Amaranta did not shiver at all. Like a docile animal, she withdrew her hands and continued her work.",18.74,18.59,"Amaranta and Pietro Crespi, indeed, had deepened their friendship, sheltered by Úrsula's trust, who this time did not find it necessary to monitor the visits. It was a twilight courtship. The Italian would arrive at dusk, with a gardenia in his buttonhole, and translate Petrarch's sonnets for Amaranta. They would stay in the corridor suffocated by oregano and roses, he reading and she weaving bobbin lace, indifferent to the shocks and bad news of the war, until the mosquitoes forced them to take refuge in the living room. Amaranta's sensitivity, her discreet but enveloping tenderness, had woven around the suitor an invisible web that he had to physically push aside with his pale, ringless fingers to leave the house at eight. They had made a precious album with the postcards that Pietro Crespi received from Italy. They were images of lovers in solitary parks, with vignettes of pierced hearts and golden ribbons held by doves. ""I know this park in Florence,"" Pietro Crespi would say, going through the postcards. "" One extends a hand and the birds come down to eat.

After crossing the ocean in search of it, after confusing it with passion in Rebeca's vehement caresses, Pietro Crespi had found love. Happiness brought prosperity with it. His store then occupied almost an entire block, and it was a fantasy greenhouse, with reproductions of the Florence bell tower that chimed the hour with a carillon concert, and musical boxes from Sorrento, and Chinese powder boxes that sang five-note tunes when opened, and all the musical instruments one could imagine and all the mechanical devices one could conceive. Bruno Crespi, his younger brother, was in charge of the store, because he couldn't keep up with the demands of the music school. Thanks to him, the Street of the Turks, with its dazzling display of trinkets, became a melodic haven to forget Arcadio's arbitrariness and the distant nightmare of the war. When Úrsula arranged for the resumption of Sunday mass, Pietro Crespi donated a German harmonium to the church, organized a children's choir, and prepared a Gregorian repertoire that added a splendid note to Father Nicanor's taciturn ritual. No one doubted that he would make Amaranta a happy wife. Without rushing their feelings, letting themselves be carried by the natural flow of the heart, they reached a point where all that was left was to set the wedding date. They would find no obstacles. Úrsula privately blamed herself for having twisted Rebeca's fate with repeated postponements, and she was not willing to accumulate more remorse. The rigor of mourning for Remedios' death had been relegated to a secondary place by the mortification of the war, Aureliano's absence, Arcadio's brutality, and the expulsion of José Arcadio and Rebeca. In the face of the imminent wedding, Pietro Crespi himself had suggested that Aureliano José, in whom he had fostered an almost paternal affection, be considered his eldest son. Everything suggested that Amaranta was heading towards an untroubled happiness. But unlike Rebeca, she did not show the slightest anxiety. With the same patience with which she adorned tablecloths and wove exquisite trimmings and embroidered peacocks in cross-stitch, she waited for Pietro Crespi to no longer bear the urgencies of the heart. Her moment came with the ominous rains of October. Pietro Crespi took the embroidery basket from her lap and clasped her hand between his. ""I can't bear this wait any longer,"" he said to her. ""We'll get married next month. ""Amaranta did not tremble at the touch of his icy hands. She withdrew hers, like a slippery little animal, and returned to her work.",48.002,47.931
220,"“Don’t be simple, Crespi.” She smiled. “I wouldn’t marry you even if I were dead.”","- Stop being so naive, Crespi, - she laughed. - Even if I die, I won't marry you.",14.222,9.849,"""Simplification,"" Crespi said, smiling. ""I wouldn't marry you even if I died.""",23.843,19.748,"—Don't be naive, Crespi —she smiled—, not even dead would I marry you.",10.952,6.198
221,"Pietro Crespi lost control of himself. He wept shamelessly, almost breaking his fingers with desperation, but he could not break her down. “Don’t waste your time,” was all that Amaranta said. “If you really love me so much, don’t set foot in this house again.” Úrsula thought she would go mad with shame. Pietro Crespi exhausted all manner of pleas. He went through incredible extremes of humiliation. He wept one whole afternoon in Úrsula’s lap and she would have sold her soul in order to comfort him. On rainy nights he could be seen prowling about the house with an umbrella, waiting for a light in Amaranta’s bedroom. He was never better dressed than at that time. His august head of a tormented emperor had acquired a strange air of grandeur. He begged Amaranta’s friends, the ones who sewed with her on the porch, to try to persuade her. He neglected his business. He would spend the day in the rear of the store writing wild notes, which he would send to Amaranta with flower petals and dried butterflies, and which she would return unopened. He would shut himself up for hours on end to play the zither. One night he sang. Macondo woke up in a kind of angelic stupor that was caused by a zither that deserved more than this world and a voice that led one to believe that no other person on earth could feel such love. Pietro Crespi then saw the lights go on in every window in town except that of Amaranta. On November second, All Souls’ Day, his brother opened the store and found all the lamps lighted, all the music boxes opened, and all the docks striking an interminable hour, and in the midst of that mad concert he found Pietro Crespi at the desk in the rear with his wrists cut by a razor and his hands thrust into a basin of benzoin.","Piêtrô Crêspi could not control himself. He cried uncontrollably, no longer feeling any shame, nearly crushing his fingers out of frustration. But he still could not sway her. ""Don't waste any more time hesitating,"" that was all Amaranta could say. ""If you truly love me deeply, then please do not come to this house anymore."" Ursula felt as if she were going mad with shame. Piêtrô Crêspi used all his skills to plead, lowering himself to unimaginable levels. He cried like a child on Ursula's chest all night, who might have had to sell her soul to comfort him. On rainy nights, people would find him wandering around the house with a silk umbrella, hoping to catch a glimpse of the light in Amaranta's room. He had never dressed as elegantly as he did then. His magnificent hair, like that of an emperor after a storm of emotions, had taken on a strange appearance. He intercepted Amaranta's friends, the girls who usually came to embroider on the porch, to ask them to persuade Amaranta. He no longer had the heart to take care of the shop. All day long, he stayed at home writing tedious letters to send to Amaranta along with dried flowers and butterflies. But she returned them unopened. Shutting himself in his room, he sat for days on end playing the lute. One night, he sang. Macondo awoke in a special kind of astonishment, feeling chosen by the gods, as the sound of the lute resonated mournfully, not from this world, accompanied by a voice filled with such love that it seemed impossible to exist on this earth. It was then that Pietro Crespi saw light coming from the windows of every house in the village except Amaranta's room. On November second, All Souls' Day, his younger brother opened the shop and found all the lights on, all the music boxes open, all the clocks stopped at an eternal hour, and amidst this chaotic scene, he saw Pietro Crespi sitting at the writing table in the back room with his fingers cut and soaked in a basin of cochineal dye.",13.369,13.019,"Pietro Crespi could no longer hold himself back. Without any shame, he was sobbing uncontrollably, rubbing his hands in despair as if he would break his fingers. But he couldn't soften Amaranta. -Don't waste your time. If you really love me, you will never set foot in this house again, she said, and no other words came out of the girl's mouth. Ursula was dying of shame. Pietro Crespi did not tire of begging and pleading. He was willing to endure all kinds of disgrace and humiliation. He spent an entire day with his head resting on Ursula's lap, crying. Ursula was ready to give her life if it would console him. On rainy nights, Crespi would open his umbrella and circle around the house to see the light in Amaranta's room. He had never dressed as well as he did in those days. He held his head, reminiscent of an emperor who had lost his throne and crown, with a peculiar dignity and nobility. He went to the friends who sat on the terrace with Amaranta, doing embroidery. He left no stone unturned to persuade Amaranta. He neglected his work. He would lock himself in the room at the back of the shop from morning till night, writing passionate letters and sending them to Amaranta with dried flower petals and butterflies. But Amaranta would send the letters back unopened. Crespi would retreat to a corner and play the lute for hours. One night, he even sang. The divine melodies from the strings of the lute, resembling a qanun, and the soulful voice that could serve as proof that no one in the world could love this much, awakened the entire Macondo. All the lights in the village were lit one by one, except for Amaranta's. On the second of November, All Saints' Day, Crespi's brother opened the shop. All the lights were on. All the musical boxes were open. All the clocks were striking an endless hour.

On rainy nights he was seen lurking around the house with a silk umbrella, trying to catch a glimpse of light in Amaranta's bedroom. He was never better dressed than during that time. His august head of a tormented emperor acquired a strange air of grandeur. He pestered Amaranta's friends, those who came to embroider in the corridor, to try to persuade her. He neglected his business. He spent the day in the back room, writing insane notes, which he sent to Amaranta with membranes of petals and dried butterflies, and which she returned unopened. He locked himself up for hours and hours to play the zither. One night he sang. Macondo awoke in a kind of stupor, angelized by a zither that did not deserve to be of this world and a voice that one could not conceive there could be another on earth with so much love.

Úrsula stood up to him. “In a way that neither you nor I can understand, that man was a saint,” she said. “So I am going to bury him, against your wishes, beside Melquíades’ grave.” She did it with the support of the whole town and with a magnificent funeral. Amaranta did not leave her bedroom. From her bed she heard Úrsula’s weeping, the steps and whispers of the multitude that invaded the house, the wailing of the mourners, and then a deep silence that smelled of trampled flowers. For a long time she kept on smelling Pietro Crespi’s lavender breath at dusk, but she had the strength not to succumb to delirium. Úrsula abandoned her. She did not even raise her eyes to pity her on the afternoon when Amaranta went into the kitchen and put her hand into the coals of the stove until it hurt her so much that she felt no more pain but instead smelled the pestilence of her own singed flesh. It was a stupid cure for her remorse. For several days she went about the house with her hand in a pot of egg whites, and when the burns healed it appeared as if the whites had also scarred over the sores on her heart. The only external trace that the tragedy left was the bandage of black gauze that she put on her burned hand and that she wore until her death.","Ursula decided to keep her brother's body in her house for the funeral rites. Father Nicanor refused to perform the baptism and bury him in the holy ground. Ursula confronted the priest. ""Neither you nor I can understand that this man is a saint,"" she said. "" Against your wishes, I will bury him right next to Melquiades' grave. "" She did exactly what she said. With the support of the entire village, she organized a solemn funeral for him. Amaranta did not step out of her room. Lying on her bed, she clearly heard Ursula's crying, the footsteps and the sobbing murmurs of the crowd, the eerie wails of the hired mourners echoing into the house, and then the quiet, solemn scene laden with the scent of trampled flowers. Ursula abandoned her. That very afternoon, Amaranta went into the kitchen, thrust her hand into the glowing embers, and left it there until she no longer felt pain but only the acrid smell of her own flesh burning, yet her mother did not even lift her eyes to pity her daughter. It was an effective remedy for the torment of remorse. For several days, with her burnt hand soaking in a bowl of egg whites, she walked around the house, and as the egg whites healed the burns, it seemed they also healed the burns in her heart.

Therefore, whether you like it or not, I will bury him next to Melquiades. And she did; with the support of the entire village and a grand funeral ceremony. Amaranta did not leave her bedroom. From where she lay, she could hear Ursula crying, the footsteps and whispers of the crowd filling the house, and the lamentations of the mourners. Then a silence began that smelled of crushed flowers. For a long time, as evening fell, Amaranta continued to smell the lavender scent of Pietro Crespi. But she was strong enough not to lose herself. Ursula had left her to her own devices and had stopped caring. Even when one afternoon, Amaranta went to the kitchen, plunged her hand into the coals in the stove, and burned her hand until she felt a pain beyond the smell of her burning flesh, Ursula did not turn her head to look. Remorse could not be alleviated this way. For a few days, Amaranta walked around the house with her hand wrapped in an egg white poultice. It was as if the egg white had seared not only the burn on her hand but also the wounds in her heart.

223,"Arcadio gave a rare display of generosity by decreeing official mourning for Pietro Crespi. Úrsula interpreted it as the return of the strayed lamb. But she was mistaken. She had lost Arcadio, not when he had put on his military uniform, but from the beginning. She thought she had raised him as a son, as she had raised Rebeca, with no privileges or discrimination. Nevertheless, Arcadio was a solitary and frightened child during the insomnia plague, in the midst of Úrsula’s utilitarian fervor, during the delirium of José Arcadio Buendía, the hermetism of Aureliano, and the mortal rivalry between Amaranta and Rebeca. Aureliano had taught him to read and write, thinking about other things, as he would have done with a stranger. He gave him his clothing so that Visitación could take it in when it was ready to be thrown away. Arcadio suffered from shoes that were too large, from his patched pants, from his female buttocks. He never succeeded in communicating with anyone better than he did with Visitación and Cataure in their language. Melquíades was the only one who really was concerned with him as he made him listen to his incomprehensible texts and gave him lessons in the art of daguerreotype.

However, Arcadio was a lonely and frightened child during the time of the insomnia plague, in the circumstances where Úrsula was busy getting rich, José Arcadio Buendía was insane, Aureliano was taciturn, and Amaranta and Rebeca were hostile to each other. Aureliano taught him to read and write, but his mind was elsewhere, as if he was turning him into a stranger. He gave him clothes that were about to tear for Visitación to mend to fit. Arcadio suffered with shoes that were too big, with mended pants, and with his womanly hips. He never confided in anyone except Visitación and Cataure in their language. In fact, Melquíades was the only one who cared about him. He recited incomprehensible elegies to him and explained the art of photography to him. No one knew how he cried silently over Melquíades' death and tried to revive him by studying his writings without success.

She thought she had raised Arcadio just as she had raised Rebeca, without any difference, treating him no differently than her own children. However, during the insomnia plague, amidst Ursula's efforts to repair the house, when Jose Arcadio Buendia lost his mind, during Aureliano's days of seclusion, and throughout the deadly feud between Amaranta and Rebeca, Arcadio had always lived a lonely and timid childhood. Indeed, Aureliano had taught him to read and write. But he did so as if teaching a stranger, without genuine interest, his mind always elsewhere. He also gave his clothes that had become unwearable to Arcadio, and Visitacion would alter and shorten them to fit the child.

He felt his blood pulsing through his veins, his misfortune beating erratically, and his hand, with a lifeline cut short by death on the thumb mound, was damp with sweat. Thus, he immediately understood that this woman was not the one he had been waiting for, because she did not emit the expected burnt smell but rather the scent of brigantine, because she had wrinkled breasts, a firm and round navel like a grape seed, and a body trembling with the fear of someone inexperienced in life. She was a virgin and had an almost unbelievable name: Santa Sofía de la Piedad. Pilar Ternera paid her fifty pesos, half of the money she had saved all her life, to do what she was doing.

He felt the veins' texture, the pulse of his misfortune, and felt the moist palm with the lifeline cut at the base of the thumb by the claw of death. Then he understood that this was not the woman he was waiting for, because she did not smell of smoke but of little flower pomade, and she had inflated and blind breasts with male nipples, and a stone-like and round sex like a nut, and the chaotic tenderness of exalted inexperience. She was a virgin and had the unbelievable name of Santa Sofía de la Piedad. Pilar Ternera had paid her fifty pesos, half of her lifetime savings, to do what she was doing. Arcadio had seen her many times, tending her parents' small grocery store, and had never noticed her, because she had the rare virtue of not fully existing except at the opportune moment. But from that day on, she curled up like a cat in the warmth of his armpit. She would go to the school at siesta time, with her parents' consent, to whom Pilar Ternera had paid the other half of her savings. Later, when the government troops evicted them from the premises, they made love among the tins of lard and sacks of corn in the back room. By the time Arcadio was appointed civil and military chief, they had a daughter.",55.318,55.211
228,"The only relatives who knew about it were José Arcadio and Rebeca, with whom Arcadio maintained close relations at that time, based not so much on kinship as on complicity. José Arcadio had put his neck into the marital yoke. Rebeca’s firm character, the voracity of her stomach, her tenacious ambition absorbed the tremendous energy of her husband, who had been changed from a lazy, woman-chasing man into an enormous work animal. They kept a clean and neat house. Rebeca would open it wide at dawn and the wind from the graveyard would come in through the windows and go out through the doors to the yard and leave the whitewashed walls and furniture tanned by the saltpeter of the dead. Her hunger for earth, the cloc-cloc of her parents’ bones, the impatience of her blood as it faced Pietro Crespi’s passivity were relegated to the attic of her memory. All day long she would embroider beside the window, withdrawn from the uneasiness of the war, until the ceramic pots would begin to vibrate in the cupboard and she would get up to warm the meal, much before the appearance, first, of the mangy hounds, and then of the colossus in leggings and spurs with a double-barreled shotgun, who sometimes carried a deer on his shoulder and almost always a string of rabbits or wild ducks. One afternoon, at the beginning of his rule, Arcadio paid them a surprise visit. They had not seen him since they had left the house, but he seemed so friendly and familiar that they invited him to share the stew.","The only close relatives who knew about it were José Arcadio and Rebeca. They were the ones with whom Arcadio at that time maintained intimate relations not only based on kinship but also on complicity. The marital yoke completely subdued José Arcadio. Rebeca's strong character, her gluttonous appetite, and her insatiable greed drained the robust strength of her husband, forcing him, who was lazy and a playboy, to become a hardworking giant. He has a clean and tidy house. Every morning, Rebecca opens the doors wide, and the wind from the cemetery rushes through the windows and then sweeps out through the side door, leaving behind the sulfurous smell of the dead, causing the walls to turn pale and the tables, cabinets, and beds to darken. The hunger for land, the clattering sound of the bones of her parents, and her impatience with Pietro Crespi's overly calm demeanor had faded into the past. All day, she sat embroidering by the window, indifferent to the echoes of war. Only when the earthenware pots began to rattle in the cupboard did she get up to reheat the food. She did this before the appearance of the mud-splattered, sniffing dogs and the burly man in spurred boots, carrying a double-barreled musket: ""This man sometimes carried a deer on his shoulders, but almost always brought back a string of rabbits or wild ducks… One afternoon, right when he took power, Arcadio suddenly came to visit them. When they left the house, they did not see him, but he had shown such warmth and friendliness that the couple invited him to stay and taste the freshly cooked game meat.",19.295,18.909,"The only relatives who knew about this situation were Jose Arcadio and Rebeca. During that period, Arcadio was close to them more out of a sense of complicity than kinship. Jose Arcadio had surrendered himself to the yoke of marriage. Rebeca's strong personality, insatiable appetite, and relentless ambition were draining all the strength from her husband, who had transformed from a woman-chasing idler into a beast of burden. They had a neat and tidy house. At sunrise, Rebeca would open up the entire house, and as the wind from the cemetery blew in through the windows and out through the doors into the garden, it would infuse the walls and furniture with the scent of graveyard saltpeter. Rebeca's craving for eating earth, the rattling of her parents' bones, and the boiling of her blood in the face of Pietro Crespi's ineptitude were all things of the distant past. Rebeca would sit by the window all day, embroidering, far removed from the anxieties of the war. When the dishes in the cupboard began to clink against each other, she would get up and start cooking. Long before the giant with boots, spurs, and a shotgun, sometimes with a deer slung over his shoulder, but more often with strings of wild ducks and rabbits dangling from his hands, appeared in the distance, Rebeca would have the meal ready. One afternoon, during the early days of his administration, Arcadio showed up. They had not seen him since they left home, but he had such a sincere and friendly demeanor that Rebeca and Jose Arcadio did not hesitate to invite him to their table.",17.841,17.429,"The only relatives who found out were José Arcadio and Rebeca, with whom Arcadio maintained intimate relations, based not so much on kinship as on complicity. José Arcadio had bowed his head to the matrimonial yoke. Rebeca's firm character, the voracity of her womb, her tenacious ambition, absorbed the husband's colossal energy, who from a lazy womanizer turned into a huge work animal. They had a clean and orderly house. Rebeca would open it wide at dawn, and the wind from the graves would enter through the windows and exit through the patio doors, leaving the walls whitewashed and the furniture tanned by the saltpeter of the dead. The hunger for land, the cloc cloc of her parents' bones, the impatience of her blood in the face of Pietro Crespi's passivity were relegated to the attic of memory. All day she would embroider by the window, oblivious to the turmoil of the war, until the ceramic pots started to vibrate in the cupboard and she would get up to heat the food, long before the scrawny tracking dogs appeared and then the colossus with gaiters and spurs and a double-barreled shotgun, who sometimes carried a deer on his shoulder and almost always a string of rabbits or wild ducks.

229,"Only when they were having coffee did Arcadio reveal the motive behind his visit: he had received a complaint against José Arcadio. It was said that he had begun by plowing his own yard and had gone straight ahead into neighboring lands, knocking down fences and buildings with his oxen until he took forcible possession of the best plots of land around. On the peasants whom he had not despoiled because he was not interested in their lands, he levied a contribution which he collected every Saturday with his hunting dogs and his double-barreled shotgun. He did not deny it. He based his right on the fact that the usurped lands had been distributed by José Arcadio Buendía at the time of the founding, and he thought it possible to prove that his father had been crazy ever since that time, for he had disposed of a patrimony that really belonged to the family. It was an unnecessary allegation, because Arcadio had not come to do justice. He simply offered to set up a registry office so that José Arcadio could legalize his title to the usurped land, under the condition that he delegate to the local government the right to collect the contributions. They made an agreement. Years later, when Colonel Aureliano Buendía examined the titles to property, he found registered in his brother’s name all of the land between the hill where his yard was on up to the horizon, including the cemetery, and discovered that during the eleven months of his rule, Arcadio had collected not only the money of the contributions, but had also collected fees from people for the right to bury their dead in José Arcadio’s land.","It was only when drinking coffee that Arcadio clearly stated the purpose of his visit: he had received a complaint against José Arcadio. The complaint alleged that José Arcadio plowed his own field and encroached on neighboring lands, broke down fences, herded his cattle into others' pens, and used force to seize the most fertile farms around. For those farmers who were not dispossessed because their lands were poor, he forced them to pay taxes. Every Saturday, he used hunting dogs and a double-barreled musket to collect taxes. He did not deny these accusations. He asserted his rights over the lands he had seized, which had been distributed by José Arcadio Buendía during the village's founding, and he believed he could prove that his father had been insane since that time because he had given away wealth that rightfully belonged to his family. It was an unnecessary argument because Arcadio had not come to adjudicate right or wrong but merely to negotiate. As for himself, he established a law office to oversee private property, which would provide José Arcadio with the documents to legalize the lands he had seized, and in return, he had to allow the local government the right to collect taxes. The two agreed with each other. In later years, when Colonel Aureliano Buendía examined the land deeds, he found that all the land from José Arcadio's yard to the horizon, including the village cemetery, belonged to his brother; and that during the eleven months of his rule, Arcadio had collected not only taxes but also money from people who wanted to bury their loved ones on José Arcadio's estate.",29.284,29.018,"While they were eating their meals and drinking their coffee, Arcadio explained the reason for his visit. There was a complaint about Jose Arcadio. It was said that Jose Arcadio had started by plowing his own field, then driving the oxen forward, crushing fences and demolishing structures, he forcibly took over the most fertile lands in the area. He had also imposed a tribute on the owners of the lands he did not find appealing. Every Saturday, he would take his hunting dogs, sling his shotgun over his shoulder, and go out to collect the tribute. Jose Arcadio did not deny his actions. -These lands were distributed by Jose Arcadio Buendia during the establishment of the village. In fact, it is said that his madness began at that time because he squandered this inheritance, which actually belonged to the family, and for this reason, he saw himself justified in seizing those lands. Such a defense was actually unnecessary, because Arcadio had not come to see justice served. He had come to negotiate with Jose Arcadio. In order for the title deeds of the seized lands to be transferred to Jose Arcadio, Arcadio would establish a cadastral office, and in return, Jose Arcadio would agree to let the local government representatives collect the tribute. They reached an agreement. Years later, while Colonel Aureliano Buendia was examining the title records, he saw that all the lands, including the cemetery, from the hill where Jose Arcadio's garden was located to as far as the eye could see, were registered in his brother's name. And he learned that during Arcadio's eleven-month rule, not only had he collected the tributes, but he had also taken money from the families of the deceased so they could bury their dead on Jose Arcadio's land. Ursula learned about these events, which were the talk of the entire village, only a few months later.",14.374,13.99,"Only when they were having coffee did Arcadio reveal the reason for his visit: he had received a complaint against José Arcadio.

230,"It took Úrsula several months to find out what was already public knowledge because people hid it from her so as not to increase her suffering. At first she suspected it. “Arcadio is building a house,” she confided with feigned pride to her husband as she tried to put a spoonful of calabash syrup into his mouth. Nevertheless, she involuntarily sighed and said, “I don’t know why, but all this has a bad smell to me.” Later on, when she found out that Arcadio had not only built a house but had ordered some Viennese furniture, she confirmed her suspicion that he was using public funds. “You’re the shame of our family name,” she shouted at him one Sunday after mass when she saw him in his new house playing cards with his officers. Arcadio paid no attention to her. Only then did Úrsula know that he had a six-month-old daughter and that Santa Sofía de la Piedad, with whom he was living outside of marriage, was pregnant again. She decided to write to Colonel Aureliano Buendía, wherever he was, to bring him up to date on the situation. But the fast-moving events of those days not only prevented her plans from being carried out, they made her regret having conceived them. The war, which until then had been only a word to designate a vague and remote circumstance, became a concrete and dramatic reality. Around the end of February an old woman with an ashen look arrived in Macondo riding a donkey loaded down with brooms. She seemed so inoffensive that the sentries let her pass without any questions as another vendor, one of the many who often arrived from the towns in the swamp. She went directly to the barracks. Arcadio received her in the place where the classroom used to be and which at that time had been transformed into a kind of rearguard encampment, with roiled hammocks hanging on hooks and mats piled up in the corners, and rifles and carbines and even hunting shotguns scattered on the floor. The old woman stiffened into a military salute before identifying herself:","A few months later, Úrsula finally learned about the matter that had become public knowledge, because the townspeople had hidden it from her to spare her further distress. She began to suspect him. ""Arcadio is building a house,"" she proudly asserted to her husband while trying to shove a spoonful of pumpkin soup into his mouth. However, she unconsciously sighed: ""I don't know why, but I feel uneasy about all these things."" And later, when she found out that not only had Arcadio finished building the house but had also bought furniture made in Vienna, she became even more convinced that he was embezzling public funds, something she had previously suspected. ""You are the disgrace of our family,"" she scolded him like that at the end of the Sunday mass, when she saw him playing cards in the new house. Arcadio ignored her words. It was only then that Úrsula learned he had a six-month-old daughter and that Santa Sofía de la Piedad, the woman he was living with without being married, was pregnant again. Ursula intended to write a letter to Colonel Aureliano Buendía, no matter where he was, to inform him of everything happening at home and in the neighborhood. But the tumultuous events at that time not only hindered all her intentions but also made her regret having gathered them. War, which until then had been just a word to describe an empty and stagnant situation, had materialized into a tragic reality. At the end of February, an old woman with white hair riding a broomstick horse arrived in the village of Macondo. She looked so gentle that the patrols let her into the village without questioning her, just as they had not questioned the peddlers who often passed through the villages around the swamp. She went straight to the barracks, where Arcadio received her right in what used to be the classroom and was now the soldiers' resting place, where hammocks were rolled up and hung on hooks, backpacks were piled up in corners, and rifles, carbines, and hunting guns were scattered all over the floor. The old woman saluted in a military manner before introducing herself:",23.573,23.322,"Everyone was hiding what had happened to avoid adding to her sorrow. At first, Ursula was suspicious. While she was giving her husband spoonfuls of pumpkin syrup, she said, supposedly with a puffed-up chest, Arcadio is building a house. She said it, but then she couldn't help but sigh and added, I don't know, but I have a feeling something is going to come out of this. Later, when she learned that Arcadio was not only building a house but also ordering furniture from Vienna, she became convinced that he was spending the money he had collected for public services.

But anyone could have bought it before the war or stolen it, and it had no merit as a safe-conduct pass. The messenger even went to the extreme of violating a military secret so that they would believe his identity.

236,"He did not have long to wait. The news of the Liberal defeat was more and more concrete. Toward the end of March, before a dawn of premature rain, the tense calm of the previous weeks was abruptly broken by the desperate sounds of a cornet and a cannon shot that knocked down the steeple of the church. Actually, Arcadio’s decision to resist was madness. He had only fifty poorly armed men with a ration of twenty cartridges apiece. But among them, his former pupils, excited by the high-sounding proclamations, the determination reigned to sacrifice their skins for a lost cause. In the midst of the tramping of boots, contradictory commands, cannon shots that made the earth tremble, wild shooting, and the senseless sound of cornets, the supposed Colonel Stevenson managed to speak to Arcadio. “Don’t let me undergo the indignity of dying in the stocks in these women’s clothes,” he said to him. “If I have to die, let me die fighting.” He succeeded in convincing him. Arcadio ordered them to give him a weapon and twenty cartridges, and he left him with five men to defend headquarters while he went off with his staff to head up the resistance. He did not get to the road to the swamp. The barricades had been broken and the defenders were openly fighting in the streets, first until they used up their ration of rifle bullets, then with pistols against rifles, and finally hand to hand. With the imminence of defeat, some women went into the street armed with sticks and kitchen knives. In that confusion Arcadio found Amaranta, who was looking for him like a madwoman, in her nightgown and with two old pistols that had belonged to José Arcadio Buendía. He gave his rifle to an officer who had been disarmed in the fight and escaped with Amaranta through a nearby street to take her home. Úrsula was, in the doorway waiting, indifferent to the cannon shots that had opened up a hole in the front of the house next door. The rain was letting up, but the streets were as slippery and as smooth as melted soap, and one had to guess distances in the darkness. Arcadio left Amaranta with Úrsula and made an attempt to face two soldiers who had opened up with heavy firing from the corner. The old pistols that had been kept for many years in the bureau did not work. Protecting Arcadio with her body, Úrsula tried to drag him toward the house.","No need to wait long. News of the Liberal faction's failure became more and more certain. In the early hours of a late March night, amidst early downpours, the heavy, quiet atmosphere of the previous weeks suddenly dissipated with the eerie sound of a cornet and the violent explosion of a cannon that brought down the church bell tower. In reality, Arcadio's resolve to resist was a mad idea. He had no more than fifty poorly armed men with no more than twenty bullets per gun. But among the resistance fighters, his former students, who were once eager with his grand declarations, were determined to fight to the last moment for a lost cause. In the midst of the chaotic sounds of running boots, conflicting orders, earth-shaking cannon blasts, random gunfire, and meaningless cornet calls, the imprisoned Colonel Stevenson requested to speak with Arcadio. ""Spare me the shame of dying in prison dressed in women's clothes,"" he said to him. ""If I must die, I will die fighting. ""Arcadio ordered a gun with twenty bullets to be given to him and allowed him, along with five others, to defend the barracks, while he and his command went to the front line of the resistance. The barricades were broken, and the village defenders had to fight an uneven gun battle in the streets. First, they fought with rifles until they ran out of bullets, then with pistols against rifles, and finally in hand-to-hand combat. Facing imminent defeat, some women, wielding sticks and butcher knives, poured into the streets. In that chaotic scene, Arcadio encountered Amaranta in her nightgown, holding two old pistols of José Arcadio Buendía, frantically searching for him. Arcadio handed his gun to an officer who had lost his weapon in the battle, then slipped into a nearby alley with Amaranta to take her home. Ursula stood at the doorway, waiting, despite the gunfire and a stray bullet that punched a hole in the front wall of the neighboring house. The rain had stopped, but the main road was muddy like soap foam, and people had to feel their way in the darkness. Arcadio left Amaranta with Ursula and intended to face two government soldiers coming down the street to search. The pistols, having been in the drawer for too long without oil, did not fire. Shielding Arcadio with her body, Ursula tried to pull him back to her house.",21.758,21.524,"He didn't have to wait long. News of the Liberals' defeat was increasing day by day. Towards the end of March, at dawn when untimely rains were pouring down, the tense silence of the past weeks was broken by the bitter sound of a trumpet and the cannon noise that destroyed the church's tower. In fact, Arcadio's decision to resist was sheer madness. Supposedly, he had fifty armed men, and each man had twenty bullets. Even so, former students, spurred on by Arcadio's boasts, had committed themselves wholeheartedly to the lost cause. Amid the sounds of boots on the roads, clashing commands, earth-shaking cannons, whizzing bullets, and the harsh sounds of bugles, a man called Colonel Stevenson found an opportunity to speak with Arcadio. ""Don't humiliate me by making me die in women's clothing,"" he said. ""If I'm going to die, let me die fighting."" In the end, he managed to convince Arcadio. Arcadio ordered that he be given a weapon and twenty bullets, left five men with him to defend the headquarters, and went out with his men to lead the resistance. However, he couldn't reach the main road leading to the swamp. The barricades had been destroyed. The defenders of the village were fighting in the streets. They fought with their rifles until they ran out of bullets, then drew their pistols against the rifles, and finally came to hand-to-hand combat, grappling throat to throat. Seeing the rout, some of the women took to the streets with sticks and bread knives they had grabbed. In that chaos, Arcadio, in his nightshirt and with José Arcadio Buendía's two old pistols in hand, encountered Amaranta, who was frantically searching for him. Arcadio gave his rifle to an officer who had lost his weapon in the fight and turned into a side street to take Amaranta home. Ursula was standing at the door, waiting for them, indifferent to the cannon fire that had made a huge breach in the adjoining house. The rain was letting up, but the streets were as slippery as if soap had been spilled on them, and in the darkness, distance could only be judged by eye. Arcadio left Amaranta with Ursula and tried to confront two soldiers who were firing from the corner. The old pistols, forgotten for years at the bottom of a drawer, did not fire. Ursula tried to pull Arcadio into the house, shielding him with her body.",23.679,23.458,"He did not have to wait long. The news of the liberal failure became increasingly concrete. At the end of March, in the early hours of a premature rainy morning, the tense calm of the previous weeks was abruptly shattered by a desperate bugle call, followed by a cannon shot that destroyed the temple tower. In reality, Arcadio's will to resist was madness. He had no more than fifty poorly armed men, each with a maximum supply of twenty cartridges. But among them, his former students, excited by high-sounding proclamations, were determined to sacrifice their skins for a lost cause. Amid the clatter of boots, contradictory orders, cannon shots that made the ground tremble, hasty gunfire, and senseless bugle calls, the supposed Colonel Stevenson managed to speak with Arcadio. “Spare me the indignity of dying in the stocks with these women's rags,” he said. “If I am to die, let it be fighting.” He managed to convince him. Arcadio ordered that he be given a weapon with twenty cartridges and left him with five men defending the barracks while he went with his staff to lead the resistance. He did not reach the swamp road. The barricades had been torn apart and the defenders were fighting in the open in the streets, first as far as their rifle supplies would last, then with pistols against rifles, and finally hand to hand. Faced with imminent defeat, some women took to the streets armed with sticks and kitchen knives. In that confusion, Arcadio found Amaranta who was looking for him like a madwoman, in her nightgown, with two old pistols of José Arcadio Buendía. He gave his rifle to an officer who had been disarmed in the skirmish, and escaped with Amaranta down an adjacent street to take her home. Úrsula was at the door, waiting, indifferent to the gunfire that had opened a breach in the facade of the neighboring house. The rain was letting up, but the streets were slippery and soft like melted soap, and distances had to be guessed in the darkness. Arcadio left Amaranta with Úrsula and tried to confront two soldiers who fired a blind volley from the corner. The old pistols, stored for many years in a wardrobe, did not work. Protecting Arcadio with her body, Úrsula tried to drag him to the house.",47.592,47.479

240,"Arcadio pushed Úrsula toward the house and surrendered. A short time later the shooting stopped and the bells began to toll. The resistance had been wiped out in less than half an hour. Not a single one of Arcadio’s men had survived the attack, but before dying they had killed three hundred soldiers. The last stronghold was the barracks. Before being attacked, the supposed Colonel Gregorio Stevenson had freed the prisoners and ordered his men to go out and fight in the street. The extraordinary mobility and accurate aim with which he placed his twenty cartridges gave the impression that the barracks was well-defended, and the attackers blew it to pieces with cannon fire. The captain who directed the operation was startled to find the rubble deserted and a single dead man in his undershorts with an empty rifle still clutched in an arm that had been blown completely off. He had a woman’s full head of hair held at the neck with a comb and on his neck a chain with a small gold fish. When he turned him over with the tip of his boot and put the light on his face, the captain was perplexed. “Jesus Christ,” he exclaimed. Other officers came over.","Accadio pushed Ursula towards the house, while he raised his hands in surrender. Shortly thereafter, the gunfire ceased abruptly and the church bells began to toll. The resistance was crushed in less than half an hour. Not a single person from Akkad survived the attack, but before dying, they were all paraded in front of three hundred government soldiers. The last fortress to be destroyed was the military camp. Before it was attacked, Colonel Gregory Stevenson, who was imprisoned, released all the prisoners and ordered his subordinates to go out and fight on the streets. The change in the combat position was as flexible as his, and the precise trajectory of the twenty bullets he fired from different windows gave the impression that the barracks were well-defended, forcing the attackers to use cannons to bring it down. The captain commanding the battle was astonished by the sight of the collapsed walls, with only one man, wearing nothing but shorts, dead, and a gun with no bullets being held by a severed arm. That man had thick, curly hair resting on his shoulders and wore a necklace with a goldfish pendant around his neck. When the captain used his boot to turn the man's face up for a clearer look, he was startled and exclaimed, ""Holy crap,"" he said. Several other officers also rushed over.",20.336,19.946,"Arcadio pushed Ursula towards the house, then surrendered. Soon after, the gunfire ceased, and the bells began to ring. The resistance was broken in less than half an hour. Not a single one of Arcadio's men survived, but they had killed three hundred soldiers from the opposing side. The last point of resistance was the headquarters. Before the attack, a man named Colonel Gregorio Stevenson had released the prisoners in the headquarters and ordered his men to go out and fight in the streets. His extraordinary agility and his ability to hit all twenty of his shots without missing gave the impression that the headquarters was defended by a multitude of people, causing the attackers to bombard the headquarters with cannonballs. The captain leading the attack was surprised when he saw no one among the ruins except a single dead body with a shattered arm, holding an empty rifle, and wearing nothing but underwear. The dead man's long hair, like that of a woman, was held at the nape of his neck with a comb, and there was a small fish pendant hanging from a chain around his neck.

242,"At dawn, after a summary court martial, Arcadio was shot against the wall of the cemetery. In the last two hours of his life he did not manage to understand why the fear that had tormented him since childhood had disappeared. Impassive. without even worrying about making a show of his recent bravery, he listened to the interminable charges of the accusation. He thought about Úrsula, who at that hour must have been under the chestnut tree having coffee with José Arcadio Buendía. He thought about his eight-month-old daughter, who still had no name, and about the child who was going to be born in August. He thought about Santa Sofía de la Piedad, whom he had left the night before salting down a deer for next day’s lunch, and he missed her hair pouring over her shoulders and her eyelashes, which looked as if they were artificial. He thought about his people without sentimentality, with a strict dosing of his accounts with life, beginning to understand how much he really loved the people he hated most. The president of the court-martial began his final speech when Arcadio realized that two hours had passed. “Even if the proven charges did not have merit enough,” the president was saying, “the irresponsible and criminal boldness with which the accused drove his subordinates on to a useless death would be enough to deserve capital punishment.” In the shattered schoolhouse where for the first time he had felt the security of power, a few feet from the room where he had come to know the uncertainty of love, Arcadio found the formality of death ridiculous. Death really did not matter to him but life did, and therefore the sensation he felt when they gave their decision was not a feeling of fear but of nostalgia. He did not speak until they asked him for his last request.","At dawn, Accadio was shot in front of the cemetery wall after the military council held an emergency meeting. In the last two hours of his life, he still couldn't understand why the fear of death that had tormented him since childhood had vanished. With a cold, calm demeanor, not at all concerned with proving his newly found courage, he listened to the lengthy accusations. He thought of Úrsula, who at this hour was probably drinking coffee with José Arcadio Buendía under the chestnut tree. He thought of the eight-month-old daughter who still had no name and the child that would be born in the coming August. He thought of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, who had marinated a deer last night for Saturday's lunch, remembered her long hair falling over her shoulders, and her long eyelashes that looked like they were fake. He thought of his people without the slightest regret. In the fairness that life demanded, he began to understand how much he actually loved those he had once hated. The president of the military council began his final speech just as Arcadio suddenly remembered that two hours had already passed. ""Although the positions assigned to him were insignificant,"" the president said, ""his aggressive, irresponsible, and cruel attitude led his subordinates to useless deaths, which is enough to sentence him to death.""... At the cracked school where he first felt the certainty of power, just a few meters from the classroom where he first experienced bewildering love, Arcadio encountered the ridiculous form of death. In reality, what mattered to him now was not death but life, and thus, the feeling he experienced when sentenced to death was not fear but longing. He remained silent until asked what his final wish was.",23.301,22.997,"At dawn, by the decision of the hastily convened military court, Arcadio was executed by firing squad at the foot of the cemetery wall. He himself could not understand why the fear that had poisoned his life since childhood suddenly vanished in the last two hours of his life. Without attempting to show the courage he had displayed moments before, he listened indifferently to the accusations directed at him by the court. He remembered Ursula. He thought that at this hour she must be having her morning coffee with Jose Arcadio Buendia under the chestnut tree. He thought of his eight-month-old daughter, who had not yet been named, and the child that would be born in August. He thought of Santa Sofia de la Piedad, whom he had left the evening before while salting the venison for the next day's meal; he missed her hair falling on her shoulders and her eyelashes that looked artificial. As he was definitively settling his account with life, he wasn't getting emotional thinking about his own people; he was beginning to understand how he had actually loved the people he hated the most. When the president of the military court finished his speech, Arcadio realized that two hours had passed. Although we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate the charges, said the president, the defendant's irresponsible rashness, which led those under his command to unnecessary death, is enough to warrant the heaviest penalty. Arcadio found it absurd that he was preparing for his death a few steps away from the room where he first felt the anxiety of love, in the ruined classroom where he first tasted the security of power. He didn't care about death, but life meant a lot. Therefore, his feeling at the moment the death sentence was pronounced was not fear, but longing.

244,"Before they took him to the execution wall Father Nicanor tried to attend him. “I have nothing to repent,” Arcadio said, and he put himself under the orders of the squad after drinking a cup of black coffee. The leader of the squad, a specialist in summary executions, had a name that had much more about it than chance: Captain Roque Carnicero, which meant butcher. On the way to the cemetery, under the persistent drizzle, Arcadio saw that a radiant Wednesday was breaking out on the horizon. His nostalgia disappeared with the mist and left an immense curiosity in its place. Only when they ordered him to put his back to the wall did Arcadio see Rebeca, with wet hair and a pink flowered dress, opening wide the door. He made an effort to get her to recognize him. And Rebeca did take a casual look toward the wall and was paralyzed with stupor, barely able to react and wave good-bye to Arcadio. Arcadio answered her the same way. At that instant the smoking mouths of the rifles were aimed at him and letter by letter he heard the encyclicals that Melquíades had chanted and he heard the lost steps of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, a virgin, in the classroom, and in his nose he felt the same icy hardness that had drawn his attention in the nostrils of the corpse of Remedios. “Oh, God damn it!” he managed to think. “I forgot to say that if it was a girl they should name her Remedios.” Then, all accumulated in the rip of a claw, he felt again all the terror that had tormented him in his life. The captain gave the order to fire. Arcadio barely had time to put out his chest and raise his head, not understanding where the hot liquid that burned his thighs was pouring from.","Before they took him to the wall at the cemetery, Father Nicanor intended to baptize him. ""I have no regrets,"" Arcadio said, and followed the execution squad's orders after drinking a cup of black coffee. The commander of the execution squad, a man who specialized in carrying out death sentences, had a name very fitting for his profession: Captain Roque Carnicero. On the way to the cemetery, under a light drizzle, Arcadio noticed that a dawn Wednesday was beginning to glow on the horizon. Nostalgia dissolved in the mist and left behind a terrible curiosity. Only when he was ordered to lean against the wall did Arcadio see Rebeca with her wet hair, wearing a pink floral dress, opening the door of the house wide. He silently prayed that Rebeca would recognize him. Indeed, at that moment, Rebeca looked towards the cemetery wall and suddenly stood there, stunned and horrified. She barely had time to signal a farewell to Arcadio. Arcadio responded with a similar gesture. At that moment, the smoking barrels of the guns fired at Arcadio, and he clearly heard each word of the chant recited by old Melquíades and felt the staggering footsteps of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, the virgin maiden, echoing in the classroom, and felt the cold hardness of ice on his nose, which he had noticed in the nostrils of Remedios' corpse. ""Ah, the b... - he just had time to think, - I forgot to say that if it's a girl, name her Remedios."" At that moment, he felt the fear that had tormented him his entire life.

The name of the commander, who was unmatched in hasty executions, suited him well: Captain Roque Carnicero, which meant butcher. As they were heading to the cemetery, under the constant drizzle, Arcadio saw that a bright Wednesday was about to dawn on the horizon. With the dawn, the pain of longing within him also dissipated and was replaced by curiosity. When they told him to lean against the wall, Arcadio saw Rebeca opening the door with her wet hair and pink nightgown. He tried to introduce himself. Rebeca glanced at the wall and froze in astonishment. She barely had time to wave to Arcadio. Arcadio waved back at her. At that moment, the smoking barrels of the rifles were aimed at him, and Arcadio heard Melquiades' words verbatim, the footsteps of untouched Santa Sofia de la Piedad in the dark classroom echoed in his ears, and he felt the icy stiffness he saw in Remedios' nostrils when she died in his own nose. Damn it! he had just enough time to think. I forgot to tell them to name the child Remedios if it’s a girl. Then, all the fear that had poisoned his entire life pierced his heart at once.

Two weeks before the government made the official announcement in a high-sounding proclamation, which promised merciless punishment for those who had started the rebellion, Colonel Aureliano Buendía fell prisoner just as he was about to reach the western frontier disguised as an Indian witch doctor.

The news of his capture was announced in Macondo with a special proclamation. “He’s alive,” Úrsula told her husband. “Let’s pray to God for his enemies to show him clemency.” After three days of weeping, one afternoon as she was stirring some sweet milk candy in the kitchen she heard her son’s voice clearly in her ear. “It was Aureliano, “ she shouted, running toward the chestnut tree to tell her husband the news. “I don’t know how the miracle took place, but he’s alive and we’re going to see him very soon.” She took it for granted. She had the floors of the house scrubbed and changed the position of the furniture. One week later a rumor from somewhere that was not supported by any proclamation gave dramatic confirmation to the prediction. Colonel Aureliano Buendía had been condemned to death and the sentence would be carried out in Macondo as a lesson to the population. On Monday, at ten-thirty in the morning, Amaranta was dressing Aureliano José when she heard the sound of a distant troop and the blast of a cornet one second before Úrsula burst into the room with the shout: “They’re bringing him now!” The troop struggled to subdue the overflowing crowd with their rifle butts. Úrsula and Amaranta ran to the corner, pushing their way through, and then they saw him. He looked like a beggar. His clothing was torn, his hair and beard were tangled, and he was barefoot. He was walking without feeling the burning dust, his hands tied behind his back with a rope that a mounted officer had attached to the head of his horse. Along with him, also ragged and defeated, they were bringing Colonel Gerineldo Márquez. They were not sad.

She believed that omen to be true. She ordered the floor to be cleaned and the furniture to be rearranged. A week later, a source without origin, not based on any decree, heartbreakingly confirmed that omen.

Úrsula and Amaranta ran to the end of the street, pushed through the crowd, and there they saw Aureliano Buendía. He looked like a beggar: his clothes were in tatters, his hair and beard were unkempt, he was barefoot, his hands were tied behind his back with a rope attached to the saddle of the officer's horse.

Not feeling fear, nor longing, he only felt furious that this artificial death had not allowed him to see with his own eyes the final result of so much unfinished work.

The official order arrived in the Monday mail: the execution was to be carried out within twenty-four hours. That night the officers put seven slips of paper into a cap, and Captain Roque Carnicero’s unpeaceful fate was foreseen by his name on the prize slip. “Bad luck doesn’t have any chinks in it,” he said with deep bitterness. “I was born a son of a bitch and I’m going to die a son of a bitch.” At five in the morning he chose the squad by lot, formed it in the courtyard, and woke up the condemned man with a premonitory phrase.","In reality, they did not dare to carry out the sentence.

278,"Another war began right there. Captain Roque Carnicero and his six men left with Colonel Aureliano Buendía to free the revolutionary general Victorio Medina, who had been condemned to death in Riohacha. They thought they could save time by crossing the mountains along the trail that José Arcadio Buendía had followed to found Macondo, but before a week was out they were convinced that it was an impossible undertaking. So they had to follow the dangerous route over the outcroppings; with no other munitions but what the firing squad had. They would camp near the towns and one of them, with a small gold fish in his hand, would go in disguise in broad daylight to contact the dormant Liberals, who would go out hunting on the following morning and never return. When they saw Riohacha from a ridge in the mountains, General Victorio Medina had been shot. Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s men proclaimed him chief of the revolutionary forces of the Caribbean coast with the rank of general. He assumed the position but refused the promotion and took the stand that he would never accept it as long as the Conservative regime was in power. At the end of three months they had succeeded in arming more than a thousand men, but they were wiped out. The survivors reached the eastern frontier. The next thing that was heard of them was that they had landed on Cabo de la Vela, coming from the smaller islands of the Antilles, and a message from the government was sent all over by telegraph and included in jubilant proclamations throughout the country announcing the death of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. But two days later a multiple telegram which almost overtook the previous one announced another uprising on the southern plains. That was how the legend of the ubiquitous Colonel Aureliano Buendía, began. Simultaneous and contradictory information declared him victorious in Villanueva. defeated in Guacamayal, devoured by Motilón Indians, dead in a village in the swamp, and up in arms again in Urumita. The Liberal leaders, who at that moment were negotiating for participation in the congress, branded him in adventurer who did not represent the party. The national government placed him in the category of a bandit and put a price of five thousand pesos on his head. After sixteen defeats, Colonel Aureliano Buendía left Guajira with two thousand well-armed Indians and the garrison, which was taken by surprise as it slept, abandoned Riohacha. He established his headquarters there and proclaimed total war against the regime. The first message he received from the government was a threat to shoot Colonel Gerineldo Márquez within forty-eight hours if he did not withdraw with his forces to the eastern frontier. Colonel Roque Carnicero, who was his chief of staff then, gave him the telegram with a look of consternation, but he read it with unforeseen joy.","From that point, a new war began. Captain Roque Carnicero, along with six of his subordinates, followed Colonel Aureliano Buendía to liberate the revolutionaries, General Victorio Medina, who had been sentenced to death in Riohacha. They thought they could save time by quickly crossing the mountain range along the path José Arcadio Buendía had taken to establish the village of Macondo, but within less than a week, they unanimously agreed that it was an impassable route. Thus, they had to undertake a perilous journey along the mountain slopes with the scant ammunition of the soldiers in the execution squad. They rested on the outskirts of the villages. One of them, disguised and carrying a golden fish, entered the village in broad daylight to meet with the waiting Liberal faction members. The next morning, these people went hunting and would never be seen returning. When they saw the city of Rioacha from a mountain bend, General Victorio Medina had already been executed. The men under Colonel Aureliano Buendía immediately proclaimed him Commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of the Caribbean coast with the rank of General. He accepted the position but refused the rank, setting for himself the condition that he would not accept the rank until his army had overthrown the Royalist regime. Exactly three months later, he had gathered more than a thousand troops but was defeated by government forces. The survivors fled towards the eastern border of the country. Another time, it was known that they had landed at Cabo de la Vela from the Antidat archipelago, yet a government communiqué was sent through the postal service and reprinted in the form of cheerful notices spread throughout the country, announcing the death of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. But two days later, another troubling telegram, almost simultaneous with the previous one, reported a new uprising in the southern plains. Thus began the legend of Colonel Aureliano Buendía's uncanny abilities. Similar and different news spread, announcing his victory in Vidanuéva, his defeat in Goacamadan, that he had been killed by the Indians in Colombia and Venezuela, that he died in some village in the swamp region, and once again he rose up in Urumita. The leaders of the Liberal Party, meanwhile negotiating their participation in the parliament, considered him an adventurous rogue who did not represent the party. The national government classified him as a bandit and offered a reward of five thousand pesos for his capture. After sixteen failed armed uprisings, Colonel Aureliano Buendía, with two thousand Indian soldiers armed from the Goahira region, launched an attack, and the Royalist guard, caught by surprise while sleeping, had to abandon the city of Riohacha and flee. There, he established his General Headquarters and declared a total war against the regime. The first reaction from the government that he received was a threat to execute Colonel Gerineldo Márquez within forty-eight hours if he did not withdraw all his armed forces to the eastern border. Colonel Roque Carnicero, now his chief of staff, solemnly handed him the telegram.",28.676,28.525,"A new war began right there. Captain Roque Carnicero and six soldiers set out with Colonel Aureliano Buendia to rescue the revolutionary General Victorio Medina, who had been sentenced to death in Riohacha. They thought it would be shorter if they followed the path Jose Arcadio Buendia had taken to Macondo and headed into the mountains, but within a week they realized it was an impossible endeavor. As a result, they were forced to take the dangerous path filled with cliffs. They had no ammunition other than the bullets of the firing squad. They would camp near villages and towns, and one of them would disguise himself and go out to search for hidden Liberals with a small silver fish in hand. The Liberals would leave the next day under the pretense of going hunting and would not return. By the time they saw Riohacha through the mountains, General Victorio Medina had already been executed by firing squad. Colonel Aureliano Buendia's men promoted Buendia to the rank of general and made him the Commander of the Revolutionary Forces of the Caribbean Coast. Aureliano took on the role but stated that he could not accept the rank of general as long as the Conservative regime remained in power. They were able to arm a force of over a thousand people within three months. But they were defeated. The survivors reached the eastern border. Then, it was heard that they had landed on Cabo de la Vela, considered one of the smaller islands of the Antilles. The government sent out proclamations by telegraph in all directions, and during this time, it was loudly announced that Colonel Aureliano Buendia had died. However, a telegram received two days later, as if to contradict the previous one, conveyed news of a new uprising in the southern plains. Thus, the legend of Colonel Aureliano Buendia appearing in various places at the same time was born. At the same time, the conflicting news reported that Aureliano had won the battle in Villanueva, was defeated in Guacamayal, fell into the hands of the Motilon natives, was killed in one of the swamp villages, and launched an armed attack in Urumita. Meanwhile, the Liberals, who were negotiating to enter the House of Representatives, branded Aureliano as an adventurer and declared that he did not represent the party in any way. The national government declared him a bandit and put a price of five thousand pesos on his head. After sixteen defeats, Colonel Aureliano Buendia set out from Guajira with two thousand armed natives from head to toe, and the military unit he caught off guard while they were sleeping was forced to abandon Riohacha. Colonel Buendia established his headquarters there and declared a total war against the regime. In the first news he received from the government, it was reported that if he did not withdraw to the eastern border with his forces, Colonel Gerinaldo Marquez would be executed within forty-eight hours. At that time, Colonel Roque Carnicero, who was Aureliano's chief of staff, handed over the telegram with a stern face. But Aureliano read the telegram with unexpected joy.",29.843,29.697,"There another war began. Captain Roque Carnicero and his six men went with Colonel Aureliano Buendía to liberate the revolutionary general Victorio Medina, sentenced to death in Riohacha. They thought they could save time by crossing the mountains via the route José Arcadio Buendía had taken to found Macondo, but within a week they were convinced it was an impossible endeavor. So they had to take the dangerous foothill route, with no more ammunition than that of the firing squad. They camped near the towns, and one of them, with a little gold fish in hand, would enter in disguise in broad daylight and make contact with the resting liberals, who the next morning would go out hunting and never return. When they sighted Riohacha from a bend in the mountains, General Victorio Medina had already been executed. Colonel Aureliano Buendía's men proclaimed him the leader of the revolutionary forces of the Caribbean coast, with the rank of general. He assumed the position but rejected the promotion, imposing on himself the condition not to accept it until the conservative regime was overthrown. Within three months they had managed to arm more than a thousand men, but they were exterminated. The survivors reached the eastern border. The next time they were heard from, they had landed at Cabo de la Vela, coming from the Antilles archipelago, and a government report, broadcast by telegraph and published in jubilant proclamations throughout the country, announced the death of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. But two days later, a multiple telegram, which almost caught up with the previous one, announced another rebellion in the southern plains. Thus began the legend of the ubiquity of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Simultaneous and contradictory reports declared him victorious in Villanueva, defeated in Guacamayal, devoured by the Motilone Indians, dead in a village in the swamp, and once again uprising in Urumita. The liberal leaders, who at that time were negotiating a participation in parliament, labeled him an adventurer without party representation. The national government classified him as a bandit and put a price of five thousand pesos on his head. After sixteen defeats, Colonel Aureliano Buendía left La Guajira with two thousand well-armed indigenous people, and the garrison, surprised during their sleep, abandoned Riohacha. There he established his headquarters and declared total war against the regime. The first notification he received from the government was the threat to execute Colonel Gerineldo Márquez within forty-eight hours if he did not retreat with his forces to the eastern border. Colonel Roque Carnicero, who was then his chief of staff, handed him the telegram with a gesture of consternation, but he read it with unpredictable joy.",49.402,49.304

280,"His reply was definitive. In three months he expected to establish his headquarters in Macondo. If he did not find Colonel Gerineldo Márquez alive at that time he would shoot out of hand all of the officers he held prisoner at that moment starting with the generals, and he would give orders to his subordinates to do the same for the rest of the war. Three months later, when he entered Macondo in triumph, the first embrace he received on the swamp road was that of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez.","His answer was decisive. For three months, he waited to establish his General Headquarters in Macondo. If by then he had not seen Colonel Gerineldo Márquez alive, he would execute all the captured officers without trial, starting with the generals, and at the same time, he would order his subordinates to proceed in the same manner, executing Royalist officers until the war ended.

282,"Not all the news was good. A year after the flight of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, José Arcadio and Rebeca went to live in the house Arcadio had built. No one knew about his intervention to halt the execution. In the new house, located on the best corner of the square, in the shade of an almond tree that was honored by three nests of redbreasts, with a large door for visitors and four windows for light, they set up a hospitable home. Rebeca’s old friends, among them four of the Moscote sisters who were still single, once more took up the sessions of embroidery that had been interrupted years before on the porch with the begonias. José Arcadio continued to profit from the usurped lands, the title to which was recognized by the Conservative government. Every afternoon he could be seen returning on horseback, with his hunting dogs and his double-barreled shotgun and a string of rabbits hanging from his saddle.

It was a difficult version to believe, but there was no other more plausible, and no one could think of any motive for Rebeca to murder the man who had made her happy. That was perhaps the only mystery that was never cleared up in Macondo. As soon as José Arcadio closed the bedroom door the sound of a pistol shot echoed through the house.

A year after Colonel Aureliano escaped, José Arcadio and Rebeca moved into the house that Arcadio had built. No one knew that he had disrupted the execution. The couple built a warm and welcoming home in their new house, situated in the most beautiful corner of the main square, nestled under the shade of an ancient almond tree with three redbird nests. The house had a main entrance for guests and four windows to let in light. Rebeca's friends, including the four Moscote sisters who were still unmarried, resumed their gatherings to embroider, a tradition that had never been interrupted in the past years, in the corridor adorned with begonia pots. José Arcadio continued to enjoy the benefits of the lands he had seized, with deeds recognized by the Royalist government. Every afternoon, he was seen returning on horseback, a double-barreled shotgun slung over his shoulder, followed by fierce hunting dogs, with a string of wild rabbits hanging from his saddle. One September afternoon, before a threatening storm, he returned home earlier than usual. He greeted Rebeca, who was in the dining room, tied the dogs in the yard, hung the string of rabbits in the kitchen to be cleaned and marinated later, and then went to the bedroom to change clothes. Later, Rebeca explained that when her husband entered the bedroom, she was in the bathroom and knew nothing of what happened. It was a hard-to-believe explanation, but no clearer one was available, and no one could think of any other reason for Rebeca to kill the man who had brought her happiness. That might be the only mystery that was never solved in the village of Macondo. Just as José Arcadio closed the door to his room, a gunshot rang out, shaking the entire house. A stream of blood flowed out from under the door, crawled across the living room, went out onto the street, continued to flow along the rugged roads, climbed over steps and obstacles, crawled steadily along the Turkish road, turned left onto one street then right onto another before making a carpenter's square turn right in front of the Buendía house, slipped under the closed door into the house, clung to the wall to avoid staining the carpets, continued to crawl through another room, made a wide loop to avoid the dining table, crawled along the hallway past the sugar-recovery pots and slipped under the chair where Amaranta was teaching arithmetic to Aureliano José without being seen, then disappeared as it entered the corn storage, and reappeared in the kitchen where Úrsula was cracking thirty-six eggs to make a cake.",29.693,29.518,"Not all the news was good.

They found no wound on his body nor could they locate the weapon. Nor was it possible to remove the smell of powder from the corpse. First they washed him three times with soap and a scrubbing brush, and they rubbed him with salt and vinegar, then with ashes and lemon, and finally they put him in a barrel of lye and let him stay for six hours. They scrubbed him so much that the arabesques of his tattooing began to fade. When they thought of the desperate measure of seasoning him with pepper, cumin seeds, and laurel leaves and boiling him for a whole day over a slow fire, he had already begun to decompose and they had to bury him hastily.

Father Nicanor, with his liver enlarged and tight as a drum, gave him his blessing from bed. Although in the months that followed they reinforced the grave with walls about it, between which they threw compressed ash, sawdust, and quicklime, the cemetery still smelled of powder for many years after, until the engineers from the banana company covered the grave over with a shell of concrete. As soon as they took the body out, Rebeca closed the doors of her house and buried herself alive, covered with a thick crust of disdain that no earthly temptation was ever able to break. She went out into the street on one occasion, when she was very old, with shoes the color of old silver and a hat made of tiny flowers, during the time that the Wandering Jew passed through town and brought on a heat wave that was so intense that birds broke through window screens to come to die in the bedrooms. The last time anyone saw her alive was when with one shot she killed a thief who was trying to force the door of her house. Except for Argénida, her servant and confidante, no one ever had any more contact with her after that. At one time it was discovered that she was writing letters to the Bishop, whom she claimed as a first cousin. but it was never said whether she received any reply. The town forgot about her.","The blood flowed backward, and to find its source, she crawled through the corn shed, followed the corridor lined with begonias where little Aureliano José was loudly reciting three times three is nine, passed through the dining rooms and two living rooms, then went straight out to the main road, turned left and right to enter Turkey Street, not remembering that she was still wearing the apron she used in the kitchen and the two house slippers, then she went out to the square, entered a house she had never been in before, pushed open the bedroom door, and was almost overwhelmed by the smell of gunpowder, and she found José Arcadio lying face down on the floor, his body covering the boots he had just taken off, and saw the blood trickling from his right ear. There was no visible wound on his body, nor could the gun that had fired be found. Nor could the acrid smell of gunpowder be washed off the corpse. First, they bathed him with soap and scrubbing pads, then soaked him in vinegar and salt water, then used ash and lemon juice, and finally placed him in a tub of bleach for six hours straight. They scrubbed him so much that his tattoos began to fade. When they resorted to embalming him with pepper, dill, bay leaves, and simmering the corpse over a low flame for a whole day, the body began to fall apart, forcing them to bury him immediately. They laid the corpse in an oversized coffin, two and a half meters long and one meter wide, lined with tin inside and tightly sealed with steel screws. Despite the thorough washing and embalming, the corpse still emitted a burnt smell along the way as the funeral procession passed. Cha Nicanô, with his round, liver-pained belly like a drum, stood on the bed sprinkling holy water on him. Although in recent months people had built graves with concrete slabs placed on top and scattered ashes, sawdust, and lime powder, the cemetery continued to reek of gunpowder, so much so that in later years, engineers from the Banana Company had to pour a concrete cover over the grave. Immediately after the coffin was taken away, Rêbêca shut the door and buried herself alive in the house, wearing a wrinkled coarse cloth outfit that no worldly desire could tear. During the period of the appearance of the demon Juđiô Erăngtê, Macônđô experienced a terrible heatwave that caused birds to crash through the wire mesh and die in the bedrooms; she went out once, very old, wearing old silver-white boots and a hat adorned with tiny flowers. The last time anyone saw her alive was when she shot dead a thief trying to break into her house. Since then, no one except Arhêmđa, her servant and confidante, had direct contact with her.

Forgetting that she had an apron on and slippers on her feet, she reached the square, entered a house she had never visited, pushed open the bedroom door, almost suffocated by the smell of burnt gunpowder, found Jose Arcadio lying face down on the gaiters he had taken off, and saw that the source of the blood seepage, already clotted, was in the man's right ear. They found no wounds on Jose Arcadio's body. They couldn't seize the weapon either. It was also impossible to rid the corpse of the smell of gunpowder. First, they washed and scrubbed it three times with soap, then they rubbed every part of it with salt and vinegar, then they scrubbed it with lemon juice mixed with ashes, and finally, they submerged it in a barrel of water mixed with ashes and left it for six hours. They scrubbed the body so much that Jose Arcadio's tattoos began to fade. When nothing worked and, as a last resort, they thought of boiling the body for a day with black pepper, cumin seeds, and bay leaves, the corpse had already started to smell and decompose. So they had to bury it in a hurry. They placed it in a special coffin, two and a half meters long, one and a half meters wide, reinforced inside with iron plates and fastened with steel bolts, and sealed the lid tightly. Yet, the streets through which the funeral procession passed were filled with the smell of gunpowder. Father Nicanor, whose liver had swollen and stretched like a drum, recited the funeral prayer without getting out of his bed. Even though they built thick walls around the grave and mixed mortar with compacted ash, sawdust, and quicklime over the following months, the smell of gunpowder lingered in the cemetery for years. The smell persisted until the engineers from the banana company came and covered the grave with a concrete lid. As soon as they took the body out of the house, Rebeca tightly shut the doors of her home and withdrew into a shell of indifference that no worldly pleasure could penetrate, burying herself alive in the house. She left the house once. When she was very old, during a heatwave when the Wandering Jew passed through the village and birds broke through the windows of bedrooms to die peacefully, Rebeca also went outside. She wore tarnished silver shoes and a hat made of small flowers. She was last seen when she took down a burglar who was forcing her door with a single shot. After that day, she had no contact with anyone except her servant and confidante, Argenida. At one point, there was a rumor that she wrote a letter to the bishop she called her cousin, but it was not mentioned whether she received any replies to her letters. The townspeople eventually forgot him.",26.521,26.372,"He followed the trail of blood in the opposite direction, and in search of its origin, he crossed the barn, passed through the corridor of begonias where Aureliano José was singing that three and three are six and six and three are nine, and crossed the dining room and the rooms and continued in a straight line down the street, then turned right and then left until he reached the Street of the Turks, not remembering that he was still wearing his baking apron and house slippers, and went out to the square and entered a house where he had never been before, and pushed open the door of the bedroom and almost choked on the smell of burnt gunpowder, and found José Arcadio lying face down on the floor over the gaiters he had just taken off, and saw the original end of the blood trail that had stopped flowing from his right ear.

285,"In spite of his triumphal return, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was not enthusiastic over the looks of things. The government troops abandoned their positions without resistance and that aroused an illusion of victory among the Liberal population that it was not right to destroy, but the revolutionaries knew the truth, Colonel Aureliano Buendía better than any of them. Although at that moment he had more than five thousand men under his command and held two coastal states, he had the feeling of being hemmed in against the sea and caught in a situation that was so confused that when he ordered the restoration of the church steeple, which had been knocked down by army cannon fire, Father Nicanor commented from his sickbed: “This is silly; the defenders of the faith of Christ destroy the church and the Masons order it rebuilt.” Looking for a loophole through which he could escape, he spent hours on end in the telegraph office conferring with the commanders of other towns, and every time he would emerge with the firmest impression that the war was at a stalemate. When news of fresh liberal victories was received it was celebrated with jubilant proclamations, but he would measure the real extent of them on the map and could see that his forces were penetrating into the jungle, defending themselves against malaria and mosquitoes, advancing in the opposite direction from reality. “We’re wasting time,” he would complain to his officers. “We’re wasting time while the bastards in the party are begging for seats in congress.” Lying awake at night, stretched out on his back in a hammock in the same room where he had awaited death, he would evoke the image of lawyers dressed in black leaving the presidential palace in the icy cold of early morning with their coat collars turned up about their ears, rubbing their hands, whispering, taking refuge in dreary early-morning cafés to speculate over what the president had meant when he said yes, or what he had meant when he said no, and even to imagine what the president was thinking when he said something quite different, as he chased away mosquitoes at a temperature of ninety-five degrees, feeling the approach of the fearsome dawn when he would have to give his men the command to jump into the sea.","Although returning victorious, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was not satisfied with the visible results. The government troops withdrew from the towns without any resistance, which sowed an illusion of an irreversible victory among the newly liberated populace. But the revolutionaries, especially Colonel Aureliano Buendía, understood the truth more accurately. Despite maintaining five thousand men under his command at that time and holding two coastal provinces, he was acutely aware that his forces were being pushed towards the sea and were in such a politically complicated situation that when he ordered the reconstruction of the church bell tower, which had been destroyed by artillery, Father Nicanor, lying on his sickbed, exclaimed: ""This is a joke: the defenders of the Christian faith have shelled the church, while the Freemasons are ordering its reconstruction."" For hours and hours, he stayed in the telegraph room, talking with the commanders of other towns, seeking a way out. But every time he left the room, he increasingly confirmed his feeling that the war was coming to an end. When the new victory news of the Freedom fighters was delivered and loudly announced, he calculated the results achieved on the maps and understood that his army was retreating deeper into the forest to fight tuberculosis and jungle mosquitoes, moving further away from the city. ""We are wasting time,"" he lamented to the officers. ""We will continue to waste time while those bastards in the Freedom party are begging for a seat in parliament."" In sleepless nights lying on the hammock hung in the very room that used to be a death row cell, he recalled the images of lawyers dressed in black with collars turned up to cover their ears and sleeves hanging down to cover their hands, stepping out of the President's mansion in the freezing cold of the night towards dawn, shivering, quickly slipping into the mournful coffee gardens at dawn to ponder over what the President meant when he said yes, or perhaps what he meant when he said no, and to search for what the President was thinking when he said something entirely different. Meanwhile, he swatted mosquitoes, endured the sweltering heat of thirty-five degrees, and felt increasingly closer to the dreadful morning when he would have to order his soldiers to plunge into the sea.",22.908,22.672,"Despite having returned in triumph, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was not at all pleased with the state of affairs. The government troops had abandoned their positions without any resistance, which had given the Liberals the impression that victory had been achieved. It was not right to shatter this belief. However, the revolutionaries knew the true nature of the situation. Colonel Aureliano Buendia was also the person who understood the situation best. Although at that time he had over five thousand armed men under his command and two coastal provinces were under their control. Even so, Colonel Aureliano Buendia felt that they were trapped on the coastline, and all his thoughts and actions were in turmoil. In fact, when Aureliano ordered the repair of the church tower that had been destroyed by the government soldiers' artillery fire, Father Nicanor expressed his astonishment, saying, ""What a ridiculous situation, the believers of Jesus are destroying the church, and the Freemasons are repairing it."" Colonel Aureliano Buendia, hoping to find a way out, would rush to the telegraph office, communicate for hours with the commanders of other towns, and finally return, once again convinced that the war had reached a deadlock. The news of new victories by the Liberals was spreading around with enthusiastic proclamations. However, when Colonel Buendia followed the operation on the map, he saw that his men were plunging into the forests, struggling with malaria and mosquitoes, and increasingly drifting away from reality. -We are wasting time, he would complain to his officers. While the scoundrels in the party are begging for seats in the assembly, we are wasting time here. Once upon a time, he would lie down in the hammock in the room where he awaited death, thinking without blinking until dawn; he would imagine the lawyers dressed in black leaving the presidential palace in the morning chill, lifting their collars to their ears and rubbing their hands as they made their way to the all-night cafes; he would construct in his mind their debates about what the president meant when he said yes, what he meant when he said no, and even what he might be thinking when he said something else. Meanwhile, he was struggling with the overwhelming heat and mosquitoes, and he sensed that the dreadful dawn hour when he would have to give the command to his men to jump into the sea was approaching.",24.669,24.457,"Despite his triumphant return, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was not enthusiastic about appearances. The government troops abandoned the plazas without resistance, and this created an illusion of victory among the liberal population that was not convenient to dispel, but the revolutionaries knew the truth, and more than anyone, Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Although at that moment he had more than five thousand men under his command and dominated two coastal states, he was aware of being cornered against the sea, and caught in such a confusing political situation that when he ordered the restoration of the church tower shattered by an army cannon shot, Father Nicanor commented from his sickbed: ""This is nonsense: the defenders of the faith of Christ destroy the temple and the Masons order it to be repaired."" Seeking an escape route, he spent hours and hours in the telegraph office, conferencing with the leaders of other plazas, and each time he came out with the more defined impression that the war was stagnant. When news of new liberal triumphs was received, they were proclaimed with jubilant decrees, but he measured their true extent on the maps, and understood that his forces were penetrating the jungle, defending themselves from malaria and mosquitoes, advancing in the opposite direction to reality. ""We are wasting time,"" he complained to his officers. ""We will be wasting time as long as the bastards of the party are begging for a seat in congress."" On sleepless nights, lying on his back in the hammock that hung in the same room where he had been condemned to death, he evoked the image of the lawyers dressed in black who left the presidential palace in the icy early morning with their coat collars turned up to their ears, rubbing their hands, whispering, taking refuge in the gloomy cafes of dawn, to speculate on what the president meant when he said yes, or what he meant when he said no, and even to suppose what the president was thinking when he said something entirely different, while he swatted mosquitoes at thirty-five degrees of temperature, feeling the dreadful dawn approaching when he would have to give his men the order to throw themselves into the sea.",45.749,45.615
286,"One night of uncertainty, when Pilar Ternera was singing in the courtyard with the soldiers, he asked her to read the future in her cards. “Watch out for your mouth,” was all that Pilar Ternera brought out after spreading and picking up the cards three times. “I don’t know what it means, but the sign is very clear. Watch out for your mouth.” Two days later someone gave an orderly a mug of black coffee and the orderly passed it on to someone else and that one to someone else until, hand to hand, it reached Colonel Aureliano Buendía office. He had not asked for any coffee, but since it was there the colonel drank it. It had a dose of nux vomica strong enough to kill a horse. When they took him home he was stiff and arched and his tongue was sticking out between his teeth. Úrsula fought against death over him. After cleaning out his stomach with emetics, she wrapped him in hot blankets and fed him egg whites for two days until his harrowed body recovered its normal temperature. On the fourth day he was out of danger. Against his will, pressured by Úrsula and his officers, he stayed in bed for another week. Only then did he learn that his verses had not been burned. “I didn’t want to be hasty,” Úrsula explained to him. “That night when I went to light the oven I said to myself that it would be better to wait until they brought the body.” In the haze of convalescence, surrounded by Remedios’ dusty dolls, Colonel Aureliano Buendía, brought back the decisive periods of his existence by reading his poetry. He started writing again. For many hours, balancing on the edge of the surprises of a war with no future, in rhymed verse he resolved his experience on the shores of death. Then his thoughts became so clear that he was able to examine them forward and backward. One night he asked Colonel Gerineldo Márquez:","One restless night, Pila Tecnêra sang with the soldiers in the courtyard. He asked her to predict his future through the cards. ""Keep your mouth shut,"" that was all Pila Tecnêra clearly saw after arranging the cards and gathering them back. ""I don't know what that means, but the omen is very clear: keep your mouth shut""… Two days later, someone replaced him and ordered an orderly to prepare a cup of coffee without sugar, then this orderly passed the order to another person, who then passed it to another until the cup of coffee without sugar, having gone through many hands, was brought to Colonel Aureliano Buendía's residence. Although he hadn't called for coffee, since it was already there, the colonel drank it. That cup of coffee contained enough strychnine to kill a stallion. When they brought him home, he was stiff, convulsed, with his tongue sticking out between his teeth. Úrsula fought with death to save him. After making him vomit to cleanse his stomach, she covered him with heated bed sheets and gave him egg whites to drink for two days until his weak body regained its normal temperature. On the fourth day, he was out of danger. Contrary to his wishes, due to Úrsula and his officers' insistence, he stayed in bed for another week. Only then did he learn that his poems had not been burned. ""That night, mother didn't want to rush,"" Úrsula explained to him. ""That night, when I went to light the stove, I thought it best to wait until your corpse was brought home."" Living among Remedios' dolls surrounding him, in the condition of gradually recovering health, Colonel Aureliano Buendía, through his poems, reminisced about the most vibrant periods of his life. He began writing poetry again. For many hours, on the sidelines of the prominent events of a war with no future, he affirmed his experiences right at the brink of death. Thus, his mind became increasingly clearer to the point where he could turn it inside out to examine it. One night, he asked Colonel Gerineldo Márquez:",27.394,27.18,"Colonel Aureliano Buendia, on a night when he was once again mired in doubts and anxieties, summoned Pilar Ternera, who was singing in the garden with the soldiers, to read his fortune.

Two days later, someone gave a cup of coffee to one of the sentry soldiers, who passed the cup to another, and that one to another, and so on. The cup made its way from hand to hand until it reached Colonel Aureliano Buendia's room. The Colonel hadn't asked for coffee, but since it was there, he drank it. Inside the coffee was a dose of poisonous black nightshade seeds strong enough to kill a large stallion. When they carried him home, Aureliano was stiff as a board, his tongue hanging out between his teeth. Ursula waged a battle against death on his body. She made him drink purgative medicines and washed his stomach. Then she wrapped him in thick blankets and fed him egg whites for two days until Aureliano's fever returned to normal. On the fourth day, Aureliano tore off the shroud. With the insistence of Ursula and her officers, he stayed in bed for another week. During that time, he learned that his poems had not been burned. Ursula explained, ""I said, let me not rush."" ""When I went to light the oven that night, I said, let them bring the body first, for now, let it be."" In the lethargy of the recovery days spent among Remedios's dusty dolls, Colonel Aureliano Buendia recalled the days that had shaped the course of his life by reading his poems. He started writing poetry again. He would sit for hours, writing poems, trying not to stumble in the face of the unexpected developments of a war with no future. In this way, he went back and forth to the other world. Eventually, his thoughts became so clear that he could see the front and back of everything.

300,"At that time Colonel Aureliano Buendía took the time to send a detailed account to Macondo every two weeks. But only once, almost eight months after he had left, did he write to Úrsula. A special messenger brought a sealed envelope to the house with a sheet of paper inside bearing the colonel’s delicate hand: Take good care of Papa because he is going to die. Úrsula became alarmed. “If Aureliano says so it’s because Aureliano knows,” she said. And she had them help her take José Arcadio Buendía to his bedroom. Not only was he as heavy as ever, but during his prolonged stay under the chestnut tree he had developed the faculty of being able to increase his weight at will, to such a degree that seven men were unable to lift him and they had to drag him to the bed. A smell of tender mushrooms, of wood-flower fungus, of old and concentrated outdoors impregnated the air of the bedroom as it was breathed by the colossal old man weather-beaten by the sun and the rain. The next morning he was not in his bed. In spite of his undiminished strength, José Arcadio Buendía was in no condition to resist. It was all the same to him. If he went back to the chestnut tree it was not because he wanted to but because of a habit of his body. Úrsula took care of him, fed him, brought him news of Aureliano. But actually, the only person with whom he was able to have contact for a long time was Prudencio Aguilar. Almost pulverized at that time by the decrepitude of death, Prudencio Aguilar would come twice a day to chat with him. They talked about fighting cocks. They promised each other to set up a breeding farm for magnificent birds, not so much to enjoy their victories, which they would not need then, as to have something to do on the tedious Sundays of death. It was Prudencio Aguilar who cleaned him fed him and brought him splendid news of an unknown person called Aureliano who was a colonel in the war. When he was alone, José Arcadio Buendía consoled himself with the dream of the infinite rooms. He dreamed that he was getting out of bed, opening the door and going into an identical room with the same bed with a wrought-iron head, the same wicker chair, and the same small picture of the Virgin of Help on the back wall. From that room he would go into another that was just the same, the door of which would open into another that was just the same, the door of which would open into another one just the same, and then into another exactly alike, and so on to infinity. He liked to go from room to room. As in a gallery of parallel mirrors, until Prudencio Aguilar would touch him on the shoulder. Then he would go back from room to room, walking in reverse, going back over his trail, and he would find Prudencio Aguilar in the room of reality. But one night, two weeks after they took him to his bed, Prudencio Aguilar touched his shoulder in an intermediate room and he stayed there forever, thinking that it was the real room. On the following morning Úrsula was bringing him his breakfast when she saw a man coming along the hall. He was short and stocky, with a black suit on and a hat that was also black, enormous, pulled down to his taciturn eyes. “Good Lord,” Úrsula thought, “I could have sworn it was Melquíades.” It was Cataure, Visitación’s brother, who had left the house fleeing from the insomnia plague and of whom there had never been any news. Visitación asked him why he had come back, and he answered her in their solemn language:","At that time, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had arranged to send a detailed report about Macondo every two weeks. But only once, after nearly eight months away, did he write a private letter to Úrsula. A special messenger brought to the house a letter written in the colonel's beautiful handwriting: ""Take good care of father because he is going to die."" Úrsula was startled. ""If Aureliano says so, then Aureliano knows,"" Úrsula said, and asked someone to carry José Arcadio Buendía into the bedroom. He was not only as heavy as he had been before but had grown even heavier during the time he lay under the chestnut tree, to the point that seven strong men could not lift him, forcing them to drag him into the house. The smell of fresh moss mixed with the scent of wood ear mushrooms, the odor of long-standing and dense humidity, filled the room when the robust old man, who had weathered rain and sun for a long time, began to breathe. The next day, he did not wake up in the bed placed in the room. After searching all the rooms, Úrsula once again found him lying under the chestnut tree. So they tied him to the bed. Though strong, José Arcadio Buendía had been rendered out of action... He accepted everything, no longer distinguishing anything. If he returned to lie under the chestnut tree, it was not out of desire but out of habit. Úrsula took care of him, fed him, and told him news about Aureliano. But in reality, the only person he had been in contact with for a long time was Prudencio Aguilar. With a haggard appearance due to old age in the underworld, Prudencio Aguilar would come to the house twice a day to talk with him. The two of them talked about fighting cocks. They promised each other to build a coop for magnificent fighting cocks, not just for the joy of winning some matches but also to pass the time on the melancholic Sunday afternoons in the underworld. Prudencio Aguilar was the one who bathed him, fed him, and told him about the glorious victories of a completely unknown man called Aureliano, who was a colonel in battle. When alone, José Arcadio Buendía found some solace in dreams within the infinite room. He dreamed of getting up from bed, opening the main door, and walking into the next room, which had a bed with a steel headboard, a wicker rocking chair, and a portrait of the Virgin of Remedies hanging on the far wall. From this room, he would go into another identical room, whose door opened into yet another identical room, and so on endlessly. He enjoyed walking from room to room, as if walking in a corridor with mirrored walls on both sides, until Prudencio Aguilar patted him on the shoulder. Then he would return, passing through the rooms one by one, gradually waking up as he retraced his steps, only to meet Prudencio Aguilar again in the backdrop of reality. But then one night, two weeks after Úrsula had brought him into the house, Prudencio Aguilar patted him on the shoulder right in the intermediate room between reality and dreams, and he stayed there forever, thinking it was the room of reality. The very next morning, when bringing him breakfast, Úrsula encountered a man walking towards her from the hallway. The man was short and stout, dressed in black clothes, wearing a wide-brimmed black hat that almost covered his sad eyes. ""Oh my God,"" Úrsula thought. ""He looks like Melquiades... The man was Cataure, the brother of Visitación, who had left home to avoid the insomnia plague and had not been heard from since. When Visitación asked her brother why he had returned, he replied in their native language:",25.072,24.938,"At that time, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was sending a detailed report to Macondo every fifteen days. But he wrote to Ursula only once, and that was almost eight months after his departure. A special messenger brought the sealed envelope to the house. In the paper inside the envelope, the colonel, with his pearl-like handwriting, said, -Take good care of my father, because he is going to die. Ursula became alarmed. -If Aureliano says so, then it is so, she said. And Jose Arcadio Buendia, as if being heavy wasn't enough, had learned to make himself even heavier whenever he wanted during the long time he spent under the chestnut tree. Seven people barely managed to lift him, and they had to drag him to his bed. The large, elderly man, sunburned and soaked by rains, filled the bedroom air with the scent of soft fungus, tree moss, and condensed open air as he breathed. The next morning, the old man was not in his bed. Despite his inexhaustible strength, Jose Arcadio Buendia was in no condition to resist. It was all the same to him. If he had gone back under the chestnut tree, it wasn't because he wanted to, but because his body had the habit of doing so. Ursula looked after him, fed him, and brought news from Aureliano. However, the only person Jose Arcadio Buendia could communicate with for a long time was Prudencio Aguilar. Prudencio Aguilar, who had aged considerably in the realm of the dead, would come twice a day, walking shakily, to chat with him. They would talk about cockfights. They would make plans to establish a large farm and raise purebred roosters. They had no intention of fighting them; the glory of cockfighting victories was long behind them. Their main goal was to create a pastime to while away the endless markets of death. It was always Prudencio Aguilar who brought good news about an unknown person named Aureliano, who had cleaned and fed Jose Arcadio Buendia and had been promoted to colonel in the war. Jose Arcadio Buendia would amuse himself with the fantasy of endless rooms when he was alone. He would imagine getting out of bed, opening the door, and entering a second room with the same wrought-iron bed, the same rocking chair, and the same image of the Holy Virgin on the wall. He would open the door of that room and enter another identical one, and from there another identical one, and so on. Once Jose Arcadio Buendia entered these interconnected rooms that resembled the mirrored hall at the fair, he would wander around until Prudencio Aguilar came and touched his shoulder. Then he would return the way he came, passing from room to room, from room to room, until he came to the real room to find Prudencio Aguilar. But one night, two weeks after they had moved him to the bed, Jose Arcadio Buendia, while in one of the intermediate rooms, felt Prudencio Aguilar touch his shoulder, and Buendia, thinking he was in the real room, stayed there forever. The next morning, as Ursula was bringing his breakfast, she encountered a man in the corridor. He was a short, stocky man. He was dressed in black, with a large black hat pulled down over his eyes. Ursula thought to herself, -My God, I could swear this is almost Melquiades. The man was Cataure, Visitacion's brother, who had fled the village during the insomnia plague and had not been heard from since. Visitacion asked him why he had returned. Cataure replied in their own language, which sounded like a hymn:",26.069,25.939,"Colonel Aureliano Buendía then had time to send a detailed report to Macondo every two weeks. But only once, almost eight months after he had left, did he write to Úrsula. A special emissary brought a sealed envelope to the house, inside of which was a paper written in the colonel's meticulous handwriting: Take good care of father because he is going to die. Úrsula was alarmed. ""If Aureliano says so, Aureliano knows,"" she said. And she asked for help to take José Arcadio Buendía to his bedroom. Not only was he as heavy as ever, but during his prolonged stay under the chestnut tree, he had developed the ability to increase his weight voluntarily, to the point that seven men could not lift him and had to drag him to the bed. A stench of tender mushrooms, wood flower, and ancient, concentrated exposure to the elements filled the air of the bedroom when the colossal old man, macerated by the sun and rain, began to breathe it. The next day he was not in bed at dawn. After searching all the rooms, Úrsula found him again under the chestnut tree. Then they tied him to the bed. Despite his intact strength, José Arcadio Buendía was not in a condition to fight. Everything was the same to him. If he returned to the chestnut tree, it was not by his will but by a habit of the body. Úrsula took care of him, fed him, and brought him news of Aureliano.

He was gliding the razor over his foam-covered chin.

306,"He had been for a long time, ever since that distant day when Amaranta thought he was still a child and continued getting undressed in front of him in the bathroom as she had always done, as she had been used to doing ever since Pilar Ternera had turned him over to her to finish his upbringing. The first time that he saw her the only thing that drew his attention was the deep depression between her breasts. He was so innocent that he asked her what had happened to her and Amaranta pretended to dig into her breasts with the tips of her fingers and answered: “They gave me some terrible cuts.” Some time later, when she had recovered from Pietro Crespi’s suicide and would bathe with Aureliano José again, he no longer paid attention to the depression but felt a strange trembling at the sight of the splendid breasts with their brown nipples. He kept on examining her, discovering the miracle of her intimacy inch by inch, and he felt his skin tingle as he contemplated the way her skin tingled when it touched the water. Ever since he was a small child he had the custom of leaving his hammock and waking up in Amaranta’s bed, because contact with her was a way of overcoming his fear of the dark. But since that day when he became aware of his own nakedness, it was not fear of the dark that drove him to crawl in under her mosquito netting but an urge to feel Amaranta’s warm breathing at dawn. Early one morning during the time when she refused Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, Aureliano José awoke with the feeling that he could not breathe. He felt Amaranta’s fingers searching across his stomach like warm and anxious little caterpillars. Pretending to sleep, he changed his position to make it easier, and then he felt the hand without the black bandage diving like a blind shellfish into the algae of his anxiety. Although they seemed to ignore what both of them knew and what each one knew that the other knew, from that night on they were yoked together in an inviolable complicity. Aureliano José could not get to sleep until he heard the twelve-o’clock waltz on the parlor dock, and the mature maiden whose skin was beginning to grow sad did not have a moments’ rest until she felt slip in under her mosquito netting that sleepwalker whom she had raised, not thinking that he would be a palliative for her solitude. Later they not only slept together, naked, exchanging exhausting caresses, but they would also chase each other into the corners of the house and shut themselves up in the bedrooms at any hour of the day in a permanent state of unrelieved excitement. They were almost discovered by Úrsula one afternoon when she went into the granary as they were starting to kiss. “Do you love your aunt a lot?” she asked Aureliano José in an innocent way. He answered that he did. “That’s good of you,” Úrsula concluded and finished measuring the flour for the bread and returned to the kitchen. That episode drew Amaranta out of her delirium. She realized that she had gone too far, that she was no longer playing kissing games with a child, but was floundering about in an autumnal passion, one that was dangerous and had no future, and she cut it off with one stroke. Aureliano José, who was then finishing his military training, finally woke up to reality and went to sleep in the barracks. On Saturdays he would go with the soldiers to Catarino’s store. He was seeking consolation for his abrupt solitude, for his premature adolescence with women who smelled of dead flowers, whom he idealized in the darkness and changed into Amaranta by means of the anxious efforts of his imagination.","You've been an adult for a long time, ever since the day Amaranta thought you were still a child and continued to bathe naked in front of you, just as she had done ever since Pila Tecnêra returned you to the family, shedding her responsibility to raise you. The first time you saw her bathing, you only noticed the deep groove between the two nipples on her chest. At that time, you were so innocent that you had to ask her what was wrong with her chest, and Amaranta pretended to scratch her chest with her finger and replied to you, ""I was carved, carved by someone. "" Later, after recovering from the illness caused by Piêtrô Crêspi's suicide, she bathed together with Aurêlianô Hôsê in the bathroom again. You no longer noticed the deep groove but instead shivered with strange delight at the sight of her pink, plump breasts. You continued to watch her and thus understood more deeply the strange intimacy between the two of you, feeling goosebumps on your skin as you watched her, just as her skin would get goosebumps when she poured water over herself. From a very young age, you had the habit of leaving your hammock empty all night to wake up on Amaranta's bed, because lying next to her, you were less afraid of the dark. But ever since you became aware of the pleasure of her ivory body, the motivation for leaving your hammock to crawl into her mosquito net was not the fear of the dark but the desire to feel Amaranta's warm breath at dawn. During the period when she was rejecting Colonel Hêrinênđô Mackêt, one early morning, Aurêlianô Hôsê woke up feeling suffocated. You felt Amaranta's fingers, like silkworms, hot and eager, searching your belly. Pretending to still be asleep, you shifted your position so they wouldn't encounter any obstacles on their path, and at that moment you realized that the five fingers of the hand without the black band, like blind snails, were groping between your thighs. Although both of you pretended not to know what you both knew and what each knew the other knew, from that night on, you were bound together in a wonderful understanding. Aurêlianô Hôsê couldn't sleep until he heard the waltz music from the clock in the living room, and the aging woman, whose skin began to feel numb, wouldn't be at peace until she felt the sleepwalker crawl into her mosquito net. She had raised him without thinking that he would become a temporary anchor for her loneliness. So they not only slept in the same bed, naked, craving each other's touch, but also followed each other around the house, staying in closed rooms at any time, always eagerly and never bored. Once, they were almost caught by Ucsula. One afternoon, she entered the cornmeal storeroom just as they were about to kiss. ""You love your aunt very much, don't you?"" she asked Aurêlianô Hôsê with utmost innocence. He replied, ""Yes,"" to his grandmother. ""Good boy,"" Ucsula concluded, measuring out flour to make bread before returning to the kitchen. This incident pulled Amaranta out of her frenzy. She realized that she had gone too far, that she was no longer kissing him as a child in play, but was instead wading through a dangerous, unhealthy passion with no way out, and she resolutely decided to extinguish this passion. At the same time, Aurêlianô Hôsê, having finished his military training, realized the truth and left home to sleep in the barracks. Every Saturday, he would go with the soldiers to Catarinô's shop. He found solace with the painted women, always imagining they were Amaranta.",18.93,18.77,"Aureliano Jose had already grown up. He had grown up since the day Amaranta, still seeing him as a child, continued to undress in front of him in the bathroom as usual. Since the day Pilar Ternera brought him to be raised, Amaranta would always undress in front of Aureliano Jose. When the child first saw her, the only thing that caught his eye was the deep hollow between her breasts. He was so innocent that he asked Amaranta why this hollow existed. Amaranta, pressing her fingertips to her breasts, ""They cut it off,"" he said. As time passed, and Amaranta seemed to forget the pain of Pietro Crespi's suicide and began bathing with Aureliano Jose again, the child no longer paid attention to the hollow between her breasts. Now, when he saw those beautiful breasts with their dark tips, he began to feel a strange shiver. He continued to examine Amaranta, learning the miracle of her intimate places millimeter by millimeter, and just as Amaranta's skin shivered when she entered the water, Aureliano Jose began to shiver as he looked at her. Since his childhood, he would get up from his hammock at night and wake up in the morning in Amaranta's arms. When he lay down next to Amaranta, his fear of the dark would disappear. However, from the day he became aware of his own nakedness, the feeling that drew Aureliano Jose under Amaranta's mosquito net was not the fear of the dark, but the longing to hear Amaranta's warm breath at dawn. In the days when Amaranta rejected Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, one morning Aureliano Jose woke up with a start, thinking he had lost his breath. He sensed Amaranta's fingers wandering on his stomach like warm and curious caterpillars. Pretending to be asleep, he turned in a way that made it easier for the fingers to wander. Then he felt the unbandaged hand dive into the sea of curiosity and excitement that was turning his head, like a blind oyster among the seaweed at the bottom. Ignoring what they both knew and that they knew it about each other, they entered into an unbreakable complicity after that night. Aureliano Jose couldn't sleep until the clock in the living room struck midnight, and the aging girl, whose skin was starting to fade, writhed until she heard the child she had raised slip under the mosquito net. He didn't even think that he would only temporarily alleviate his own loneliness. Later, not only did they lie naked, entwined, with breath-taking caresses; they began to chase each other around the house at all hours of the day, locking themselves in bedrooms in a state of constant, unfulfilled tension. One day, they were almost caught by Ursula. They had hidden in the barn and were just about to kiss when Ursula came in and innocently turned to Aureliano Jose and asked, ""Do you love your aunt very much?"" Aureliano Jose said that he loved her very much. Ursula, saying ""Good for you,"" measured the flour she had taken out of the sack for bread and returned to the kitchen. This event pulled Amaranta out of the madness she had fallen into. She realized that she had gone too far, that what started as a kissing game with a child had turned into a passion of her later years; that it was dangerous and would lead nowhere, so she abruptly ended it. At that time, Aureliano Jose, who was about to complete his military training, finally faced reality and started living in the barracks. On Saturdays, he would go to Catarino's shop with the soldiers. In his sudden loneliness, his prematurely bursting adolescence, he sought solace in women who smelled of wilted flowers. He would fit these women into the image in his mind in the dark, straining his imagination to see them as Amaranta.",19.644,19.485,"It had been so for a long time, since that distant day when Amaranta believed he was still a child and continued undressing in the bathroom in front of him, as she had always done, as she had become accustomed to doing since Pilar Ternera handed him over to her to finish raising him. The first time he saw her, the only thing that caught his attention was the deep depression between her breasts. He was so innocent then that he asked what had happened to her, and Amaranta pretended to dig into her chest with her fingertips and replied, ""They took slices and slices and slices out of me. "" Later, when she recovered from Pietro Crespi's suicide and resumed bathing with Aureliano José, he no longer noticed the depression but instead felt an unfamiliar shudder at the sight of her splendid breasts with purple nipples. He continued examining her, discovering inch by inch the miracle of her intimacy, and felt his skin bristle in contemplation, just as her skin bristled at the touch of the water. Since he was very young, he had the habit of leaving his hammock to wake up in Amaranta's bed, whose touch had the virtue of dispelling his fear of the dark. But from the day he became aware of her nakedness, it was not the fear of the dark that drove him to crawl under her mosquito net, but the longing to feel Amaranta's warm breath at dawn. One early morning, around the time she rejected Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, Aureliano José woke up with the sensation that he was out of breath. He felt Amaranta's fingers like warm, anxious little worms seeking his belly. Pretending to sleep, he changed position to eliminate any difficulty, and then he felt the hand without the black bandage diving like a blind mollusk among the algae of his anxiety. Although they pretended to ignore what they both knew, and what each knew the other knew, from that night on they were bound by an inviolable complicity. Aureliano José could not fall asleep until he heard the twelve o'clock waltz from the clock in the living room, and the mature maiden whose skin was beginning to sadden did not have a moment of peace until she felt that sleepwalker she had raised slipping into the mosquito net, without thinking he would become a palliative for her loneliness. Then they not only slept together, naked, exchanging exhausting caresses, but they chased each other around the corners of the house and locked themselves in the bedrooms at any hour, in a permanent state of unrelieved exaltation. They were almost caught by Úrsula one afternoon when she entered the barn just as they were beginning to kiss. ""Do you love your aunt very much?"" she asked Aureliano José innocently. He replied that he did. ""You do well,"" Úrsula concluded, and finished measuring the flour for the bread and returned to the kitchen. That episode brought Amaranta out of her delirium. She realized she had gone too far, that she was no longer playing kisses with a child, but floundering in a dangerous, autumnal passion with no future, and she cut it off abruptly. Aureliano José, who was then finishing his military training, eventually accepted reality and went to sleep at the barracks. On Saturdays, he went with the soldiers to Catarino's store. He consoled himself for his abrupt loneliness, for his premature adolescence, with women who smelled of dead flowers, whom he idealized in the darkness and transformed into Amaranta through anxious efforts of imagination.",45.93,45.85
307,"A short time later contradictory news of the war began to come in. While the government itself admitted the progress of the rebellion, the officers in Macondo had confidential reports of the imminence of a negotiated peace. Toward the first of April a special emissary identified himself to Colonel Gerineldo Márquez. He confirmed the fact to him that the leaders of the party had indeed established contact with the rebel leaders in the interior and were on the verge of arranging an armistice in exchange for three cabinet posts for the Liberals, a minority representation in the congress, and a general amnesty for rebels who laid down their arms. The emissary brought a highly confidential order from Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who was not in agreement with the terms of the armistice. Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was to choose five of his best men and prepare to leave the country with them. The order would be carried out with the strictest secrecy. One week before the agreement was announced, and in the midst of a storm of contradictory rumors, Colonel Aureliano Buendía and ten trusted officers, among them Colonel Roque Carnicero, stealthily arrived in Macondo after midnight, dismissed the garrison, buried their weapons, and destroyed their records. By dawn they had left town, along with Colonel Gerineldo Márquez and his five officers. It was such a quick and secret operation that Úrsula did not find out about it until the last moment, when someone tapped on her bedroom window and whispered, “If you want to see Colonel Aureliano Buendía, come to the door right now.” Úrsula Jumped out of bed and went to the door in her nightgown and she was just able to see the horsemen who were leaving town gallop off in a mute cloud of dust. Only on the following day did she discover that Aureliano José had gone with his father.","Shortly thereafter, contradictory war news began to be circulated. While the government acknowledged the new advances of the insurgent forces, the officers in Macondo received reliable notifications about an inevitable truce negotiated by both sides. At the beginning of April, a trusted messenger came to meet with Colonel Gerineldo Márquez. This person assured the colonel that the party leaders had made contact with the insurgent commanders in the interior and were ready to sign a truce agreement on the condition that the government would grant the Liberal faction three ministerial seats, a minimum number of representatives in parliament, and general amnesty for the insurgents who had laid down their arms. The messenger carried a highly confidential order from Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who did not approve of the terms of the agreement. Colonel Herinendo Marquez had to choose the five best men and prepare to flee abroad. This order was carried out in the shortest possible time. A week before the agreement was announced, amidst the chaos of various rumors, Colonel Aureliano Buendía and his ten most trusted officers, including Colonel Roque Carnicero, quietly returned to Macondo at midnight, disbanded the army, buried the weapons, and discarded the documents. At dawn, along with Colonel Herinendo Marquez and his five subordinates, they left the village. It was a campaign carried out so quickly and secretly that Úrsula knew nothing until the last moment when someone lightly tapped on her bedroom window and whispered: ""If you want to see Colonel Aureliano Buendía, please come to the door immediately."" Úrsula sprang up, still in her nightclothes, stepped to the door, and barely managed to recognize the sound of the horses' hooves as the group quietly rode out of the village, leaving a cloud of dust behind. It wasn't until the next day that she learned Aureliano José had gone with his father.",28.318,28.065,"Shortly after, conflicting news about the war began to arrive. On one hand, the government was admitting that the uprising was growing and spreading; on the other hand, the officers in Macondo were receiving secret reports that negotiations should be held immediately and peace should be declared. In early April, a special envoy arrived for Colonel Gerineldo Marquez. The envoy confirmed that party leaders had established contact with rebel leaders in the interior of the country and were negotiating a ceasefire agreement in exchange for three ministerial seats for the Liberals, representation of the minority in the House of Representatives, and a general amnesty for rebels who laid down their arms. The envoy also brought a very secret order from Colonel Aureliano Buendia, who did not accept the terms of the ceasefire. According to the order, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez was to take his five best men and leave the country. This order was to be carried out with absolute secrecy. A week before the announcement of the agreement, when there were conflicting reports from everywhere, Colonel Aureliano Buendia, along with ten trusted officers including Colonel Roque Carnicero, secretly arrived in Macondo after midnight, disbanded the military, buried the weapons, and destroyed the documents. Before dawn broke, they left, taking Colonel Gerineldo Marquez and his five men with them. All of this happened so quickly and secretly that even Ursula only learned of it at the last moment, when someone tapped on her window and whispered, ""If you want to see Colonel Aureliano Buendia, come to the door immediately."" Ursula jumped out of bed and rushed to the door in her nightgown. She could barely make out the horsemen galloping away from the village, leaving a cloud of dust behind them.

One night, from a ship, he shelled the city of Riohacha, and the patrol had to wake up in the middle of the night, retaliating by shooting fourteen prominent Liberals imprisoned in the city. He occupied a customs house on the border for more than fifteen days, and from there he sent a call for a general uprising to the nation. One of his battalions got lost in the jungle for three months, as this unit had the mission to traverse more than fifteen hundred kilometers of forest to ignite battles around the capital. At times, he was only a few dozen kilometers from Macondo, but government patrols forced him to retreat deep into the mountains, not far from the intriguing spot where, many years earlier, his father had found the remains of a Spanish galleon.",22.927,22.468,"Ten days after the joint declaration by the government and the opposition that the war had ended, news came of Colonel Aureliano Buendia's first armed uprising on the western frontier.

Colonel Aureliano Buendia held one of the customs outposts at the border for more than two weeks and called for a general war across the nation. An expedition he undertook to wage war on the outskirts of the capital resulted in his men disappearing for three months during a frantic effort to clear a path through virgin forests over fifteen hundred kilometers deep.

She had the pleasure of dying a natural death after having renounced a throne out of fear of insomnia, and her last wish was that they should dig up the wages she had saved for more than twenty years under her bed and send the money to Colonel Aureliano Buendía so that he could go on with the war. But Úrsula did not bother to dig it up because it was rumored in those days that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had been killed in a landing near the provincial capital. The official announcement—the fourth in less than two years—was considered true for almost six months because nothing further was heard of him. Suddenly, when Úrsula and Amaranta had added new mourning to the past period, unexpected news arrived. Colonel Aureliano Buendía was alive, but apparently he had stopped harassing the government of his country and had joined with the victorious federalism of other republics of the Caribbean. He would show up under different names farther and farther away from his own country. Later it would be learned that the idea that was working on him at the time was the unification of the federalist forms of Central America in order to wipe out conservative regimes from Alaska to Patagonia. The first direct news that Úrsula received from him, several years after his departure, was a wrinkled and faded letter that had arrived, passing through various hands, from Santiago, Cuba.","During this time, Visitacion also passed away. After giving up the throne due to fear of the insomnia epidemic, she wished to die of old age, and her final wish was for people to dig up the savings she had accumulated over several decades buried under her bed and send it to Colonel Aureliano Buendía so he could continue fighting. But Úrsula did not allow the money to be dug up, because at that time there were rumors that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had died in a landing operation on the outskirts of the provincial capital. The official announcement, the fourth in less than two years, indicated that this was evident because for nearly six months, there had been no news about him. Suddenly, while Úrsula and Amaranta were mourning their ancestors anew, a strange piece of news arrived. Colonel Aureliano was still alive, but it was clear he was not siding with his own government, as he had joined the federal forces that were prevailing in several other Caribbean countries. He went to lands with different names, increasingly unfamiliar compared to the name of his homeland. It was later learned that the idea inspiring him at that moment was the idea of uniting the federal forces of Central America to sweep away the royalist regimes from Alaska to Patagonia.

However, since news arrived that Colonel Aureliano Buendia had been killed while stationed near the provincial capital, Ursula did not bother to unearth the money. The government communiqué announcing the colonel's death - the fourth such announcement in the last two years - was taken as fact for up to six months, as there was no news from the colonel. Just as Ursula and Amaranta were about to add a new mourning to the past ones, unexpected news arrived. Colonel Aureliano Buendia was alive.

311,"The person to whom she said it, who was the first to whom she showed the letter, was the Conservative general José Raquel Moncada, mayor of Macondo since the end of the war. “This Aureliano,” General Moncada commented, “what a pity that he’s not a Conservative.” He really admired him. Like many Conservative civilians, José Raquel Moncada had waged war in defense of his party and had earned the title of general on the field of battle, even though he was not a military man by profession. On the contrary, like so many of his fellow party members, he was an antimilitarist. He considered military men unprincipled loafers, ambitious plotters, experts in facing down civilians in order to prosper during times of disorder. Intelligent, pleasant, ruddy-faced, a man who liked to eat and watch cockfights, he had been at one time the most feared adversary of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. He succeeded in imposing his authority over the career officers in a wide sector along the coast. One time when he was forced by strategic circumstances to abandon a stronghold to the forces of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, he left two letters for him. In one of them quite long, he invited him to join in a campaign to make war more humane. The other letter was for his wife, who lived in Liberal territory, and he left it with a plea to see that it reached its destination. From then on, even in the bloodiest periods of the war, the two commanders would arrange truces to exchange prisoners. They were pauses with a certain festive atmosphere, which General Moncada took advantage of to teach Colonel Aureliano Buendía how to play chess. They became great friends. They even came to think about the possibility of coordinating the popular elements of both parties, doing away with the influence of the military men and professional politicians, and setting up a humanitarian regime that would take the best from each doctrine. When the war was over, while Colonel Aureliano, Buendía was sneaking about through the narrow trails of permanent sub. version, General Moncada was named magistrate of Macondo. He wore civilian clothes, replaced the soldiers with unarmed policemen, enforced the amnesty laws, and helped a few families of Liberals who had been killed in the war. He succeeded in having Macondo raised to the status of a municipality and he was therefore its first mayor, and he created an atmosphere of confidence that made people think of the war as an absurd nightmare of the past. Father Nicanor, consumed by hepatic fever, was replaced by Father Coronel, whom they called “The Pup,” a veteran of the first federalist war. Bruno Crespi, who was married to Amparo Mos. cote, and whose shop of toys and musical instruments continued to prosper, built a theater which Spanish companies included in their Itineraries. It was a vast open-air hall with wooden benches, a velvet curtain with Greek masks, and three box offices in the shape of lions’ heads, through whose mouths the tickets were sold. It was also about that time that the school was rebuilt. It was put under the charge of Don Melchor Escalona, an old teacher brought from the swamp, who made his lazy students walk on their knees in the lime-coated courtyard and made the students who talked in class eat hot chili with the approval of their parents. Aureliano Segundo and José Arcadio Segundo, the willful twins of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, were the first to sit in the classroom, with their slates, their chalk, and their aluminum jugs with their names on them. Remedios, who inherited her mother’s pure beauty, began to be known as Remedios the Beauty. In spite of time, of the superimposed Periods of mourning, and her accumulated afflictions, Úrsula resisted growing old. Aided by Santa Sofía de la Piedad, she gave a new drive to her pastry business and in a few years not only recovered the fortune that her son had spent in the war, but she once more stuffed with pure gold the gourds buried in the bedroom. “As long as God gives me life,” she would say, “there will always be money in this madhouse.” That was how things were when Aureliano José deserted the federal troops in Nicaragua, signed on as a crewman on a German ship, and appeared in the kitchen of the house, sturdy as a horse, as dark and long-haired as an Indian, and with a secret determination to marry Amaranta.","The person whom the elder spoke to, the first person he showed the letter to, was General José Raquén Moncada, a member of the Royalist faction. ""It's a pity,"" General Moncada commented, ""that this Aureliano is not a Royalist. "" He genuinely admired him. Like many Royalist civil officials, José Raquén Moncada had fought to defend his party and had risen to the rank of general in combat, despite not having strategic talent. On the contrary, like many in his party, he was opposed to the militaristic regime. He viewed the military class as a group of undisciplined, lazy, adventurous, and greedy individuals with experience in opposing civil officials to enrich themselves in chaotic situations. Intelligent, courteous, with a rosy complexion, a lover of good food and cockfighting, he had once been the most formidable enemy of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. He had established his command over professional military personnel throughout this vast coastal region. Once, due to strategic agreements, he had to withdraw his troops from a town to hand it over to Colonel Aureliano Buendía's forces, leaving two letters for him. In a long letter to the colonel, he invited him to join a joint campaign to make the war less brutal. The other letter he asked the colonel to deliver to his wife, who lived in an area controlled by the Liberal forces. Since then, even during the fiercest battles, the two commanders had agreed to ceasefires to exchange prisoners. These were truce moments so cheerful that General Moncada took advantage of the time to teach Colonel Aureliano Buendía how to play checkers. There were times when both men considered the possibility of combining the popular elements within both parties to eliminate the influence of professional military and political figures and establish a humane regime by fully exploiting the advantages of each doctrine. When the war ended, while Colonel Aureliano Buendía frequently faced defeat and had to flee through ravines, General Moncada was appointed Inspector General in the village of Macondo. He dressed in civilian clothes, used unarmed police instead of the militia, enforced respect for all amnesty regulations, and assisted families of fallen Liberals. He did everything he could to have Macondo chosen as a county town, and thus he was appointed mayor and cultivated an atmosphere of mutual trust among the populace, making them think of the war as a meaningless hardship of the past. Father Nicanor, emaciated by liver fever, was replaced by Father Coronel, nicknamed El Cachorro, a veteran of the Federalist wars. Bruno Crespi had married Amparo Moscote. Thanks to his ever-prospering toy and musical instrument store, he built a theater that Spanish touring companies included in their itineraries. It was an open-air salon with long wooden benches, a felt backdrop adorned with Greek masks, and three ticket booths shaped like lion heads through whose open mouths tickets were sold to customers. During this period, the school was also built. Don Mencho Escalona, an old teacher, was sent from the swamps to oversee the school. With the consent of the parents, he made the unruly boys kneel and walk on the gravelly yard and forced the talkative children to eat hot peppers. Aureliano Segundo and José Arcadio Segundo, the twin sons of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, were the first students to sit in the classroom with a blackboard, chalk, and aluminum cups engraved with their names. Remedios inherited her mother's true beauty and began to be known by the name Remedios the Beauty. Despite her old age, despite having endured many bereavements and numerous hardships, Úrsula remained as vigorous as ever. With the help of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, she resumed her candy business and in a short time, not only recovered the wealth her son had squandered during the war, but also filled dried gourds with pure gold and buried them in her bedroom. ""As long as God lets me live,"" - the old man often said, - ""there will never be a shortage of money in this house of lunatics."" Everything was going smoothly like that, when suddenly Auréliano José deserted the ranks of the federal army of Nicaragua, escaped onto a German ship, and then appeared right in his own kitchen. He returned healthy as a horse, tanned and with thick hair like an Indian, with the secret intention of marrying Amaranta.",24.343,24.229,"The person to whom Ursula said these words and first showed the letter was Conservative General Jose Raquel Moncada, who had been the mayor of Macondo since the end of the war. General Moncada expressed his opinion, ""It's a pity that this Aureliano is not a Conservative."" He truly admired her. Like most conservative civilians, Jose Raquel Moncada had joined the war to defend his party and, despite not being a professional officer, he had earned the title of general due to his usefulness on the battlefield. However, like most of his colleagues in the party, he was against the war. He viewed soldiers as idle individuals with no principles, greedy schemers, and experts at intimidating civilians to live in luxury during times of chaos. Moncada, cultured, intelligent, pleasant, rosy-cheeked, and fond of food and cockfights, was once considered Colonel Aureliano Buendia's most feared rival. He had managed to establish his own authority over professional officers in the vast region along the coast. On one occasion, when he was forced to withdraw from a region they held due to strategic circumstances, he left two letters for Colonel Aureliano Buendia. In one of the rather long letters, he was calling on the colonel to join the campaign to conduct the war under more humane conditions. He had written the second letter to his wife, who was in the region dominated by the Liberals, and placed it next to the colonel's letter with the hope that it would be delivered. From that day on, even during the bloodiest periods of the war, the two commanders would occasionally cease fire and exchange war prisoners. These ceasefire periods became breathers that brought a certain festive atmosphere, and General Moncada took advantage of these opportunities to teach Colonel Aureliano Buendia how to play chess. They became good friends. Gradually, they even planned to unite the beloved and respected elements of both parties, to free the soldiers from the influence of professional politicians, and to establish a humane order that encompassed the best aspects of each doctrine. After the war, while Colonel Aureliano Buendia was trying to navigate the harsh paths of successive defeats, General Moncada was appointed as a justice of the peace. He took off his uniform and put on civilian clothes, replaced the soldiers with unarmed police officers, implemented amnesty laws, and helped the families of a few Liberals who died in the war. He ensured that Macondo became a district and thus became its first mayor. And he brought security, peace, and order to the people to such an extent that they thought the war was a meaningless nightmare of the past. Father Coronel, who had participated in the first federalist war and was nicknamed Bear Fish, replaced Father Nicanor, who died of liver disease. Bruno Crespi, who married Amparo Moscote and developed his music instruments and toy shop day by day, had a theater built. Spanish theater companies on tour began to give performances there. The open-air theater consisted of wooden benches, a stage with velvet curtains adorned with Greek masks, and three ticket booths shaped like lion heads. Tickets were obtained from the lion's mouth. At around this time, the school was also rebuilt. Don Melchor Escalona, who was brought in from the swampy region, was put in charge of the school. Escalona made lazy students walk on their knees in the lime-plastered courtyard and filled the mouths of those who talked during class with hot pepper. The children's parents did not object to these actions. The mischievous twins of Santa Sofia de la Piedad, Aureliano Segundo and Jose Arcadio Segundo, were the first students to arrive in class with their slate boards, chalks, and aluminum canteens with their names written on them. Remedios, who had inherited her mother's unique beauty, became known as Beautiful Remedios. Despite time, successive periods of mourning, and a heap of sorrows, Ursula resisted aging. With the help of Santa Sofia de la Piedad, Ursula accelerated her pastry-making again, and within a few years, not only did she rebuild the fortune her son had squandered in the war, but she also refilled the jars buried in the bedroom with glittering gold. ""As long as God gives me life, there will be no shortage of money in this madhouse,"" she said. It was during this time that Aureliano Jose, having fled the federal troops in Nicaragua and signed on as a crew member of a German ship, appeared in the kitchen of the house. Aureliano Jose was as strong as a horse, as dark-skinned as a native, and had long hair, and he had secretly decided to marry Amaranta.",26.971,26.863,"The person to whom he said it, who was the first to whom he showed the letter, was the conservative general José Raquel Moncada, mayor of Macondo since the war ended.""This Aureliano,"" commented General Moncada, ""it's a pity he's not a conservative. "" He truly admired him. Like many conservative civilians, José Raquel Moncada had fought the war in defense of his party and had achieved the title of general on the battlefield, although he lacked a military vocation. On the contrary, also like many of his fellow party members, he was anti-militarist. He considered military people to be lazy, unprincipled, intriguing, and ambitious, experts in pitting civilians against each other to thrive in disorder. Intelligent, likable, sanguine, a man of good appetite and a fan of cockfights, he had at one point been the most formidable adversary of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. He managed to impose his authority over career military officers in a large sector of the coast. Once, when he was forced by strategic conveniences to abandon a position to the forces of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, he left him two letters. In one of them, very extensive, he invited him to a joint campaign to humanize the war. The other letter was for his wife, who lived in liberal territory, and he left it with the plea to ensure it reached its destination. Since then, even during the most intense periods of the war, the two commanders arranged truces to exchange prisoners.

They even came to consider the possibility of coordinating the popular elements of both parties to eliminate the influence of the military and professional politicians, and to establish a humanitarian regime that would take the best from each doctrine. When the war ended, while Colonel Aureliano Buendía was slipping through the ravines of permanent subversion, General Moncada was appointed corregidor of Macondo. He donned his civilian suit, replaced the military with unarmed police agents, enforced the amnesty laws, and assisted some families of liberals who had died in the campaign. He managed to have Macondo established as a municipality and thus became its first mayor, creating an atmosphere of trust that made people think of the war as an absurd nightmare of the past. Father Nicanor, consumed by hepatic fevers, was replaced by Father Coronel, known as El Cachorro, a veteran of the first federalist war.

It was a vast open-air hall, with wooden benches, a velvet curtain with Greek masks, and three ticket booths shaped like lion heads through whose open mouths tickets were sold. It was also around this time that the school building was restored. It was taken over by Don Melchor Escalona, an old teacher sent from the swamp, who made undisciplined students walk on their knees in the caliche yard and made the talkative ones eat hot chili peppers, with the parents' approval. Aureliano Segundo and José Arcadio Segundo, the determined twins of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, were the first to sit in the classroom with their slates, chalks, and aluminum mugs marked with their names. Remedios, inheritor of her mother's pure beauty, was beginning to be known as Remedios the Beautiful. Despite the time, the overlapping mourning periods, and accumulated afflictions, Úrsula resisted aging. Helped by Santa Sofía de la Piedad, she had given a new impetus to her pastry business, and not only recovered in a few years the fortune her son had spent in the war, but also refilled the pure gold gourds buried in the bedroom. "" As long as God gives me life,"" she used to say, ""there will be no lack of money in this house of madness. "" That was how things were when Aureliano José deserted from the federalist troops of Nicaragua, enlisted in the crew of a German ship, and appeared in the kitchen of the house, solid as a horse, dark and hairy like an Indian, with the secret determination to marry Amaranta.",50.536,50.479
312,"When Amaranta, saw him come in, even though he said nothing she knew immediately why he had come back. At the table they did not dare look each other in the face. But two weeks after his return, in the presence of Úrsula, he set his eyes on hers and said to her, “I always thought a lot about you.” Amaranta avoided him. She guarded against chance meetings. She tried not to become separated from Remedios the Beauty. She was ashamed of the blush that covered her cheeks on the day her nephew asked her how long she intended wearing the black bandage on her hand, for she interpreted it as an allusion to her virginity. When he arrived, she barred the door of her bedroom, but she heard his peaceful snoring in the next room for so many nights that she forgot about the precaution. Early one morning, almost two months after his return, she heard him come into the bedroom. Then, instead of fleeing, instead of shouting as she had thought she would, she let herself be saturated with a soft feeling of relaxation. She felt him slip in under the mosquito netting as he had done when he was a child, as he had always done, and she could not repress her cold sweat and the chattering of her teeth when she realized that he was completely naked. “Go away,” she whispered, suffocating with curiosity. “Go away or I’ll scream.” But Aureliano José knew then what he had to do, because he was no longer a child but a barracks animal. Starting with that night the dull, inconsequential battles began again and would go on until dawn. “I’m your aunt,” Amaranta murmured, spent. “It’s almost as if I were your mother, not just because of my age but because the only thing I didn’t do for you was nurse you.” Aureliano would escape at dawn and come back early in the morning on the next day, each time more excited by the proof that she had not barred the door. He had nit stopped desiring her for a single instant. He found her in the dark bedrooms of captured towns, especially in the most abject ones, and he would make her materialize in the smell of dry blood on the bandages of the wounded, in the instantaneous terror of the danger of death, at all times and in all places. He had fled from her in an attempt to wipe out her memory, not only through distance but by means of a muddled fury that his companions at arms took to be boldness, but the more her image wallowed in the dunghill of the war, the more the war resembled Amaranta. That was how he suffered in exile, looking for a way of killing her with, his own death, until he heard some old man tell the tale of the man who had married his aunt, who was also his cousin, and whose son ended up being his own grandfather.","When Amaranta saw him walk in, even though he hadn't said anything, she immediately knew why he had returned. They sat at the same table but didn't dare look each other in the face. But after two weeks of being back, even with Ursula present, he still looked her straight in the eyes and said, ""I always think of you, my dear. ""Amaranta fled from him. She guessed and maneuvered to avoid encountering him in unexpected places and times. She clung to Remedios the Beauty, not leaving her side for a moment. She blushed with shame the day her nephew asked how long she would keep wearing the black ribbon on her arm, because she understood the question as a hint about her chastity. When he returned home, she immediately locked her bedroom door. But for many nights, hearing his gentle, steady snoring from the next room, she felt so reassured that she let her guard down. Nearly two months after Aureliano José returned, one night towards dawn, she felt him enter her room. Instead of fleeing or screaming as she had planned, she surrendered herself to a light feeling of rest and satisfaction. She felt him crawling into the bed, just as he had since he was a child, as he always had, and she couldn't stop the cold sweat and chattering teeth when she realized he was completely naked. ""Get out!"" she whispered, feeling like she was suffocating from curiosity. ""Get out or I'll scream. ""But Aureliano José knew exactly what he needed to do, because he was no longer a boy afraid of the dark but a seasoned soldier. From that night on, they continued their silent struggles until dawn. ""I am your aunt,"" Amaranta whispered wearily. ""I am almost like your mother, not just because of my age but because I raised you and taught you everything, except breastfeeding you. ""At dawn, Aureliano slipped away, and the next night towards dawn, he returned to her room, increasingly pleased to find her door still unlocked. There was never a moment when he didn't love his aunt intensely. He often saw her image in the dark rooms of occupied villages, especially the most squalid ones, and recognized her physically through the smell of dried blood on the bandages of the wounded, in the sudden fear of death. He saw his aunt everywhere and at all times. He had fled from his aunt by deliberately erasing his memories, not only through the vast distance but also through the blood-curdling battles that his comrades had ranked among the most terrifying. However, the more he tried to erase his aunt's image in the horrors of war, the more the war resembled Amaranta. Thus, he painfully lived in exile, trying to kill his aunt by his own death until he heard a soldier tell a fairy tale about a man who married his own aunt, who was also his niece, and whose son was his own great-uncle.",23.896,23.72,"When Amaranta saw him come in, she understood why he had come, even though he hadn't said anything yet. They couldn't look each other in the face at the table. However, two weeks after his arrival, Aureliano Jose, in front of Ursula, staring into Amaranta's eyes, suddenly said, ""I've always thought of you."" Amaranta kept her distance from him, avoided unexpected encounters, and tried to keep Beautiful Remedios by her side. When her nephew asked her how long she intended to keep the black bandage on her hand, she blushed with shame. Because she saw this bandage as a symbol of her virginity. After Aureliano Jose arrived, Amaranta began to bolt the door of her bedroom. However, hearing the comfortable snores coming from the adjacent room every night, she eventually forgot to bolt the door. About two months after Aureliano Jose's arrival, one morning Amaranta heard him enter the room. Then, instead of screaming or running away as she had previously thought she would, she sank into a soft comfort. He heard Aureliano José slip under the mosquito net as he always did when he was a child, and when he realized the young man was completely naked, he couldn't stop himself from breaking out in a cold sweat and his teeth chattering. Breathless with curiosity, he whispered, -Go away, or I'll scream. However, Aureliano José knew exactly what he had to do. Because he was no longer a child; he had become a barracks stallion. That night, the silent and noisy struggles began again and lasted until dawn. Amaranta, losing herself, said, -I am your aunt. -I am practically your mother, not just because I am older, but because the only thing I didn't do was breastfeed you; beyond that, I mothered you, she said. Aureliano would leave at dawn, come back the next morning, and each time he came, he was even more excited by the fact that Amaranta didn't bolt the door. His desire for her had not diminished for a moment. In the dark bedrooms of the occupied cities, in the most wretched of bedrooms, he had found Amaranta, sensed Amaranta in the dried blood smell of the bandages of the wounded, lived Amaranta in the momentary terror of the danger of death, dreamed of her everywhere, all the time. He had fled from her to forget her; not only going far away but also throwing himself forward with a fury that his comrades called recklessness, yet the more he tried to bury Amaranta's image in the filth of war, the more the war resembled Amaranta. During his time in hiding, Aureliano Jose had writhed in these pains, seeking ways to kill himself and thus kill the image of Amaranta. One day, he had listened to a tale from an old man.",24.341,24.17,"When Amaranta saw him enter, without him having said anything, she immediately knew why he had returned. At the table, they did not dare to look each other in the face. But two weeks after his return, with Úrsula present, he fixed his eyes on hers and said, ""I always thought a lot about you. ""Amaranta avoided him. She guarded against casual encounters. She tried not to separate from Remedios, the beautiful.

When he arrived, she bolted her bedroom door, but after so many nights of hearing his peaceful snores in the next room, she neglected that precaution.

He had fled from her, trying to annihilate her memory not only with distance but with a dazed ferocity that his comrades in arms described as recklessness, but the more he wallowed her image in the filth of war, the more the war resembled Amaranta.

He found a woman with flaccid breasts, affectionate and cheap, who calmed his stomach for some time. He tried to apply the treatment of disdain to Amaranta. He would see her on the porch working at the sewing machine, which she had learned to operate with admirable skill, and he would not even speak to her.

There, he had an affair with a woman with sagging breasts, who was friendly and easygoing, and who satisfied his hunger for a while. He intended to treat Amaranta badly. He saw her sitting in the hallway, working on a sewing machine—a skill she had learned very quickly—and he did not greet his aunt. Amaranta felt a weight lifted off her shoulders and she herself did not understand why she now thought of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, why she longed for the afternoons playing checkers, and why she wanted him to be her husband.

320,"A few months after the return of Aureliano José an exuberant woman perfumed with jasmine appeared at the house with a boy of five. She stated that he was the son of Colonel Aureliano Buendía and that she had brought him to Úrsula to be baptized. No one doubted the origins of that nameless child: he looked exactly like the colonel at the time he was taken to see ice for the first time. The woman said that he had been born with his eyes open, looking at people with the judgment of an adult, and that she was frightened by his way of staring at things without blinking. “He’s identical,” Úrsula said. “The only thing missing is for him to make chairs rock by simply looking at them.” They christened him Aureliano and with his mother’s last name, since the law did not permit a person to bear his father’s name until he had recognized him. General Moncada was the godfather. Although Amaranta insisted that he be left so that she could take over his upbringing, his mother was against it. Úrsula at that time did not know about the custom of sending virgins to the bedrooms of soldiers in the same way that hens are turned loose with fine roosters, but in the course of that year she found out: nine more sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía were brought to the house to be baptized. The oldest, a strange dark boy with green eyes, who was not at all like his father’s family, was over ten years old. They brought children of all ages, all colors, but all males and all with a look of solitude that left no doubt as to the relationship. Only two stood out in the group. One, large for his age, made smithereens out of the flowerpots and china because his hands seemed to have the property of breaking everything they touched. The other was a blond boy with the same light eyes as his mother, whose hair had been left to grow long and curly like that of a woman. He entered the house with a great deal of familiarity, as if he had been raised there, and he went directly to a chest in Úrsula’s bedroom and demanded, “I want the mechanical ballerina.” Úrsula was startled. She opened the chest, searched among the ancient and dusty articles left from the days of Melquíades, and wrapped in a pair of stockings she found the mechanical ballerina that Pietro Crespi had brought to the house once and that everyone had forgotten about. In less than twelve years they baptized with the name Aureliano and the last name of the mother all the sons that the colonel had implanted up and down his theater of war: seventeen. At first Úrsula would fill their pockets with money and Amaranta tried to have them stay. But they finally limited themselves to giving them presents and serving as godmothers. “We’ve done our duty by baptizing them,” Úrsula would say, jotting down in a ledger the name and address of the mother and the place and date of birth of the child. “Aureliano needs well-kept accounts so that he can decide things when he comes back.” During lunch, commenting with General Moncada about that disconcerting proliferation, she expressed the desire for Colonel Aureliano Buendía to come back someday and gather all of his sons together in the house.","A few months after Aureliano José returned, a woman with an open demeanor, smelling of jasmine, brought a five-year-old child to the house. She said that the child was the son of Colonel Aureliano Buendía and that she had brought him for Úrsula to name. No one doubted the origin of the unnamed child: he resembled the Colonel exactly as he did when his father took him to see the ice. The woman recounted that the boy was born with his eyes wide open, scrutinizing those around him with the inquisitiveness of an adult, and that she herself was startled by his unblinking, intense gaze. ""Exactly,"" said Ursula. ""The only thing missing is for the chair to spin around when he looks at it."" She named him with Aureliano's first name and his mother's last name, because the law did not allow a child to bear the father's last name if the father had not acknowledged him. Colonel Moncada agreed to be his godfather. Although Amaranta requested that the boy stay with the girl's family, the mother did not agree. At that time, Úrsula still did not know the custom of parents sending their virgin daughters to the bedrooms of warriors as if they were letting hens into the coop of handsome roosters. But after a whole year, she learned: nine more sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía were brought to the house to be named by her. The oldest, brown-skinned with blue eyes, did not resemble his paternal side at all, and was already ten years old. They brought children of all ages to the house, with all skin colors, but all were boys, and all seemed lonely—a characteristic that forced people to acknowledge their origins. One child, who was very mature for his age, broke several vases and some cups, as it seemed that whatever his clumsy hands touched, he broke. Another had red hair, with snail-like eyes just like his mother's, and wore his long hair tied up in bunches just like a woman's. This boy walked into the house very naturally, as if he had been raised there, and then went straight to the old cabinet in Úrsula's room and demanded, ""Give me the wind-up dancer."" Úrsula was startled. She opened the cabinet. After finding the dancer wrapped in a pair of stockings. It was a gift from Pietro Crespi and no one had remembered it. In less than twelve years, seventeen children, fathered by the colonel and scattered across the regions he passed through during the war, were named Aureliano along with their mothers' surnames. At first, Úrsula stuffed their pockets with money, and Amaranta wanted to keep them to raise. But both concluded that it was best to give each child a commemorative gift and accept to be their godmothers. ""We will just name them,"" Úrsula said as she recorded the names and addresses of the mothers, and the places and dates of the children's births in a notebook. ""Surely Aureliano has planned this, so he will decide everything when he returns."" During lunch, while commenting with General Moncada about this ""proliferation,"" she expressed her wish that Colonel Aureliano Buendía would have the opportunity to return and reunite with his children in his own home.",23.703,23.549,"A few months after Aureliano Jose's return, a flamboyant woman, smelling of jasmine, arrived at the door holding the hand of a five-year-old boy. She said that the boy was the son of Colonel Aureliano Buendia and that she had brought him to Ursula to be baptized. No one doubted the lineage of the unnamed child: He was the spitting image of the colonel. It was exactly like the time when Aureliano first saw ice. The woman described how the child was born: He was born with his eyes wide open. As soon as he was born, he fixed his eyes, which looked like those of a grown man, on the people around him, as if he were judging them. His unblinking stare frightened his mother. Ursula, ""Just like him,"" she said. ""The only thing missing is that he can't move the chairs with a glance."" They gave the child the name Aureliano and his mother's surname. Because according to the laws, until his father officially recognized him, the child could not take his father's surname. General Moncada became his godfather. Amaranta insisted a lot that she stay with them to take on the child's upbringing, but the child's mother opposed this. Ursula had not yet heard of the custom of sending virgins into the arms of soldiers, just as hens are let loose among roosters. But she learned it well within that year. Colonel Aureliano Buendia's nine sons were brought home to be baptized. The eldest, a dark-skinned, green-eyed boy who did not resemble his father at all, was no more than ten years old. They kept bringing children of every age and color, but all of them were boys and left no doubt about their paternity. Among those who came, only two showed distinct characteristics. One was large for his age and broke every piece of crockery and every pot in the house. It was as if his hands had the ability to break everything they touched. The other was a fair-haired boy with light-colored eyes like his mother. His hair was grown long and curled like a girl's. He entered the house with a familiarity as if he had been raised there, went straight to the console in Ursula's room, and said, ""I want the wind-up ballerina."" Ursula was taken aback. She opened the drawer, rummaged through the old, dusty knick-knacks from Melquiades' time, and found the wind-up ballerina wrapped in a pair of socks. Pietro Crespi had brought it to the house, and then everyone had forgotten about it. Within less than twelve years, the seventeen sons that the colonel had fathered on his battlefield were baptized with the name Aureliano and their mothers' surnames. At first, Ursula would fill the pockets of those who came with money, and Amaranta would try to keep them at home. But eventually, they started to be content with giving them gifts and becoming their godmothers. Ursula would record the mother's name, address, and the child's place and date of birth in a large ledger, saying, ""By baptizing them, we have done our part."" She would say, ""We need to keep the records well so that when Aureliano comes, he can make a decision easily."" While Ursula was discussing this surprising reproduction issue with General Moncada at dinner one day, she hinted that Colonel Aureliano Buendia deeply wished to return one day and gather all his sons at home.",21.325,21.159,"A few months after Aureliano José's return, an exuberant woman, scented with jasmine, arrived at the house with a child of about five years old.

The woman said that he was born with his eyes open, looking at people with the judgment of an adult, and that his way of staring at things without blinking frightened her. ""He is identical,"" said Úrsula. ""The only thing missing is for him to make the chairs move just by looking at them."" They baptized him with the name Aureliano, and with his mother's surname, because the law did not allow him to carry his father's surname unless he recognized him. General Moncada served as godfather. Although Amaranta insisted on keeping him to finish raising him, the mother refused. Úrsula was unaware at the time of the custom of sending maidens to the bedrooms of warriors, much like fine roosters are given hens, but over the course of that year, she found out: nine more sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía were brought to the house to be baptized. The eldest, a strange dark-skinned boy with green eyes who bore no resemblance to the paternal family, was over ten years old.

Captain Aquiles Ricardo, the commander of the garrison, took over the exercise of municipal power. The Liberals looked upon him as a provocateur. “Something terrible is going to happen,” Úrsula would say to Aureliano José. “Don’t go out into the street after six o’clock.” The entreaties were useless. Aureliano José, just like Arcadio in other times, had ceased to belong to her. It was as if his return home, the possibility of existing without concerning himself with everyday necessities, had awakened in him the lewd and lazy leanings of his uncle José Arcadio. His passion for Amaranta had been extinguished without leaving any scars. He would drift around, playing pool, easing his solitude with occasional women, sacking the hiding places where Úrsula had forgotten her money. He ended up coming home only to change his clothes. “They’re all alike,” Úrsula lamented. “At first they behave very well, they’re obedient and prompt and they don’t seem capable of killing a fly, but as soon as their beards appear they go to ruin.” Unlike Arcadio, who had never known his real origins, he found out that he was the son of Pilar Ternera, who had hung up a hammock so that he could take his siesta in her house. More than mother and son, they were accomplices in solitude. Pilar Ternera had lost the trail of all hope. Her laugh had taken on the tones of an organ, her breasts had succumbed to the tedium of endless caressing, her stomach and her thighs had been the victims of her irrevocable fate as a shared woman, but her heart grew old without bitterness. Fat, talkative, with the airs of a matron in disgrace, she renounced the sterile illusions of her cards and found peace and consolation in other people’s loves. In the house where Aureliano José took his siesta, the girls from the neighborhood would receive their casual lovers. “Lend me your room, Pilar,” they would simply say when they were already inside. “Of course,” Pilar would answer. And if anyone was present she would explain:","The political atmosphere became tense again, just like the political atmosphere of the months before the outbreak of the first war. The cockfights that were once encouraged by the mayor had been abolished. Captain Aquiles Ricardo, the commanding officer of the troops stationed in Macondo, took power and managed all affairs in the town. The Liberals accused him of being a provocateur. ""A terrible event will happen,"" Úrsula told Aureliano José. ""Do not go out after six in the evening, do you hear me?"" Her warnings all became useless. Aureliano José, just like Arcadio in the previous period, did not listen to his grandmother. It seems that this is the result of your return home, the result of an indifferent lifestyle towards the daily pressing tasks. It was these things that awakened in you the talent for womanizing and laziness of your uncle José Arcadio. Your wave of feelings for Amaranta had completely subsided, leaving no trace of injury. You indulged in somewhat debauched activities, sometimes playing billiards, sometimes relieving boredom with random women you encountered, sometimes embezzling money that Úrsula had forgotten in the desk drawer. You only returned home to change clothes, ""Children of this house, all of them are the same,"" Úrsula lamented. "" At first, they are raised very carefully, so they are all obedient, virtuous, and gentle, seemingly not even daring to kill a fly.

Her breasts had sagged, her belly and thighs had become flabby from being the victim of her inescapable fate as a promiscuous woman. But her heart resigned to aging without a hint of bitterness. She was a fat, talkative woman. With the emptiness of an unfortunate Madam, she had given up the hopeless illusion that the cards brought her, and she found solace in the love of others. In the house where Aureliano José napped, the neighboring girls entertained random lovers. ""Aunt Pilar, can I borrow a room?"" they would easily say to her once they were inside the house.

""They listen, do whatever they are told, and seem incapable of hurting even an ant."" ""But as soon as their beards grow, their morals deteriorate,"" she grumbled.

She had become like a plump, talkative, self-indulgent maternal housewife, had cast aside the empty dreams of the cards, and had begun to find peace and solace in the loves of others. In the house where Aureliano Jose took his afternoon naps, the neighboring girls would meet with their lovers. After entering without question, they would say, -Pilar, can we use your room for a while?

On the following day Colonel Aureliano Buendía had lunch with him in Úrsula’s house, where he was being held until a revolutionary court-martial decided his fate. It was a friendly gathering. But while the adversaries forgot the war to remember things of the past, Úrsula had the gloomy feeling that her son was an intruder. She had felt it ever since she saw him come in protected by a noisy military retinue, which turned the bedrooms inside out until they were convinced there was no danger. Colonel Aureliano Buendía not only accepted it but he gave strict orders that no one should come closer than ten feet, not even Úrsula, while the members of his escort finished placing guards about the house. He was wearing an ordinary denim uniform with no insignia of any kind and high boots with spurs that were caked with mud and dried blood. On his waist he wore a holster with the flap open and his hand, which was always on the butt of the pistol, revealed the same watchful and resolute tension as his look. His head, with deep recessions in the hairline now, seemed to have been baked in a slow oven. His face, tanned by the salt of the Caribbean, had acquired a metallic hardness. He was preserved against imminent old age by a vitality that had something to do with the coldness of his insides. He was taller than when he had left, paler and bonier, and he showed the first symptoms of resistance to nostalgia. “Good Lord,” Úrsula said to herself. “Now he looks like a man capable of anything.” He was. The Aztec shawl that he brought Amaranta, the remembrances he spoke of at lunch, the funny stories her told were simple leftovers from his humor of a different time. As soon as the order to bury the dead in a common grave was carried out, he assigned Colonel Roque Carnicero the minion of setting up courts-martial and he went ahead with the exhausting task of imposing radical reforms which would not leave a stone of the reestablished Conservative regime in place. “We have to get ahead of the politicians in the party,” he said to his aides. “When they open their eyes to reality they’ll find accomplished facts.” It was then that he decided to review the titles to land that went back a hundred years and he discovered the legalized outrages of his brother, José Arcadio. He annulled the registrations with a stroke of the pen. As a last gesture of courtesy, he left his affairs for an hour and visited Rebeca to bring her up to date on what he was determined to do.","That night he was captured while trying to flee Macondo after writing a long letter to Colonel Aureliano Buendía, reminding him of their shared plans to make the war less brutal and wishing him decisive victory against the corrupt officers and greedy politicians of both parties. The next day, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had lunch with him at Úrsula's house, where he was being detained until the revolutionary military court decided his fate. It was a family gathering. But while the two adversaries forgot the war to reminisce about old memories, Úrsula had a sorrowful feeling that her son had become a completely different person. She had that feeling from the moment he entered the house, protected by a noisy squad of guards. This squad had searched all the rooms until they ensured there was no danger. Colonel Aureliano Buendía not only acknowledged this rude and intrusive action but also issued a firm order, forbidding anyone, including Úrsula, from approaching him within three meters until the guards had finished positioning themselves around the house. He wore a common coarse fiber military uniform, without any rank or insignia, and high boots with spurs caked in mud and dried blood. On his belt, he carried a pistol in a worn leather holster, his hand always resting on the grip, a gesture that perfectly matched the high alertness and determination in his eyes. His head, now with tightly curled hair, seemed to have been dried. His face, once tanned by the Caribbean sun and wind, now bore a cold, steely expression. With a hidden coldness, he was ready to face the inevitable onset of old age. Compared to when he left, he was taller, thinner, and paler, and showed the first signs of an unending melancholy. ""My God,"" Úrsula said to herself in alarm. ""Now he is capable of anything."" Indeed, he was such a person. Not content with ordering the burial of battlefield corpses in a common grave, he also tasked Colonel Roque Carnicero with urgently convening military tribunals, while he personally took on the heavy burden of implementing thorough land reforms to eradicate the royalist regime. ""We must stay one step ahead of the party politicians,"" he told his advisors. ""When they open their eyes to reality, they will be faced with accomplished facts."" It was then that he decided to review the land deeds, even those made a hundred years ago, and thus discovered the forged deeds legalized by his brother José Arcadio.

They were sitting in a great atmosphere of friendship. However, while they reminisced about the old days and forgot the war, Ursula kept feeling a bitter emotion, repeatedly telling herself that her son was like an uninvited guest and didn't belong there. Ursula had felt this way the moment she saw her son being escorted inside by a noisy group of soldiers. The soldiers had turned the whole house upside down, even reaching the bedrooms, to ensure there was no danger for the colonel. Colonel Aureliano Buendia not only accepted their behavior but also ordered that no one, including Ursula, be allowed to come within three meters of him. Meanwhile, guards were posted at various points around the house. Colonel Aureliano Buendia was wearing a coarse fabric uniform without insignia or epaulets, and his boots were smeared with mud and dried blood on the spurs. A holster with an open flap was hanging at his waist. His hand, which never left the grip of his pistol, was as alert and tense as his gaze. The head that had now significantly receded at the forehead looked as if it had been baked in a kiln without glaze. His face, scorched by the salt of the Caribbean Sea, had taken on a metallic hardness. A kind of vitality connected to his inner coldness had protected him from aging and deteriorating. He was taller, paler, and bonier than when he had left, and had begun to show the first signs of resisting homesickness. Ursula thought to herself, -My God, he looks like someone who can do anything now, she said. Indeed, Aureliano Buendia had reached a point where he could do anything. The Aztec shawl he brought to Amaranta, the memories he recounted at dinner, the funny stories, were remnants of his former playful self. After the order to bury the dead in a common grave was carried out, Colonel Aureliano Buendia assigned Colonel Roque Carnicero to establish the court-martial. He himself embarked on implementing radical reforms that would change the newly established Conservative regime in a way that would leave no stone unturned. He told his aides, -We must act faster than the politicians in the party. When they open their eyes to the facts, they will be faced with accomplished deeds, he said. At that moment, he decided to examine the land registry records dating back a hundred years and learned about his brother Jose Arcadio's legitimized scandals. He defaced and erased the land records.

Many times, when Remedios the Beauty was not present, it was he who turned the wheel on the sewing machine. Amaranta felt upset by the perseverance, the loyalty, the submissiveness of that man who was invested with so much authority and who nevertheless took off his sidearm in the living room so that he could go into the sewing room without weapons, But for four years he kept repeating his love and she would always find a way to reject him without hurting him, for even though she had not succeeded in loving him she could no longer live without him. Remedios the Beauty, who seemed indifferent to everything and who was thought to be mentally retarded, was not insensitive to so much devotion and she intervened in Colonel Gerineldo Márquez’s favor. Amaranta suddenly discovered that the girl she had raised, who was just entering adolescence, was already the most beautiful creature that had even been seen in Macondo. She felt reborn in her heart the rancor that she had felt in other days for Rebeca, and begging God not to impel her into the extreme state of wishing her dead, she banished her from the sewing room. It was around that time that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez began to feel the boredom of the war. He summoned his reserves of persuasion, his broad and repressed tenderness, ready to give up for Amaranta a glory that had cost him the sacrifice of his best years. But he could not succeed in convincing her. One August afternoon, overcome by the unbearable weight of her own obstinacy, Amaranta locked herself in her bedroom to weep over her solitude unto death after giving her final answer to her tenacious suitor:","Since that day, even during the fiercest days of the war, he would visit her every afternoon.

However, for four long years, he had confessed his love to her, and she had found ways to decline without causing him pain, because she did not love him, but also felt she could not live without him. Remedios the Beauty, who seemed indifferent to everything in life and was considered intellectually underdeveloped, did not appear so indifferent after all and showed some affection for Colonel Gerineldo Márquez. Amaranta immediately realized that the girl she had raised, though not yet at puberty, was already the most beautiful girl in Macondo. In her heart, she felt a resurgence of the hatred she had once harbored for Rebeca and prayed to God not to let her wish for the girl's death, so she banished her from the sewing room. That was the period when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez began to feel a deep aversion to war. He employed his caution, his gentle nature, ready to forsake the glory he had exchanged for the best years of his life, just to win Amaranta's heart. But he could not persuade her. On an August afternoon, suffering from his persistent attitude, Amaranta stayed in her bedroom to cry for the loneliness of her fate, after having resolutely rejected his steadfast heart:",26.492,26.226,"Gerineldo, from that day on, came to check on Amaranta every day, even during the most intense times of the war.

For four years, Gerineldo tirelessly repeated that he loved her, and Amaranta always found a way to gently turn him down without hurting him. She did not want to hurt him, because even though she could not manage to love Gerineldo, she had become unable to do without him. Even Beautiful Remedios, who seemed indifferent to everything and was thought to be mentally slow, could not remain indifferent in the face of such devotion and took the side of Colonel Gerineldo Marquez. Amaranta suddenly realized that this girl, whom she had raised with her own hands and who had just entered her teenage years, was the most beautiful creature that had ever existed in Macondo. He sensed that the jealousy and anger he once felt towards Rebeca were rekindling in his heart, and to prevent this feeling from escalating to the extreme of wishing for the girl's death, he prayed to God and forbade Beautiful Remedios from entering the sewing room. At that time, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez had begun to feel the meaninglessness and tedium of the war. Ready to sacrifice the glory and honor that had cost him the best years of his youth for Amaranta's sake, he unleashed the love he had suppressed for years like a flood and tried with all his might to win over Amaranta.

373,"It was perhaps the most critical moment of the war. The Liberal landowners, who had supported the revolution in the beginning, had made secret alliances with the Conservative landowners in order to stop the revision of property titles. The politicians who supplied funds for the war from exile had Publicly repudiated the drastic aims of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, but even that withdrawal of authorization did not seem to bother him. He had not returned to reading his poetry, which filled more than five volumes and lay forgotten at the bottom of his trunk. At night or at siesta time he would call one of his women to his hammock and obtain a rudimentary satisfaction from her, and then he would sleep like a stone that was not concerned by the slightest indication of worry. Only he knew at that time that his confused heart was condemned to uncertainty forever. At first, intoxicated by the glory of his return, by his remarkable victories, he had peeped into the abyss of greatness. He took pleasure in keeping by his right hand the Duke of Marlborough, his great teacher in the art of war, whose attire of skins and tiger claws aroused the respect of adults and the awe of children. It was then that he decided that no human being, not even Úrsula, could come closer to him than ten feet. In the center of the chalk circle that his aides would draw wherever he stopped, and which only he could enter, he would decide with brief orders that had no appeal the fate of the world. The first time that he was in Manaure after the shooting of General Moncada, he hastened to fulfill his victim’s last wish and the widow took the glasses, the medal, the watch, and the ring, but she would not let him in the door.","Perhaps that was the most stressful phase of the war. The landlords of the Liberal faction, who had supported the revolution from the beginning, secretly allied with the Royalist landlords to halt the land reform. The politicians who had funded the war, even from abroad, openly opposed his bold decisions. But he ignored everything, even this deposition of power. He did not reread his poems, now five volumes thick and often forgotten at the bottom of a trunk. At night or during siesta time, as usual, he would call a mistress to the hammock to frolic with her and then fall asleep like a dead ox, oblivious to the world. At that moment, only he understood that his passionate heart had been permanently exiled to chaos. Initially, intoxicated by the victories, returning amidst such obvious triumphs, he had ascended to the pinnacle of glory. He was content to cling tightly to Duke Marlborough, his great master in the art of war, who wore a tiger-skin coat with intact sharp claws that commanded respect from adults and fear from children. That was when he decided that no one, not even Ursula, could come within three meters of him. With short and decisive commands, he determined the fate of the world from the center of a circle drawn with white chalk by his attendants wherever he went, and only he stepped inside. For the first time in Manaure, after executing General Moncada, he hastily fulfilled his victim's last wish. The widow accepted the glasses, medals, watch, and wedding ring but did not allow him to step through the door.",18.568,18.221,"This was perhaps the most critical moment of the war. The Liberal landowners, who had initially supported the revolution, had made secret agreements with the Conservative landowners to prevent the re-examination of land registry records. The exiled politicians who provided financial aid to the fighters announced to the public that all of Colonel Aureliano Buendia's powers had been taken away. But the colonel didn't care about authority at all. He never even picked up his poems, which filled five large notebooks and had been forgotten at the bottom of a chest. At night or when he took a nap, he would call one of the women to his hammock, and after reaching a superficial, primal satisfaction with her, he would collapse like a log and sleep. He was like a stone that neither sorrow nor worry ever touched. Only in those days did he know that he was doomed to struggle to the end with his heart turned into a tangled mess. Initially, he had been dizzy with the glorious air of his return and the considerable victories he had won, coming right to the edge of the abyss of greatness. With his animal hide clothing and tiger claw ornaments, the Duke of Marlborough, a great master of the art of war who terrified the young and was feared by the old, was Aureliano's right-hand man. He enjoyed having him constantly by his side. At that time, Ursula decided that no human being, including herself, should come closer than three meters to him. Wherever he stood, those around him would immediately run and draw a circle with chalk, and Colonel Aureliano Buendia would step into the center of this circle, which no one else could enter, and issue commands that led nowhere regarding the fate of the world. After the execution of General Moncada, during his first visit to Manaure, Aureliano had rushed to the general's house to fulfill his will. The general's widow took his glasses, medal, watch, and ring, but did not let Aureliano step inside the threshold.",23.123,22.86,"It was perhaps the most critical moment of the war. The liberal landowners, who initially supported the revolution, had entered into secret alliances with the conservative landowners to prevent the review of property titles. The politicians who were capitalizing on the war from exile had publicly repudiated the drastic determinations of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, but even that disavowal seemed not to concern him. He had not returned to reading his verses, which occupied more than five volumes and remained forgotten at the bottom of the trunk. At night, or during siesta time, he would call one of his women to the hammock and obtain from her a rudimentary satisfaction, and then he would sleep with a stone-like slumber that was not disturbed by the slightest hint of worry. Only he knew then that his bewildered heart was forever condemned to uncertainty. At the beginning, intoxicated by the glory of his return, by the unbelievable victories, he had peered into the abyss of greatness. He took pleasure in keeping the Duke of Marlborough, his great master in the arts of war, at his right hand, whose attire of furs and tiger claws elicited the respect of adults and the astonishment of children. It was then that he decided that no human being, not even Úrsula, should approach him within three meters. In the center of the chalk circle that his aides would draw wherever he arrived, and into which only he could enter, he would decide the fate of the world with brief and unappealable orders. The first time he was in Manaure after the execution of General Moncada, he hastened to fulfill his victim's last wish, and the widow received the glasses, the medal, the watch, and the ring, but she did not allow him to go beyond the door.",57.936,57.81

He found all types: idealists, ambitious people, adventurers, those with social resentments, even common criminals. There was even a former Conservative functionary who had taken refuge in the revolt to escape a judgment for misappropriation of funds. Many of them did not even know why they were fighting in the midst of that motley crowd, whose differences of values were on the verge of causing an internal explosion, one gloomy authority stood out: General Te6filo Vargas. He was a full-blooded Indian, untamed, illiterate, and endowed with quiet wiles and a messianic vocation that aroused a demented fanaticism in his men. Colonel Aureliano Buendía called the meeting with the aim of unifying the rebel command against the maneuvers of the politicians. General Teófilo Vargas came forward with his intentions: in a few hours he shattered the coalition of better-qualified commanders and took charge of the main command. “He’s a wild beast worth watching,” Colonel Aureliano Buendía told his officers. “That man is more dangerous to us than the Minister of War.” Then a very young captain who had always been outstanding for his timidity raised a cautious index finger.","Although Colonel Aureliano Buendía did not show his anger outwardly, his mind was only at ease when he knew that his entourage had looted and burned the widow's house to ashes.

At this time, he organized the second conference of the rebel generals ready to die. He met with everyone: the idealists, the ambitious ones, the adventurers, those with deep personal grudges, and even the thieves. There was also a Royalist official who had fled the court for embezzling public funds. A lot of people know nothing, including why they are fighting. In the chaotic scene of the crowd, where differences in political views almost caused an internal explosion, a formidable force stood out: General Teófilo Vargas. He was a pure-blooded Indian, rough, illiterate, but possessed a hidden cunning and had the talent to use the magic of Asia Minor to bind his soldiers in a kind of mad fanaticism. Colonel Aureliano Buendía convened a conference with the aim of consolidating the command of the insurgent forces into his own hands to counter the maneuvers of the politicians. General Theophilo Vachat had anticipated his plans: In a few hours, he managed to break the unity of some of the most famous commanders and jumped to take overall command. ""That is a fierce beast to be wary of,"" he told his subordinate officers. ""For us, that man is even more dangerous than the Minister of Defense."" In the midst of that moment, a young captain, who often stood out from others due to his sentimental nature, cautiously raised his hand.",18.12,17.779,"Colonel Aureliano Buendia never showed his anger, but his rage only subsided after the guards looted the house and turned it into a heap of ashes.

All kinds of people attended this meeting: idealists, those blinded by ambition, thrill-seekers, social misfits, even common criminals. Among them was even a former Conservative official who had taken refuge in rebellion to escape trial for embezzlement. Most of them didn't even know why they were fighting. In this colorful group, driven to the brink of internal explosion due to differences in values, one authority stood out: General Teofilo Vargas. General, an illiterate, uncultured, and unrefined man who blindly convinced his followers, deceiving them into believing that God had given him duties, was a pure-blooded Indian. Colonel Aureliano Buendia had gathered the rebel commanders to unite against the maneuvers of the politicians. General Teofilo Vargas revealed his own intentions and within a few hours, dismantled the coalition of qualified commanders and took command. Colonel Aureliano Buendia said to his officers, ""This is a wild animal we must never take our eyes off."" ""This man is more dangerous to us than the Minister of Defense.""

379,"He did not give it, as a matter of fact. But two weeks later General Teófilo Vargas was cut to bits by machetes in an ambush and Colonel Aureliano Buendía assumed the main command. The same night that his authority was recognized by all the rebel commands, he woke up in a fright, calling for a blanket. An inner coldness which shattered his bones and tortured him even in the heat of the sun would not let him sleep for several months, until it became a habit. The intoxication of power began to break apart under waves of discomfort. Searching for a cure against the chill, he had the young officer who had proposed the murder of General Teófilo Vargas shot. His orders were being carried out even before they were given, even before he thought of them, and they always went much beyond what he would have dared have them do. Lost in the solitude of his immense power, he began to lose direction. He was bothered by the people who cheered him in neighboring villages, and he imagined that they were the same cheers they gave the enemy. Everywhere he met adolescents who looked at him with his own eyes, who spoke to him with his own voice, who greeted him with the same mistrust with which he greeted them, and who said they were his sons. He felt scattered about, multiplied, and more solitary than ever. He was convinced that his own officers were lying to him. He fought with the Duke of Marlborough. “The best friend a person has,” he would say at that time, “is one who has just died.” He was weary of the uncertainty, of the vicious circle of that eternal war that always found him in the same place, but always older, wearier, even more in the position of not knowing why, or how, or even when. There was always someone outside of the chalk circle. Someone who needed money, someone who had a son with whooping cough, or someone who wanted to go off and sleep forever because he could not stand the shit taste of the war in his mouth and who, nevertheless, stood at attention to inform him: “Everything normal, colonel.” And normality was precisely the most fearful part of that infinite war: nothing ever happened. Alone, abandoned by his premonitions, fleeing the chill that was to accompany him until death, he sought a last refuge in Macondo in the warmth of his oldest memories. His indolence was so serious that when they announced the arrival of a commission from his party that was authorized to discuss the stalemate of the war, he rolled over in his hammock without completely waking up.","Indeed, he did not give the order. But fifteen days later, General Teófilo Vargas was hacked to pieces in a sudden ambush, and Colonel Aureliano Buendía took over as the overall commander. It was on the night his new position was acknowledged by all the rebel commanders that he suddenly woke up in a panic, screaming for someone to bring him an overcoat. An internal cold that pierced to the bone made him ache, and even at noon, it did not leave him in peace. This condition lasted for several months until he developed chronic insomnia. The dream of power began to crumble piece by piece. In an attempt to quell the internal chill, he ordered the execution of the young officer who had suggested killing General Teófilo Vargas. His orders were carried out before they were issued, often even before he intended them, and frequently exceeded what he dared to wish for. Lost in the loneliness of boundless power, he began to lose his bearings. He was irritated by the people in the occupied villages who cheered him, feeling that they were the same people who had cheered his enemies. Everywhere he went, he encountered young men who looked at him with his own eyes, spoke with his own voice, greeted him with the same suspicion with which he had greeted them, and all claimed to be his sons. He felt fragmented, repeated, and lonelier than ever. He realized that his own officers had deceived him. He fought with Duke Marlborough. ""The best friend,"" he often told himself, ""is the one who has just died."" He was exhausted by the ambiguous circumstances, by the vicious cycle of that prolonged war in which he always found himself at the same place, only growing older and weaker without knowing why, how, or until when. There was always someone standing outside the white chalk circle. It was the person demanding money from him, the one with a child suffering from whooping cough, or the one who wanted to sleep forever because they could no longer endure the taste of war's filth in their mouth, and yet still tried to stand at attention to report: ""Colonel, everything is normal, sir."" And it was precisely that normalcy, which meant nothing was happening, that was the most terrifying aspect of the brutal war. Abandoned by omens and to escape the cold that would chase him to his death, he sought the only refuge in the village of Macondo, in the warmth of those distant memories. His laziness was so extreme that when informed of a party delegation coming to discuss a ceasefire, he merely stirred in his hammock without waking up.",24.326,24.119,"To be honest, he didn't give such an order. However, two weeks later, General Teofilo Vargas, who had fallen into an ambush, was torn to pieces with machetes, and Colonel Aureliano Buendia assumed the position of commander-in-chief. The night when all the rebel commanders recognized him as the commander-in-chief, Colonel Aureliano Buendia woke up in fear and asked for a blanket. The coldness that enveloped him made his bones shiver, freezing him to the core even under the scorching sun. Because of this chill, he couldn't sleep for several months; then the chill became a habit. The intoxication of power began to dissipate with waves of unease. Aureliano had a young officer who suggested the killing of General Teofilo Vargas executed, thinking it might help with his chill. Aureliano's orders were carried out before they even left his mouth, even before he himself had thought them through, and were taken to extremes he wouldn't dare to reach. Colonel Aureliano Buendia sank into the solitude of unapproachable power and began to lose awareness of his actions. He was disturbed by the enthusiastic receptions in neighboring villages, suspecting that the villagers were showing the same enthusiasm to the enemy side. Wherever he went, he encountered a multitude of young men who looked at him with his own eyes, spoke with his own voice, shared the distrust he felt towards them, and claimed to be his sons. Aureliano found himself scattered and multiplied, sinking into utter loneliness. He began to believe that even his own officers were lying to him. He clashed with the Duke of Marlborough. He used to say that a man's best friend is a dead friend. He was exhausted and worn out by the endless, futile cycle of war that always caught him in the same place, but each time a little older, a little more tired, and a little less aware of the reasons, the causes, or even the timing of events. There was always someone outside the chalk circle. It was someone without money, someone whose son had caught whooping cough, or someone who just couldn't stand eating the shit of war anymore and wanted to leave and sleep forever. Moreover, they would stand at attention in front of him as if nothing had happened, saying, ""Everything is normal, Colonel."" The most terrifying aspect of that endless war was precisely this normalcy; nothing was happening. Aureliano, a man who had been abandoned by his premonitions and was trying to escape a chill that would never leave him until his death, sought his last resort in Macondo, in the warmth of old memories. He had become so indifferent that even when he heard that the authorized commission members had arrived for negotiations to stop the war, he merely turned over in his hammock without fully waking up.",23.044,22.845,"He did not give it, indeed. But fifteen days later, General Teófilo Vargas was hacked to pieces with machetes in an ambush, and Colonel Aureliano Buendía assumed central command.

An internal cold that reached his bones and tormented him even in broad daylight prevented him from sleeping well for several months, until it became a habit. The intoxication of power began to decompose into bursts of unease. Seeking a remedy for the cold, he had the young officer who proposed the assassination of General Teófilo Vargas executed by firing squad. His orders were carried out before being given, even before he conceived them, and they always reached much further than he would have dared to send them. Lost in the solitude of his immense power, he began to lose his way. He was annoyed by the people who acclaimed him in the conquered towns, who seemed to him the same people who acclaimed the enemy. Everywhere he found adolescents who looked at him with his own eyes, who spoke with his own voice, who greeted him with the same distrust with which he greeted them, and who claimed to be his children.

The spectacle that the twins had invented when they became aware that they were equal was repeated in honor of the new arrival. But Colonel Aureliano Buendía did not notice it. He seemed so alien to everything that he did not even notice Remedios the Beauty as she passed by naked on her way to her bedroom.

413,"Then Colonel Aureliano Buendía realized, without surprise, that Úrsula was the only human being who had succeeded in penetrating his misery, and for the first time in many years he looked her in the face. Her skin was leathery, her teeth decayed, her hair faded and colorless, and her look frightened. He compared her with the oldest memory that he had of her, the afternoon when he had the premonition that a pot of boiling soup was going to fall off the table, and he found her broken to pieces. In an instant he discovered the scratches, the welts, the sores, the ulcers, and the scan that had been left on her by more than half a century of daily life, and he saw that those damages did not even arouse a feeling of pity in him. Then he made one last effort to search in his heart for the place where his affection had rotted away and he could not find it. On another occasion, he felt at least a confused sense of shame when he found the smell of Úrsula on his own skin, and more than once he felt her thoughts interfering with his. But all of that had been wiped out by the war. Even Remedios, his wife, at that moment was a hazy image of someone who might have been his daughter. The countless women he had known on the desert of love and who had spread his seed all along the coast had left no trace in his feelings. Most of them had come into his room in the dark and had left before dawn, and on the following day they were nothing but a touch of fatigue in his bodily memory. The only affection that prevailed against time and the war was that which he had felt for his brother José Arcadio when they both were children, and it was not based on love but on complicity.","So it was no surprise at all that Colonel Aureliano Buendía realized that Úrsula was the only one who had guessed the pain in his heart, and for the first time in many years, he dared to look directly into her eyes. Her skin was wrinkled, her teeth were crooked, her hair was withered, and the look in her eyes was full of astonishment. He compared her with the old image of her that he still retained, the image of her on the afternoon when he had predicted that the boiling pot of soup would spill off the table, and indeed it had fallen to the ground and shattered into pieces. Immediately, he recognized the wrinkles, the rough patches, the calluses, the scars that had marked her skin over more than half a century of hard work, and he realized that those marks did not stir his heart in the slightest. Immediately, he tried to find in his heart the place where feelings had rotted away, and he could not find it. At least, at other times, he felt ashamed when he suddenly caught Úrsula's scent on his own skin, and many times he felt that her thoughts had intertwined with his own. But all of that was overshadowed by the war. Even at that moment, Remedios, his wife, was just a faint image of someone who could have been his daughter. The girls he had known in the loneliness of love, and who had borne his offspring across the coastal region, left no mark on his feelings. Most of them had entered his room to sleep when it was dark and had left before dawn, and the next day they were just a vague memory in his mind. The only feeling that remained intact against the ravages of time and war was the memory of his brother José Arcadio when they were both children, not yet knowing love, only mischief.",31.086,30.846,"Then Colonel Aureliano Buendia realized that the only person who could pierce through his pain and loneliness was Ursula. He wasn't surprised by this; for the first time in years, he looked at his mother's face. Ursula's skin had become like leather, her teeth had decayed, and her hair had lost its color. She had a frightening appearance. Aureliano compared his mother's appearance to his oldest memory of her, from the day she predicted that the boiling soup bowl would fall off the table, and found his mother shattered. He saw in an instant the traces, ulcers, wounds, and cracks that daily troubles over more than half a century had left on his mother, and realized that these did not evoke any feeling of pity in him. Then he made one last effort to find the place in his heart where emotions had rotted away, but he couldn't find it. On another visit, when he sensed Ursula's scent on his own skin, he felt a feeling akin to shame, at the very least. Later, he noticed many times that Ursula's thoughts were mingling with his own. But the war had swept away all these feelings. Now even his wife Remedios was nothing more than a faint memory of someone who could be his daughter. The countless women he had known in the desert of love, and who had spread his seed throughout the coastal region, had left no trace in Aureliano's heart. Most of them had entered his room in the dark and left before dawn, leaving behind nothing but the fatigue in his body the next day. The only feeling that had endured without succumbing to time and war was the bond he had felt for his brother Jose Arcadio during their childhood. This, too, was a feeling based not on love, but on complicity.",28.101,27.847,"Then Colonel Aureliano Buendía realized, without surprise, that Úrsula was the only human being who had managed to unravel his misery, and for the first time in many years, he dared to look her in the face.

He compared her with the oldest memory he had of her, the afternoon when he had the premonition that a pot of boiling broth was going to fall off the table, and he found her shattered. In an instant, he discovered the scratches, welts, bruises, ulcers, and scars that more than half a century of daily life had left on her, and he confirmed that these ravages did not even evoke a feeling of pity in him. He then made one last effort to search in his heart for the place where his affections had rotted away, and he could not find it. In another time, at least he experienced a confused feeling of shame when he detected Úrsula's smell on his own skin, and on more than one occasion, he felt his thoughts interfered by hers.

He kept only one pistol with one bullet in it. Úrsula did not intervene. The only time she dissuaded him was when he was about to destroy the daguerreotype of Remedios that was kept in the parlor lighted by an eternal lamp. “That picture stopped belonging to you a long time ago,” she told him. “It’s a family relic.” On the eve of the armistice, when no single object that would let him be remembered was left in the house, he took the trunk of poetry to the bakery when Santa Sofía de la Piedad was making ready to light the oven.","In the days that followed, he busied himself with erasing every trace of his existence from this world.

Even though after so many years of war they should have sounded familiar to him this time he felt the same weakness in his knees and the same tingling in his skin that he had felt in his youth in the presence of a naked woman. He thought confusedly, finally captive in a trap of nostalgia, that perhaps if he had married her he would have been a man without war and without glory, a nameless artisan, a happy animal. That tardy shudder which had not figured in his forethought made his breakfast bitter. At seven in the morning, when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez came to fetch him, in the company of a group of rebel officers, he found him more taciturn than ever, more pensive and solitary.

""Everyone was surprised by your wide-open eyes."" He didn't pay attention to her words, because he was listening to the soldiers preparing, listening to the sharp bugle calls and the commands that were unsettling the dawn. Even after many years of war, those sounds seemed familiar to him, but this time they made his knees feel weak and gave him the same shiver he had felt in his youth when standing before a naked woman. He thought, in a confused way, at the moment he was most trapped in the snare of loneliness, that if he had married that girl, he would have been a man who did not wander through wars and did not carry glory, but a nameless, ordinary craftsman, a happy male. It was this late sadness, which did not stand out in his plans, that made his breakfast taste bitter. At seven in the morning, when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez came to find him to go with the group of revolutionary officers, he found him silent, contemplative, lonelier than ever. Úrsula intended to drape a new coat over his shoulders. ""What will the government think,"" she said to him, ""They will think that you surrendered simply because you were so destitute that you couldn't afford a new coat.""

After so many years of fighting, these sounds should not have felt unfamiliar, yet Aureliano felt the same weakness in his knees and the shiver in his skin that he had felt when he saw his first naked woman in his youth. He felt a strange longing, thinking that if he had married that woman, he would have been a happy, unknown artisan, unaware of war, fame, and glory. This unexpected shiver ruined his breakfast.

444,"Fernanda del Carpio, the beautiful woman he had married the year before, agreed. Úrsula, on the other hand, could not conceal a vague feeling of doubt. Throughout the long history of the family the insistent repetition of names had made her draw some conclusions that seemed to be certain. While the Aurelianos were withdrawn, but with lucid minds, the José Arcadios were impulsive and enterprising, but they were marked with a tragic sign. The only cases that were impossible to classify were those of José Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano Segundo. They were so much alike and so mischievous during childhood that not even Santa Sofía de la Piedad could tell them apart. On the day of their christening Amaranta put bracelets on them with their respective names and dressed them in different colored clothing marked with each one’s initials, but when they began to go to school they decided to exchange clothing and bracelets and call each other by opposite names. The teacher, Melchor Escalona, used to knowing José Arcadio Segundo by his green shirt, went out of his mind when he discovered that the latter was wearing Aureliano Segundo’s bracelet and that the other one said, nevertheless, that his name was Aureliano Segundo in spite of the fact that he was wearing the white shirt and the bracelet with José Arcadio Segundo’s name. From then on he was never sure who was who. Even when they grew up and life made them different. Úrsula still wondered if they themselves might not have made a mistake in some moment of their intricate game of confusion and had become changed forever. Until the beginning of adolescence they were two synchronized machines. They would wake up at the same time, have the urge to go to the bathroom at the same time, suffer the same upsets in health, and they even dreamed about the same things. In the house, where it was thought that they coordinated their actions with a simple desire to confuse, no one realized what really was happening until one day when Santa Sofía de la Piedad gave one of them a glass of lemonade and as soon as he tasted it the other one said that it needed sugar. Santa Sofía de la Piedad, who had indeed forgotten to put sugar in the lemonade, told Úrsula about it. “That’s what they’re all like,” she said without surprise. “crazy from birth.” In time things became less disordered. The one who came out of the game of confusion with the name of Aureliano Segundo grew to monumental size like his grandfathers, and the one who kept the name of José Arcadio Segundo grew to be bony like the colonel, and the only thing they had in common was the family’s solitary air. Perhaps it was that crossing of stature, names, and character that made Úrsula suspect that they had been shuffled like a deck of cards since childhood.","Fernanda del Carpio, the beautiful wife he married last year, agreed to name the baby that way. As for herself, Úrsula could not hide her vague pain. In the long history of the family, the practice of naming children the same from generation to generation allowed her to draw conclusions that were almost confirmed. While those named Aureliano were melancholic yet very intelligent, those named José Arcadio were impulsive and bold; but all bore the mark of a tragic fate. The only cases that were difficult to distinguish were those of José Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano Segundo. In their childhood, both were so alike and mischievous that even Santa Sofía de la Piedad could not tell the twin brothers apart. On the day of the naming ceremony, Amaranta put a saint medallion with their names engraved on each and dressed them in different colored clothes marked with their initials; but when they went to class, they swapped names, clothes, and medallions. The teacher, Mencho Escalona, who had gotten used to identifying José Arcadio Segundo by his blue shirt, was suddenly confused when he discovered that this boy wore a medallion with the name Aureliano Segundo and that although the other boy claimed to be Aureliano Segundo, he wore a white shirt and a medallion with the name José Arcadio Segundo. From then on, it was impossible to know exactly who was who. Even when they had grown up and life had made them different, Úrsula continued to wonder if at some point they had made a mistake in their confusing game, they would have changed a lot. Even in their youth, they were like two synchronized machines. They woke up at the same time, felt the need to go to the bathroom at the same hour, suffered from the same ailments, and had identical dreams. At home, everyone believed that their synchronized actions were a deliberate attempt to confuse people, but no one understood their true nature until one day Santa Sofía de la Piedad gave one of them a glass of lemonade, and later the other one said it lacked sugar. Indeed, she had forgotten to put sugar in the lemonade. Santa Sofía de la Piedad recounted this to Úrsula. ""All the children in this family are like that,"" she said, not at all surprised. "" They are crazy from birth. "" Time passed and eventually ended the confusion of identities. The boy in the confusing games, still called Aureliano Segundo, had the robust body of his grandfather, while the other, still called José Arcadio Segundo, had the slender build of the colonel, and the only thing they shared was the family's characteristic loneliness. Perhaps the swapping of appearances, names, and characteristics was what made Úrsula suspect that from their childhood, they had been shuffled like a deck of cards.",29.663,29.506,"Fernanda del Carpio, the beautiful woman Aureliano had married a year ago, accepted what her husband said. On the other hand, Ursula did not hide her vague suspicion. According to Ursula, the repeated use of names throughout the family's long history had yielded almost certain results. While all the Aurelianos were introverted and sensible, the Jose Arcadios were bold and enterprising, but inevitably ran into trouble. The only case that couldn't be classified was the situation of Jose Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano Segundo. In their childhood, they were so identical and so mischievous that even Santa Sofia de la Piedad could not tell them apart. On the day they were baptized, Amaranta put a tag on each of the children's arms and always dressed them in clothes of different colors with their initials embroidered on them. However, after the children started school, they began changing their clothes and name tags, calling each other by the wrong names. The teachers, including Melchor Escalona, who distinguished Jose Arcadio Segundo by his green shirt, were bewildered when they discovered that Jose Arcadio Segundo was wearing the name tag of the other, who, in turn, wore a white shirt and the name tag of Aureliano Segundo. From then on, they could never be sure which one was which. Even when the children grew up and life differentiated them, Ursula always wondered if, during that game of deception, the children had mistakenly switched identities permanently. Until they reached adolescence, they were like two machines operating in perfect harmony. They woke up at the same time, rushed to the bathroom at the same time, caught the same illnesses, and even had the same dreams. The people at home thought they were acting this way to deceive everyone. However, one day Santa Sofia de la Piedad gave one of the twins a glass of lemonade. As soon as the child brought the glass to his mouth, the other one jumped in and said that the lemonade was unsweetened. Santa Sofia de la Piedad, who had indeed forgotten to put sugar in the lemonade, told this incident to Ursula. Ursula was not surprised at all, ""They're all like this,"" she said. ""Crazy from birth."" Over time, the confusion lessened. At the end of the deception game, the one known as Aureliano Segundo became a broad-shouldered young man like his ancestors, while the one named Jose Arcadio Segundo turned into a thin, bony young man like the colonel. The only common trait they shared was the air of loneliness unique to the family. Perhaps it was this contrast in their stature, names, and personalities that gave Ursula the suspicion that the children had been shuffled like a deck of cards since they were born.",24.731,24.553,"Fernanda del Carpio, the beautiful woman he had married the previous year, agreed. On the other hand, Úrsula could not hide a vague feeling of unease. In the long history of the family, the persistent repetition of names had allowed her to draw conclusions that seemed definitive to her. While the Aurelianos were withdrawn but of clear mind, the José Arcadios were impulsive and enterprising, but they were marked by a tragic sign. The only cases of impossible classification were those of José Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano Segundo. They were so similar and mischievous during childhood that not even Santa Sofía de la Piedad herself could distinguish them. On the day of the baptism, Amaranta put bracelets on them with their respective names and dressed them in different colored clothes marked with each one's initials, but when they started attending school, they opted to switch clothes and bracelets and call themselves by the crossed names. Teacher Melchor Escalona, accustomed to knowing José Arcadio Segundo by his green shirt, lost his temper when he discovered that this one had Aureliano Segundo's bracelet, and that the other claimed to be Aureliano Segundo despite wearing the white shirt and the bracelet marked with the name José Arcadio Segundo. From then on, it was not known for certain who was who. Even when they grew up and life made them different, Úrsula kept wondering if they themselves had made a mistake at some point in their intricate game of confusions and had remained switched forever.

445,"The decisive difference was revealed in the midst of the war, when José Arcadio Segundo asked Colonel Gerineldo Márquez to let him see an execution. Against Úrsula’s better judgment his wishes were satisfied. Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, shuddered at the mere idea of witnessing an execution. He preferred to stay home. At the age of twelve he asked Úrsula what was in the locked room. “Papers,” she answered. “Melquíades’ books and the strange things that he wrote in his last years.” Instead of calming him, the answer increased his curiosity. He demanded so much, promised with such insistence that he would not mistreat the things, that Úrsula, gave him the keys. No one had gone into the room again since they had taken Melquíades’ body out and had put on the door a padlock whose parts had become fused together with rust. But when Aureliano Segundo opened the windows a familiar light entered that seemed accustomed to lighting the room every day and there was not the slightest trace of dust or cobwebs, with everything swept and clean, better swept and cleaner than on the day of the burial, and the ink had not dried up in the inkwell nor had oxidation diminished the shine of the metals nor had the embers gone out under the water pipe where José Arcadio Buendía had vaporized mercury. On the shelves were the books bound in a cardboard-like material, pale, like tanned human skin, and the manuscripts were intact. In spite of the room’s having been shut up for many years, the air seemed fresher than in the rest of the house. Everything was so recent that several weeks later, when Úrsula went into the room with a pail of water and a brush to wash the floor, there was nothing for her to do. Aureliano Segundo was deep in the reading of a book. Although it had no cover and the title did not appear anywhere, the boy enjoyed the story of a woman who sat at a table and ate nothing but kernels of rice, which she picked up with a pin, and the story of the fisherman who borrowed a weight for his net from a neighbor and when he gave him a fish in payment later it had a diamond in its stomach, and the one about the lamp that fulfilled wishes and about flying carpets. Surprised, he asked Úrsula if all that was true and she answered him that it was, that many years ago the gypsies had brought magic lamps and flying mats to Macondo.","The clear difference between the two was evident during the most intense period of the war when José Arcadio Segundo asked Colonel Gerineldo Márquez to take him to watch the executions. Contrary to Ucsula's thoughts, his wish was fulfilled. On the contrary, Aureliano Segundo felt weak at the thought of being present at the execution. The boy only liked staying at home. At the age of twelve, he asked Ucsula what was in the closed room. ""Just papers,"" she replied, ""those are Melquíades' books and the strange things he wrote in his later years."" The answer that should have reassured him only further stimulated his curiosity. He earnestly begged to be allowed to see, passionately promising her that he would not damage anything in there, to the point that Ucsula couldn't resist and had to give him the key. No one had entered the room since they carried Melquíades' corpse away; and a rusty iron lock that had long since seized up had been installed on the door. However, when Aureliano Segundo flung the windows open, a familiar beam of light seemed to illuminate the room as it always had; the room was not covered in dust, there were no cobwebs, but on the contrary, everything was clean, perhaps even more meticulously swept and polished than on the day of the funeral, the ink in the bottle was not dry, rust had not dulled the shine of the metal tools; even the embers in the stove where José Arcadio Buendía boiled mercury were still glowing. On the shelves were books bound in light brown cardboard resembling tanned human skin and even handwritten pages with fresh ink. Although the room had been closed for many years, the air there seemed cleaner than in other parts of the house. Everything was so new that a few weeks later when Ucsula brought in a bucket of water and a broom to sweep the floor, she found she didn't need to do anything. Aureliano Segundo was engrossed in reading a book. Although the book had lost its cover and had no title, the boy enjoyed the story of a woman sitting at a table picking up each grain of rice with chopsticks; the story of a fisherman borrowing a lead weight from his neighbor to fasten to his fishing net and the fish he later returned to the neighbor carrying a pearl in its belly; the story of a magic lamp that granted all wishes and flying carpets. With an excited look, the boy asked Ursula if these stories were true, and she replied that they were, that a long time ago, the gypsies brought magic lamps and flying carpets to the village of Macondo.",22.089,21.878,"During the most intense days of the war, when Jose Arcadio Segundo told Colonel Gerineldo Marquez that he wanted to watch someone being executed by firing squad, a clear distinction emerged among the children. Ursula's opposition was in vain, and Jose Arcadio Segundo got his way. On the other hand, Aureliano Segundo shuddered from head to toe at the mere thought of watching someone being executed by firing squad. He preferred to stay at home. When he was twelve years old, he asked Ursula what was in the locked room. Ursula replied, ""Papers."" ""Melquiades' books and the strange things he wrote in his final years."" This answer only fueled Aureliano Segundo's curiosity instead of quenching it. He insisted so much on entering the room and promised so fervently that he wouldn't damage anything that Ursula finally handed him the keys. No one had entered the room since Melquiades' body had been removed. The padlock on the door had rusted and corroded from the inside. Despite all this, when Aureliano Segundo opened the windows, a light entered the room as if it were accustomed to illuminating it every day. There was no dust or cobwebs to be seen anywhere. Everywhere had been swept and cleaned, it was even shinier than the day Melquiades was buried. The ink in the inkwell had not dried, the metal objects had not rusted or tarnished, and the embers under the still where Jose Arcadio Buendia boiled mercury had not yet gone out. On the shelves were books covered with something resembling cardboard, yellowed, and tanned, reminiscent of human skin. The manuscripts had also remained as they were. Despite being closed for years, the air in the room was cleaner than that of the other rooms in the house. Everything was so clean that a few weeks later, when Ursula entered the room with a bucket and a brush to scrub the boards, she found nothing to do. Aureliano Segundo was dozing, reading a book. Even though the book had no cover and its name was written nowhere, the child still enjoyed what he was reading. He was reading the story of a woman who sat at a table and put nothing in her mouth except rice paste which she ate with a stick, the story of a fisherman who borrowed weights from his neighbor to catch fish and in return gifted a fish from whose belly a diamond emerged, the story of a magic lamp that granted wishes, and flying carpets.

He was under forty years of age. He was wearing the same old-fashioned vest and the hat that looked like a raven’s wings, and across his pale temples there flowed the grease from his hair that had been melted by the heat, just as Aureliano and José Arcadio had seen him when they were children.

He still wore the bizarre overcoat and the wide-brimmed hat, sweat dripping from his hair down his temples, exactly as he had appeared to Aureliano and José Arcadio when they were young.

No one knew then at what moment he began to ring the bells in the tower, to assist Father Antonio Isabel, successor of El Cachorro, at mass, and to care for fighting cocks in the courtyard of the parish house. When Colonel Gerineldo Márquez found out, he harshly reprimanded him for learning trades despised by the liberals. “The thing is,” he replied, “it seems to me that I have turned out to be a conservative.” He believed it as if it were a determination of fate. Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, scandalized, told Úrsula about it.",56.957,56.791

456,"It was soon discovered that Father Antonio Isabel was preparing him for his first communion. He was teaching him the catechism as he shaved the necks of his roosters. He explained to him with simple examples, as he put the brooding hens into their nests, how it had occurred to God on the second day of creation that chickens would be formed inside of an egg. From that time on the parish priest began to show the signs of senility that would lead him to say years later that the devil had probably won his rebellion against God, and that he was the one who sat on the heavenly throne, without revealing his true identity in order to trap the unwary. Warmed up by the persistence of his mentor, in a few months José Arcadio Segundo came to be as adept in theological tricks used to confuse the devil as he was skilled in the tricks of the cockpit. Amaranta made him a linen suit with a collar and tie, bought him a pair of white shoes, and engraved his name in gilt letters on the ribbon of the candle. Two nights before the first communion, Father Antonio Isabel closeted himself with him in the sacristy to hear his confession with the help of a dictionary of sins. It was such a long list that the aged priest, used to going to bed at six o’clock, fell asleep in his chair before it was over. The interrogation was a revelation for José Arcadio Segundo. It did not surprise him that the priest asked him if he had done bad things with women, and he honestly answered no, but he was upset with the question as to whether he had done them with animals. The first Friday in May he received communion, tortured by curiosity. Later on he asked Petronio, the sickly sexton who lived in the belfry and who, according to what they said, fed himself on bats, about it, and Petronio, answered him: “There are some corrupt Christians who do their business with female donkeys.” José Arcadio Segundo still showed so much curiosity and asked so many questions that Petronio lost his patience.","Immediately, everyone knew that Father Antonio Isabel was preparing to conduct the first Holy Communion for the boy. Father taught him catechism while plucking the neck feathers of fighting cocks. Father used simple, easy-to-understand examples to explain to him while placing the hens in their nests, just as it happened with God on the second day of Creation, the day the chicks were formed in the eggs. From that time, the pastor showed the first signs of senility, which many years later led him to say that perhaps the devil had won the rebellion against God's will, who sits on the heavenly throne, not revealing his form before the eyes of the foolish. Forged by the courage of his teacher, a few months later, José Arcadio Segundo had become very knowledgeable in religious tricks to deceive the devil and also experienced in raising chickens. Amaranta sewed him a linen suit with a collar and tie, bought him a pair of white shoes, and gilded his name on the ribbons tied to the candle. Two nights before his first Holy Communion, Father Antonio Isabel closed the holy storeroom to conduct a confession ceremony with him, aided by a book listing sins. It was such a long list that the old pastor, who was used to going to bed at six o'clock, fell asleep in the rocking chair before finishing. The questions were a revelation to José Arcadio Segundo. He was not surprised to see the priest ask him if he had been with a woman, and he proudly answered no, but he was bewildered when the priest asked if he had been with animals. In May, on the first Friday, he took communion with a heart aching from curiosity. Afterward, he asked Petronio, the sickly monk who kept the holy relics, lived in the bell tower, and who, according to rumors, ate fireflies to survive, and Petronio answered him: ""It's because there was a vile brother who slept with a female donkey."" José Arcadio Segundo was more astonished than ever, demanding further explanations to the point that Petronio lost his patience.",29.604,29.394,"It soon became clear that Father Antonio Isabel was preparing Jose Arcadio Segundo for his first communion. While they were shaving the necks of their roosters and preparing them for fights, the priest was teaching Jose Arcadio Segundo the necessary knowledge through 'catechism'; as they placed the hens ready to brood into the nests, he explained with simple examples how on the second day of creation, God thought that chicks should hatch from eggs. The priest had begun to show signs of senility at that time. This senility would gradually increase, and years later, the priest would claim that perhaps the devil's rebellion against God had ended in victory and that, to deceive the unwary, the devil had hidden his true identity and sat on the throne in the heavens. With the guidance and persistence of his teacher, Jose Arcadio Segundo mastered the theological tricks used to outwit the devil within a few months, just as he had mastered the tricks of cockfighting. Amaranta sewed a linen garment with a collar and tie. She bought white shoes. She embroidered the initials of her name in gold on the ribbon that would be tied to the candle. Two nights before the first communion, Father Antonio Isabel locked himself in the room where the church's valuable items were kept with Jose Arcadio Segundo to hear his confession. They had also brought a dictionary of sins with them. The list of sins was so long that the old priest, who was used to going to bed at six, couldn't stay awake until the end and fell asleep in his chair. The priest's questions opened up a new world for Jose Arcadio Segundo. He wasn't surprised when the priest asked if he had done indecent things with women and honestly answered no. But when he was asked if he had done the same with animals, he was confused. On the first Friday of May, the communion was held, but his mind was still on the priest's question. He immediately ran to Petronio. Petronio was the church's sickly caretaker. He lived in the bell tower. It was said that he ate bats. Jose Arcadio Segundo asked him the question that was troubling his mind. Petronio replied, ""There are immoral Christians who do their business with female donkeys."" Jose Arcadio Segundo wasn't satisfied with this answer, his curiosity was tormenting him, and he asked so many questions in succession that Petronio finally lost his patience.",23.359,23.128,"Very soon it was known that Father Antonio Isabel was preparing him for his first communion. He taught him the catechism while shaving the necks of the roosters.

Since then, the parish priest showed the first symptoms of the senile delirium that led him to say, years later, that probably the devil had won the rebellion against God, and that it was he who was sitting on the heavenly throne, without revealing his true identity to trap the unwary. Fired up by the boldness of his preceptor, José Arcadio Segundo became in a few months as skilled in theological tricks to confuse the devil as he was in the tricks of the cockpit.

458,"Indeed, on the following Tuesday Petronio came down out of the tower with a wooden stool which until then no one had known the use of, and he took José Arcadio Segundo to a nearby pasture. The boy became so taken with those nocturnal raids that it was a long time before he was seen at Catarino’s. He became a cockfight man. “Take those creatures somewhere else,” Úrsula ordered him the first time she saw him come in with his fine fighting birds. “Roosters have already brought too much bitterness to this house for you to bring us any more.” José Arcadio Segundo took them away without any argument, but he continued breeding them at the house of Pilar Ternera, his grandmother, who gave him everything he needed in exchange for having him in her house. He soon displayed in the cockpit the wisdom that Father Antonio Isabel had given him, and he made enough money not only to enrich his brood but also to look for a man’s satisfactions. Úrsula compared him with his brother at that time and could not understand how the twins, who looked like the same person in childhood, had ended up so differently. Her perplexity did not last very long, for quite soon Aureliano Segundo began to show signs of laziness and dissipation. While he was shut up in Melquíades’ room he was drawn into himself the way Colonel Aureliano Buendía had been in his youth. But a short time after the Treaty of Neerlandia, a piece of chance took him out of his withdrawn self and made him face the reality of the world. A young woman who was selling numbers for the raffle of an accordion greeted him with a great deal of familiarity. Aureliano Segundo was not surprised, for he was frequently confused with his brother. But he did not clear up the mistake, not even when the girl tried to soften his heart with sobs, and she ended taking him to her room. She liked him so much from that first meeting that she fixed things so that he would win the accordion in the raffle. At the end of two weeks Aureliano Segundo realized that the woman had been going to bed alternately with him and his brother, thinking that they were the same man, and instead of making things clear, he arranged to prolong the situation. He did not return to Melquíades’ room. He would spend his afternoons in the courtyard, learning to play the accordion by ear over the protests of Úrsula, who at that time had forbidden music in the house because of the mourning and who, in addition, despised the accordion as an instrument worthy only of the vagabond heirs of Francisco the Man. Nevertheless, Aureliano Segundo became a virtuoso on the accordion and he still was after he had married and had children and was one of the most respected men in Macondo.","Indeed, on the third day, Petronio carried a wooden chair that no one knew what it was used for until now, down from the bell tower, and led Jose Arcadio Segundo to a nearby garden. The boy was so passionate about those adventurous nights that it was a long time before people saw him appear at Catarino's dance hall again. He became a cockfighter. ""Take those animals somewhere else,"" Ursula said when she first saw him bring the beautiful fighting cocks home. "" Those chickens have brought so much bitterness to this house, and now you want to bring more suffering to us? "" Jose Arcadio Segundo did not argue with his great-grandmother; he quietly took the fighting cocks to be raised at the house of his grandmother, Pilar Ternera, who was willing to indulge him so he could be present at her home. Immediately, he demonstrated the knowledge of Father Antonio Isabel at the cockfighting ring, preparing enough money not only to enrich the chickens he raised but also to satisfy his adventurous spirit. At this time, Ursula compared him to his brother and could not understand how two twins who were identical in childhood could now be so completely different. She did not have to ponder this thought for long because Aureliano Segundo soon began to show signs of laziness. When sitting in Melquiades' room, he was as contemplative as Colonel Aureliano Buendia in his youth. But shortly before the Treaty of Neclandia, a chance encounter pulled him out of his inner world, forcing him to face real life. It was a young woman, who sold lottery tickets with the prize of an accordion, who greeted him warmly. Aureliano Segundo was not surprised because it often happened that people mistook him for his brother. But he did not bother to correct her even when she tried to soften his heart with her sobbing, and thus she led him to her bedroom. From the first meeting, she liked him so much that she cheated during the lottery draw to ensure he won the accordion. After a few weeks, Aureliano Segundo realized that this woman alternated between sleeping with him and his brother, thinking they were one person, and instead of clarifying the situation, he ignored it to prolong the state of both brothers sharing the same woman. He did not return to Melquiades' room. Every afternoon, he was outside in the yard, engrossed in learning the accordion despite Ursula's scolding, who had banned music because the house was in mourning, and besides, she despised the accordion as a toy for vagabonds, successors of Francisco the Man. However, Aureliano Segundo became a famous accordion player and remained famous even after marrying, having children, and becoming one of the most respected people in the town of Macondo.",23.234,23.048,"Indeed, the following Tuesday, Petronio came out of the bell tower with a wooden stool that no one had known the purpose of until that day and took Jose Arcadio Segundo to a nearby pasture. The young man became so engrossed in his nightly outings that he didn't appear at Catarino's shop for a very long time. He became a passionate cockfighter. The first day he came home with fighting cocks, Ursula scolded him, saying, ""Take these damn things out of here."" ""Cocks have already brought too much sorrow to this house; there's no need for you to add to it."" Without any resistance, Jose Arcadio Segundo took the cocks out of the house, but he continued to keep them at the house of his grandmother Pilar Ternera, who did anything to have him visit her. Soon enough, in the cockfighting arena, applying the tricks he had learned from Father Antonio Isabel, he not only increased the number of cocks but also made enough money to consider having some fun. Ursula compared him to his brother and couldn't understand how the twins, who had been like one person in their childhood, had ended up so differently. Ursula's astonishment did not last long. Because very soon, Aureliano Segundo began to show signs of laziness and disarray. When he locked himself in Melquiades' room, Aureliano Segundo, like Colonel Aureliano Buendia in his youth, would withdraw into himself. But shortly after the Treaty of Neerlandia, by chance, he broke out of his introversion and faced the reality of the world. A young woman selling lottery tickets, with an accordion as the prize, greeted him warmly as if she knew him. Aureliano Segundo was not surprised by this because he was often mistaken for his brother. However, he did not attempt to correct the mistake. In fact, even when the girl tried to soften his heart by crying and eventually took him to her room, Aureliano Segundo did not attempt to explain the situation. During their very first meeting, the woman warmed up to him so much that she did everything she could to ensure Aureliano Segundo won the accordion. After two weeks had passed, Aureliano Segundo realized that the woman thought the two of them were the same man, sleeping with one and then the other; nevertheless, instead of correcting the situation, he preferred to let it continue. He never returned to Melquiades' room again. In the afternoons, he would sit in the garden, learning to play the accordion by ear despite all of Ursula's shouting and scolding. At that time, Ursula had banned music in the house due to mourning. Moreover, she despised the accordion, considering it an instrument fit only for Francisco's nomadic heirs. Nevertheless, Aureliano Segundo became an expert at playing the accordion and, even after getting married and having children, and becoming one of the most respected people in Macondo, he did not stop playing the accordion.",26.684,26.518,"On the following Tuesday, indeed, Petronio came down from the tower with a small wooden bench that no one had known what it was for until then, and took José Arcadio Segundo to a nearby orchard.

Since Aureliano Segundo had taken charge of the house those festivities were a common thing, even when there was no motive as proper as the birth of a Pope.

Solid, monumental like his grandfathers, but with a joie de vivre and an irresistible good humor that they did not have, Aureliano Segundo scarcely had time to look after his animals.

Cows gave birth to triplets, hens laid eggs twice a day, and pigs grew at an astonishing rate. No one could explain the wealth that seemed to be the result of some miraculous phenomenon. ""Now you must be frugal,"" Úrsula told her great-grandson who spent lavishly. ""Luck won't follow you for your entire life. ""But Aureliano Segundo did not heed her advice. The more champagne he uncorked to entertain his friends, the more his livestock reproduced wildly, and he became convinced that his good fortune did not stem from calculated business practices but from the influence of Petra Cotes, his mistress, whose love seemed to soften the heart of fate. He was very confident that this was the source of his wealth, and therefore he never let Petra Cotes stay far from the livestock, and even after marrying and having children, he continued to live with her with Fernanda's complicity. With a robust and muscular body like that of his great-grandfather and grandfather, but with a more cheerful and carefree disposition, Aureliano Segundo hardly had enough time to tend to his livestock. All he needed to do was bring Petra Cotes to the barns, let her ride a horse around the farms, and that was enough for his animals to reproduce rapidly.",19.756,19.456,"The guests also raised their glasses, repeating the same words in unison. Then the man of the house played the accordion, fireworks were set off, and the event was celebrated by drumming in the streets throughout the town. At dawn, the guests, who had been immersed in champagne, sacrificed six cows and laid the meat of the cows in the street for everyone to take. Nobody found it strange. Since Aureliano Segundo took charge of the house, such exuberance had become commonplace, even when there wasn't a sufficient reason like the birth of a Pope. Within a few years, Aureliano Segundo, without any effort, purely due to his good luck and the extraordinary reproductive abilities of his animals, had amassed one of the greatest fortunes in the swamp region. His mares were giving birth to triplets, and they were fattening up so quickly that no one could comprehend such irregular productivity, and it was said that there must be some wizardry involved. Ursula would say to her enterprising grandson, ""Set aside a few pennies."" ""Your luck won't last a lifetime."" But Aureliano Segundo did not care about her. The more bottles he popped to give his friends champagne baths, the more wildly the animals bred, and Aureliano Segundo believed that his lucky star depended not on his own actions but on the influence of Petra Cotes, whose love conquered nature. Aureliano Segundo was so convinced that she was the source of his wealth that he never kept Petra Cotes away from the farm. Even after getting married and having children, he continued to live with Petra with the consent of his wife Fernanda. Aureliano Segundo, who had a monumental build like his grandfathers and an irresistible charm and vitality they lacked, didn't have much time to take care of the animals. Taking Petra Cotes to his farm and having her ride across it once on horseback was enough to cause an unstoppable breeding epidemic among all the animals marked with his brand.",25.723,25.471,"The guests toasted in unison. Then the host played the accordion, fireworks exploded, and drums of jubilation were ordered for the town. In the early morning, the guests, soaked in champagne, sacrificed six cows and put them in the street for the crowd to take. Nobody was scandalized. Since Aureliano Segundo took charge of the house, those festivities were commonplace, even if there wasn't a reason as just as the birth of a Pope. In a few years, without effort, purely by strokes of luck, he had accumulated one of the greatest fortunes in the swamp, thanks to the supernatural proliferation of his animals. His mares gave birth to triplets, the hens laid eggs twice a day, and the pigs fattened with such frenzy that no one could explain such chaotic fertility, except by magic arts. “Save now,” Úrsula would tell her scatterbrained great-grandson. “This luck won't last you a lifetime.” But Aureliano Segundo paid her no attention. The more champagne he uncorked to soak his friends, the more wildly his animals reproduced, and the more convinced he became that his good fortune was not due to his behavior but to the influence of Petra Cotes, his concubine, whose love had the virtue of exasperating nature. He was so persuaded that this was the origin of his fortune that he never kept Petra Cotes away from his offspring, and even when he married and had children, he continued living with her with Fernanda's consent. Solid, monumental like his grandparents, but with a vital joy and an irresistible charm that they did not have, Aureliano Segundo barely had time to oversee his herds. It was enough for him to take Petra Cotes to his breeding grounds and ride her on horseback through his lands for every animal marked with his brand to succumb to the irremediable plague of proliferation.",49.686,49.547
465,"Like all the good things that occurred in his long life, that tremendous fortune had its origins in chance. Until the end of the wars Petra Cotes continued to support herself with the returns from her raffles and Aureliano Segundo was able to sack Úrsula’s savings from time to time. They were a frivolous couple, with no other worries except going to bed every night, even on forbidden days, and frolicking there until dawn. “That woman has been your ruination,” Úrsula would shout at her great-grandson when she saw him coming into the house like a sleepwalker. “She’s got you so bewitched that one of these days I’m going to see you twisting around with colic and with a toad in your belly.” José Arcadio Segundo, who took a long time to discover that he had been supplanted, was unable to understand his brother’s passion. He remembered Petra Cotes as an ordinary woman, rather lazy in bed, and completely lacking in any resources for lovemaking. Deaf to Úrsula’s clamor and the teasing of his brother, Aureliano Segundo only thought at that time of finding a trade that would allow him to maintain a house for Petra Cotes, and to die with her, on top of her and underneath her, during a night of feverish license. When Colonel Aureliano Buendía opened up his workshop again, seduced at last by the peaceful charms of old age, Aureliano Segundo thought that it would be good business to devote himself to the manufacture of little gold fishes. He spent many hours in the hot room watching how the hard sheets of metal, worked by the colonel with the inconceivable patience of disillusionment, were slowly being converted into golden scales. The work seemed so laborious to him and the thought of Petra Cotes was so persistent and pressing that after three weeks he disappeared from the workshop. It was during that time that it occurred to Petra Cotes to raffle off rabbits. They reproduced and grew up so fast that there was barely time to sell the tickets for the raffle. At first Aureliano Segundo did not notice the alarming proportions of the proliferation. But one night, when nobody in town wanted to hear about the rabbit raffle any more, he heard a noise by the courtyard door. “Don’t get worried,” Petra, Cotes said. “It’s only the rabbits.” They could not sleep, tormented by the uproar of the animals. At dawn Aureliano Segundo opened the door and saw the courtyard paved with rabbits, blue in the glow of dawn. Petra Cotes, dying with laughter, could not resist the temptation of teasing him.","Like all the good things that had ever happened in his long life, that unmanageable wealth seemed predestined by fate. Even during the final period of the war, Petra Cotes still issued lottery tickets, and at times Aureliano Segundo had to steal money from Úrsula to cover all the expenses. They lived together comfortably, without any concerns except for making sure they slept together every night, even on days when they should abstain, frolicking until dawn. ""That woman will be the ruin of you,"" Úrsula scolded her great-grandson whenever she saw him enter the house like a sleepwalker. ""She has made you foolish, and one day we'll see you writhing in pain with a toad in your belly."" José Arcadio Segundo, who took a long time to realize that his younger brother had outsmarted him, could not understand his brother's passion. He remembered Petra Cotes as an easy woman, more accurately as someone lazy in bed and completely dull when it came to love. Ignoring Ursula's scoldings and his brother's mockery, Aureliano Segundo only thought of finding a job that would allow him to maintain the house for Fernanda and to die with her, on her and under her, in a night of wild passion. When Colonel Aureliano Buendía reopened the goldsmith workshop, drawn by the serene joy of old age, Aureliano Segundo thought that following the trade of making little gold fishes would also be a good idea. He spent many hours in the sweltering small room watching the hard metal sheets, patiently forged and carved by the Colonel, gradually turn into shimmering scales. He found the job very meticulous, meanwhile the longing for Petra Cotes was so overwhelming and intense that just three weeks later he disappeared from the workshop. That was the period when Petra Cotes was making a fortune by using rabbits as prizes to run a lottery. These rabbits were born and grew rapidly. They were countless. Even though she increased the tickets and the number of draws many times, she still couldn't use up all the rabbits for the prizes. At first, Aureliano Segundo did not realize how these rabbits were reproducing. But one night, when no one in the village wanted to talk about the rabbit lotteries, he felt a thunderous noise right by the wall. ""Don't be startled!"" Petra Cotes said, ""those are the rabbits!"". They couldn't sleep any longer, tossing and turning with worry about the livestock. At dawn, Aureliano Segundo opened the door and saw the yard teeming with rabbits, their fur gleaming in the morning light. Petra Cotes laughed uncontrollably, unable to resist the urge to tease him:",26.262,26.083,"Like many of the spoils in Aureliano Segundo's long life, the origin of that great fortune was also based on luck. Until the end of the wars, Petra Cotes lived off lottery income. Aureliano Segundo also continued to occasionally pilfer from Ursula's savings. Even on days considered sinful, they had become a carefree couple whose only concern was to revel every night until dawn. Whenever Ursula caught her son staggering into the house like a sleepwalker with his grandchild, she would shout at the top of her lungs, ""This woman has ruined you."" ""This woman has bewitched you so much that I wouldn't be surprised if one day you start writhing in pain and a black frog comes out of your belly."" Jose Arcadio Segundo, who realized too late that he had lost his place, could never understand his brother's passion. The Petra Cotes he knew was an ordinary woman with no special qualities, quite clumsy in bed, and knew nothing about love games. Aureliano Segundo, having turned a deaf ear to Ursula's yelling and his brother's mockery, could think of nothing but begging Petra Cotes for money to support himself, finding a job, and dying beside, on top of, or underneath her in a night of fiery passion. When Colonel Aureliano Buendia finally succumbed to the peace of old age and reopened his silver workshop, Aureliano Segundo thought it would be good to devote himself to making ornamental fish. He would sit for hours in the hot room, watching how the metal sheets, shaped with the incredible patience born of the colonel's disillusionment, transformed into golden fish scales. This work seemed so laborious and tedious to him, and the thought of Petra Cotes was so persistent in his mind, that after three weeks Aureliano Segundo stopped visiting the workshop. It was around that time that Petra Cotes came up with the idea of a rabbit lottery. Due to the rapid breeding and quick growth of the rabbits, they couldn't keep up with selling the lottery tickets. Initially, Aureliano Segundo did not notice that the animals were multiplying at an alarming rate. But one night, when the town was so fed up with rabbits that no one wanted to hear about the rabbit lottery anymore, Aureliano Segundo heard a sound in front of the garden gate. Petra Cotes said, ""Don't worry."" ""They are rabbits."" They couldn't sleep because of the noise from the animals. At dawn, Aureliano Segundo opened the door and saw that the garden was completely filled with rabbits, which appeared blue in the morning twilight. Petra Cotes, who was laughing uncontrollably, couldn't help but tease him.",22.244,22.033,"Like all the good things that happened to them in their long life, that unbridled fortune originated from chance. Until the end of the wars, Petra Cotes continued to support herself with the proceeds from her raffles, and Aureliano Segundo managed to occasionally raid Úrsula's piggy banks. They formed a frivolous couple, with no other concerns than going to bed every night, even on forbidden dates, and frolicking in bed until dawn. “That woman has been your downfall,” Úrsula would shout at her great-grandson when she saw him enter the house like a sleepwalker. “She has you so bewitched that one of these days I'll see you writhing in colic, with a toad inside your belly.” José Arcadio Segundo, who took a long time to discover the substitution, could not understand his brother's passion. He remembered Petra Cotes as a conventional woman, rather lazy in bed, and completely devoid of resources for love. Deaf to Úrsula's clamor and his brother's taunts, Aureliano Segundo only thought then of finding a job that would allow him to support a house for Petra Cotes, and die with her, on her, and under her, in a night of feverish excess. When Colonel Aureliano Buendía reopened the workshop, finally seduced by the peaceful charms of old age, Aureliano Segundo thought it would be a good business to dedicate himself to making little gold fishes. He spent many hours in the hot little room watching how the hard metal sheets, worked by the colonel with the inconceivable patience of disappointment, gradually turned into golden scales. The trade seemed so laborious to him, and the memory of Petra Cotes was so persistent and pressing, that after three weeks he disappeared from the workshop. It was during that time that Petra Cotes took to raffling rabbits. They reproduced and became adults so quickly that there was barely time to sell the raffle numbers. At first, Aureliano Segundo did not notice the alarming proportions of the proliferation. But one night, when no one in town wanted to hear about rabbit raffles anymore, he heard a crash against the patio wall. “Don't be scared,” said Petra Cotes. “It's the rabbits.” They could not sleep anymore, tormented by the hustle of the animals. At dawn, Aureliano Segundo opened the door and saw the patio paved with rabbits, blue in the glow of dawn.

468,"A few days later, in an attempt to clean out her courtyard, Petra Cotes exchanged the rabbits for a cow, who two months later gave birth to triplets. That was how things began. Overnight Aureliano Segundo be. came the owner of land and livestock and he barely had time to enlarge his overflowing barns and pigpens. It was a delirious prosperity that even made him laugh, and he could not help doing crazy things to release his good humor. “Cease, cows, life is short,” he would shout. Úrsula wondered what entanglements he had got into, whether he might be stealing, whether he had become a rustler, and every time she saw him uncorking champagne just for the pleasure of pouring the foam over his head, she would shout at him and scold him for the waste. It annoyed him so much that one day when he awoke in a merry mood, Aureliano Segundo appeared with a chest full of money, a can of paste, and a brush, and singing at the top of his lungs the old songs of Francisco the Man, he papered the house inside and out and from top to bottom, with one-peso banknotes. The old mansion, painted white since the time they had brought the pianola, took on the strange look of a mosque. In the midst of the excitement of the family the scandalization of Úrsula, the joy of the people cramming the street to watch that apotheosis of squandering. Aureliano Segundo finished by papering the house from the front to the kitchen, including bathrooms and bedrooms, and threw the leftover bills into the courtyard.","A few days later, while cleaning the yard, Petra Cotes replaced the rabbits with a cow. A few months later, the cow gave birth to triplets. Everything started from there. In no time, Aureliano Segundo became a wealthy landowner, possessing vast lands and numerous herds of livestock, and he barely had enough time to expand his cattle pens and grazing fields further. It was an intoxicating wealth that even he found overwhelming, unable to restrain his exuberant display of joy. ""Oh, cows, spread out because life is too short,"" he shouted. Úrsula wondered if he had committed a crime, if not a thief then a cattle rustler, and every time she saw him pop two champagne bottles just to spray the foam over his head with delight, she scolded him for being a wastrel. She never left him in peace, so one day Aureliano Segundo woke up with a calm joy, grabbed a basket of paper money, a bucket of paste, and a brush, humming her old songs. Francisco - The Man, then he pasted the one-peso bills on the walls of the house, from top to bottom, both inside and outside. The old house, which had been whitewashed since the purchase of the automatic piano, now looked strangely like a mosque. Amid the family's chaos, Úrsula's anger, and the villagers' joy as they poured into the streets to witness the spectacle of a man flaunting his wealth, Aureliano Segundo finished pasting the paper money on the house, from the front wall to the kitchen, including the toilet and bedroom, then threw the remaining money into the yard.",19.756,19.388,"A few days later, Petra Cotes bartered a cow to rid the garden of rabbits.

This was a crazy abundance that even made Aureliano Segundo laugh, and he started doing whatever came to mind to express his joy. ""Stop, cows, life is short!"" he would shout. Ursula wondered what kind of shady dealings he might be involved in, whether he was stealing or swindling. And every time she saw him popping champagne just because he enjoyed pouring the foam over his head, she would yell at him, scolding him for being wasteful. Tired of Ursula's scoldings, Aureliano Segundo, one cheerful morning, showed up with a chest of money, a bucket of glue, and a brush. And singing Francisco's old songs at the top of his lungs, he plastered one-peso banknotes all over the house, inside and out, from top to bottom.

470,"That was what happened. Úrsula had the bills taken down, stuck to great cakes of whitewash, and the house was painted white again. “Dear Lord,” she begged, “make us poor again the way we were when we founded this town so that you will not collect for this squandering in the other life.” Her prayers were answered in reverse. One of the workmen removing the bills bumped into an enormous plaster statue of Saint Joseph that someone had left in the house during the last years of the war and the hollow figure broke to pieces on the floor. It had been stuffed with gold coins. No one could remember who had brought that life-sized saint. “Three men brought it,” Amaranta explained. “They asked us to keep it until the rains were over and I told them to put it there in the corner where nobody would bump into it, and there they put it, very carefully, and there it’s been ever since because they never came back for it.” Later on, Úrsula had put candles on it and had prostrated herself before it, not suspecting that instead of a saint she was adoring almost four bundled pounds of gold. The tardy evidence of her involuntary paganism made her even more upset. She spat on the spectacular pile of coins, put them in three canvas sacks, and buried them in a secret place, hoping that sooner or later the three unknown men would come to reclaim them. Much later, during the difficult years of her decrepitude, Úrsula would intervene in the conversations of the many travelers who came by the house at that time and ask them if they had left a plaster Saint Joseph there during the war to be taken care of until the rains passed.","The story happened like this. Ursula ordered the peeling of the banknotes stuck with plaster from the walls and whitewashed the house. ""Oh, my merciful God,"" she prayed, ""make us poor again like when this village was first established, so that in the next life you won't punish us for wasting money."" Her prayers were answered in the opposite way. Indeed, they were. A worker peeling the banknotes off the wall accidentally bumped into the statue of Saint Joseph, a giant plaster statue that someone had brought to the house when the war was about to end, and it shattered upon hitting the ground. Inside, it was filled with gold coins. No one remembered who had brought the life-sized statue to the house. ""Three men brought it,"" Amaranta said. ""They asked me to tell our family to keep the statue until the rainy season passed, and I told them to place it there, in that corner, so no one would bump into it, and they carefully left it there and never came back for it."" Recently, Ursula had lit candles and prayed before the statue of Saint Joseph without suspecting that inside it were nearly two hundred kilograms of gold. The late revelation of her polytheistic faith deepened her worries. She cursed the valuable gold coins, stuffed them into three burlap sacks, and buried them in a secret location, waiting for the three strangers to come and claim them. Much later, in the hard years of her old age, Ursula would often interrupt conversations with visiting strangers to ask if, during the turmoil, they had left a plaster statue of Saint Joseph at her house for safekeeping during the rainy season.",19.974,19.655,"That's how it happened. Ursula had the money removed along with the large pieces of plaster they were stuck to, and the house was painted white again. ""God, I pray that you do not take out the pain of this waste on us in the afterlife; please make us as poor as we were when we first founded this town,"" Ursula was praying. The exact opposite of their prayers happened. One of the workers who was stripping the money hit a life-sized plaster statue of a saint that someone had brought and left during the last years of the war; when the statue fell to the ground, it shattered into pieces, and inside the statue was filled with glittering gold coins. None of them remembered who had brought this life-sized statue of the saint. Amaranta said, ""Three men had brought it."" ""They said let it stay here until the rainy season ends, and I told them to leave it in the corner so no one would bump into it."" They placed it there carefully, and since no one came to take it, the statue remained there. Later on, Ursula placed candles on the statue and knelt in front of it to pray, without even considering that she was worshipping almost two hundred kilos of gold rather than a saint. The evidence of this unintended idolatry, scattered all over the place, further confused Ursula's mind. She spat on the heap of coins, filled a sack with them, and buried it in a secret place. She hoped that those three unknown people would eventually come and ask for the money. Much later, during the arduous years of her old age, Ursula began to interrupt the conversations of travelers passing by her house, asking if they had come to her home during the war and left a plaster statue of a saint to be picked up after the rainy season.",19.234,18.903,"That's how it was. Úrsula had the bills removed from the large cakes of lime and repainted the house white. ""My God,"" she pleaded.

471,"Things like that which gave Úrsula such consternation, were commonplace in those days. Macondo was swamped in a miraculous prosperity. The adobe houses of the founders had been replaced by brick buildings with wooden blinds and cement floors which made the suffocating heat of two o’clock in the afternoon more bearable. All that remained at that time of José Arcadio Buendía’s ancient village were the dusty almond trees, destined to resist the most arduous of circumstances, and the river of clear water whose prehistoric stones had been pulverized by the frantic hammers of José Arcadio Segundo when he set about opening the channel in order to establish a boat line. It was a mad dream, comparable to those of his great-grandfather, for the rocky riverbed and the numerous rapids prevented navigation from Macondo to the sea. But José Arcadio Segundo, in an unforeseen burst of temerity, stubbornly kept on with the project. Until then he had shown no sign of imagination. Except for his precarious adventure with Petra Cotes, he had never known a woman. Úrsula had considered him the quietest example the family had ever produced in all its history, incapable of standing out even as a handler of fighting cocks, when Colonel Aureliano Buendía told him the story of the Spanish galleon aground eight miles from the sea, the carbonized frame of which he had seen himself during the war. The story, which for so many years had seemed fantastic to so many people, was a revelation for José Arcadio Segundo. He auctioned off his roosters to the highest bidder, recruited men, bought tools, and set about the awesome task of breaking stones, digging canals, clearing away rapids, and even harnessing waterfalls. “I know all of this by heart,” Úrsula would shout. “It’s as if time had turned around and we were back at the beginning.” When he thought that the river was navigable, José Arcadio Segundo gave his brother a detailed account of his plans and the latter gave him the money he needed for the enterprise. He disappeared for a long time. It had been said that his plan to buy a boat was nothing but a trick to make off with his brother’s money when the news spread that a strange craft was approaching the town. The inhabitants of Macondo, who no longer remembered the colossal undertakings of José Arcadio Buendía, ran to the riverbank and saw with eyes popping in disbelief the arrival of the first and last boat ever to dock in the town. It was nothing but a log raft drawn by thick ropes pulled by twenty men who walked along the bank. In the prow, with a glow of satisfaction in his eyes, José Arcadio Segundo was directing the arduous maneuver. There arrived with him a rich group of splendid matrons who were protecting themselves from the burning sun with gaudy parasols, and wore on their shoulders fine silk kerchiefs, with colored creams on their faces and natural flowers in their hair and golden serpents on their arms and diamonds in their teeth. The log raft was the only vessel that José Arcadio Segundo was able to bring to Macondo, and only once, but he never recognized the failure of his enterprise, but proclaimed his deed as a victory of will power. He gave a scrupulous accounting to his brother and very soon plunged back into the routine of cockfights. The only thing that remained of that unfortunate venture was the breath of renovation that the matrons from France brought, as their magnificent arts transformed traditional methods of love and their sense of social well-being abolished Catarino’s antiquated place and turned the street into a bazaar of Japanese lanterns and nostalgic hand organs. They were the promoters of the bloody carnival that plunged Macondo into delirium for three days and whose only lasting consequence was having given Aureliano Segundo the opportunity to meet Fernanda del Carpio.","Those events, which often made Ursula very anxious, were commonplace during this period. Macondo was submerged in a miraculous devastation. The mud-walled thatched houses of the founding fathers were now replaced by brick houses with cement floors and sunshades woven from small wooden slats. These houses made the already hot atmosphere even more stifling at two in the afternoon. The old village of José Arcadio Buendía now only had dusty almond trees ready to endure much harsher conditions, and the crystal-clear river whose prehistoric rocks had been shattered into fragments by the frenzied hammer blows of José Arcadio Segundo when he began dredging the river to establish a waterway. It was a crazy dream comparable to the dreams of his ancestors, because the riverbed full of boulders and its rapids prevented boats from traveling from Macondo to the sea. But José Arcadio Segundo, in his bold and reckless determination, threw himself into the work with fervor. Until now, he had never revealed his calculative abilities. Except for a brief affair with Petra Cotes, he had never known a woman. Ursula considered him a prime example of the lack of intelligence that her family, in its enduring history, had produced. He almost had no ability to stand out even though he was an expert cockfighter. When Colonel Aureliano Buendía told him about the Spanish ship lying twelve kilometers from the sea, whose hull had turned to coal, which he had seen with his own eyes during the war, this story seemed mystical to others for a long time but was understandable to him. He sold all his fighting cocks at the highest price, gathered the village men, and spent money on saws and chisels, then began the grand task of breaking rocks, dredging the riverbed, and overcoming rapids... ""I know it all too well,"" Ursula said. "" It's as if time runs in circles and now we are back at the beginning. "" When he was convinced that boats could navigate the river, José Arcadio Segundo meticulously presented his plans, and his brother gave him enough money for the work. He was absent for a long time. People were gossiping that his plan to buy a steamboat was just a ruse to get money from his brother when news spread: a warship was approaching the town. The people of Macondo, who had long forgotten the feats of José Arcadio Buendía, flocked noisily to the riverbank and, with skeptical eyes, saw the first boat slowly approaching. It was the first and also the last boat to dock there. In reality, it was just a wooden raft pulled by twenty men walking with thick ropes. Standing at the end of the raft, with bright, enthusiastic eyes, José Arcadio Segundo directed this costly journey. Accompanying him was a group of flamboyant village prostitutes, carrying luxurious parasols to shield from the harsh sun, draped in precious silk scarves, faces heavily made up, hair adorned with flowers, golden snakes coiled around their arms, and teeth inlaid with pearls. That wooden raft was the only means of transportation that José Arcadio Segundo managed to push upstream to Macondo, and it was only that one time. But he would never admit it was a failure of his initial endeavor; instead, he always declared it as his achievement, ""a victory of willpower. "" He placed all the calculated expenses of the trip on his brother's shoulders. The only thing left from this unfavorable beginning was the fresh breeze brought to the town by the French-style prostitutes. Their exquisite art of pleasing men changed the traditional ways of prostitution, and its social welfare significance toppled Catarino's store, turning the streets into a common market with Japanese-style lanterns and phonographs playing melancholic tunes. They were the driving force behind the bloody Carnival festival that plunged Macondo into fear for three days, and its only lasting result was that it allowed Aureliano Segundo to meet Fernanda del Carpio.",20.32,20.169,"These events, which so surprised and upset Ursula, were considered very ordinary in those days. Macondo was buried in unprecedented wealth. In place of the adobe houses of the town's founders, brick structures with cement floors and wooden shutters, which made the oppressive midday heat a bit more bearable, had been erected. The only thing left of Jose Arcadio Buendia's village at that time was the river, with its dusty almond trees destined to endure the harshest conditions and the prehistoric stones shattered by Jose Arcadio Segundo's sledgehammer. When Jose Arcadio Segundo set his mind on operating a ship to Macondo, he had not left a single stone unturned in the river. This was a dream that could only be compared to the craziness of his great-grandfather's dreams. Because the rocky nature of the riverbed and the presence of currents in places made it impossible to reach the sea from Macondo by water. But Jose Arcadio Segundo, stubbornly and with a mad audacity, kept insisting. Until then, he had shown no signs of imagination. Besides his rootless adventure with Petra Cotes, he had not known any woman. During the days when Colonel Aureliano Buendia was telling Jose Arcadio Segundo about the Spanish galleon lying about twelve kilometers inland from the sea, whose decayed skeleton he had seen with his own eyes during the war, Ursula knew him as the quietest person in the family, someone who couldn't even manage to stand out in cockfights. For years, this galleon story, which seemed like a fairy tale to most people, sparked a new idea in Jose Arcadio Segundo's mind. He sold his roosters at auction, hired men, bought tools, and embarked on the daunting task of breaking rocks, opening channels, clearing currents, and even taming waterfalls. Ursula was shouting, -I know all of this by heart. -It's as if time has reversed and we've come back to the very beginning, she was saying. When Jose Arcadio Segundo came to the conclusion that the river could be made navigable, he shared his plans with his brother, who then gave him the necessary money for this venture. Jose Arcadio Segundo disappeared for a long time. While rumors were spreading that the plan to buy a ship was just an excuse to extort money from his brother, news came that an unprecedented vessel was approaching the town. The people of Macondo, who had long forgotten the grand ventures of Jose Arcadio Buendia, rushed to the shore and, with eyes wide in astonishment, watched the first and last boat the town would ever see. This was nothing more than a raft made of planks, being pulled by twenty people walking along the shore with a rope. Standing at the front of the raft with the joy of accomplishing something in his eyes, Jose Arcadio Segundo was maneuvering with great difficulty. There was a heap of beautiful women beside him. The women had applied colorful creams to their faces, adorned their hair with real flowers, wrapped serpentine gold bracelets around their arms, and embedded diamonds in their teeth. They had thin silk shawls on their shoulders. They had opened colorful and fancy umbrellas to protect themselves from the sun. The wooden raft became the only boat that Jose Arcadio Segundo could bring to Macondo - and he could bring it only once. But he never accepted the failure of this endeavor and defended it as a victory of willpower. He gave a detailed account to his brother, then got caught up in cockfighting again. The only thing that remained from that ill-fated venture was the new breath the women brought from France. Their great skills outshone the lovemaking methods known in Macondo until then, and their not being slum girls eliminated Catarino's antiquated shop. The street where Catarino's shop was located became a marketplace where Japanese lanterns and music boxes playing sentimental songs were sold. Those women also initiated the carnival that made Macondo a scene of madness for three days and three nights and, apart from giving Aureliano Segundo the opportunity to meet Fernanda del Carpio, provided no other benefit.",18.554,18.391,"These things, which so greatly dismayed Úrsula, were common at that time. Macondo was drowning in a miraculous prosperity. The mud and cane houses of the founders had been replaced by brick constructions, with wooden shutters and cement floors, which made the suffocating heat of two in the afternoon more bearable. From the old village of José Arcadio Buendía, only the dusty almond trees, destined to withstand the harshest circumstances, and the river with its clear waters whose prehistoric stones were pulverized by the crazed sledgehammers of José Arcadio Segundo when he insisted on clearing the channel to establish a navigation service, remained. It was a delirious dream, comparable only to those of his great-grandfather, because the rocky bed and the numerous obstacles of the current prevented transit from Macondo to the sea. But José Arcadio Segundo, in an unforeseen burst of recklessness, persisted with the project. Until then, he had shown no sign of imagination. Except for his precarious adventure with Petra Cotes, he had never been known to have a woman. Úrsula considered him the dullest specimen the family had ever produced, incapable of standing out even as a cockfight troublemaker, when Colonel Aureliano Buendía told him the story of the Spanish galleon stranded twelve kilometers from the sea, whose charred ribs he himself saw during the war. The story, which had seemed fantastic to so many people for so long, was a revelation for José Arcadio Segundo. He auctioned off his roosters to the highest bidder, recruited men, bought tools, and embarked on the colossal enterprise of breaking stones, digging canals, clearing obstacles, and even leveling waterfalls. “I already know this by heart,” Úrsula shouted. “It’s as if time were going in circles and we had returned to the beginning.” When he deemed the river navigable, José Arcadio Segundo gave his brother a detailed presentation of his plans, and his brother gave him the money he needed for his enterprise. He disappeared for a long time. It was said that his project to buy a boat was nothing more than a ruse to abscond with his brother’s money, when news spread that a strange vessel was approaching the town. The inhabitants of Macondo, who no longer remembered the colossal enterprises of José Arcadio Buendía, rushed to the riverbank and saw with eyes wide with incredulity the arrival of the first and last boat that ever docked in the town. It was nothing more than a raft of logs, dragged by thick cables by twenty men walking along the riverbank. At the prow, with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes, José Arcadio Segundo directed the extravagant maneuver. Along with him came a group of splendid matrons who protected themselves from the scorching sun with colorful umbrellas, and wore precious silk shawls on their shoulders, colorful ointments on their faces, natural flowers in their hair, gold snakes on their arms, and diamonds in their teeth. The log raft was the only vehicle that José Arcadio Segundo managed to bring up to Macondo, and only once, but he never acknowledged the failure of his enterprise; instead, he proclaimed his feat as a victory of will. He gave scrupulous accounts to his brother and soon returned to the routine of the roosters. The only thing that remained of that unfortunate initiative was the breath of renewal brought by the matrons from France, whose magnificent arts changed the traditional methods of love, and whose sense of social well-being swept away the outdated store of Catarino and transformed the street into a bazaar of Japanese lanterns and nostalgic barrel organs. They were the promoters of the bloody carnival that for three days plunged Macondo into delirium, and whose only lasting consequence was giving Aureliano Segundo the opportunity to meet Fernanda del Carpio.",52.57,52.502
472,"Remedios the Beauty was proclaimed queen. Úrsula, who shuddered at the disquieted beauty of her great-granddaughter, could not prevent the choice. Until then she had succeeded in keeping her off the streets unless it was to go to mass with Amaranta, but she made her cover her face with a black shawl. The most impious men, those who would disguise themselves as priests to say sacrilegious masses in Catarino’s store, would go to church with an aim to see, if only for an instant, the face of Remedios the Beauty, whose legendary good looks were spoken of with alarming excitement throughout the swamp. It was a long time before they were able to do so, and it would have been better for them if they never had, because most of them never recovered their peaceful habits of sleep. The man who made it possible, a foreigner, lost his serenity forever, became involved in the sloughs of abjection and misery, and years later was cut to pieces by a train after he had fallen asleep on the tracks. From the moment he was seen in the church, wearing a green velvet suit and an embroidered vest, no one doubted that he came from far away, perhaps from some distant city outside of the country, attracted by the magical fascination of Remedios the Beauty. He was so handsome, so elegant and dignified, with such presence, that Pietro Crespi would have been a mere fop beside him and many women whispered with spiteful smiles that he was the one who really should have worn the shawl.

Ursula, who had once trembled before the mesmerizing beauty of her great-granddaughter, could do nothing to prevent this selection. Until that moment, she had tried every way to keep her from going out, except for attending mass with Amaranta, but she forced her to use a black veil to cover her face. The less devout men, those who pretended to be priests to conduct irreverent masses at Catarino's store, went to church with the sole purpose of catching even a fleeting glimpse of Remedios the Beauty, whose legendary beauty was fervently discussed throughout the swamp region. This happened long before they found an opportunity that was even more significant to them, because many of them, after beholding the beauty of Remedios the Beauty, never regained peaceful sleep. The person who created that opportunity was a stranger who had forever lost the tranquility of his soul, had fallen into a state of contemplative melancholy and easily provoked suffering, and a few years later was crushed by a train because he fell asleep on the tracks. From the moment he was seen at the church wearing a white and blue flannel suit, no one doubted that he was a stranger who had come from afar, possibly from some ancient city deep inland, lured by the beauty of Remedios the Beauty. He was a very handsome, gallant, and courteous man, with a harmoniously proportioned body to the extent that if Pietro Crespi stood next to him, he would seem sickly and frail. Many women whispered to each other with sad smiles that he was worthy of the girl. He did not associate with anyone in Macondo. He appeared early on Sunday mornings, like a prince from a fairy tale riding a horse saddled with flannel and stirrups.",23.337,23.037,"Beautiful Remedios was chosen as the carnival queen. Ursula, frightened by the intoxicating beauty of her grandson's daughter, could not prevent this selection. Until then, she had managed to keep the girl away from the street except for going to church with Amaranta, and even then, she made her cover her face tightly with a black veil. The most godless of men, those who dressed as priests and recited lewd prayers in Catarino's shop, and even those who had the least regard for religion, had started to frequent the church just to catch a glimpse of the legendary beauty of Beautiful Remedios, whose fame had spread throughout the swamp region. It was only after a very long time that they were able to see Beautiful Remedios's face. They wished they hadn't, because most of the men were deprived of sleep ever after. The stranger who made Beautiful Remedios unveil her face lost his mind completely, became miserable and wretched, and years later, fell asleep on the tracks and was torn apart by a train. When the man appeared in the church in his green velvet suit and embroidered vest, no one doubted that he had come from far away, perhaps from a distant town in a foreign country, drawn by the enchanting allure of Beautiful Remedios. The young man looked so handsome, so elegant, so polite, so dignified that Pietro Crespi would have seemed like a gaudy dandy next to him. The women began to whisper, saying that with such beauty, it was she who should be wearing the veil. The man did not speak to anyone in Macondo. At dawn on Sunday morning, he would arrive like a fairy tale prince on a horse with silver stirrups and a velvet-covered saddle, and after the church service, he would leave the town.",24.807,24.512,"Remedios, the beautiful, was proclaimed queen.

Aureliano Segundo was the only one who felt a cordial compassion for him and he tried to break his perseverance. “Don’t waste your time any more,” he told him one night. “The women in this house are worse than mules.” He offered him his friendship, invited him to bathe in champagne, tried to make him understand that the females of his family had insides made of flint, but he could not weaken his obstinacy. Exasperated by the interminable nights of music, Colonel Aureliano Buendía threatened to cure his affliction with a few pistol shots. Nothing made him desist except his own lamentable state of demoralization. From a well-dressed and neat individual he became filthy and ragged. It was rumored that he had abandoned power and fortune in his distant nation, although his origins were actually never known.

That the leading lady of a Spanish company passing through the capital had been kidnapped by a band of masked highwaymen and on the following Sunday she had danced in the nude at the summer house of the president of the republic. “Don’t talk to me about politics,” the colonel would tell him. “Our business is selling little fishes.” The rumor that he did not want to hear anything about the situation in the country because he was growing rich in his workshop made Úrsula laugh when it reached her ears. With her terrible practical sense she could not understand the colonel’s business as he exchanged little fishes for gold coins and then converted the coins into little fishes, and so on, with the result that he had to work all the harder with the more he sold in order to satisfy an exasperating vicious circle. Actually, what interested him was not the business but the work. He needed so much concentration to link scales, fit minute rubies into the eyes, laminate gills, and put on fins that there was not the smallest empty moment left for him to fill with his disillusionment of the war. So absorbing was the attention required by the delicacy of his artistry that in a short time he had aged more than during all the years of the war, and his position had twisted his spine and the close work had used up his eyesight, but the implacable concentration awarded him with a peace of the spirit. The last time he was seen to take an interest in some matter related to the war was when a group of veterans from both parties sought his support for the approval of lifetime pensions, which had always been promised and were always about to be put into effect. “Forget about it,” he told them. “You can see how I refuse my pension in order to get rid of the torture of waiting for it until the day I died.” At first Colonel Gerineldo Márquez would visit him at dusk and they would both sit in the street door and talk about the past. But Amaranta could not bear the memories that that man, whose baldness had plunged him into the abyss of premature old age, aroused in her, and she would torment him with snide remarks until he did not come back except on special occasions and he finally disappeared, extinguished by paralysis. Taciturn, silent, insensible to the new breath of vitality that was shaking the house, Colonel Aureliano Buendía could understand only that the secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude. He would get up at five in the morning after a light sleep, have his eternal mug of bitter coffee in the kitchen, shut himself up all day in the workshop, and at four in the afternoon he would go along the porch dragging a stool, not even noticing the fire of the rose bushes or the brightness of the hour or the persistence of Amaranta, whose melancholy made the noise of a boiling pot, which was perfectly perceptible at dusk, and he would sit in the street door as long as the mosquitoes would allow him to. Someone dared to disturb his solitude once.","Rumors that Remedios Buendía would preside over the festival had spread throughout the swamp region, reaching even the most remote corners where her renowned beauty was still unknown, causing anxiety among those who until then had thought her name was a symbol of corruption. It was an unfounded anxiety. If there was anyone at that time who was no longer a cause for concern, it was Colonel Aureliano Buendía, a sad old man who was gradually losing his connection with the reality of the country. Secluding himself in the jewelry workshop, his only link to the outside world was the trade of little goldfish. One of the soldiers who had guarded the colonel's house when peace was newly established would go daily to the neighboring villages to sell goldfish and return home with gold coins and news. There are rumors that the Royalist faction, with the help of the Liberal faction, has reformed the law so that each President has the right to stay in office for about a hundred years. There are rumors that an agreement with the Vatican has been signed, stating that a Cardinal Patriarch, adorned with a diamond-studded crown and riding on a golden throne, has come from Rome, and the Liberal ministers have taken photographs of the ceremony where they knelt to kiss his ring. There are rumors that a Spanish theater actress, during a night stay in the capital, was kidnapped by a masked group right in her bedroom, and on Sunday she danced naked at the summer house of the President of the Republic. ""Do not talk politics with me,"" the colonel said to the soldier. ""Our issue is selling goldfish."" The rumor that the colonel did not want to know anything about the state of the country because he had become wealthy from his jewelry workshop, when it reached Úrsula's ears, made her laugh with her very sharp sense of reality. She could not understand the colonel's business of constantly exchanging goldfish for gold coins, only to then turn the gold coins back into goldfish, and so on in a perpetual cycle: having to work harder the more he sold to satisfy the hopeless vicious circle. Indeed, for the colonel, what delighted him was not business but labor. He had to concentrate his mind intensely to arrange the scales, to inlay the tiny golden pupil into the eyes, to thin the scales in front of the fins, to attach the tail to the fish, so that there was no room in his mind for the disappointment of war to creep in. The meticulous and demanding profession required him to exert all his mental strength, which aged him very quickly, faster than all the arduous years of warfare combined; his working posture bent his spine, and his pupils lost their sharpness, but the intense concentration on his work rewarded him with a serene spirit. The last time he was seen concerned with any war-related issues was when veterans from both political parties sought his help to demand the government pass the war pension, a pension always promised but perpetually in the initial stages of processing. ""Forget about it,"" he told them. ""You see, I refused it to avoid the suffering of waiting in vain until death."" At first, Colonel Herinendo Marquez visited him every afternoon, and they both sat at the door looking out onto the street to reminisce about their past. But Amaranta suffered unbearably from the old memories stirred up by the very man whose weary head, already bald, had thrust him into the abyss of premature old age, and thus she tormented him with trivialities until he only visited on special occasions and eventually stopped coming altogether because paralysis confined him to one spot. Sullen, silent, and oblivious to the invigorating new breeze blowing through his house, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had come to understand that the secret to a peaceful old age was nothing other than a deep attachment to solitude. He woke up at five in the morning after a fitful sleep, drank the sugarless coffee that had been a constant in his life, then locked himself in his gold workshop. At four in the afternoon, he dragged his stool along the hallway without ever looking at the garden ablaze with red roses, paying no mind to Amaranta's patient determination as she followed every faint hum that marked the arrival of dusk, and then he sat at the door looking out at the street until the mosquitoes drove him inside. Occasionally, someone dared to disturb his solitude.",19.148,19.007,"The news that Remedios Buendia would be the carnival queen spread beyond the borders of the swamp region within a few hours, reaching distant places where her beauty was unknown, and intrigued and worried those who still saw her surname as a symbol of destruction. The worries were unfounded. If there was anyone who had become harmless at that time, it was Colonel Aureliano Buendia, who was aging, collapsing with disappointment, and gradually losing all connection with the realities of the country. He had shut himself in his workshop. His only connection to the world was the trade of ornamental fish. In the early days of peace, one of the soldiers standing guard at the house would take the fish made by Colonel Aureliano Buendia, go around the villages in the swamp selling them, and return with a heap of money and a heap of news. According to the soldier, the Conservative government had secured the support of the Liberals and was reforming the calendar so that Presidents could stay in power for a hundred years. Allegedly, an agreement was signed with the papacy in the end, and a cardinal with a diamond crown and a solid gold throne came from Rome. Allegedly, the Liberal ministers knelt before the cardinal and kissed his face while having their picture taken. Allegedly, the lead artist of a Spanish troupe touring the capital was kidnapped by masked bandits and made to perform naked at the president's summer house on Sunday. The Colonel said, ""Don't talk to me about politics."" ""Our job is to sell fish."" When the rumor that the Colonel did not want the country's situation to be discussed because he had started making money reached Ursula's ears, she laughed heartily. With her eerie intuition, Ursula couldn't understand the Colonel's business; how he sold the fish to buy gold, then converted the gold back into silver to make ornamental fish again, then sold them to earn gold once more, and ultimately, how he had to work as much as he sold to maintain this vicious cycle. Actually, what interested Colonel Aureliano Buendia was not the business aspect, but the work itself. Connecting the scales, setting tiny rubies into the eyes, flattening the gills, attaching the fins required such intense concentration that there was no time left to think about the disappointments brought by the war. Because of this, he deteriorated more in a short time than he had during all those years of war. Constant sitting had hunched his back, and bending over the work had ruined his eyes. However, the extreme intensity granted peace to his soul. The last time he dealt with a matter related to the war was when a mixed group of fighters from both sides asked for his support. They had been promised a lifelong pension, but this had never been implemented. The former warriors wanted the colonel to support them in securing the pension. The Colonel said, ""It's best to just forget it."" ""Look, I didn't accept the pension because I wanted to escape the torture of waiting for it to come, whether it would come or not, until I die."" Previously, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez would come to her in the afternoons, sitting at the front door and talking about the past. However, Amaranta, unable to bear the memories this man, who had prematurely fallen into the abyss of old age due to his baldness, stirred in her heart, kept making sarcastic remarks. In the end, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez stopped visiting their house except on important days, and later, after he had a stroke, he disappeared altogether. Colonel Aureliano Buendia, a quiet and reserved man who was indifferent to the new liveliness shaking the house, believed that to have a good old age, one must reconcile with solitude. After a short sleep, he would wake up at five in the morning, drink his usual black coffee in the kitchen, lock himself in his workshop all day, and at four in the afternoon, dragging his stool, he would pass through the veranda without noticing the flaming rosebuds, the brightness of the sun, or Amaranta's sobs, which resembled the sound of a boiling pot and were clearly heard in the evening silence as she succumbed to melancholy, and he would place the stool in front of the street door, sitting there until the mosquitoes began to bother him. Once, someone dared to break the solitude in which the colonel was immersed.",19.222,19.077,"The news that Remedios Buendía was going to be the queen of the festival spread beyond the limits of the swamp in a few hours, reaching distant territories where the immense prestige of her beauty was unknown, and arousing the unease of those who still considered her surname a symbol of subversion. It was an unfounded unease. If anyone was harmless at that time, it was the aged and disillusioned Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who had gradually lost all contact with the reality of the nation. Locked in his workshop, his only connection with the rest of the world was the trade of little gold fishes. One of the former soldiers who guarded his house in the early days of peace would sell them in the swamp towns and return loaded with coins and news.

481,"So that the anxiety caused by the public reappearance of his family name, having to do with the coronation of Remedios the Beauty, was baseless. Many people did not think that way, however. Innocent of the tragedy that threatened it, the town poured into the main square in a noisy explosion of merriment. The carnival had reached its highest level of madness and Aureliano Segundo had satisfied at last his dream of dressing up like a tiger and was walking along the wild throng, hoarse from so much roaring, when on the swamp road a parade of several people appeared carrying in a gilded litter the most fascinating woman that imagination could conceive. For a moment the inhabitants of Macondo took off their masks in order to get a better look at the dazzling creature with a crown of emeralds and an ermine cape, who seemed invested with legitimate authority, and was not merely a sovereign of bangles and crepe paper. There were many people who had sufficient insight to suspect that it was a question of provocation. But Aureliano Segundo immediately conquered his perplexity and declared the new arrivals to be guests of honor, and with the wisdom of Solomon he seated Remedios the Beauty and the intruding queen on the same dais. Until midnight the strangers, disguised as bedouins, took part in the delirium and even enriched it with sumptuous fireworks and acrobatic skills that made one think of the art of the gypsies. Suddenly, during the paroxysm of the celebration, someone broke the delicate balance.","Thus, the concern caused by the public reappearance of the Buendía family through the crowning of Remedios the Beauty had lost its practical basis. However, many people did not believe so. Naive in the face of the impending disaster, the populace flocked to the grand square in an uproarious and boundless belief. The Carnival ball had reached its feverish peak, and Aureliano Segundo, satisfied with his tiger disguise, joyfully moved among the self-indulgent crowd, shouting and singing until his voice was hoarse. At that very moment, on the road leading from the swamp into the town, appeared a procession of colorfully disguised people, carrying a gilded palanquin on which sat a girl so stunningly beautiful that people dared not even think of her. The gentle residents of the town of Macondo simultaneously removed their masks to get a better look at the dazzling girl in a crown adorned with emeralds and a cloak made of bird feathers, as if she were a true queen and not just a beauty queen in the masquerade ball of Carnival. There was no shortage of people with enough clear-headed reasoning to suspect that the group intended to provoke. But Aureliano Segundo immediately overcame this complicated situation, declaring that the newcomers were honored guests, and he solemnly seated Remedios the Beauty and the disguised queen together on the high platform. By midnight, the strangers disguised as Bedouins joined the ecstatic festivities of the night and enriched the fun with brilliant pyrotechnics and rope-walking tricks that made everyone think of the magical games of the gypsies.

While wandering among the crowd, hoarse from shouting, a few people appeared on the main road coming from the swamp. They were carrying the most beautiful, most alluring woman one could imagine in a gilded litter. The people of Macondo, realizing that this woman was not an artificial queen adorned with crepe paper but looked like a real queen with her ermine cloak and emerald crown, took off their masks for a moment to get a better look at her. Many people sensed that the main purpose of this arrival was provocation and challenge. Aureliano Segundo, however, quickly recovered and declared the newcomers as guests of honor. Then, with a just and wise gesture reminiscent of King Solomon, he seated Beautiful Remedios and the newly arrived queen side by side on the same throne.

Many years later there were those who still insisted that the royal guard of the intruding queen was a squad of regular army soldiers who were concealing government-issue rifles under their rich Moorish robes. The government denied the charge in a special proclamation and promised a complete investigation of the bloody episode. But the truth never came to light, and the version always prevailed that the royal guard, without provocation of any kind, took up combat positions upon a signal from their commander and opened fire without pity on the crowd.

In a special communiqué, the government opposed this public opinion and promised to conduct a thorough investigation into this bloodshed.

Nature had made him reserved and elusive, with tendencies towards solitary meditation, and she had shaped his character into the opposite: vital, expansive, uninhibited, and had instilled in him the joy of living and the pleasure of partying and extravagance, until she turned him, inside and out, into the man she had dreamed of for herself since adolescence. He had gotten married, as children eventually do. He did not dare to break the news to her in advance. He assumed such a childish attitude towards the situation that he pretended to have false grudges and imaginary resentments, looking for a way for Petra Cotes to provoke the breakup.

In the heat of the merriment that broke out that evening, he had Petra Cotes dress up as queen, crowned her absolute and lifetime ruler of Madagascar, and handed out copies of the picture to his friends, she not only went along with the game, but she felt sorry for him inside, thinking that he must have been very frightened to have conceived of that extravagant means of reconciliation.

She not only played along with the game but also felt pity for him, thinking that he must have been very desperate to come up with such a strange way to make amends. At seven in the evening, still wearing the queenly attire, she received him in bed. He had been married for only a few months, but she immediately noticed that the couple was not getting along even in their marital bed, and she was ecstatic to see her revenge fully realized. However, two days later, when he not only did not dare to return to her house but also sent an intermediary to settle the terms of their separation, she understood that she would need to be more patient and that he seemed determined to pursue that superficial glitter. She was not upset. She complied with all his demands, making everyone genuinely believe that she was a suffering woman.

Petra Cotes, on one hand, was participating in this game, and on the other hand, she was secretly feeling sorry for Aureliano Segundo, thinking about how frightened he must have been to come up with such an extravagant way of reconciliation. At seven in the evening, without taking off her queen costume, Petra Cotes received Aureliano Segundo in bed. Aureliano Segundo had not even been married for two months, but at first glance, the woman realized that things were not going well in the bridal bed and savored the insatiable pleasure of taking revenge. However, when two days later Aureliano Segundo, not daring to come himself, sent an envoy to negotiate the terms of separation, Petra Cotes realized that she would have to show more patience than she had anticipated. Because Aureliano Segundo seemed ready to make any sacrifice to save appearances. Petra Cotes did not panic this time either.

492,"She did not have to wait as long as she had imagined. Actually, Aureliano Segundo understood from the night of his wedding that he would return to the house of Petra Cotes much sooner than when he would have to put on the patent leather boots: Fernanda was a woman who was lost in the world. She had been born and raised in a city six hundred miles away, a gloomy city where on ghostly nights the coaches of the viceroys still rattled through the cobbled streets, Thirty-two belfries tolled a dirge at six in the afternoon. In the manor house, which was paved with tomblike slabs, the sun was never seen. The air had died in the cypresses in the courtyard, in the pale trappings of the bedrooms, in the dripping archways of the garden of perennials. Until puberty Fernanda had no news of the world except for the melancholy piano lessons taken in some neighboring house by someone who for years and years had the drive not to take a siesta. In the room of her sick mother, green and yellow under the powdery light from the windowpanes, she would listen to the methodical, stubborn, heartless scales and think that that music was in the world while she was being consumed as she wove funeral wreaths. Her mother, perspiring with five-o’clock fever, spoke to her of the splendor of the past. When she was a little girl, on one moonlit night Fernanda saw a beautiful woman dressed in white crossing the garden toward the chapel. What bothered her most about that fleeting vision was that she felt it was exactly like her, as if she had seen herself twenty years in advance. “It was your great-grandmother the queen,” her mother told her during a truce in her coughing. “She died of some bad vapors while she was cutting a string of bulbs.” Many years later, when she began to feel she was the equal of her great-grandmother, Fernanda doubted her childhood vision, but her mother scolded her disbelief.","She did not have to wait as long as she had previously predicted. In fact, Aureliano Segundo, right from the wedding night, understood that he would return to Petra Cotes' house much sooner than he would need to wear the beige boots, because Fernanda was a woman out of place in this life. She was born and raised in a place thousands of kilometers away from the sea, a desolate city with fearful nights echoing the clattering wheels of viceroys on the rough stone streets. Thirty-two bell towers tolled mournfully and deathly at six o'clock in the evening. The sun never shone on the old stone-paved house. The wind died on the tops of the cypress trees in the yard, on the faded wind screens in the rooms, on the intersecting arches of the camphor trees in the garden. Even when she reached puberty, Fernanda knew nothing of life beyond the melancholic, longing piano practice pieces played by someone permitted to skip the afternoon nap next door. Sitting in her sickly, pale mother's room in the filtered light through dusty frosted glass; she listened to the orderly, mournful, and sorrowful notes and thought that music existed in life, while she busily braided mourning hats from palm leaves. Her mother, sweating with fever at five in the afternoon, told her stories of past glories. One moonlit night, when she was still a child, Fernanda saw the shadow of a woman in white walking from the flower garden into the prayer room. The shadow that passed by so quickly worried her because she felt it looked exactly like her, as if it were her own shadow twenty years later. ""That was your great-great-grandmother,"" her mother said as her cough subsided, ""She died of a chill while cutting a camphor branch."" Many years later, when she felt she looked exactly like her great-great-grandmother, Fernanda began to doubt the ghost she had seen as a child, but her mother scolded her for her lack of faith.",17.735,17.42,"He didn't have to wait as long as he thought. Aureliano Segundo realized on his wedding night that he would go to Petra Cotes' house long before he reached the age to pull on his boots and wait for death. Fernanda was a living dead. She was born and raised in a city about a thousand kilometers away. It was a gloomy city where the sounds of the carriages of long-gone governors could still be heard on the cobblestones of deserted streets on dark nights. At six in the evening, death bells would ring from exactly thirty-two towers. In the mansion with wooden floors resembling a funeral slab, the sun was never seen. The cypress trees in the garden, the pale, heavy curtains of the bedrooms, and the arches covered with climbing roses in the garden would completely suffocate the air. Until she reached her teenage years, Fernanda grew up unaware of the world, except for the melancholic hum of piano lessons that a neighbor had persistently continued for years, resisting taking a nap. Fernanda would sit in the room of her sick mother, whose skin appeared greenish-yellow in the light seeping through the shutters, listening to the methodical, monotonous, emotionless sounds of the keys, and while she withered away weaving funeral wreaths, she thought that music was the world. Her mother, burning with evening fever and sweating, would tell her how unparalleled the beauty of the past was. When Fernanda was very young, on a moonlit night, she had seen a very beautiful woman dressed in white walking towards the small church in the garden. The aspect of that image, which never left her sight, that disturbed Fernanda was that the woman looked exactly like her own spouse. It was as if she had seen her younger self, from twenty years ago. Her mother, in between bouts of coughing, would say, ""She was the queen who was your great-grandmother."" ""She died because she was bothered by the smell while cutting a bunch of onions,"" she would say. Years later, when Fernanda began to suspect that she was the spitting image of her great-grandmother, she doubted whether what she had seen as a child was just a figment of her imagination.

494,"She believed it, even though they were sitting at the long table with a linen tablecloth and silver service to have a cup of watered chocolate and a sweet bun. Until the day of her wedding she dreamed about a legendary kingdom, in spite of the fact that her father, Don Fernando, had to mortgage the house in order to buy her trousseau. It was not innocence or delusions of grandeur. That was how they had brought her up. Since she had had the use of reason she remembered having done her duty in a gold pot with the family crest on it. She left the house for the first time at the age of twelve in a coach and horses that had to travel only two blocks to take her to the convent. Her classmates were surprised that she sat apart from them in a chair with a very high back and that she would not even mingle with them during recess. “She’s different,” the nuns would explain. “She’s going to be a queen.” Her schoolmates believed this because she was already the most beautiful, distinguished, and discreet girl they had ever seen. At the end of eight years, after having learned to write Latin poetry, play the clavichord, talk about falconry with gentlemen and apologetics, with archbishops, discuss affairs of state with foreign rulers and affairs of God with the Pope, she returned to her parents’ home to weave funeral wreaths. She found it despoiled. All that was left was the furniture that was absolutely necessary, the silver candelabra and table service, for the everyday utensils had been sold one by one to underwrite the costs of her education. Her mother had succumbed to five-o’clock fever. Her father, Don Fernando, dressed in black with a stiff collar and a gold watch chain, would give her a silver coin on Mondays for the household expenses, and the funeral wreaths finished the week before would be taken away. He spent most of his time shut up in his study and the few times that he went out he would return to recite the rosary with her. She had intimate friendships with no one. She had never heard mention of the wars that were bleeding the country. She continued her piano lessons at three in the afternoon. She had even began to lose the illusion of being a queen when two peremptory raps of the knocker sounded at the door and she opened it to a well-groomed military officer with ceremonious manners who had a scar on his cheek and a gold medal on his chest. He closeted himself with her father in the study. Two hours later her father came to get her in the sewing room. “Get your things together,” he told her. “You have to take a long trip.” That was how they took her to Macondo. In one single day, with a brutal slap, life threw on top of her the whole weight of a reality that her parents had kept hidden from her for many years. When she returned home she shut herself up in her room to weep, indifferent to Don Fernando’s pleas and explanations as he tried to erase the scars of that strange joke. She had sworn to herself never to leave her bedroom until she died when Aureliano Segundo came to get her. It was an act of impossible fate, because in the confusion of her indignation, in the fury of her shame, she had lied to him so that he would never know her real identity. The only real clues that Aureliano Segundo had when he left to look for her were her unmistakable highland accent and her trade as a weaver of funeral wreaths. He searched for her without cease. With the fierce temerity with which José Arcadio Buendía had crossed the mountains to found Macondo, with the blind pride with which Colonel Aureliano Buendía had undertaken his fruitless wars, with the mad tenacity with which Úrsula watched over the survival of the line, Aureliano Segundo looked for Fernanda, without a single moment of respite. When he asked where they sold funeral wreaths they took him from house to house so that he could choose the best ones. When he asked for the most beautiful woman who had ever been seen on this earth, all the women brought him their daughters. He became lost in misty byways, in times reserved for oblivion, in labyrinths of disappointment. He crossed a yellow plain where the echo repeated one’s thoughts and where anxiety brought on premonitory mirages. After sterile weeks he came to an unknown city where all the bells were tolling a dirge. Although he had never seen them and no one had ever described them to him he immediately recognized the walls eaten away by bone salt, the broken-down wooden balconies gutted by fungus, and nailed to the outside door, almost erased by rain, the saddest cardboard sign in the world: Funeral Wreaths for Sale. From that moment until the icy morning when Fernanda left her house under the care of the Mother Superior there was barely enough time for the nuns to sew her trousseau and in six trunks put the candelabra, the silver service, and the gold chamberpot along with the countless and useless remains of a family catastrophe that had been two centuries late in its fulfillment. Don Fernando declined the invitation to go along. He promised to go later when he had cleared up his affairs, and from the moment when he gave his daughter his blessing he shut himself up in his study again to write out the announcements with mournful sketches and the family coat of arms, which would be the first human contact that Fernanda and her father would have had in all their lives. That was the real date of her birth for her. For Aureliano Segundo it was almost simultaneously the beginning and the end of happiness.","She believed that even though her family currently owned only a long dining table with enough cloth and silverware, and this table was only used for eating pastries and drinking chocolate. Even on her wedding day, she still dreamed of the time of kings. This legend persisted even though her father, Don Fernando, had to mortgage the house to get money for her wedding attire. Not too naive nor pretentious about her family's prestige, she was raised in such a manner. From the time she had a little understanding, she remembered sitting on a golden chamber pot engraved with her family's coat of arms to relieve herself. The first time she left the house was when she was twelve years old, in a carriage that only needed to travel two blocks to reach the convent. The classmates were all surprised that she was separated, made to sit on a very high chair, and that even during playtime she did not play with them. ""She is very different,"" the nuns explained to them, ""She will be a queen. "" Her friends believed it because even then she was already a beautiful, unusual, and discreet girl. Eight years later, after learning to write poetry in Latin, to play the clavichord, to converse with young noblemen about falconry, with bishops about theological matters, to debate with foreign diplomats about state affairs, and with the Pope about matters of God, she returned to her parents' home to weave mourning hats from palm leaves. She found her home cleared of furniture. Almost only valueless beds and wardrobes, chandeliers, and the silverware remained, because the valuable items had been gradually sold off to cover the costs of her education. Her mother had passed away from a fever at five in the afternoon. Her father, Don Fernando, dressed in black, with a high-collared shirt and a gold chain draped across his chest, would give her a silver coin for food expenses on Mondays, then take away the mourning hats made of palm leaves that she had finished the previous week. He spent most of the day in his private room, and on the rare occasions he went out, he hurried back home before six in the evening to pray the Rosary with her. He never befriended anyone. He never spoke of the civil wars that were ravaging the country. He never missed her piano practice sessions at three in the afternoon. When she began to lose hope of becoming a queen, there was an urgent knock on the main door. She quickly opened it to a handsome soldier with a scar on his cheek and a gold medal pinned to his chest. He went to have a private conversation with her father. Two hours later, her father came to the sewing room to find her. ""Prepare your belongings,"" he told her, ""You need to go far away."" That is how she was taken to Macondo. In just one day, life had brought down upon her all the weight of a reality that in For many years, her parents deliberately shielded her. Since returning home, she locked herself in her room, crying, ignoring the pleas and explanations of Don Fernanda, to erase the burning shame that had scarred her skin. She had just vowed to herself that she would not leave her room until she died when Aureliano Segundo came to the house looking for her. It was an unforeseen stroke of luck because, in her confusion and anger, in her fury and shame, she had lied to him so he would never trace her true whereabouts. But the only tangible clue for Aureliano Segundo to follow in his search for her was her unmistakable plains accent and her craft of weaving mourning hats from palm leaves. He patiently searched for her with the same determination that José Arcadio Buendía had used to cross the mountains and found Macondo, with the blind pride that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had used to ignite futile wars, with the mad perseverance that Úrsula had used to assert the endurance of her lineage. That was how Aureliano Segundo searched for Fernanda, never showing any sign of discouragement. When he asked where mourning hats woven from palm leaves were sold, people led him to their homes to choose the finest hats. When he asked where the most beautiful girl on earth was, mothers immediately took him to see their daughters. He got lost in cloud-covered mountain passes, in forgotten regions, and in the maze of despair. He crossed a withered plateau where only the echo of his thoughts and the blinding thirst accompanied him. After many weeks of hardship, he reached a strange city where all the church bells tolled mournfully. Though he had never seen it before, nor heard it described, he immediately recognized the weathered walls eroded by salty winds, the rickety wooden balconies eaten away by termites, and the sign advertising mourning hats, with its letters faded on an old cardboard. From the moment he arrived until the morning Fernanda left the house in the care of the Almighty Virgin, they were so busy that there was hardly enough time for the nuns to sew the bridal gown. They were preoccupied with packing chandeliers, silverware, and countless useless items from the noble family that had been bankrupt for two centuries into six large trunks. Don Fernanda declined the invitation to accompany them. He promised to go once he had fulfilled his promises. From the moment he bowed to bless his daughter, he closed himself off again in his room, writing letters in verse adorned with sorrowful decorations and the family crest, which were the only means through which Fernanda and her father had direct contact with the outside world. For Fernanda, that day was her true birthday. For Aureliano Segundo, that day was both the beginning and the end of his happiness.",23.734,23.637,"Sitting at a long table with linen cloths spread out and silver cutlery placed, only to leave the table finding nothing but sweet rolls and water with little chocolate and plenty of cocoa, Fernanda still believed her mother's words. Even though her father, Don Fernando, had to mortgage the house to make her a dowry, Fernanda dreamed of a legendary queenship until her wedding day. This was neither naivety nor a longing for grandeur. She had been raised that way. For as long as she could remember, she had relieved herself on a golden seat embroidered with the family crest. She left the house for the first time at the age of twelve and was placed in a decorated carriage to go to the convent school two streets away. His classmates were quite surprised that he sat in a separate corner on a very high-backed chair and did not join them even during breaks. The nuns would say, ""He is not like you."" -She will be the queen. Her classmates immediately believed this statement because they had never seen a girl as beautiful, elegant, and distinguished as her. After eight years of education, during which she learned to write Latin poetry, play the piano, discuss hunting with young men, theology with bishops, world affairs with foreign heads of state, and matters of the afterlife with the Pope, Fernanda returned to her father's house to spend her days weaving garlands. She found the house completely empty. After staying at home for so long, only a few essential pieces of furniture, silver candlesticks, and a silver dinner set remained; the everyday items had been sold off one by one to cover his school expenses. Her mother's fever had started to rise every evening. Her father, Don Fernando, who dressed in black, wore stiff collars, and carried a gold chain, would give her a silver coin on Mondays to cover the household expenses and would send off the wreaths prepared the previous week. Her father spent most of his time shut away in his study, and although he occasionally left the house, he would return at prayer time to pray with his daughter, using a rosary. Fernanda had no close friends. She was unaware of the ongoing bloody wars. Every day at three o'clock, she continued her piano lessons. Just as she was beginning to lose her dreams of becoming a queen, one day, the door knocker was struck twice. When Fernanda opened the door, she saw an officer standing there with a formal demeanor, well-dressed, a scar on his cheek, and a gold medal on his chest. The officer and her father shut themselves in the study. Two hours later, her father came to the sewing room and called for her. -Pack your things, he said. -You will go on a long journey. This is how they brought him to Macondo. Life, in a single day, with a merciless slap, crushed him under the full weight of the truths his family had been hiding for years. After Fernanda returned home, she locked herself in her room and began to cry, ignoring Don Fernando's explanations and pleas as he tried to erase the traces of this meaningless joke. She swore not to leave her room until she died. At that moment, Aureliano Segundo came to get her. This was an incomprehensible twist of fate. Because Fernanda, in that anger and shame, had lied to Aureliano Segundo so that he wouldn't learn her true identity. When Aureliano Segundo set out to look for her, he knew nothing more than that the girl spoke with the accent typical of the mountainous region and that she wove funeral wreaths. He searched for her tirelessly. With the same terrible determination that led Jose Arcadio Buendia to cross the mountains to find Macondo, with the blind pride that drove Colonel Aureliano Buendia into futile wars, and with the mad diligence Ursula showed in continuing her lineage, Aureliano Segundo searched for Fernanda. He searched without stopping for a moment, without losing hope for a moment. When he asked anyone he came across where funeral wreaths were sold, they took him from house to house so he could choose the best one and buy the one he liked. When he asked for the most beautiful woman in the world, all the women pointed to their own daughters. Aureliano Segundo lost himself in foggy paths, wasted times, and the dead-end of disappointment. He passed through a yellow plain. Here, a person's thoughts echoed, and what crossed their mind stood before them like a mirage. After wandering for weeks without any results, he entered a foreign city where funeral bells were ringing in all its towers. Although Aureliano Segundo had never seen or heard of it, as soon as he saw the worn walls, the moss-covered broken wooden balconies, and the world's most sorrowful 'Wreaths for Sale' sign on the street door, so faded by the rain that it was almost unreadable, he realized this was the place he had been searching for. In that short period, from the moment Fernanda left the house on the arm of the abbess on that freezing morning, the nuns only had enough time to sew the wedding dress and pack countless useless items left over from a family tragedy two hundred years overdue, silver candlesticks, silver tableware, and a golden chamber pot into six chests. Don Fernando did not accept the call to go along with the bride. After putting his affairs in order, he promised to come in the future, and after blessing and wishing happiness for his daughter, he shut himself in his room, drafting announcements more suited for obituaries, and wrote wedding announcements bearing the family crest. Throughout their lives, this was the first humane relationship between Fernanda and her father. That day was truly the day Fernanda was born, and for Aureliano Segundo, it was the day happiness both began and ended.",21.93,21.833,"She believed it, although they only occupied the long table with linen tablecloths and silverware to have a cup of chocolate with water and a sweet bread. Until the day of the wedding, she dreamed of a legendary reign, despite the fact that her father, Don Fernando, had to mortgage the house to buy her trousseau. It was neither naivety nor delusions of grandeur. That was how she was raised. Since she could remember, she had done her business in a golden chamber pot with the family coat of arms. She left the house for the first time at twelve years old, in a horse-drawn carriage that only had to travel two blocks to take her to the convent. Her classmates were surprised that she was kept apart, in a high-backed chair, and that she didn't even mix with them during recess. ""She is different,"" the nuns explained. "" She is going to be a queen. ""Her classmates believed it, because even then she was the most beautiful, distinguished, and discreet maiden they had ever seen. After eight years, having learned to versify in Latin, to play the clavichord, to converse about falconry with gentlemen and apologetics with archbishops, to discuss state matters with foreign rulers and matters of God with the Pope, she returned to her parents' house to weave funeral palms. She found it ransacked. Only the essential furniture, the candelabras, and the silverware remained, because the household items had been sold, one by one, to cover the costs of her education. Her mother had succumbed to the five o'clock fever. Her father, Don Fernando, dressed in black, with a laminated collar and a gold watch chain across his chest, gave her a silver coin on Mondays for household expenses, and took the funeral wreaths finished the previous week. He spent most of the day locked in the office, and on the few occasions when he went out, he returned before six to accompany her in praying the rosary. She never had an intimate friendship with anyone. She never heard about the wars that bled the country dry. She never stopped hearing the piano exercises at three in the afternoon. She was even beginning to lose the illusion of being a queen when two peremptory knocks sounded at the gate, and she opened it to a dashing military man, with ceremonious manners, who had a scar on his cheek and a gold medal on his chest. He locked himself in the office with her father. Two hours later, her father came to fetch her from the sewing room. "" Prepare your things,"" he said. ""You have to take a long trip. "" That was how they took her to Macondo. In a single day, with a brutal blow, life threw upon her all the weight of a reality that her parents had hidden from her for years. Upon returning home, she locked herself in her room to cry, indifferent to Don Fernando's pleas and explanations, trying to erase the burn of that unheard-of mockery. She had promised herself not to leave the bedroom until death, when Aureliano Segundo came to find her. It was an inconceivable stroke of luck, because in the daze of indignation, in the fury of shame, she had lied to him so that he would never know her true identity. The only real clues Aureliano Segundo had when he set out to find her were her unmistakable highland diction and her occupation as a funeral palm weaver. He searched for her relentlessly. With the fierce determination with which José Arcadio Buendía crossed the mountains to found Macondo, with the blind pride with which Colonel Aureliano Buendía promoted his useless wars, with the insane tenacity with which Úrsula ensured the survival of the lineage, Aureliano Segundo searched for Fernanda, without a single moment of discouragement. When he asked where they sold funeral palms, they took him from house to house to choose the best ones. When he asked where the most beautiful woman on earth was, all the mothers brought their daughters to him. He got lost through foggy ravines, through times reserved for oblivion, through labyrinths of disillusionment. He crossed a yellow wasteland where the echo repeated thoughts and anxiety caused premonitory mirages. After weeks of fruitless searching, he arrived in an unknown city where all the bells were tolling for the dead. Although he had never seen them, nor had anyone described them to him, he immediately recognized the walls corroded by the lime of bones, the decrepit balconies of wood gutted by fungi, and nailed to the gate and almost erased by the rain, the saddest little sign in the world: Funeral palms for sale. From then until the cold morning when Fernanda left the house in the care of the Mother Superior, there was barely enough time for the nuns to sew the trousseau and pack the candelabras, the silverware, the golden chamber pot, and the countless and useless remnants of a family catastrophe that had taken two centuries to consummate into six trunks. Don Fernando declined the invitation to accompany them. He promised to come later, when he finished settling his commitments, and from the moment he blessed his daughter, he locked himself back in the office to write her letters with mourning borders and the family coat of arms that would be the first human contact Fernanda and her father would have in their entire lives. For her, that was the real date of her birth. For Aureliano Segundo, it was almost simultaneously the beginning and the end of happiness.",44.731,44.677
495,"Fernanda carried a delicate calendar with small golden keys on which her spiritual adviser had marked in purple ink the dates of venereal abstinence. Not counting Holy week, Sundays, holy days of obligation, first Fridays, retreats, sacrifices, and cyclical impediments, her effective year was reduced to forty-two days that were spread out through a web of purple crosses. Aureliano Segundo, convinced that time would break up that hostile network, prolonged the wedding celebration beyond the expected time. Tired of throwing out so many empty brandy and champagne bottles so that they would not clutter up the house and at the same time intrigued by the fact that the newlyweds slept at different times and in separate rooms while the fireworks and music and the slaughtering of cattle went on, Úrsula remembered her own experience and wondered whether Fernanda might have a chastity belt too which would sooner or later provoke jokes in the town and give rise to a tragedy. But Fernanda confessed to her that she was just letting two weeks go by before allowing the first contact with her husband. Indeed, when the period was over, she opened her bedroom with a resignation worthy of an expiatory victim and Aureliano Segundo saw the most beautiful woman on earth, with her glorious eyes of a frightened animal and her long, copper-colored hair spread out across the pillow. He was so fascinated with that vision that it took him a moment to realize that Fernanda was wearing a white nightgown that reached down to her ankles, with long sleeves and with a large, round buttonhole, delicately trimmed, at the level of her lower stomach. Aureliano Segundo could not suppress an explosion of laughter.","Fernanda carried with her a precious calendar and a bunch of gold-plated keys in which the priest who taught her had marked with ever-fresh ink the days to abstain from entering the room. Excluding Holy Week, Sundays, days required to attend mass, the first Fridays of each month, feast days, and menstruation days, which were strictly to be abstained from, her useful calendar only had forty-two free days scattered within the web of still fresh ink crosses. Aureliano Segundo believed that time would break down that barrier and extended the wedding celebration beyond the set time. Exhausted from having to pour out bottles of Brandy and champagne into the trash to keep the house tidy, and at the same time curious to see that the bride and groom did not go to bed at the same time and even slept in separate rooms while fireworks were still going off, music was still playing, and livestock was still being slaughtered, Úrsula recalled her own life experiences and wondered if Fernanda was also wearing a chastity belt that sooner or later would provoke the villagers' malicious comments and be the source of a tragedy. But Fernanda had confessed to the old man that she only had to wait two weeks before being allowed to sleep with her husband for the first time. Indeed, two weeks passed, and she opened her room door with the obligatory concession of a punished victim, and Aureliano Segundo saw the most beautiful woman in the world with eyes blazing with the pride of a frightened animal and locks of copper-colored blonde hair spread over the pillow. He was so delighted by that sight that it took him a moment to realize that Fernanda was wearing a pure white nightgown, covering her ankles and even her knuckles, with a large, round opening at the belly, carefully embroidered around the edges. Aureliano Segundo couldn't hold back a burst of hearty laughter.",22.442,22.16,"Fernanda never went anywhere without her elegant calendar, adorned with gold leaf. The religion teacher had marked the days of sexual abstinence on this calendar with purple ink. Once the holy week, Sundays, fasting days, the first Friday of each month, the three months, sacrifices, and the days hindered by menstruation were excluded, Fernanda's useful days were reduced to forty-two, squeezed between purple marks. Believing that this hostile web of marks would eventually unravel, Aureliano Segundo prolonged the wedding longer than expected. Ursula, tired of constantly throwing away empty bottles of cognac and champagne to make room to walk in the house, was surprised that the newlyweds slept at different times and in different rooms while fireworks were set off, music played, and lambs were roasted; she wondered if, like herself, Fernanda wore a chastity belt that would eventually become a subject of ridicule in the town and cause a disaster at home. Fortunately, Fernanda opened up to him and said that she was waiting for two weeks to pass before letting her husband come near her. Indeed, at the end of that period, she opened the bedroom door with a reluctance befitting those sacrificed to death. Aureliano Segundo saw the most beautiful woman in the world, with eyes like a frightened animal and long copper-red hair spread out on the pillow. This sight so overwhelmed him that he only later noticed Fernanda was wearing a long-sleeved white nightgown with gold-embroidered edges and a large, round hole just below her navel, reaching down to her ankles. Aureliano Segundo couldn't hold back and burst into uncontrollable laughter.",18.472,18.092,"Fernanda carried a beautiful calendar with little golden keys in which her spiritual director had marked the dates of venereal abstinence with purple ink.

504,"From that time on they did not speak to each other again. When circumstances demanded it they would send notes. In spite of the visible hostility of the family, Fernanda did not give up her drive to impose the customs of her ancestors. She put an end to the custom of eating in the kitchen and whenever anyone was hungry, and she imposed the obligation of doing it at regular hours at the large table in the dining room, covered with a linen cloth and with silver candlesticks and table service. The solemnity of an act which Úrsula had considered the most simple one of daily life created a tense atmosphere against which the silent José Arcadio Segundo rebelled before anyone else. But the custom was imposed, the same as that of reciting the rosary before dinner, and it drew the attention of the neighbors, who soon spread the rumor that the Buendías did not sit down to the table like other mortals but had changed the act of eating into a kind of high mass. Even Úrsula’s superstitions, with origins that came more from an inspiration of the moment than from tradition, came into conflict with those of Fernanda, who had inherited them from her parents and kept them defined and catalogued for every occasion. As long as Úrsula had full use of her faculties some of the old customs survived and the life of the family kept some quality of her impulsiveness, but when she lost her sight and the weight of her years relegated her to a corner, the circle of rigidity begun by Fernanda from the moment she arrived finally closed completely and no one but she determined the destiny of the family. The business in pastries and small candy animals that Santa Sofía de la Piedad had kept up because of Úrsula’s wishes was considered an unworthy activity by Fernanda and she lost no time in putting a stop to it. The doors of the house, wide open from dawn until bedtime, were closed during siesta time under the pretext that the sun heated up the bedrooms and in the end they were closed for good. The aloe branch and loaf of bread that had been hanging over the door since the days of the founding were replaced by a niche with the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Colonel Aureliano, Buendía became aware somehow of those changes and foresaw their consequences. “We’re becoming people of quality,” he protested. “At this rate we’ll end up fighting against the Conservative regime again, but this time to install a king in its place.” Fernanda very tactfully tried not to cross his path. Within herself she was bothered by his independent spirit his resistance to all kinds of social rigidity. She was exasperated by his mugs of coffee at five in the morning, the disorder of his workshop, his frayed blanket, and his custom of sitting in the street door at dusk. But she had to tolerate that one loose piece in the family machinery because she was sure that the old colonel was an animal who had been tamed by the years and by disappointment and who, in a burst of senile rebellion, was quite capable of uprooting the foundations of the house. When her husband decided to give their first son the name of his great-grandfather, she did not dare oppose him because she had been there only a year. But when the first daughter was bom she expressed her unreserved determination to name her Renata after her mother. Úrsula had decided to call her Remedios. After a tense argument, in which Aureliano Segundo acted as the laughing go-between, they baptized her with the name Renata Remedios, but Fernanda went on calling her just Renata while her husband’s family and everyone in town called her Meme, a diminutive of Remedios.","Since that day, the two people did not speak to each other. When they were forced to talk to each other, they would send messages through others or speak indirectly. Ignoring the discomfort of the household, Fernanda did not give up her intention to impose habits on her superiors. She decided to abandon the practice of eating in the kitchen whenever one was hungry, as was done before, and required everyone to eat at the designated time in the dining room, sitting at a large, neatly arranged table with napkins, chandeliers, and silverware. The solemnity of what Ursula considered the simplest daily activity created a tense atmosphere, causing José Arcadio Segundo, who was already sullen, to be the first to oppose it. But the habits were still established, such as the custom of praying the Rosary before dinner, which caught the neighbors' attention and led to rumors that the Buendía family did not sit down to eat like other families but instead turned dinner into a solemn mass. Even Ursula's religious beliefs, which arose more from momentary hope than tradition, began to conflict with the doctrines Fernanda had inherited from her parents. While Ursula was still strong and capable, some old customs were maintained, and family life followed her subtle perceptions. But when she became blind and the weight of old age confined her to a corner, the reins that Fernanda had initiated since she first came to the house completely tightened, and no one but her decided the family's fate. The candy-making trade that Santa Sofía de la Piedad maintained according to Ursula's wishes was deemed lowly by Fernanda and was soon discontinued. The house, which had been open from early morning until bedtime, was closed during the afternoon nap with the excuse of keeping the bedrooms cool and then remained shut all day. The aloe branch and cake that had been hung at the door since the founding of Macondo were replaced by a niche for a statue of Jesus. Colonel Aureliano Buendía also noticed these changes and understood their reasons. ""We are returning to being aristocrats,"" he protested, ""At this rate, we will once again have to fight against the monarchy, but this time to put another king on the throne."" Fernanda, being very delicate, restrained herself to avoid clashing with him. His free spirit and resistance to rigid social rituals made her very uncomfortable. The unsweetened coffee at five in the morning, the clutter in the workshop, the frayed coat, and the habit of sitting at the door looking out at dusk were all like painful thorns in her eyes. But Fernanda had to yield to him, treating him as an external part of the family machinery because she understood very clearly that this old colonel, tamed by age and disappointment, could, with a single powerful act of rebellion, shake the very foundations of the house. When her husband decided to name their first son after his grandfather, she did not dare to object, as she had only been married for a year. But when their first daughter was born, she insisted on naming her Renata, after her mother. Ursula decided to name her Remedios. After a heated debate in which Aureliano Segundo played the role of a cheerful sage, they named her Renata Remedios, but Fernanda continued to call her Renata mockingly, while the whole family and the villagers called her Meme, a nickname for Remedios.",22.132,21.987,"After that day, they never spoke to each other again. If a very urgent situation arose, they still wouldn't speak; instead, they would send their messages to each other in writing. Despite the family's clear stance against her, Fernanda did not give up on her efforts to force the ancestral customs into the household's order. She ended the habit of eating in the kitchen and everyone snacking whenever they were hungry, making it mandatory to set the table in the dining room at specific times with linen cloths, silver candlesticks, and silver cutlery. Turning the matter of meals, which was the simplest daily event for Ursula, into such a pompous issue created a tension that first and foremost incited the usually calm and gentle Jose Arcadio Segundo to rebellion. But meals started to be eaten at the table set in the dining room. It would have been better if it had stopped there. Fernanda also made it a condition that everyone pray before sitting at the table. Neighbors started gossiping that the Buendias did not eat like other people but turned the act of eating into a religious ceremony. Even Ursula's superstitions, which were not based on a deep-rooted tradition but on momentary whims, began to clash with Fernanda's. Fernanda continued the superstitions she inherited from her family, becoming fixated on a unique and specific belief for every event. As long as Ursula was able-bodied, the family's old habits continued to some extent, and Ursula managed some things as she saw fit. However, when Ursula's eyesight failed and she became very old, she was pushed aside, and the strict circle that began the moment Fernanda stepped into the house was completed, making Fernanda the sole authority over the family's fate. At Ursula's request, Fernanda scoffed at the cake and confectionery business that Santa Sofia de la Piedad was running, saying it was insignificant and not worth the effort, and ordered it to be stopped without delay. The doors, which were open from sunrise until bedtime, began to be closed during siesta hours on the pretext that the heat was entering the bedrooms, and over time, they were never opened again. The branch of agarwood and the loaf of bread that had been hanging above the door since the town was founded were taken down, and in their place, a pouch containing a piece of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was hung. Colonel Aureliano Buendia noticed these changes and sensed what consequences they might bring. ""We are starting to become noble people,"" he said. ""At this rate, we might end up overthrowing the Conservatives again and fighting to crown a king over us,"" he added. Fernanda was careful not to clash with Colonel Aureliano Buendia. However, deep down, she was disturbed by his independent personality and his opposition to all social norms. The colonel's habit of drinking coffee at five in the morning, the disorderliness of his workshop, the worn-out Fernanda was irritated by her blanket and sitting on a stool by the street door in the late afternoons. But no matter how irritated she got, she knew that she shouldn't tighten this loose cog in the family mechanism. Because he understood that the colonel, tamed by old age and disappointment, was a wild animal and sensed that when he got angry, he could shake the house to its foundations. When her husband tried to name their first child after his great-grandfather, Fernanda couldn't muster the courage to oppose him, as it had only been a year since she had come into the house as a bride. But when their daughter was born, she insisted on naming the child Renata, after her own mother. However, Ursula had planned to name the girl Remedios. After a heated argument in which Aureliano mediated with laughter, they baptized the child as Renata Remedios. Fernanda calls her daughter Renata, but her husband's family and the entire town call her Meme, which is short for Remedios.",14.105,13.922,"Since that day, they never spoke to each other again. When circumstances forced them to, they sent messages or spoke indirectly. Despite the visible hostility of the family, Fernanda did not give up her will to impose the habits of her elders. She ended the custom of eating in the kitchen whenever one was hungry and imposed the obligation to eat at exact times at the large dining table, set with linen tablecloths, candlesticks, and silverware. The solemnity of an act that Úrsula had always considered the simplest of daily life created an atmosphere of stiffness against which the quiet José Arcadio Segundo was the first to rebel. But the custom prevailed, as did the practice of praying the rosary before dinner, and it drew so much attention from the neighbors that soon the rumor spread that the Buendía family did not sit at the table like other mortals but had turned the act of eating into a high mass. Even Úrsula's superstitions, which arose more from momentary inspiration than tradition, clashed with those Fernanda inherited from her parents, which were perfectly defined and cataloged for every occasion. While Úrsula enjoyed full control of her faculties, some of the old habits persisted, and the family's life retained a certain influence from her hunches. But when she lost her sight and the weight of the years relegated her to a corner, the circle of rigidity initiated by Fernanda from the moment she arrived completely closed, and no one but her determined the family's fate. The pastry and candy animal business that Santa Sofía de la Piedad maintained by Úrsula's will was considered by Fernanda an unworthy activity, and she soon liquidated it. The doors of the house, open wide from dawn until bedtime, were closed during the siesta, under the pretext that the sun overheated the bedrooms, and eventually, they were closed forever. The aloe branch and the bread that had hung on the lintel since the founding days were replaced by a niche of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Colonel Aureliano Buendía noticed these changes and foresaw their consequences. ""We are becoming fine folks,"" he protested. ""At this rate, we will end up fighting against the conservative regime again, but this time to put a king in its place. "" With very good tact, Fernanda took care not to clash with him. His independent spirit, his resistance to all forms of social rigidity, bothered her deeply. His bowls of coffee at five, the disorder of his workshop, his frayed blanket, and his habit of sitting at the street door at dusk exasperated her. But she had to tolerate this loose piece of the family mechanism because she was certain that the old colonel was a beast pacified by years and disappointment, who in a fit of senile rebellion could uproot the foundations of the house. When her husband decided to name their first son after his great-grandfather, she did not dare oppose it because she had only been there for a year. But when the first daughter was born, she expressed without reservation her determination that she be named Renata, like her mother. Úrsula had resolved that she be named Remedios. After a tense controversy, in which Aureliano Segundo acted as an amused mediator, they baptized her with the name Renata Remedios, but Fernanda continued to call her Renata for short, while her husband's family and the whole town continued to call her Meme, a diminutive of Remedios.",39.774,39.681
505,"At first Fernanda did not talk about her family, but in time she began to idealize her father. She spoke of him at the table as an exceptional being who had renounced all forms of vanity and was on his way to becoming a saint. Aureliano Segundo, startled at that unbridled glorification of his father-in-law, could not resist the temptation to make small jokes behind his wife’s back. The rest of the family followed his example. Even Úrsula, who was extremely careful to preserve family harmony and who suffered in secret from the domestic friction, once allowed herself the liberty of saying that her little great-great-grandson had his pontifical future assured because he was “the grandson of a saint and the son of a queen and a rustler.” In spite of that conspiracy of smiles, the children became accustomed to think of their grandfather as a legendary being who wrote them pious verses in his letters and every Christmas sent them a box of gifts that barely fitted through the outside door. Actually they were the last remains of his lordly inheritance. They used them to build an altar of life-size saints in the children’s bedroom, saints with glass eyes that gave them a disquietingly lifelike look, whose artistically embroidered clothing was better than that worn by any inhabitant of Macondo. Little by little the funereal splendor of the ancient and icy mansion was being transformed into the splendor of the House of Buendía. “They’ve already sent us the whole family cemetery,” Aureliano Segundo commented one day. “All we need now are the weeping willows and the tombstones.” Although nothing ever arrived in the boxes that the children could play with, they would spend all year waiting for December because, after all, the antique and always unpredictable gifts were something, new in the house. On the tenth Christmas, when little José Arcadio was getting ready to go to the seminary, the enormous box from their grandfather arrived earlier than usual, nailed tight and protected with pitch, and addressed in the usual Gothic letters to the Very Distinguished Lady Doña Fernanda del Carpio de Buendía. While she read the letter in her room the children hastened to open the box. Aided as was customary by Aureliano Segundo, they broke the seals, opened the cover, took out the protective sawdust, and found inside a long lead chest closed by copper bolts. Aureliano Segundo took out the eight bolts as the children watched impatiently, and he barely had time to give a cry and push the children aside when be raised the lead cover and saw Don Fernando, dressed in black and with a crucifix on his chest, his skin broken out in pestilential sores and cooking slowly in a frothy stew with bubbles like live pearls.","At first, Fernanda did not talk about her family, but gradually she began to idealize her father. Right at the dining table, she praised him as a special person who had renounced all empty rituals and had become a living saint. Aureliano Segundo, surprised by the untimely praise of his father-in-law, couldn't help but mock lightly behind his wife's back. The whole family followed his example. Even Úrsula, who was extremely proud of her harmonious family and quietly endured the household's discord, once said that her little great-grandson would surely become a Cardinal. A Cardinal because he was ""the grandson of a saint, the son of a queen, and a cattle thief. "" Despite that mocking smile, the children were used to thinking of their grandfather as a legendary figure who often sent them affectionate poems in letters and a huge box of gifts every Christmas that almost couldn't fit through the main door. In fact, these were the last trinkets left from the old noble estate. Right in the children's bedroom, with these items, an altar was set up with life-sized statues of saints whose glass eyes made a deep impression on them as if they were real; and the beautifully embroidered clothes of the saints were, in their eyes, the finest garments no one in Macondo had ever worn. Gradually, the dull splendor of that old and cold house was transferred to the bright house of the Buendía family. ""Now, they have sent us a family cemetery,"" Aureliano Segundo once commented, ""all that's missing are the weeping willows and the tombstones. "" Although these boxes never contained toys for the children, they still eagerly awaited the end of the year for December to come, because regardless, those ancient and always unexpected items were still a novelty in the house. On the tenth Christmas since Fernanda came to her husband's house, when young José Arcadio was preparing for his exams, a huge wooden chest from her grandfather, carefully nailed and varnished, was sent to Mrs. Fernanda del Carpio de Buendía, with a very respectful note written in familiar Gothic script, arriving much earlier than usual. While she was in her room reading the letter, the children impatiently opened the chest. As usual, with the help of Aureliano Segundo, they pried off the sealed wax, opened the lid of the chest, removed all the sawdust inside, and found another lead chest inside, securely fastened with brass screws. In front of the eager children, Aureliano Segundo unscrewed the eight brass screws, and when he opened the lid, he almost didn't have time to shout and push the children aside, because he saw Uncle Fernando dressed in black, with a cross on his chest, his skin cracked open with festering sores emitting a foul odor, and this corpse had been preserved in a broth of pearl-bearing oysters simmering over a low fire.",21.367,21.177,"At first, Fernanda never spoke about her family, but over time, she couldn't stop praising her father. When they sat down at the table, she would start talking about her father, describing in great detail how he was free from arrogance and grandeur, almost to the point of reverence. Aureliano Segundo, surprised by the unreserved glorification of his father-in-law, couldn't help but start teasing his wife jokingly behind her back. The other members of the family did not delay in following him on this matter. Even Ursula, who took great care to maintain the family's peace and was afraid of causing unrest at home, once couldn't help but say to her great-great-grandchild, -Your grandfather is a saint, your mother is a queen, as long as your father's pot is full, you will never fall, you could even become the Pope. Despite everyone except their mother smiling under their breath, the children began to see their grandfather as a legendary figure who wrote religious poems to them in his letters and sent gift boxes so large they barely fit through the front door every Christmas. These were actually the last remnants of their grandfather's inheritance. With the gifts that arrived, they set up a shrine in the children's room adorned with life-sized statues of saints. The embroidered garments on the backs of these saint statues with glass eyes, which looked almost alive, were many times more beautiful than what the people of Macondo wore throughout their lives. The dead splendor of the old and cold mansion slowly began to move into the Buendía's house. One day Aureliano Segundo couldn't stand it anymore and said, ""They sent the family cemetery here."" ""Now all that's missing are the tombstones and weeping willows."" Although there was never anything like toys in the boxes that arrived, the children would still eagerly await December all year long. Because these antique and unexpected gifts brought novelty to the house. On the tenth Christmas when little Jose Arcadio was about to be sent to theology school, the gift chest sent by his grandparents arrived earlier than usual. The chest was tightly nailed, wrapped with a steel strip, and inscribed with 'To the Esteemed Dona Fernanda del Carpio de Buendia' in the usual Gothic letters. When Fernanda withdrew to her room to read the letter that came with the chest, the children rushed to open it. As always, with the help of Aureliano Segundo, they broke the seals, opened the lid, emptied the sawdust, and found another long chest inside, clamped with copper bolts and made of lead. While the children waited impatiently, Aureliano Segundo unscrewed the eight bolts; upon opening the lid and seeing Don Fernando, he screamed and pushed the children aside. Don Fernando lay there, dressed in black, with a cross placed on his chest. His entire body was covered with plague sores and marks from being scalded in boiling water.",15.789,15.555,"In the beginning, Fernanda did not talk about her family, but over time she began to idealize her father. She spoke of him at the table as an exceptional being who had renounced all forms of vanity and was becoming a saint. Aureliano Segundo, astonished by the sudden magnification of his father-in-law, could not resist the temptation to make small jokes behind his wife's back. The rest of the family followed his example. Even Úrsula, who was extremely jealous of family harmony and secretly suffered from domestic friction, allowed herself to say once that the little great-great-grandson had his pontifical future assured because he was ""the grandson of a saint and the son of a queen and a rustler."" Despite that smiling conspiracy, the children got used to thinking of their grandfather as a legendary being who transcribed pious verses in letters to them and sent a crate of gifts every Christmas that barely fit through the street door. They were, in reality, the last remnants of the noble patrimony. With them, an altar was built in the children's bedroom with life-sized saints, whose glass eyes gave them a disturbing appearance of life and whose artistically embroidered cloth garments were better than those ever worn by any inhabitant of Macondo. Little by little, the funeral splendor of the old and cold mansion was transferred to the bright Buendía house. ""They've already sent us the whole family cemetery,"" Aureliano Segundo commented on one occasion. ""Only the willows and the tombstones are missing."" Although nothing ever arrived in the crates that the children could use to play with, they spent the year waiting for December because, after all, the old-fashioned and always unpredictable gifts were a novelty in the house. On the tenth Christmas, when little José Arcadio was already preparing to travel to the seminary, the enormous crate from the grandfather arrived earlier than in previous years, very well nailed and waterproofed with tar, and addressed with the usual label in Gothic characters to the very distinguished lady Mrs. Fernanda del Carpio de Buendía. While she read the letter in the bedroom, the children hurried to open the box. Helped as usual by Aureliano Segundo, they scraped off the tar seals, un-nailed the lid, removed the protective sawdust, and found inside a long lead coffin closed with copper bolts. Aureliano Segundo removed the eight bolts, to the children's impatience, and barely had time to let out a scream and push them aside when he lifted the lead platform and saw Don Fernando dressed in black with a crucifix on his chest, his skin bursting with pestilent belches and cooking slowly in a frothy and bubbling broth of live pearls.",48.11,48.004
506,"A short time after the birth of their daughter, the unexpected jubilee for Colonel Aureliano, Buendía, ordered by the government to celebrate another anniversary of the Treaty of Neerlandia, was announced. It was a decision so out of line with official policy that the colonel spoke out violently against it and rejected the homage. “It’s the first time I’ve ever heard of the word ‘jubilee,’ ” he said. “But whatever it means, it has to be a trick.” The small goldsmith shop was filled with emissaries. Much older and more solemn, the lawyers in dark suits who in other days had flapped about the colonel like crows had returned. When he saw them appear the same as the other time, when they came to put a stop to the war, he could not bear the cynicism of their praise. He ordered them to leave him in peace, insisting that he was not a hero of the nation as they said but an artisan without memories whose only dream was to die of fatigue in the oblivion and misery of his little gold fishes. What made him most indignant was the word that the president of the republic himself planned to be present at the ceremonies in Macondo in order to decorate him with the Order of Merit. Colonel Aureliano, Buendía had him told, word for word, that he was eagerly awaiting that tardy but deserved occasion in order to take a shot at him, not as payment for the arbitrary acts and anachronisms of his regime, but for his lack of respect for an old man who had not done anyone any harm. Such was the vehemence with which he made the threat that the president of the republic canceled his trip at the last moment and sent the decoration with a personal representative. Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, besieged by pressures of all kinds, left his bed of a paralytic in order to persuade his former companion in arms. When the latter saw the rocking chair carried by four men appear and saw the friend who had shared his victories and defeats since youth sitting in it among some large pillows, he did not have a single doubt but that he was making that effort in order to express his solidarity. But when he discovered the real motive for his visit he had them take him out of the workshop.","Shortly after the birth of the baby girl, the much-unanticipated celebration of Colonel Aureliano Buendía's longevity was publicly announced. The government ordered it to be organized to commemorate the signing of the Treaty of Neclandia. It was a decision so contrary to the orthodox political line that the colonel vehemently declared his opposition and refused the celebration. ""This is the first time I've heard of a longevity celebration,"" he said, ""But whatever it means, it can only be a blasphemy."" The jewelry workshop, already cramped, was now crowded with emissaries. The lawyers dressed in dark clothes, who previously hovered around the colonel like crows, returned now looking much older and more solemn. Seeing them appear as they had before to prevent the war, he could not stand their overly blatant flattery. He ordered them to leave him alone, refusing to acknowledge himself as a national figure, as they said, but merely as an ordinary craftsman with the sole desire to die of exhaustion in oblivion and poverty, making his little gold fishes. What infuriated him the most was the news that the President of the Republic himself intended to personally participate in the public activities in Macondo to award the Medal of Merit to the colonel. Colonel Aureliano Buendía had asked to convey to the President, word for word, that he sincerely longed for this belated but precious opportunity to shoot the President, not to make him atone for the injustices and untimeliness of the regime, but to make him atone for the insolence he dared to show towards an old man who had harmed no one. That was the stern warning the colonel had spoken aloud, causing the President of the Republic to postpone his trip at the last moment and, to make the celebration more grandiose, he sent a special envoy in his place. Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, completely bedridden, left his paralyzed bed to comfort his old comrade-in-arms. When he saw a rocking chair being carried by four men, and saw his friend who had shared with him all the glories and humiliations since their youth sitting on it among the pillows, Colonel Aureliano Buendía immediately realized that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez had made an effort to come and show his solidarity. But when he learned the true intention of this visit, he ordered his old friend to be expelled from the gold workshop.",23.818,23.598,"Shortly after the birth of Fernanda and Aureliano Segundo's daughters, on an anniversary of the Neerlandia Agreement, the government announced that a jubilee would be held for Colonel Aureliano Buendia. It was such an incompatible decision with state policy that the colonel objected and said he would not accept this show of respect. -I am hearing the word ""jubilee"" for the first time in my life. Whatever its meaning, there must be something fishy about it, he said. One envoy after another was coming and going to the silver workshop. In the old days, the lawyers in black clothes who used to circle around the colonel like crows came this time older and more distinguished. When the colonel saw them, just as when they had come last time to end the war, he couldn't stand their endless praises. He told them to leave him alone, that he was not a national hero as they said, that he was an artist who had lost his memories and wanted nothing more than to spend his life and die among his goldfish. When he heard that the President himself was planning to attend the ceremony in Macondo to award him a medal of merit, he fumed with anger. He said he was eagerly awaiting this belated but long-deserved opportunity to shoot the President, and that he would kill the President not for the regime's arbitrary actions or historical mistakes, but because he did not respect an old man who had never harmed him, and he asked the envoys to convey his words exactly to the President. His anger was so terrifying that the President canceled his trip at the last moment and sent the medal with a special envoy. Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, who was under all kinds of pressure from every side, got out of bed despite his paralyzed state and tried to deceive his old comrade. When Colonel Aureliano Buendia saw the swing chair carried by four people and his old friend, who had shared his victories and defeats since their youth, sitting propped up on pillows, he had no doubt that Gerineldo made this effort to prove their solidarity. But when he realized the true purpose of Gerineldo's visit, he had him thrown out of the workshop.",19.451,19.196,"Shortly after the birth of the girl, the unexpected jubilee of Colonel Aureliano Buendía was announced, ordered by the government to celebrate a new anniversary of the Treaty of Neerlandia. It was a decision so inconsistent with official policy that the colonel vehemently opposed it and rejected the tribute. ""It is the first time I hear the word jubilee,"" he said. ""But whatever it means, it can only be a mockery."" The narrow goldsmith's workshop filled with emissaries. The lawyers in dark suits, who once fluttered around the colonel like crows, returned, much older and much more solemn. When he saw them appear, just as they had come to bog down the war in the past, he could not bear the cynicism of their panegyrics.

508,"So the jubilee was celebrated without the attendance of any members of the family. Chance had it that it also coincided with carnival week, but no one could get the stubborn idea out of Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s head that the coincidence had been foreseen by the government in order to heighten the cruelty of the mockery. From his lonely workshop he could hear the martial music, the artillery salutes, the tolling of the Te Deum, and a few phrases of the speeches delivered in front of the house as they named the street after him. His eyes grew moist with indignation, with angry impotence, and for the first time since his defeat it pained him not to have the strength of youth so that he could begin a bloody war that would wipe out the last vestiges of the Conservative regime. The echoes of the homage had not died down when Úrsula knocked at the workshop door.","Thus, the grand celebration of the colonel's birthday proceeded without the participation of any member of the Buendía family. This celebration coincidentally overlapped with the Carnival masquerade week, but no one could dissuade Colonel Aureliano Buendía from the persistent thought that this coincidence had been premeditated by the government to make the blasphemy even more egregious. From the silent jewelry workshop, he heard the majestic marches, the twenty-one gun salutes, the hymns of thanksgiving ringing out, and a few lines from the speech delivered in front of his house when they named a street after him. When his eyes welled up with tears, tears of humiliation, tears of anger, and for the first time since his defeat, he felt the agony of no longer having the indomitable spirit and the mountain-moving strength of his youth to launch a bloody battle to eradicate the monarchy. Amidst the lingering joyous noises of the festival, Úrsula knocked on the door of the jewelry workshop.",18.83,18.207,"Thus, the jubilee was celebrated without any family members attending. By coincidence, the event coincided with carnival week. But it was impossible to convince Colonel Aureliano Buendia that this was a coincidence. He kept saying that the government had deliberately created the coincidence to mock him. He shut himself in his workshop. He could hear the salute shots in his honor, the playing of the national anthem, and the speeches made in front of the house when the street they lived on was named after him, all from his workshop. He was on the verge of crying out of anger, frustrated by his helplessness, and for the first time since his defeat, he lamented not being young anymore. If he were vigorous, if he had his strength, it would have been nothing to start a bloody war at that moment to sweep away the last remnants of the Conservative regime. As the last speeches of the ceremony still echoed in his ears, Ursula knocked on the door.",19.123,18.552,"Thus, the jubilee took place without the attendance of any of the family members. It was a coincidence that it coincided with carnival week, but no one could dissuade Colonel Aureliano Buendía from his stubborn belief that this coincidence had also been planned by the government to emphasize the cruelty of the mockery. From the solitary workshop, he heard the martial music, the ceremonial artillery, the bells of the Te Deum, and some phrases from the speeches delivered in front of the house when they christened the street with his name. His eyes welled up with indignation, with furious impotence, and for the first time since the defeat, he regretted not having the courage of his youth to start a bloody war that would erase every last vestige of the conservative regime.

""What I have to say has nothing to do with the ceremony.""",20.615,17.798,—Open it —insisted Úrsula in an everyday tone—. This has nothing to do with the party.,28.916,25.449
511,"Then Colonel Aureliano Buendía took down the bar and saw at the door seventeen men of the most varied appearance, of all types and colors, but all with a solitary air that would have been enough to identify them anywhere on earth. They were his sons. Without any previous agreement, without knowing each other, they had arrived from the most distant corners of the coast, captivated by the talk of the jubilee. They all bore with pride the name Aureliano and the last name of their mothers. The three days that they stayed in the house, to the satisfaction of Úrsula and the scandal of Fernanda, were like a state war. Amaranta searched among old papers for the ledger where Úrsula had written down the names and birth and baptism dates of all of them, and beside the space for each one she added his present address. That list could well have served as a recapitulation of twenty years of war. From it the nocturnal itinerary of the colonel from the dawn he left Macondo at the head of twenty-one men on his way to a fanciful rebellion until he returned for the last time wrapped in a blanket stiff with blood could have been reconstructed. Aureliano Segundo did not let the chance go by to regale his cousins with a thunderous champagne and accordion party that was interpreted as a tardy adjustment of accounts with the carnival, which went awry because of the jubilee. They smashed half of the dishes, they destroyed the rose bushes as they chased a bull they were trying to hog-tie, they killed the hens by shooting them, they made Amaranta dance the sad waltzes of Pietro Crespi, they got Remedios the Beauty to put on a pair of men’s pants and climb a greased pole, and in the dining room they turned loose a pig daubed with lard, which prostrated Fernanda, but no one regretted the destruction because the house shook with a healthy earthquake. Colonel Aureliano Buendía who at first received them with mistrust and even doubted the parentage of some, was amused by their wildness, and before they left he gave each one a little gold fish. Even the withdrawn José Arcadio Segundo offered them an afternoon of cockfights, which was at the point of ending in tragedy because several of the Aurelianos were so expert in matters of the cockpit that they spotted Father Antonio Isabel’s tricks at once. Aureliano Segundo, who saw the limitless prospect of wild times offered by those mad relatives, decided that they should all stay and work for him. The only one who accepted was Aureliano Triste, a big mulatto with the drive and explorer’s spirit of his grandfather. He had already tested his fortune in half the world and it did not matter to him where he stayed. The others, even though they were unmarried, considered their destinies established. They were all skillful craftsmen, the men of their houses, peace-loving people. The Ash Wednesday before they went back to scatter out along the coast, Amaranta got them to put on Sunday clothes and accompany her to church. More amused than devout, they let themselves be led to the altar rail where Father Antonio Isabel made the sign of the cross in ashes on them. Back at the house, when the youngest tried to clean his forehead, he discovered that the mark was indelible and so were those of his brothers. They tried soap and water, earth and a scrubbing brush, and lastly a pumice stone and lye, but they could not remove the crosses. On the other hand, Amaranta and the others who had gone to mass took it off without any trouble. “It’s better that way,” Úrsula stated as she said goodbye to them. “From now on everyone will know who you are.” They went off in a troop, preceded by a band of musicians and shooting off fireworks, and they left behind in the town an impression that the Buendía line had enough seed for many centuries. Aureliano Triste, with the cross of ashes on his forehead, set up on the edge of town the ice factory that José Arcadio Buendía had dreamed of in his inventive delirium.","So Colonel Aureliano Buendía unlocked the door and saw in front of him seventeen men who were completely different from each other in stature and skin color, but all of whom bore a loneliness that made it possible for anyone, anywhere in the world, to recognize them as brothers. They were his sons. Without having informed each other, and without knowing each other, they had come from the most remote corners of the bustling coastal region. All of them proudly bore the name Aureliano along with their mother's surname. During the three days they stayed at the colonel's house, to please Úrsula and astonish Fernanda, they sometimes caused brawls. Amaranta searched through old papers to find the notebook in which Úrsula had recorded by hand the names, birth dates, and christening dates of all of them, and she showed each one their current room. That list allowed them to recall twenty years of war. With that list, one could reconstruct the colonel's nocturnal journeys, from the morning he left the village of Macondo leading twenty-one young men to join a quixotic uprising, to the last time he returned, cloaked in a coat stained with dried blood. Aureliano Segundo did not miss the chance to celebrate his uncles with a noisy party featuring champagne and accordions, and the revelry was so lively that it was considered even better than the Carnival ball that had failed because it coincided with the colonel's birthday celebration organized by the government. They broke half the cups and trampled the flower gardens chasing a calf. They shot guns to kill chickens, made Amaranta dance Pietro Crespi's sad waltzes, coaxed Remedios the Beauty into wearing men's pants to climb a greased pole, and then released a greased pig in the hallway, which knocked Fernanda over. But no one complained about these excessive pranks because the house shook like an earthquake with the joy that released the robust vitality of the people. Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who had initially received them with indifference and even suspected that some were not his blood relatives, joined in their exuberant joy and, before they left, gave each one a goldfish. Even José Arcadio Segundo, usually cynical, offered them an afternoon of cockfighting that almost ended in disaster because some of the seventeen Aureliano brothers were experts in cockfighting and immediately recognized the cunning tricks of Father Antonio Isabel. Aureliano Segundo, watching his brothers enthusiastically engage in endless and fascinating games, decided to invite everyone to stay and work with him. The only one who accepted the invitation was Aureliano Triste, a robust young mulatto who had inherited his grandfather's fervor and curiosity, having experienced all sorts of hardships everywhere, and thus believed that living anywhere was the same. The others, although still unmarried, had already determined their own destinies. All were skilled craftsmen, pillars of their families, and good-natured people. On Ash Wednesday, before each went their separate ways along the coast, Amaranta insisted they wear their Sunday best and take her to church. More amused than devout, they allowed themselves to be drawn into the ceremony of confirmation. It was here that Father Antonio Isabel marked a cross of ashes on each of their foreheads. Back home, the youngest, wanting to wipe his forehead, discovered that the ash mark could not be washed off, and soon after, he realized that his brothers' ash marks were also indelible. They tried soap and water, then dirt and scrubbing paste, then pumice stone and lye, but nothing could erase the cross on their foreheads. In contrast, Amaranta and the others who attended mass easily wiped off their crosses. ""It's better that they leave like this,"" Úrsula said, ""From now on, no one can mistake them. "" They left noisily amid fireworks and music, leaving the impression that the Buendía family had sown its seed everywhere for eternity. Aureliano Triste, with the gray ash cross on his forehead, established an ice factory on the outskirts of the village, fulfilling José Arcadio Buendía's long-held dream in his creative fervor.",20.562,20.419,"Colonel Aureliano Buendia unlocked the door. In front of him stood exactly seventeen men, of various structures, types, and races, but all marked by a sadness that would distinguish them anywhere in the world. They were his sons. Unaware of each other, they had risen and come one by one from the farthest places upon hearing that a jubilee would be held. They proudly bore the name Aureliano and their mothers' surnames. They stayed at the house for three days. This made Ursula very happy, but it drove Fernanda up the wall. For three days, the house turned into a battlefield. Amaranta scattered old papers to find the notebook where Ursula had written the children's names, birth, and baptism dates, then added their current addresses to the notebook. This list could be considered a summary of the twenty-year war. The nocturnal expeditions that the colonel undertook from the dawn he left Macondo with twenty-one men to lead a visionary uprising, to the day he returned home for the last time wrapped in a blanket stiffened with dried bloodstains, could be traced from this list. Aureliano Segundo did not miss the opportunity to organize a grand campaign and accordion party for his nephews. Thus, the carnival, which had been lackluster due to the jubilee, was celebrated, albeit belatedly. The Aurelianos broke half of the dishes in the house, destroyed the rose bushes in the garden while claiming to chase a bull, and shot at and killed the chickens with a rifle. They made Amaranta dance to the melancholic waltzes of Pietro Crespi. They dressed Beautiful Remedios in men's pants and made her climb a greasy pole, and they brought a pig covered in filth and released it in the middle of the dining room. All of this caused Fernanda to fall into a state of distress and take to her bed. But the others did not care about the breaking and spilling, because this exuberance had brought a healthy atmosphere to the house, shaken things up, and enlivened the place. Initially meeting them with distrust, and even suspecting that some of them were not his own, Colonel Aureliano Buendia greatly enjoyed their exuberance and gave each of them an ornamental fish before leaving. Even the introverted Jose Arcadio Segundo organized cockfights in honor of his nephews. However, since a few of the Aurelianos were skilled enough in cockfighting to immediately detect Father Antonio Isabel's tricks, an unpleasant incident was about to erupt. Seeing how much fun he could have with these crazy relatives, Aureliano Segundo wanted all of them to stay there and work with him. Only one person accepted this proposal. Aureliano Triste, a burly mixed-race young man, carried his grandfather's boldness and inquisitive spirit. Up until that day, he had traveled half the world to try his luck; staying there didn't make any difference. The others, although they were single, believed that their fates were predetermined and were preparing for it. They were all skilled craftsmen, good housekeepers, and people who loved to live quietly and peacefully. Before the young men returned to their scattered homes in various parts of the coastal region, on the first Wednesday of the Easter fast, Amaranta gathered them all, dressed them in their bargaining clothes, and took them to church. More for fun than faith, the young men lined up in front of the altar and did not object when Father Antonio Isabel dipped his finger in blessed ash and drew a cross on their foreheads. When they returned home, the youngest tried to wipe his forehead and saw that the cross mark did not come off: neither did his brothers'. They washed with soapy water, but it didn't budge. They rubbed with dirt, it didn't fade. Finally, they applied ash water and scrubbed with pumice stone, yet they still couldn't remove the cross marks. On the other hand, Amaranta and the others who participated in the prayer easily cleaned the marks on their foreheads. As Ursula bid farewell to her grandchildren, she said, ""It's better this way."" ""From now on, everyone will know who you are."" The Aurelianos lined up like a squad amidst the brass band and exploding fireworks and set off, leaving the townspeople with the impression that the Buendía lineage had enough seed to last for centuries. Aureliano Triste, with a cross mark drawn in ash on his forehead, established the ice factory he had dreamed of amidst the creative madness of Jose Arcadio Buendia on the outskirts of the town.",16.977,16.829,"Then Colonel Aureliano Buendía removed the bar, and saw at the door seventeen men of the most varied appearances, of all types and colors, but all with a solitary air that would have been enough to identify them anywhere on earth. They were his sons. Without agreeing beforehand, without knowing each other, they had arrived from the most remote corners of the coast, captivated by the noise of the jubilee. They all proudly bore the name Aureliano, and their mother's surname. During the three days they stayed in the house, to Úrsula's satisfaction and Fernanda's scandal, they caused war-like disturbances. Amaranta searched among old papers for the account book where Úrsula had written down the names and dates of birth and baptism of all, and added the current address next to each corresponding space. That list would have allowed a recapitulation of twenty years of war. With it, the nocturnal itineraries of the colonel could have been reconstructed, from the dawn he left Macondo at the head of twenty-one men towards a chimerical rebellion, until he returned for the last time wrapped in the blood-stiffened blanket. Aureliano Segundo did not miss the opportunity to celebrate with his cousins with a thunderous party of champagne and accordion, which was interpreted as a belated settling of accounts with the carnival spoiled by the jubilee. They shattered half the crockery, destroyed the rose bushes chasing a bull to toss it, shot the chickens, forced Amaranta to dance Pietro Crespi's sad waltzes, got Remedios the Beauty to wear men's pants to climb the greasy pole, and released a lard-smeared pig in the dining room that knocked Fernanda over, but no one regretted the mishaps, because the house shook with an earthquake of good health. Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who initially received them with distrust and even doubted the paternity of some, enjoyed their craziness, and before they left, he gave each one a little gold fish. Even the elusive José Arcadio Segundo offered them an afternoon of cockfights, which almost ended in tragedy, because several of the Aurelianos were so skilled in cockfight dealings that they discovered Father Antonio Isabel's tricks at first glance. Aureliano Segundo, who saw the limitless partying prospects offered by that unruly family, decided that they should all stay and work with him. The only one who accepted was Aureliano Triste, a big mulatto with the impulses and exploratory spirit of his grandfather, who had already tried his luck in half the world, and didn't mind staying anywhere. The others, although still single, considered their fate resolved. They were all skilled artisans, homebodies, people of peace. On Ash Wednesday, before they dispersed again along the coast, Amaranta managed to get them to wear Sunday clothes and accompany her to church. More amused than pious, they let themselves be led to the communion rail, where Father Antonio Isabel placed the ash cross on their foreheads. Back home, when the youngest wanted to clean his forehead, he discovered that the mark was indelible, as were those of his brothers. They tried with water and soap, with dirt and scrubbing brush, and finally with pumice stone and lye, but they couldn't erase the cross. In contrast, Amaranta and the others who went to mass removed it without difficulty."" This way is better,"" Úrsula said goodbye to them. "" From now on, no one will be able to confuse you. ""They left in a rush, preceded by the band and setting off fireworks, leaving the impression in the town that the Buendía lineage had seeds for many centuries. Aureliano Triste, with his ash cross on his forehead, set up the ice factory on the outskirts of town that José Arcadio Buendía had dreamed of in his inventor's deliriums.",43.337,43.265
512,"Some months after his arrival, when he was already well-known and well-liked, Aureliano Triste went about looking for a house so that he could send for his mother and an unmarried sister (who was not the colonel’s daughter), and he became interested in the run-down big house that looked abandoned on a corner of the square. He asked who owned it. Someone told him that it did not belong to anyone, that in former times a solitary widow who fed on earth and whitewash from the walls had lived there, and that in her last years she was seen only twice on the street with a hat of tiny artificial flowers and shoes the color of old silver when she crossed the square to the post office to mail a letter to the Bishop. They told him that her only companion was a pitiless servant woman who killed dogs and cats and any animal that got into the house and threw their corpses into the middle of the street in order to annoy people with the rotten stench. So much time had passed since the sun had mummified the empty skin of the last animal that everybody took it for granted that the lady of the house and the maid had died long before the wars were over, and that if the house was still standing it was because in recent years there had not been a rough winter or destructive wind. The hinges had crumbled with rust, the doors were held up only by clouds of cobwebs, the windows were soldered shut by dampness, and the floor was broken by grass and wildflowers and in the cracks lizards and all manner of vermin had their nests, all of which seemed to confirm the notion that there had not been a human being there for at least half a century. The impulsive Aureliano Triste did not need such proof to proceed. He pushed on the main door with his shoulder and the worm-eaten wooden frame fell down noiselessly amid a dull cataclysm of dust and termite nests. Aureliano Triste stood on the threshold waiting for the dust to clear and then he saw in the center of the room the squalid woman, still dressed in clothing of the past century, with a few yellow threads on her bald head, and with two large eyes, still beautiful, in which the last stars of hope had gone out, and the skin of her face was wrinkled by the aridity of solitude. Shaken by that vision from another world, Aureliano Triste barely noticed that the woman was aiming an antiquated pistol at him.","After staying for a few months, meaning when he had become a familiar person and was respected by everyone, Aureliano Triste went looking for a house to bring his mother and unmarried sister (who was not the daughter of the colonel) to live with him, and he liked the old, seemingly abandoned house on the street near the square. He asked who the owner of that house was. Someone told him that it was an ownerless house, that previously a lonely widow who lived by eating dirt and wall lime had lived in that house, and that in the last years of her life, she was seen only twice going out, wearing a hat adorned with many tiny fake flowers and old silver shoes, as she crossed the square to the post office to send letters to the Bishop. People told him that her only friend was a very cruel maid who often killed dogs, cats, and any animal that dared to come near the house, then threw their bodies in the middle of the main road, causing the whole village to suffocate from the stench of the rotting animal carcasses. Since the time the sun dried the skin of the last animal thrown into the middle of the main road, a very long time had passed, to the extent that the whole village agreed that the mistress and the maid had died long before the war ended, and said that the house was still standing because in recent years there had been no storms or harsh winters, the door hinges were all rusted; the doors were almost standing still thanks to the cobwebs, the windows held together by moisture; the floor cracked due to the overgrown grass and wildflowers, and these cracks were home to lizards and all kinds of disgusting creatures, all of which seemed to collectively suggest that no one had lived in that house for at least half a century. Aureliano Triste, who liked adventure, needed no further evidence. He gently pushed the main door with his shoulder, and the termite-ridden wooden frame suddenly collapsed without a sound in a shower of dust and termite droppings. Aureliano Triste stood still at the doorstep, waiting until the thick cloud of dust had settled, and immediately he saw in the middle of the living room a gaunt woman, still dressed in the fashion of the previous century, with a few tufts of reddish hair still clinging to her bald head, her large eyes, which had just lost their hopeful gleam, still beautiful, and her face wrinkled with bitter loneliness. Still shocked by the sight of a person who belonged to another world, Aureliano Triste had not yet realized that the woman was aiming an old revolver at him.",28.179,28.006,"In a short time, Aureliano Triste, who became well-known and beloved, started looking for a house to bring his mother and his unmarried sister (who was not the colonel's daughter) a few months after his arrival, and he became interested in the large, dilapidated house at the corner of the area. He asked who the owner was. Someone said that it did not have an owner, and that a lonely widow who once ate dirt and plaster in that house used to live there. They said that in her last years, the woman went outside only twice, wearing a hat adorned with artificial flowers and tarnished silver shoes when she went to the post office to send a letter to the bishop. They told that only a stone-hearted maid stayed with her, and that the maid killed cats, dogs, and any animals that entered the house, throwing their carcasses into the middle of the street to disturb passersby with the smell. It had been so long since the last animal's hide dried in the sun that everyone believed the lady of the house and the maid had died years ago, even before the war ended. If the house is still standing, they said, it hasn't collapsed because there haven't been harsh winters or winds in recent years. The hinges were rusted and crooked. The doors were held in place by cobwebs. The windows had swollen from the damp, becoming impossible to open. Weeds and wildflowers had sprung up between the stones in the garden. Between the wooden planks, lizards and all kinds of pests had made their nests. All of this confirmed the belief that no human foot had set foot in the house for at least half a century. For Aureliano Triste, who liked to act on a whim, such evidence was unnecessary to enter the house. He pushed the street door with his shoulder. The door, gnawed away by worms, silently collapsed onto the accumulation of dust and insect nests. Aureliano Triste stood on the threshold, waiting for the dust cloud to settle so he could make out the interior. Then he saw the disheveled woman standing in the middle of the room. She wore a dress from the past century, and had two or three strands of yellow hair on her bald head. Her eyes, which had not yet lost their beauty, were large, as if the last stars of hope had also faded. Her face was wrinkled from the drought of loneliness. Aureliano Triste, who felt as if he had encountered someone from another world, did not even notice that the woman was pointing an old model gun at him in his astonishment.",25.215,25.023,"Months after his arrival, when he was already known and appreciated, Aureliano Triste was looking for a house to bring his mother and an unmarried sister (who was not the colonel's daughter) and became interested in the decrepit mansion that seemed abandoned on a corner of the square. He asked who the owner was. Someone told him it was a house that belonged to no one, where a solitary widow once lived who fed on the earth and lime from the walls, and in her last years was only seen twice on the street with a hat of tiny artificial flowers and shoes the color of old silver, when she crossed the square to the post office to send letters to the bishop. They told him that her only companion was a heartless servant who killed dogs and cats and any animal that entered the house, and threw the corpses in the middle of the street to plague the town with the stench of putrefaction. So much time had passed since the sun mummified the empty skin of the last animal that everyone assumed the owner of the house and the servant had died long before the wars ended, and that if the house was still standing, it was because there hadn't been a harsh winter or a devastating wind in recent years. The hinges crumbled by rust, the doors barely held by accumulations of cobwebs, the windows welded by humidity, and the floor broken by grass and wildflowers, in whose cracks lizards and all kinds of vermin nested, seemed to confirm the version that no human being had been there for at least half a century. The impulsive Aureliano Triste didn't need so much evidence to proceed. He pushed the main door with his shoulder, and the rotten wooden frame collapsed without a crash, in a silent cataclysm of dust and termite nests. Aureliano Triste stood on the threshold, waiting for the fog to clear, and then he saw in the center of the room the scrawny woman still dressed in clothes from the previous century, with a few yellow strands on her bald skull, and with large, still beautiful eyes in which the last stars of hope had faded, and the skin of her face cracked by the dryness of solitude. Shaken by the vision of another world, Aureliano Triste barely noticed that the woman was pointing an old military pistol at him.",49.861,49.755

519,"That night at dinner Aureliano Triste told the family about the episode and Úrsula wept with consternation. “Holy God!” she exclaimed, clutching her head with her hands. “She’s still alive!” Time, wars, the countless everyday disasters had made her forget about Rebeca. The only one who had not lost for a single minute the awareness that she was alive and rotting in her wormhole was the implacable and aging Amaranta. She thought of her at dawn, when the ice of her heart awakened her in her solitary bed, and she thought of her when she soaped her withered breasts and her lean stomach, and when she put on the white stiff-starched petticoats and corsets of old age, and when she changed the black bandage of terrible expiation on her hand. Always, at every moment, asleep and awake, during the most sublime and most abject moments, Amaranta thought about Rebeca, because solitude had made a selection in her memory and had burned the dimming piles of nostalgic waste that life had accumulated in her heart, and had purified, magnified and eternalized the others, the most bitter ones. Remedios the Beauty knew about Rebeca’s existence from her. Every time they passed the run-down house she would tell her about an unpleasant incident, a tale of hate, trying in that way to make her extended rancor be shared by her niece and consequently prolonged beyond death, but her plan did not work because Remedios was immune to any kind of passionate feelings and much less to those of others. Úrsula, on the other hand, who had suffered through a process opposite to Amaranta’s, recalled Rebeca with a memory free of impurities, for the image of the pitiful child brought to the house with the bag containing her parents’ bones prevailed over the offense that had made her unworthy to be connected to the family tree any longer. Aureliano Segundo decided that they would have to bring her to the house and take care of her, but his good intentions were frustrated by the firm intransigence of Rebeca, who had needed many years of suffering and misery in order to attain the privileges of solitude and who was not disposed to renounce them in exchange for an old age disturbed by the false attractions of charity.","That night, during dinner, Aureliano Triste recounted this story to the whole family, and Úrsula burst into tears. ""Oh my God?"", she exclaimed, holding her head in her hands, ""Is he still alive?"". Time, war, and countless everyday misfortunes had caused the old woman to completely forget Rebecca. The only person who was always aware that Rebecca was still alive was the old and stubborn Amaranta. Amaranta thought of Rebecca at dawn when the chill in her heart woke her on her lonely bed, then thought of Rebecca as she soaped her withered breasts and wrinkled belly, as she put on her old-age undergarments, and as she replaced the black bandage on the hand she had plunged into a stove full of glowing coals to punish herself. Amaranta thought of Rebeca at all hours, whether asleep or awake, whether happy or sad, because loneliness had forced her to choose memories, to discard the heaps of sorrowful rubbish of life that had accumulated in her heart, and on the other hand, to purify, elevate, and eternalize other memories, the most bitter memories of her life. Through her, Remedios the Beauty learned of Rebeca's existence. Every time they passed the dilapidated house, she would tell her niece about a boring event or a vulgar fable, and through this form, she tried to make her niece share in her cooled hatred and thus tried to prolong it until death. But she did not achieve her goals, because Remedios the Beauty was completely innocent of all easily moved emotions and moreover indifferent to feelings that were too distant for her. In contrast, Úrsula, who had endured torments different from those of Amaranta, remembered Rebeca with a purer memory, because the image of a poor little girl brought to the house along with the shoes of her deceased parents had overcome the punishment she had inflicted to not recognize her as a member of the family. Aureliano Segundo decided that he needed to bring her back home to take care of her, but his good intentions were thwarted by Rebeca's stubbornness, who had traded many years of suffering and poverty to claim the right to enjoy solitude, and was not willing to give it up for the sake of a joyful old age amidst the artificial pleasures of a daily miserable life.",18.166,17.894,"That evening, at dinner, Aureliano Triste recounted what had happened. Ursula, crying, exclaimed, ""Oh my God!"" Beating her head, she said, ""So, she is still alive!"" The long passage of time, the wars, and daily troubles had made her forget Rebeca. The only person who never forgot that Rebeca was alive and rotting in that bug hole, and who never forgave her, was the old Amaranta. When she woke up alone at dawn, shivering from the coldness in her heart, the first thing Amaranta thought of was Rebeca. While soaping her withered breasts and sagging belly, putting on the corset she wore to straighten her stiffly starched petticoats and bent waist, and changing the black bandage of that terrible penance on her hand, she always thought of Rebeca. Amaranta, whether awake or asleep, whether angry or calm, always thought of Rebeca. Because loneliness had sifted through her memories, burned the longing-filled debris accumulated in the heart of life, leaving behind only the most painful memories, purifying, enlarging, and eternalizing them. Beautiful Remedios had learned of Rebeca's existence from Amaranta. Every time they passed by the old house, Amaranta would tell an unpleasant story, a tale steeped in hatred, thus trying to instill in her niece the hatred that persisted in her own heart, hoping it would continue even after her own death. However, this plan did not work, because Remedios was devoid of any passion, and it was unthinkable for her to share the obsessions of others. Ursula, who had woven a pain in her heart opposite to Amaranta's, kept Rebeca alive in untainted memories. Because the image of the pitiable child brought home with a bag containing the bones of his mother and father outweighed the behavior that led them to erase Rebeca from the family record. Aureliano Segundo decided to bring Rebeca home. She would sit with them and be taken care of as needed. However, Rebeca, who had endured years of pain and deprivation to attain the privilege of solitude, was determined not to trade this privilege for a period of old age disrupted by false displays of kindness.",14.206,13.835,"That night, during dinner, Aureliano Triste recounted the episode to the family, and Úrsula cried in dismay. “Good Lord,” she exclaimed, clutching her head with her hands. “She’s still alive!” Time, wars, and countless daily disasters had made her forget about Rebeca. The only one who had not lost consciousness for a single moment that she was alive, rotting in her soup of larvae, was the relentless and aged Amaranta. She thought of her at dawn, when the ice in her heart woke her in the lonely bed, and she thought of her when she soaped her withered breasts and emaciated belly, and when she put on the white petticoats and lace bodices of old age, and when she changed the black band of terrible atonement from one hand to the other. Always, at all hours, asleep and awake, in the most sublime moments and in the most abject ones, Amaranta thought of Rebeca, because solitude had selected her memories, and had incinerated the obstructive piles of nostalgic garbage that life had accumulated in her heart, and had purified, magnified, and eternalized the others, the most bitter ones. Because of her, Remedios the Beauty knew of Rebeca’s existence. Every time they passed by the decrepit house, she recounted an unpleasant incident, a fable of disgrace, trying in this way to ensure that her exhausting rancor was shared by her niece, and consequently prolonged beyond death, but she did not achieve her goals because Remedios was immune to all kinds of passionate feelings, and much more to those of others. Úrsula, on the other hand, who had undergone a process contrary to Amaranta’s, recalled Rebeca with a memory free of impurities, as the image of the pitiable creature they brought to the house with the sack of her parents' bones prevailed over the offense that made her unworthy of continuing to be linked to the family tree. Aureliano Segundo decided that she had to be brought to the house and protected, but his good intention was thwarted by Rebeca’s unyielding intransigence, who had needed many years of suffering and misery to conquer the privileges of solitude, and was not willing to renounce them in exchange for an old age disturbed by the false charms of mercy.",51.733,51.615
520,"In February, when the sixteen sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía returned, still marked with the cross of ashes, Aureliano Triste spoke to them about Rebeca in the tumult of the celebration and in half a day they restored the appearance of the house, changing doors and windows, painting the front with gay colors, bracing walls and pouring fresh cement on the floor, but they could not get any authorization to continue the work inside. Rebeca did not even come to the door. She let them finish the mad restoration, then calculated what it had cost and sent Argénida, her old servant who was still with her, to them with a handful of coins that had been withdrawn from circulation after the last war and that Rebeca thought were still worth something it was then that they saw to what a fantastic point her separation from the world had arrived and they understood that it would be impossible to rescue her from her stubborn enclosure while she still had a breath of life in her.","In February, when the sixteen sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía returned home and during the lively celebration, Aureliano Triste told them about Rebeca, and in just half a day, they restored the appearance of the house, replaced the doors and windows, whitewashed the front wall, reinforced the other walls, and cemented the floor. They did all the work in the outer house but were not allowed to make any repairs in the inner house. Rebeca did not show her face at the door. She let them finish the noisy renovation work, then calculated the cost and told Argenida, the old maid who still lived with her, to bring them a handful of money, the kind that had been banned from circulation since the last war, but Rebeca stubbornly believed it was still usable. That was when she realized how far her estrangement from real life had gone, and she understood that as long as she had a breath left, it would be difficult to separate herself from the stubborn self-imprisonment in this lonely house.",26.551,26.084,"In February, when Colonel Aureliano Buendia's sixteen sons returned, Aureliano Triste told them about Rebeca. All seventeen of them rolled up their sleeves; they changed the doors and windows, painted the front of the house in vibrant colors, repaired the walls, renewed the broken cement, and in half a day gave the house a new look. But they couldn't get permission from Rebeca to repair the inside of the house. Rebeca didn't even come to the door. She waited for this chaotic repair to be completed, then calculated the expenses and, despite the fact that the currency had been out of circulation since the last war, handed a handful of money she still considered valid to her old servant Argenida and sent her away.

Rebeca did not even peek out the door. She let them finish the hasty restoration, and then calculated the costs and sent them, with Argénida, the old servant who still accompanied her, a handful of coins withdrawn from circulation since the last war, which Rebeca still believed to be useful.

521,"On the second visit by the sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía to Macondo, another of them, Aureliano Centeno, stayed on to work with Aureliano Triste. He was one of the first who had been brought to the house for baptism and Úrsula and Amaranta remembered him very well because in a few hours he had destroyed every breakable object that passed through his hands. Time had moderated his early impulse for growth and he was a man of average height marked by smallpox scars, but his amazing power for manual destruction remained intact. He broke so many plates, even without touching them, that Fernanda decided to buy him a set of pewterware before he did away with the last pieces of her expensive china, and even the resistant metal plates were soon dented and twisted. But to make up for that irremediable power, which was exasperating even for him, he had a cordiality that won the immediate confidence of others and a stupendous capacity for work. In a short time he had increased the production of ice to such a degree that it was too much for the local market and Aureliano Triste had to think about the possibility of expanding the business to other towns in the swamp. It was then that he thought of the decisive step, not only for the modernization of his business but to link the town with the rest of the world.","During the second visit to Macondo by Colonel Aureliano Buendía's sons, one of them stayed to work with Aureliano Triste. His name was Aureliano Segundo. He was one of the first to come to the house to be named. Úrsula and Amaranta recognized him immediately because within a few hours, he had broken countless fragile items just by touching them. Time had reduced the initial growth of his body, and now he was of average stature, covered in smallpox scars, but his ability to break things remained the same. Many dishes were broken, even before he touched them. Fernanda had to quickly buy him a set of alloy dishes so he wouldn't break her expensive porcelain ones. Even these metal dishes were chipped and bent within a few days. But aside from this incurable habit of breaking dishes, he was so sincere that he was immediately loved and trusted by everyone, and he was a very hard worker. In a short time, through his own efforts, he made the ice production exceed the local market demand. As a result, Aureliano Triste considered the possibility of expanding the ice business to other villages in the swamp region. That was when he conceived the decisive turning point that not only meant modernizing his factory but also connecting Macondo with the rest of the world.",21.44,21.032,"When Colonel Aureliano Buendía's sons came to Macondo for the second time, one of them stayed behind. This was Aureliano Centeno, who decided to work with Aureliano Triste. Aureliano Centeno was one of the first to be brought home for baptism, and because he broke almost everything in the house within a few hours of his arrival, Ursula and Amaranta remembered him very well. Although he was a large child, he grew slowly over time and became a medium-sized, pockmarked man. But his destructive power remained unchanged. He would break plates and glasses without even touching them. He broke so many plates that Fernanda finally decided to buy him zinc plates to save the few pieces left of her precious porcelain. Even the zinc plates soon became bent and warped. However, Aureliano Centeno's clumsiness, which even tired himself, was forgiven due to his respectful and courteous behavior that quickly earned the trust of those around him, and his great work ethic. He increased ice production so much in a short time that more goods were produced than the town market could handle. Thereupon, Aureliano Triste thought of expanding the ice trade to other towns across the swamp. It was then that he decided not only to modernize his own business but also to take the step that would connect the town to the rest of the world.",21.682,21.269,"On the second visit that Colonel Aureliano Buendía's sons made to Macondo, another one of them, Aureliano Centeno, stayed to work with Aureliano Triste. He was one of the first who had arrived at the house for the baptism, and Úrsula and Amaranta remembered him very well because he had destroyed in a few hours every fragile object that passed through his hands. Time had moderated his initial growth impulse, and he was a man of medium height marked with smallpox scars, but his astonishing power of manual destruction remained intact. He broke so many plates, even without touching them, that Fernanda opted to buy him a pewter set before he could finish off the last pieces of her expensive china, and even the resistant metal plates were soon chipped and twisted. But in exchange for that irremediable power, exasperating even for himself, he had a cordiality that inspired immediate trust, and an outstanding capacity for work. In a short time, he increased ice production so much that it exceeded the local market, and Aureliano Triste had to consider the possibility of expanding the business to other towns in the swamp. It was then that he conceived the decisive step not only for the modernization of his industry but also to connect the town with the rest of the world.",57.269,57.111

523,"That was the first time that the word had ever been heard in Macondo. Looking at the sketch that Aureliano Triste drew on the table and that was a direct descendent of the plans with which José Arcadio Buendía had illustrated his project for solar warfare, Úrsula confirmed her impression that time was going in a circle. But unlike his forebear, Aureliano Triste did not lose any sleep or appetite nor did he torment anyone with crises of ill humor, but he considered the most harebrained of projects as immediate possibilities, made rational calculations about costs and dates, and brought them off without any intermediate exasperation. If Aureliano Segundo had something of his great-grandfather in him and lacked something of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, it was an absolute indifference to mockery, and he gave the money to bring the railroad with the same lighthearted air with which he had given it for his brother’s absurd navigation project. Aureliano Triste consulted the calendar and left the following Wednesday, planning to return after the rains had passed. There was no more news of him. Aureliano Centeno, overwhelmed by the abundance of the factory, had already begun to experiment with the production of ice with a base of fruit juices instead of water, and without knowing it or thinking about it, he conceived the essential fundamentals for the invention of sherbet. In that way he planned to diversify the production of an enterprise he considered his own, because his brother showed no signs of returning after the rains had passed and a whole summer had gone by with no news of him. At the start of another winter, however, a woman who was washing clothes in the river during the hottest time of the day ran screaming down the main street in an alarming state of commotion.","It was the first time that the word was heard in Macondo. Standing before the drawing made by Aureliano Triste, which was a direct descendant of the diagrams that José Arcadio Buendía had illustrated for the plan to use solar energy in warfare, Úrsula reaffirmed her feeling that time was circling back. But unlike his grandfather, Aureliano Triste did not suffer from insomnia, did not lose his appetite, nor did he have the erratic temper that caused others distress; on the contrary, he envisioned his plans clearly, saw them as direct possibilities, made precise calculations of the costs and construction timelines, and meticulously ensured that no unfortunate gaps were left. Aureliano Segundo, who seemed to have inherited a lack of foresight from his great-grandfather—a trait absent in Colonel Aureliano Buendía—recklessly spent money on building a railway, just as he had previously squandered money on his brother's failed river navigation project. Aureliano Triste checked the calendar and set off the following Wednesday to return after the rainy season. Since his departure, there had been no further news. Aureliano Centeno, after producing an excess of ice, began experimenting with making ice from fruit juice instead of water. Unknowingly and unintentionally, he discovered the basic principle of making ice cream. This led him to consider changing the production methods of a factory he assumed would be his, as his brother had shown no signs of returning after the rainy season and another summer had passed. However, at the beginning of another winter, a washerwoman by the river, during the hottest part of the day, ran across the main road, frantically shouting in a state of complete agitation: - Oh my goodness!",18.239,17.874,"The word ""railroad"" was heard for the first time in Macondo. While Ursula was looking at the plan Aureliano Triste had drawn on the table, she thought that it was the offspring of the plans Jose Arcadio Buendia had made when he waged war in the direction of the sunrise, and her belief that history was nothing but repetition was further reinforced. But Aureliano Triste, unlike his grandfather, neither lost his sleep nor his appetite, nor did he poison anyone's life with nervous breakdowns. He saw the most foolish plans as if they would come to fruition immediately, calculated the costs, estimated the completion date, and endeavored to realize them without bothering anyone. The trait Aureliano Segundo inherited from his great-grandfather, which was completely unlike Colonel Aureliano Buendia, was his indifference to mockery. Just as he had unhesitatingly given money for his brother's absurd waterway project, this time he immediately provided the necessary funds for the laying of the railroad. Aureliano Triste examined the calendar, made calculations, and left to return after the rainy season ended. He was never heard from again. Aureliano Centeno, bewildered by the factory's production power, began to engage in various experiments and started making ice from fruit juice instead of water. Thus, unknowingly and unintentionally, he discovered the main ingredient of sherbet. Since they had not heard from his brother and he himself had not returned even though the rainy season had ended and summer had passed, Aureliano Centeno planned to change the production of this enterprise, which he now considered his own, and to undertake other ventures. But at the beginning of the second winter, a woman washing clothes in the stream at noon suddenly screamed in fear, threw herself onto the main street, and started running while shouting.",10.539,9.841,"It was the first time that word was heard in Macondo.

But unlike his grandfather, Aureliano Triste did not lose sleep or appetite, nor did he torment anyone with fits of bad temper, but rather conceived the most reckless projects as immediate possibilities, made rational calculations about costs and deadlines, and carried them out without intervals of exasperation. Aureliano Segundo, who if he had something of his great-grandfather and lacked something of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, it was an absolute impermeability to learning from mistakes, released the money to bring the railroad with the same frivolity with which he released it for his brother's absurd navigation company.

During the previous weeks they had seen the gangs who were laying ties and tracks and no one paid attention to them because they thought it was some new trick of the gypsies, coming back with whistles and tambourines and their age-old and discredited song and dance about the qualities of some concoction put together by journeyman geniuses of Jerusalem. But when they recovered from the noise of the whistles and the snorting, all the inhabitants ran out into the street and saw Aureliano Triste waving from the locomotive, and in a trance they saw the flower-bedecked train which was arriving for the first time eight months late. The innocent yellow train that was to bring so many ambiguities and certainties, so many pleasant and unpleasant moments, so many changes, calamities, and feelings of nostalgia to Macondo.","At that moment, the entire village shuddered at the sound of a long, resonant whistle and the heavy, hissing breaths of the locomotive. In the previous weeks, the villagers had seen work crews laying sleepers and pulling rails, but no one paid attention because they thought it was merely a new magic trick by the gypsies who had returned with trumpets and tambourines, blowing and banging to advertise the ingenious inventions of the wise men from Jerusalem. But once they recovered from the whistle and the hissing of the locomotive, the entire population of Macondo poured into the streets and saw Aureliano Triste waving to them from the locomotive. They eagerly watched the train adorned with flowers on its windows, arriving in Macondo for the first time after an eight-month delay. The innocent yellow train might bring to Macondo countless uncertainties and clarities, flattery and misfortune, upheavals, suffering, and longing.",18.029,17.319,"At that moment, the town was shaken by a whistle sound that terrified with its echo and a puff resembling a noisy breath. For a few weeks, they had been seeing some workers laying down iron and beams, but with their tambourines and whistles, their old songs and dances describing the inventions of wandering geniuses from Jerusalem, they thought the gypsies had come again and that this was a new trick of theirs, so they paid no attention. But the Macondians, stunned by the whistle sounds, the puffing, and the clattering, rushed out into the street as soon as they collected themselves, and saw Aureliano Triste waving from the locomotive and the first train, adorned with flowers, arriving eight months late. This bright yellow, innocent train brought to Macondo a heap of doubts and certainties, a heap of sweet and bitter events, a heap of changes, disasters, and feelings of longing.",19.362,18.728,"At that moment, the population was shaken by a whistle of dreadful resonances and a colossal wheezing breath.

But when they recovered from the bewilderment of the whistles and snorts, all the inhabitants rushed into the street and saw Aureliano Triste waving from the locomotive, and they watched in awe the train adorned with flowers that for the first time arrived eight months late.

527,"DAZZLED BY SO MANY and such marvelous inventions, the people of Macondo did not know where their amazement began. They stayed up all night looking at the pale electric bulbs fed by the plant that Aureliano Triste had brought back when the train made its second trip, and it took time and effort for them to grow accustomed to its obsessive toom-toom. They be. came indignant over the living images that the prosperous merchant Bruno Crespi projected in the theater with the lion-head ticket windows, for the character who had died and was buried in one film and for whose misfortune tears of affliction had been shed would reappear alive and transformed into an Arab in the next one. The audience, who paid two cents apiece to share the difficulties of the actors, would not tolerate that outlandish fraud and they broke up the seats. The mayor, at the urging of Bruno Crespi, explained in a proclamation that the cinema was a machine of illusions that did not merit the emotional outbursts of the audience. With that discouraging explanation many felt that they had been the victims of some new and showy gypsy business and they decided not to return to the movies, considering that they already had too many troubles of their own to weep over the acted-out misfortunes of imaginary beings. Something similar happened with the cylinder phonographs that the merry matrons from France brought with them as a substitute for the antiquated hand organs and that for a time had serious effects on the livelihood of the band of musicians. At first curiosity increased the clientele on the forbidden street and there was even word of respectable ladies who disguised themselves as workers in order to observe the novelty of the phonograph from first hand, but from so much and such close observation they soon reached the conclusion that it was not an enchanted mill as everyone had thought and as the matrons had said, but a mechanical trick that could not be compared with something so moving, so human, and so full of everyday truth as a band of musicians. It was such a serious disappointment that when phonographs became so popular that there was one in every house they were not considered objects for amusement for adults but as something good for children to take apart. On the other hand, when someone from the town had the opportunity to test the crude reality of the telephone installed in the railroad station, which was thought to be a rudimentary version of the phonograph because of its crank, even the most incredulous were upset. It was as if God had decided to put to the test every capacity for surprise and was keeping the inhabitants of Macondo in a permanent alternation between excitement and disappointment, doubt and revelation, to such an extreme that no one knew for certain where the limits of reality lay. It was an intricate stew of truths and mirages that convulsed the ghost of José Arcadio Buendía under the chestnut tree with impatience and made him wander all through the house even in broad daylight. Ever since the railroad had been officially inaugurated and had begun to arrive with regularity on Wednesdays at eleven o’clock and the primitive wooden station with a desk, a telephone, and a ticket window had been built, on the streets of Macondo men and women were seen who had adopted everyday and normal customs and manners but who really looked like people out of a circus. In a town that had chafed under the tricks of the gypsies there was no future for those ambulatory acrobats of commerce who with equal effrontery offered a whistling kettle and a daily regime that would assure the salvation of the soul on the seventh day; but from those who let themselves be convinced out of fatigue and the ones who were always unwary, they reaped stupendous benefits. Among those theatrical creatures, wearing riding breeches and leggings, a pith helmet and steel-rimmed glasses, with topaz eyes and the skin of a thin rooster, there arrived in Macondo on one of so many Wednesdays the chubby and smiling Mr. Herbert, who ate at the house.","Astonished by so many marvelous inventions, the people of Macondo didn't know where to start their admiration. People stayed up all night watching the electric lights illuminated by the generator that Aureliano Triste brought back after his second train journey, and it took several days for them to get used to its humming sound. People were outraged by the vivid images that the wealthy merchant Bruno Crespi screened at the theater with the ticket booth, because a character who had died and been buried in one film and had someone shed tears of sorrow for him, came back to life and became an Arab in another film. The crowd, having spent two centavos to share the tribulations of the characters, could not tolerate such unprecedented deceit and left. At Bruno Crespi's request, the mayor issued a proclamation explaining that films were a product of imagination and that the public should not be so upset. Despite these explanations, many believed they had fallen victim to a new gypsy trick and decided not to return to the cinema, thinking they already had enough real suffering and did not need to waste their time mourning the fake misfortunes of imaginary characters. The same happened with the phonographs that the prostitutes carried instead of the old-fashioned guitars, which at one time had severely harmed the interests of the bands. Initially, curiosity increased the number of customers in the red-light district, to the point where even noblewomen disguised themselves as commoners to see the novelty of the phonograph firsthand. But the more they observed, the quicker they concluded that it was not some magical trick as they had thought and as the prostitutes claimed, but merely a mechanical device that could not compare to a band, which was moving, human, and full of everyday truths. The disillusionment was so great that when phonographs became common in every household, they were not used as entertainment for adults but were left for children to take apart and play with. In contrast, when people witnessed the real marvel of the telephone placed outside the train station, which also had a crank and looked like a crude phonograph, even the bravest were terrified. It seemed as if God had decided to test every capacity for wonder in humans and keep the people of Macondo in a state of oscillation between joy and sorrow, belief and doubt, to the extent that no one knew exactly where the boundary of reality lay. It was a tangled mix of truth and illusion that made the ghost of José Arcadio Buendía restless under the chestnut tree, forcing him to pace the house even in broad daylight. Since the official inauguration of the railroad and the regular arrival of the train at eleven o'clock every Wednesday morning, and the construction of a crude wooden station with an office containing a desk, a telephone, and a ticket booth, people in Macondo began to walk the streets trying to appear normal, though they looked like circus performers. In a village that was well acquainted with the tricks of the gypsies, the future did not look promising for the smooth-talking medicine men who relied on the sound of a clanging pot and meals that barely saved their souls, but they profited greatly by deceiving the gullible, whether out of weariness or naivety. Among the circus clowns in tight pants, high boots, rubber hats, and iron-rimmed glasses with brown eyes that looked like roosters, there was one who came to Macondo every Wednesday and had lunch at the Buendía house: the short, chubby, always smiling Mr. Herbert.",19.007,18.858,"The people of Macondo, dizzy with countless and incredible inventions, did not know where their astonishment began. They sat up all night, watching the dim light of the electric bulbs powered by the generator that Aureliano Triste brought on his second train trip. It took them quite a long time to get used to the noise of the power plant. The live pictures shown by Bruno Crespi, a merchant who had made his fortune, in the theater with lion's mouth ticket booths, greatly angered the people of Macondo. Because someone who died and was buried in one film, causing the audience to shed tears, would come back to life in the next film and appear this time in the guise of an Arab. The audience, who paid two cents per person for tickets to share in the calamities that befell the actors, were outraged by this deceit and broke the chairs. Under pressure from Bruna Crespi, the mayor issued a statement explaining that cinema was a visual machine that did not require emotional outbursts from the audience. After this discouraging announcement, many people considered themselves victims of a new and flashy gypsy trick and decided that their own troubles were enough for them, deeming it unnecessary to shed tears over the fabricated calamities of imaginary people, and thus boycotted the cinema. A similar incident occurred when the cheerful and coquettish women from France brought gramophones to play instead of the barrel organ, which for a while endangered the livelihood of the band members. At first, everyone was curious about what the gramophone was, and the customers of the sinful street were increasing. It was said that even respectable ladies who wanted to see this new invention with their own eyes, disguised themselves as workers and went there. After long observations and detailed examinations, everyone came to the conclusion that this was not a magical mill as initially thought and as French women claimed, but a mechanical trick that could never be compared to something human, touching, and full of daily realities like a band. The disappointment was so great that even when the gramophone became commonplace and entered every home, no one saw it as a means of entertainment for adults but as a toy that entertained children. But when the undeniable skill of the magneto phone connected to the train station was tested, things changed. Those who saw the crank of the magneto thought it was something like the gramophone. However, after one of the townspeople spoke on the phone for the first time, even those who never believed in such nonsense were astounded. It was as if God was testing all surprising abilities and was playing with the Macondians' emotions, mixing the boundaries of reality with enthusiasm and disappointment, doubt and discovery. The fusion of dream and reality in a single crucible disturbed the ghost of Jose Arcadio Buendia under the chestnut tree, and the ghost began to wander inside the house even at midday. After the railway was officially opened and the train started arriving every Wednesday at eleven o'clock, and a wooden station with a desk, a telephone, and ticket windows was built, men and women who behaved normally but looked as if they had sprung from a circus began to appear on the streets of Macondo. In the town seasoned with the Gypsies' tricks and deceptions, these itinerant trade acrobats couldn't make a long-term living. These peddlers, who tried to sell a daily diet that would bring peace to the soul after seven days with a pressure cooker with the same brazenness, could only extract money from those who were tired of their persuasions and those always ready to be caught off guard. On one of the Wednesdays when the train arrived, Mister Herbert appeared among these clownish-looking men, wearing knee breeches and gaiters, a bowler hat on his head, wire-framed glasses on his eyes, with beady eyes, skinny and saggy cheeks like a rooster's skin, a potbelly, and always showing all thirty-two of his teeth. Mister Herbert had his meal at the Buendias'.",16.548,16.373,"Dazzled by so many and such wonderful inventions, the people of Macondo didn't know where to begin to be amazed.

The audience, who paid two cents to share the vicissitudes of the characters, could not tolerate such an unprecedented mockery and broke the seating. The mayor, at the urging of Don Bruno Crespi, explained through a decree that cinema was a machine of illusion that did not deserve the public's passionate outbursts. Faced with the discouraging explanation, many believed they had been victims of another elaborate gypsy affair, so they chose not to return to the cinema, considering that they already had enough of their own sorrows to cry over the feigned misfortunes of imaginary beings. Something similar happened with the cylinder phonographs brought by the cheerful matrons from France to replace the outdated barrel organs, which for a time deeply affected the interests of the band of musicians. At first, curiosity multiplied the clientele of the forbidden street, and it was even known that respectable ladies disguised themselves as villains to closely observe the novelty of the phonograph, but they observed it so much and so closely that they soon concluded it was not a magical mill, as everyone thought and as the matrons said, but a mechanical trick that could not compare to something as moving, as human, and as full of everyday truth as a band of musicians. It was such a severe disappointment that when phonographs became popular to the point that there was one in every house, they were still not regarded as objects for adult entertainment, but as something good for children to tear apart. In contrast, when someone from the town had the opportunity to verify the harsh reality of the telephone installed at the railway station, which due to the crank was considered a rudimentary version of the phonograph, even the most skeptical were bewildered. It was as if God had decided to test every capacity for amazement, and kept the inhabitants of Macondo in a permanent swing between joy and disappointment, doubt and revelation, to the point that no one could know for certain where the boundaries of reality lay.

He was in the captive-balloon business, which had taken him halfway around the world with excellent profits, but he had not succeeded in taking anyone up in Macondo because they considered that invention backward after having seen and tried the gypsies’ flying carpets. He was leaving, therefore, on the next train. When they brought to the table the tiger-striped bunch of bananas that they were accustomed to hang in the dining room during lunch, he picked the first piece of fruit without great enthusiasm. But he kept on eating as he spoke, tasting, chewing, more with the distraction of a wise man than with the delight of a good eater, and when he finished the first bunch he asked them to bring him another. Then he took a small case with optical instruments out of the toolbox that he always carried with him. With the auspicious attention of a diamond merchant he examined the banana meticulously, dissecting it with a special scalpel, weighing the pieces on a pharmacist’s scale, and calculating its breadth with a gunsmith’s calipers. Then he took a series of instruments out of the chest with which he measured the temperature, the level of humidity in the atmosphere, and the intensity of the light.

Aureliano Segundo happened to meet him while he was still grumbling and cursing in awkward Spanish because he couldn't get a private room at the Jacob Hotel, so he brought the guest home as he often did with many other strangers. He had a business selling helium balloons that he took everywhere, making huge profits, but he couldn't attract customers in Macondo because the people there considered it outdated after having seen and tried the flying carpets of folklore. Therefore, he was going to leave on the next train. When the host had someone bring the first bunch of ripe bananas, which usually hung in the dining room, the guest indifferently broke off one. He ate while talking, nibbling and chewing noisily, more like the mannerisms of an absent-minded scholar than a glutton, and when he finished the first bunch, he asked for another. At that moment, he opened the toolkit he always carried with him and took out a package containing optical instruments. Then, with the caution of a diamond merchant, he meticulously examined the banana, cutting it into pieces with a special knife and weighing them on a precision scale, then measuring the diameter of each piece with a gunsmith's caliper. Next, he took out one instrument after another, one to measure temperature, another to measure humidity, and another to measure light intensity. It was a bizarre ritual, making everyone eat with bated breath, waiting for Mr. Herbert to say something, but he said nothing that revealed his intentions.",18.496,18.132,"No one noticed that Mister Herbert was at the table until the first bunch of bananas in the dining room was finished. Aureliano Segundo had encountered him in front of Hotel Jacob. In his broken Spanish, he was complaining about not finding a place at the hotel. With the hospitality he showed to most strangers who came to town, Aureliano Segundo took him in and brought him home. Mister Herbert was in the hot air balloon business. He had traveled half the world and made a fortune from this business. But since the people of Macondo, who had seen the gypsies' flying carpets, considered it a rather backward invention, no one was willing to pay to ride the balloon. Therefore, Mister Herbert was going to leave on the next train. When the large bunch of bananas, which everyone was used to seeing hanging in the dining room during meals, was brought to the table, Mister Herbert reluctantly reached out and took one banana. But he started eating more and more. He was talking while also absentmindedly, not out of gluttony but with the distraction of a scholar, plucking bananas and popping them into his mouth. When he finished the first banana, he asked for another one. Then he took out some magnifying glasses and mirrors from his toolkit, which he always kept by his side. As careful as a diamond merchant, he examined the banana thoroughly, cut it in half with a special knife, weighed the pieces on a precise scale, and calculated the diameter of the banana using a caliper typically used for adjusting gun calibers. Then, taking out more devices from his bag, he measured the temperature, humidity in the air, and light intensity with them. These things they did were so complicated that everyone had stopped eating and was waiting to see what kind of judgment Mister Herbert would make.

529,"On the days that followed he was seen with a net and a small basket hunting butterflies on the outskirts of town. On Wednesday a group of engineers, agronomists, hydrologists, topographers, and surveyors arrived who for several weeks explored the places where Mr. Herbert had hunted his butterflies. Later on Mr. Jack Brown arrived in an extra coach that had been coupled onto the yellow train and that was silver-plated all over, with seats of episcopal velvet, and a roof of blue glass. Also arriving on the special car, fluttering around Mr. Brown, were the solemn lawyers dressed in black who in different times had followed Colonel Aureliano Buendía everywhere, and that led the people to think that the agronomists, hydrologists, topographers, and surveyors, like Mr. Herbert with his captive balloons and his colored butterflies and Mr. Brown with his mausoleum on wheels and his ferocious German shepherd dogs, had something to do with the war. There was not much time to think about it, however, because the suspicious inhabitants of Macondo barely began to wonder what the devil was going on when the town had already become transformed into an encampment of wooden houses with zinc roofs inhabited by foreigners who arrived on the train from halfway around the world, riding not only on the seats and platforms but even on the roof of the coaches. The gringos, who later on brought their languid wives in muslin dresses and large veiled hats, built a separate town across the railroad tracks with streets lined with palm trees, houses with screened windows, small white tables on the terraces, and fans mounted on the ceilings, and extensive blue lawns with peacocks and quails. The section was surrounded by a metal fence topped with a band of electrified chicken wire which during the cool summer mornings would be black with roasted swallows. No one knew yet what they were after, or whether they were actually nothing but philanthropists, and they had already caused a colossal disturbance, much more than that of the old gypsies, but less transitory and understandable. Endowed with means that had been reserved for Divine Providence in former times, they changed the pattern of the rams, accelerated the cycle of harvest, and moved the river from where it had always been and put it with its white stones and icy currents on the other side of the town, behind the cemetery. It was at that time that they built a fortress of reinforced concrete over the faded tomb of José Arcadio, so that the corpses smell of powder would not contaminate the waters. For the foreigners who arrived without love they converted the street of the loving matrons from France into a more extensive village than it had been, and on one glorious Wednesday they brought in a trainload of strange whores, Babylonish women skilled in age-old methods and in possession of all manner of unguents and devices to stimulate the unaroused, to give courage to the timid, to satiate the voracious, to exalt the modest man, to teach a lesson to repeaters, and to correct solitary people. The Street of the Turks, enriched by well-lit stores with products from abroad, displacing the old bazaars with their bright colors, overflowed on Saturday nights with the crowds of adventurers who bumped into each other among gambling tables, shooting galleries, the alley where the future was guessed and dreams interpreted, and tables of fried food and drinks, and on Sunday mornings there were scattered on the ground bodies that were sometimes those of happy drunkards and more often those of onlookers felled by shots, fists, knives, and bottles during the brawls. It was such a tumultuous and intemperate invasion that during the first days it was impossible to walk through the streets because of the furniture and trunks, and the noise of the carpentry of those who were building their houses in any vacant lot without asking anyone’s permission, and the scandalous behavior of couples who hung their hammocks between the almond trees and made love under the netting in broad daylight and in view of everyone. The only serene corner had been established by peaceful West Indian Negroes, who built a marginal street with wooden houses on piles where they would sit in the doors at dusk singing melancholy hymns in their disordered gabble. So many changes took place in such a short time that eight months after Mr. Herbert’s visit the old inhabitants had a hard time recognizing their own town.","In the days that followed, people saw Mr. Herbert carrying a net and basket to catch butterflies in the areas around the town. By Wednesday, a group of agricultural engineers, irrigation experts, cartographers, and surveyors arrived to conduct weekly surveys in the very areas where Herbert had been catching butterflies. After that, Mr. Jack Brown arrived on a private railcar attached to the yellow train; it was a special car with silver-plated floors and walls, velvet-covered cushioned seats, and a roof lined with blue glass. Also on this special train, bustling around Mr. Jack Brown, were solemn lawyers in black robes, who once followed Colonel Aureliano Buendía everywhere. This made the villagers think that the agricultural engineers, irrigation experts, cartographers, and surveyors, as well as Mr. Herbert with his weather balloons and colorful butterflies, and Mr. Brown with his mobile railcar and fierce German Shepherds, seemed to signal a war. However, people did not have much time to think, because the sensitive residents of Macondo had barely begun to ask each other what the hell was happening when the entire town turned into a camp of wooden houses with tin roofs, inhabited by strangers who arrived on overcrowded trains, not only sitting on the seats and floors but also on the roofs of the carriages. This group of Gringos, who later brought along their skinny wives often dressed in thin muslin clothes and wide-brimmed fabric hats, built their own residential area on the other side of the railway, planting Panama trees along the road. Each house had iron mesh windows, white tables on the verandas, X-shaped weather vanes on the rooftops, and wide lawns around the houses where they kept chickens and turkeys. The entire village was fenced with iron mesh, resembling a giant electrified chicken coop, and in the cool early summer months, flocks of swallows would darken the sky in the mornings. No one knew exactly what they were looking for, or if in fact they were simply philanthropists, but they caused a tremendous disturbance, even more than the gypsies had before, although it was brief and understandable. Endowed with abilities that once only God possessed, they changed the pattern of the rain, shortened the harvest season, and diverted the river to the other side of the village, behind the cemetery. During that time, they also built a concrete mausoleum to replace the old grave of José Arcadio, so that the smell of gunpowder from the corpse wouldn't contaminate the water supply. To serve the strangers without families, they transformed the small neighborhood of prostitutes into a larger and more bustling town. Then, on one bright Wednesday, they brought in a trainload of stunningly beautiful prostitutes, flamboyant women trained with unimaginable skills, fully prepared with all sorts of cosmetics and tools to entice inexperienced and shy young men, satisfy the lustful, and entertain all kinds of people, especially the bachelors. The Turkish quarter became more luxurious with stores for ocean-going sailors replacing the old shabby shops. Every Saturday night, it was noisy with energetic and adventurous crowds jostling around gambling tables, shooting galleries, in the alley where fortunes were told and omens interpreted, around tables laden with food and drink, and by Sunday morning, these tables lay overturned on the ground amidst a jumble of people, sometimes those dead drunk after hours of revelry, but mostly those who had fallen from being shot, stabbed, slashed, or hit with bottles in brawls. It was indeed a very noisy and untimely invasion, to the extent that initially, people could not move around the streets filled with furniture, trunks, and the wooden planks and bamboo of those who brazenly built houses on any vacant land without asking anyone's permission, and the scandalous behavior of couples hanging hammocks haphazardly under trees and making love in broad daylight without regard for passersby. The only quiet corner was that of the black people from the Antilles with their rickety wooden houses, and at dusk, they would sit on their porches singing mournful songs in their native language. So many changes had occurred in such a short time, just eight months after Mr. Herbert's visit, that the long-time residents of Macondo called each other to wake up early and see their own village.",19.205,19.064,"In the following days, they saw Mister Herbert outside the town, catching butterflies with a basket and a net. On Wednesday, a group of engineers, water engineers, soil engineers, topographers, and surveyors got off the train. They conducted research for weeks in the areas where Mister Herbert caught butterflies. Later, Mister Jack Brown arrived in a special carriage attached to the yellow train, painted with gilding, with velvet seats and a blue glass ceiling. Among those buzzing around Mister Jack Brown in the special carriage were the lawyers in black suits who once never left Colonel Aureliano Buendia's side. When the people saw these lawyers, they thought that the agricultural engineers, water engineers, topographers, surveyors, hot air balloons with colorful butterflies, Mister Herbert, and Mister Brown with his terrifying German dogs were all related to the war. There wasn't much opportunity to think about whether it was so. Because before the suspicious Macondolans could figure out what was happening, the zinc-roofed wooden houses where foreigners from the other half of the world settled surrounded Macondo, with people hanging on to the seats, corridors, and even the roofs of the trains. Later, they established a separate town on the other side of the railway for these gringos, who brought their worn-out wives dressed in muslin clothes and large hats covered with veils. Palm trees lined the streets of this new town. The houses had shutters on the windows, tiny white tables on the verandas, ceiling fans with propellers, and gardens covered with bluish grass where peacocks and quails roamed. This area was surrounded by iron bars. Electric wires that turned the swallows, which perched on the bars on cool summer mornings, into coal were wrapped around the bars. No one could understand why these newcomers had come, what their intentions were, and whether they had really come purely out of love for humanity and a desire to help people. They had already created a great deal of unrest. The unease they caused was greater, more lasting, and more incomprehensible than the troubles brought by the old gypsies. These men, once endowed with abilities that were only attributed to God, changed the rainy season, accelerated the harvest period, allowing for multiple crops a year, and moved the river from its usual place to the other side of the town, behind the cemetery, along with its white stones and icy water. Around that time, they also built a concrete cover over Jose Arcadio's grave like a fortress, so that the smell of gunpowder from the corpse wouldn't poison the water. For those among the upcoming strangers whose hearts were not burning with the fire of love, they turned the street of love women who came from France into a place much more splendid and expensive than before. One Wednesday, they transported a whole train full of prostitutes. These were the most skilled women in the art of lovemaking that has persisted since the world was established. They were trying a thousand and one ways, reviving the worn-out with strength pastes and ointments, encouraging the timid, satisfying the insatiable, exciting the quietest, giving the necessary lesson to those who were clingy, and rescuing those who were buried in loneliness. Instead of the old markets filled with colorful and varied goods, Turk Street, where goods from foreign countries were displayed in illuminated shop windows, began to overflow on Saturday nights. In the crowd between the gambling tables, shooting galleries, places where fortunes were told and dreams interpreted, and tables laden with roasted meats and drinks, everyone was bumping into each other. On Sunday mornings, those who had passed out dead drunk and the many who had been struck down by bullets, fists, knives, and bottles in the fights would be gathered from the ground. In the early days when this terrible crowd first began to surge, walking on the streets became a problem in itself. Trucks, crates, belongings, the construction materials of those who saw no need to ask anyone's permission to build houses wherever they found an empty spot, the noise of carpenters, and the indecency of couples making love in broad daylight in hammocks strung up on almond trees made it impossible to go out. The only sensible place was the neighborhood of the black people from the West Indies. These quiet people had settled on a street lined with wooden shacks nailed onto stilts. In the evenings, they would come out in front of their doors and sing soulful, poignant songs. So many changes happened in such a short time that, eight months after Mr. Herbert's first arrival, the old Macondo residents could no longer recognize their own town.",15.999,15.849,"In the following days, he was seen with a net and a basket catching butterflies around the village. On Wednesday, a group of engineers, agronomists, hydrologists, topographers, and surveyors arrived, who for several weeks explored the same places where Mr. Herbert was catching butterflies. Later, Mr. Jack Brown arrived in an additional wagon that was hooked to the tail of the yellow train, and it was all laminated in silver, with episcopal velvet armchairs and a ceiling of blue glass. In the special wagon also arrived, fluttering around Mr. Brown, the solemn lawyers dressed in black who in another time followed Colonel Aureliano Buendía everywhere, and this made people think that the agronomists, hydrologists, topographers, and surveyors, as well as Mr. Herbert with his captive balloons and colorful butterflies, and Mr. Brown with his rolling mausoleum and his fierce German dogs, had something to do with the war. There was not, however, much time to think about it, because the suspicious inhabitants of Macondo had just begun to wonder what the hell was going on, when the village had already transformed into a camp of wooden houses with zinc roofs, populated by strangers who arrived from half the world on the train, not only in the seats and platforms but even on the roofs of the wagons. The gringos, who later brought their languid women in muslin dresses and large gauze hats, made a separate town on the other side of the train line, with streets lined with palm trees, houses with windows of metal screens, white tables on the terraces, and ceiling fans with blades, and extensive blue lawns with peacocks and quails. The sector was fenced with a metal mesh, like a gigantic electrified chicken coop that in the cool months of summer dawned black with charred swallows. No one yet knew what they were looking for, or if they were truly nothing more than philanthropists, and they had already caused a colossal disruption, much more disturbing than that of the old gypsies, but less transient and comprehensible. Endowed with resources that in another era were reserved for Divine Providence, they modified the rainfall regime, hastened the crop cycle, and moved the river from where it had always been and placed it with its white stones and icy currents at the other end of the town, behind the cemetery. It was on that occasion that they built a concrete fortress over the faded tomb of José Arcadio, so that the smell of gunpowder from the corpse would not contaminate the waters. For the strangers who arrived without love, they turned the street of the affectionate French matrons into a town larger than the other, and on a glorious Wednesday they brought a train loaded with unbelievable prostitutes, Babylonian women trained in immemorial resources, and provided with all kinds of ointments and devices to stimulate the defenseless, awaken the timid, satisfy the voracious, exalt the modest, chastise the multiple, and correct the solitary. The Street of the Turks, enriched with luminous grocery stores that displaced the old colorful bazaars, buzzed on Saturday night with crowds of adventurers jostling among the tables of luck and chance, the shooting galleries, the alley where the future was foretold and dreams were interpreted, and the tables of fried foods and drinks, which by Sunday morning were scattered on the ground, among bodies that were sometimes of happy drunks and almost always of curious ones struck down by gunshots, punches, knives, and bottle blows from the brawl. It was such a tumultuous and sudden invasion that in the early days it was impossible to walk down the street with the obstruction of furniture and trunks, and the carpentry work of those who set up their houses on any bare land without anyone's permission, and the scandal of couples who hung their hammocks between the almond trees and made love under the awnings, in broad daylight and in full view of everyone. The only corner of serenity was established by the peaceful Antillean blacks who built a marginal street, with wooden houses on stilts, on whose porches they sat in the evening singing melancholic hymns in their cumbersome Papiamento. So many changes occurred in such a short time that eight months after Mr. Herbert's visit, the old inhabitants of Macondo would get up early to get to know their own village.",43.849,43.776
530,"“Look at the mess we’ve got ourselves into,” Colonel Aureliano Buendía said at that time, “just because we invited a gringo to eat some bananas.”","- Let's see what kind of devilish things we've encountered, - Colonel Aureliano Buendía often said, - don't invite the Gringos to eat our royal bananas anymore!",10.229,6.911,"Then Colonel Aureliano Buendia said, Look at the trouble we've gotten ourselves into just because we fed a banana to a gringo.",10.147,5.961,"—Look at the mess we've gotten ourselves into —Colonel Aureliano Buendía used to say back then—, just for inviting a gringo to eat a banana.",18.317,14.278
531,"Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, could not contain his happiness over the avalanche of foreigners. The house was suddenly filled with unknown guests, with invincible and worldly carousers, and it became necessary to add bedrooms off the courtyard, widen the dining room, and exchange the old table for one that held sixteen people, with new china and silver, and even then they had to eat lunch in shifts. Fernanda had to swallow her scruples and their guests of the worst sort like kings as they muddied the porch with their boots, urinated in the garden. laid their mats down anywhere to take their siesta, and spoke without regard for the sensitivities of ladies or the proper behavior of gentlemen. Amaranta, was so scandalized with the plebeian invasion that she went back to eating in the kitchen as in olden days. Colonel Aureliano Buendía, convinced that the majority of those who came into his workshop to greet him were not doing it because of sympathy or regard but out of the curiosity to meet a historical relic, a museum fossil, decided to shut himself in by barring the door and he was not seen any more except on very rare occasions when he would sit at the street door. Úrsula, on the other hand, even during the days when she was already dragging her feet and walking about groping along the walls, felt a juvenile excitement as the time for the arrival of the train approached. “We have to prepare some meat and fish,” she would order the four cooks, who hastened to have everything ready under the imperturbable direction of Santa Sofía de la Piedad. “We have to prepare everything,” she insisted, “because we never know what these strangers like to eat.” The train arrived during the hottest time of day. At lunchtime the house shook with the bustle of a marketplace, and the perspiring guests—who did not even know who their hosts were—trooped in to occupy the best places at the table, while the cooks bumped into each other with enormous kettles of soup, pots of meat, large gourds filled with vegetables, and troughs of rice, and passed around the contents of barrels of lemonade with inexhaustible ladles. The disorder was such that Fernanda was troubled by the idea that many were eating twice and on more than one occasion she was about to burst out with a vegetable hawker’s insults because someone at the table in confusion asked her for the check. More than a year had gone by since Mr. Herbert’s visit and the only thing that was known was that the gringos were planning to plant banana trees in the enchanted region that José Arcadio Buendía and his men had crossed in search of the route to the great inventions. Two other sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, with the cross of ashes on their foreheads, arrived, drawn by that great volcanic belch, and they justified their determination with a phrase that may have explained everybody’s reasons.","On the contrary, Aureliano Segundo was overjoyed by the influx of people from all over. In no time, his house was filled with strange guests, world-famous diners, and thus additional bedrooms had to be built in the yard, the dining room had to be expanded, the old dining table was replaced with a new one with sixteen seats, and all the dishes and cutlery had to be new, yet they still had to arrange lunch in shifts. Fernanda had to endure and serve the guests of all kinds as if they were royalty, those who brazenly dragged their muddy, sandy boots into the dining room, urinated all over the garden, spread out tarps anywhere to nap, and spouted all sorts of stories without regard for the embarrassment of the women or the indignation of the respectable men. Faced with the chaos of those lower-class people, Amaranta showed her annoyance by going to eat in the kitchen as she used to. Colonel Aureliano Buendía knew that most of those who came into his workshop to greet him did so not out of respect but out of curiosity to see a historical relic, a museum skeleton, so he decided to lock himself in all day, and rarely was he seen sitting by the door facing the street. Úrsula was entirely different; even when she could only shuffle along, clinging to the walls, she still felt the youthful excitement whenever the train was about to arrive. "" We need to get meat and fish,"" she ordered the four cooks, who were always bustling about punctually under the strict supervision of Santa Sofía de la Piedad. ""We need to have everything ready,"" she insisted, ""because you never know what the guests might want to eat. "" The train arrived at the hottest hour. At lunchtime, the house was as noisy as a market, and the sweaty diners, without knowing who the hosts were, jostled to take the best seats at the table, while the cooks hurriedly bumped into each other carrying huge pots of soup, stewed meat, vegetable broth, rice dishes, and ladling out pitcher after pitcher of lemonade until the large barrel was emptied. The chaos was so great that Fernanda was infuriated, convinced that many people had come to eat twice, and often wanted to burst out with vulgar words because some fools thought it was an inn and asked for the bill. It had been more than a year since Mr. Herbert's visit, and the only thing known was that the Gringos planned to plant bananas in the enchanting land that José Arcadio Buendía and his men had crossed in their quest for great discoveries. Two other sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, marked with crosses on their foreheads, also came, drawn by the boom, and they explained their decision with a phrase that perhaps summed up everyone's reason.",23.616,23.435,"Aureliano Segundo, however, did not hide his joy at the influx of foreigners. When the house suddenly filled with all sorts of guests and foreigners who loved to eat and drink, it became necessary to build new bedrooms in the garden, expand the dining room, buy a table that could seat sixteen people instead of the old one, and increase the number of plates, dishes, and cutlery. Even so, they had to take turns sitting down to eat. Fernanda had to put aside her shyness and treat even the most uncouth guests like royalty, endure them muddying the veranda with their boots, urinating in the garden, spreading out beds and lying down wherever they fancied for an afternoon nap, and behaving in a manner that showed they had no idea how to talk to or act around women. Amaranta was so upset by this rabble's raid that she started eating her meals in the kitchen again, just like before. Colonel Aureliano Buendia, believing that most of those who came to greet him in his workshop did so not out of love or respect but out of a curiosity to see a historical relic, a museum fossil, bolted his door and shut himself in his workshop. After that, he was not seen around except for occasionally sitting in front of the street door to get some fresh air. Ursula, although she had become quite frail and could only walk by holding onto the walls, would become lively and feel a fresh joy on the days when the train's arrival was near. Ursula would call the four cooks working under the meticulous management of Santa Sofia de la Piedad, ""Let's prepare some meat and fish,"" he was saying. ""Everything should be ready, you never know what these foreigners want to eat."" The train was arriving at the hottest time of the day. At lunchtime, the house turned into a marketplace, the place was shaking from the crowd and noise. Guests, drenched in sweat and not even knowing who the hosts were, were attacking like an army to grab the best spot at the table, while the cooks, bumping into each other, were carrying soups in huge pots, meats in potfuls, pilafs in large trays, fruits in trays, and ladling lemonade from big barrels. There was such disorder, such chaos that Fernanda thought many people were eating twice and was getting angry. Once, when one of the people at the table mistakenly asked her for the bill, she almost cursed at the man with the festive language of itinerant vegetable sellers. It had been over a year since Mr. Herbert arrived, and during this time, the only thing the people of Macondo learned was that the gringos planned to grow bananas in the magical region that José Arcadio Buendía and his men had crossed in pursuit of great discoveries. Two more sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, with ash tattoos on their foreheads, came to Macondo upon hearing about this volcanic development, and the reason for their arrival",19.993,19.791,"Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, was overjoyed with the avalanche of outsiders. The house suddenly filled with unknown guests, invincible global revelers, and it was necessary to add bedrooms in the courtyard, enlarge the dining room, and replace the old table with one of sixteen places, with new dishes and services, and even then, shifts had to be established for lunch. Fernanda had to choke down her scruples and attend to guests of the most perverse condition as if they were royalty, who muddied the corridor with their boots, urinated in the garden, spread their mats anywhere to take a nap, and spoke without regard for the susceptibilities of ladies or the niceties of gentlemen. Amaranta was so scandalized by the invasion of the rabble that she went back to eating in the kitchen as in the old days. Colonel Aureliano Buendía, convinced that most of those who came to greet him in the workshop did so not out of sympathy or esteem, but out of curiosity to see a historical relic, a museum fossil, chose to lock himself in with a bar and was seen only on very rare occasions sitting at the street door. Úrsula, on the other hand, even in the times when she dragged her feet and walked feeling along the walls, experienced a childish joy when the train's arrival approached. “We must make meat and fish,” she ordered the four cooks, who bustled to be on time under the unflappable direction of Santa Sofía de la Piedad. “We must make everything,” she insisted, “because you never know what the outsiders want to eat. ”The train arrived at the hottest hour. At lunch, the house trembled with a market-like uproar, and the sweaty diners, who didn't even know who their hosts were, burst in en masse to occupy the best seats at the table, while the cooks bumped into each other with enormous pots of soup, cauldrons of meats, tubs of vegetables, trays of rice, and distributed with inexhaustible ladles the barrels of lemonade. The disorder was such that Fernanda was exasperated with the idea that many ate twice, and more than once she wanted to vent with market-woman insults because some confused diner asked her for the bill.

533,"Remedios the Beauty was the only one who was immune to the banana plague. She was becalmed in a magnificent adolescence, more and more impenetrable to formality, more and more indifferent to malice and suspicion, happy in her own world of simple realities. She did not understand why women complicated their lives with corsets and petticoats, so she sewed herself a coarse cassock that she simply put over her and without further difficulties resolved the problem of dress, without taking away the feeling of being naked, which according to her lights was the only decent way to be when at home. They bothered her so much to cut the rain of hair that already reached to her thighs and to make rolls with combs and braids with red ribbons that she simply shaved her head and used the hair to make wigs for the saints. The startling thing about her simplifying instinct was that the more she did away with fashion in a search for comfort and the more she passed over conventions as she obeyed spontaneity, the more disturbing her incredible beauty became and the more provocative she became to men. When the sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía were in Macondo for the first time, Úrsula remembered that in their veins they bore the same blood as her great-granddaughter and she shuddered with a forgotten fright. “Keep your eyes wide open,” she warned her. “With any of them your children will come out with the tail of a pig.” The girl paid such little attention to the warning that she dressed up as a man and rolled around in the sand in order to climb the greased pole, and she was at the point of bringing on a tragedy among the seventeen cousins, who were driven mad by the unbearable spectacle. That was why none of them slept at the house when they visited the town and the four who had stayed lived in rented rooms at Úrsula’s insistence. Remedios the Beauty, however, would have died laughing if she had known about that precaution. Until her last moment on earth she was unaware that her irreparable fate as a disturbing woman was a daily disaster. Every time she appeared in the dining room, against Úrsula’s orders, she caused a panic of exasperation among the outsiders. It was all too evident that she was completely naked underneath her crude nightshirt and no one could understand that her shaved and perfect skull was not some kind of challenge, and that the boldness with which she uncovered her thighs to cool off was not a criminal provocation, nor was her pleasure when she sucked her fingers after. eating. What no member of the family ever knew was that the strangers did not take long to realize that Remedios the Beauty gave off a breath of perturbation, a tormenting breeze that was still perceptible several hours after she had passed by. Men expert in the disturbances of love, experienced all over the world, stated that they had never suffered an anxiety similar to the one produced by the natural smell of Remedios the Beauty. On the porch with the begonias, in the parlor, in any place in the house, it was possible to point out the exact place where she had been and the time that had passed since she had left it. It was a definite, unmistakable trace that no one in the family could distinguish because it had been incorporated into the daily odors for a long time, but it was one that the outsiders identified immediately. They were the only ones, therefore, who understood how the young commander of the guard had died of love and how a gentleman from a faraway land had been plunged into desperation. Unaware of the restless circle in which she moved, of the unbearable state of intimate calamity that she provoked as she passed by, Remedios the Beauty treated the men without the least bit of malice and in the end upset them with her innocent complaisance. When Úrsula succeeded in imposing the command that she eat with Amaranta in the kitchen so that the outsiders would not see her, she felt more comfortable, because, after all, she was beyond all discipline. In reality, it made no difference to her where she ate, and not at regular hours but according to the whims of her appetite. Sometimes she would get up to have lunch at three in the morning, sleep all day long, and she spent several months with her timetable all in disarray until some casual incident would bring her back into the order of things. When things were going better she would get up at eleven o’clock in the morning and shut herself up until two o’clock, completely nude, in the bathroom, killing scorpions as she came out of her dense and prolonged sleep. Then she would throw water from the cistern over herself with a gourd. It was an act so prolonged, so meticulous, so rich in ceremonial aspects that one who did not know her well would have thought that she was given over to the deserved adoration of her own body. For her, however, that solitary rite lacked all sensuality and was simply a way of passing the time until she was hungry. One day, as she began to bathe herself, a stranger lifted a tile from the roof and was breathless at the tremendous spectacle of her nudity. She saw his desolate eyes through the broken tiles and had no reaction of shame but rather one of alarm.","Remedios the Beauty, was the only one to escape the banana plague. She kept her youthful beauty, becoming increasingly indifferent to all grooming, paying no attention to cunning tricks, always happy in her own simple, terrifyingly real world. She couldn't understand why women complicated their lives with bras and panties, so she made herself a dress out of burlap that she could just slip over her head, solving all her problems without any fuss. That way, she felt free and comfortable, which she believed was the best way to be at home. Everyone nagged her to cut her long hair that flowed down to her calves, to tie it up with colorful ribbons, so she shaved it all off and used her hair to make a wig for a saint's statue. The surprising thing about her simple instincts was that the more she discarded style for comfort, the more she ignored norms to follow her natural impulses, the more stunningly beautiful she became, and the more men desired her. When Colonel Aureliano Buendía's sons first came to Macondo, Úrsula remembered they carried the blood of Remedios, her great-granddaughter, and felt an unprecedented fear. ""Look closely,"" she warned, ""If you sleep with any of them, you'll give birth to a pig-tailed child. "" She paid little attention to the warning, still wore boys' clothes, rolled around in the sand to climb greasy poles, nearly causing a tragedy among her seventeen cousins who were overwhelmed by the unbearable sight. Because of this, none of them stayed at the house when visiting the village, and the four who had been there before lived separately in rented rooms arranged by Úrsula. Nevertheless, Remedios the Beauty would have probably died laughing if she knew about these precautions. Until her last moment on earth, she never realized that her irresistible feminine allure was a daily disaster. Every time she appeared in the dining room, defying Úrsula's orders, she terrified the strangers present. For two clear years, she wore that ironically oversized dress, and no one could understand that her bald head was not a challenge, and that her shamelessly exposing her legs for coolness or sucking her fingers after eating with her hands was not a provocative crime. Strangers quickly realized that Remedios the Beauty caused terror and inner torment even hours after she had passed by. Seasoned men, tested by love's sufferings, confirmed they had never felt such intense desire as they did before Remedios the Beauty's natural presence. In the hallway with the begonias, in the living room, in any corner of the house, one could point out exactly where she had stood and the precise time she had left. That trace was clear, unmistakable, but no one in the family noticed because it had long blended into the house's daily scent, while strangers recognized it immediately. Thus, only they understood that the young guard commander might have died of love, and a distant nobleman might have despaired. Unaware of the turmoil and harsh fate her every gesture and step caused, Remedios the Beauty always treated everyone without malice, still making them sorrowful with her innocent joy. When Úrsula made her eat in the kitchen with Amaranta to keep strangers from seeing her, she felt more comfortable because she was even freer. In fact, it didn't matter where she ate, and she didn't follow a set schedule; she ate whenever she felt like it. She would get up around three in the morning to eat, then sleep all day, and for months she ate at irregular times until some coincidence brought her back to the old routine. When everything was going smoothly, she would get up at eleven in the morning, lock herself in the bathroom, and soak naked in the tub for hours, killing scorpions and shaking off her lingering sleepiness. Then she would use a gourd dipper to pour water over herself. The prolonged, meticulous, enjoyable bath in the solemn silence would make anyone unfamiliar with her think she was passionately grooming herself. But for her, the monotonous ritual was not seductive; it was just a way to pass the time while she was hungry. One day, as she began her bath, a stranger removed a tile from the roof to look down, and he was breathless at the sight of her ivory body. She saw his staring eyes through the hole in the roof and her reaction was not shame but fear for his life.",20.157,20.056,"The only person unaffected by the banana plague was Beautiful Remedios. She had become a young girl of indescribable beauty, distanced herself even more from formalities, purified herself even more from evil and suspicion, and found happiness in her world filled with simple truths. She couldn't understand why women tortured themselves with corsets and petticoats. Therefore, she solved her clothing problem by sewing herself a loose robe. Thus, the feeling of nudity, which she saw as the most appropriate attire within the house, remained unblemished, and she felt as if she were naked under the loose robe. They nagged her so much to cut her hair that fell to her hips, to gather it on top of her head with combs and red ribboned braids, that in the end she shaved her hair off completely and made wigs for saint statues from the hair she cut. This was a remarkable result of his instinct to simplify everything. The more he disregarded fashion for comfort, and the more he ignored customs to act as he pleased, the more his incredible beauty stood out; the more captivating he became. When Colonel Aureliano Buendia's sons first came to Macondo, Ursula thought that the blood in their veins was the same as that of her great-granddaughter Beautiful Remedios, and she remembered. Shivering with fear, he warned the girl, ""Open your eyes."" ""If you marry one of them, your children will have tails like pigs."" The girl was so indifferent to this warning that she dressed up as a man and rolled in the sand to climb the greasy pole. This unbearable display almost drove her seventeen cousins to fight each other. That's why the young men didn't stay at home when they came to town. The remaining four, at Ursula's insistence, had each rented a room for themselves. If beautiful Remedios knew about these measures, she would have laughed herself to tears. Until her death, she never understood that she could not escape the fate of being a woman who disturbed people's peace, and that this fate was a daily trouble for those around her. Whenever she disobeyed Ursula and entered the dining room, the strangers' appetites were ruined. It was clearly evident that she was stark naked under her loose nightgown, and there was no way to explain to anyone that shaving her neat head was not an act of defiance, that lifting her skirts to cool her legs was not meant to be provocative, and that licking and sucking her fingers after meals was simply because she enjoyed it. The strangers soon realized that wherever Beautiful Remedios passed, a whirlwind of excitement would blow, lasting even hours after, leaving a painful breeze in its wake. The household did not notice that the strangers sensed this. Men who had mastered the art of heartache and had experienced love adventures all over the world said that they had never encountered anything more intoxicating than the natural scent of Beautiful Remedios's skin. Whether it was on the veranda with begonias, in the living room, or anywhere else in the house, it was possible to determine where and exactly when Beautiful Remedios had passed by her scent. It was a scent that the household did not notice because it was one of the house's unique smells, but strangers immediately distinguished it. For this reason, only the strangers could understand how the young commander of the guards fell into a deep love and died, and how the young man from distant lands was driven into misery. Beautiful Remedios, who was completely unaware of the circle of unrest surrounding her and the troublesome atmosphere she stirred up wherever she went, never harbored the slightest ill will towards men in her behavior, and in the end, with this innocence-born tolerance, she would drive them out of their minds. Ursula's insistence that she eat in the kitchen with Amaranta so that strangers wouldn't see her actually suited Beautiful Remedios even more. In this way, she avoided having to conform to any discipline. In fact, she would eat her meal wherever she wanted. Moreover, she preferred to snack whenever she felt like it rather than at set times. Sometimes she would get up at three in the morning, eat her meal, and then sleep all day. This disorder would continue for a few months until an incident occurred and things returned to normal. When things were going quite regularly, Beautiful Remedios would wake up at eleven in the morning, lock herself naked in the bathroom until two, trying to wake up from her seemingly endless sleep while killing the scorpions in the bathroom. Then she would take water from the basin with a gourd-made dipper and pour it over herself. This process would take so long and become so ceremonious that someone who didn't know Beautiful Remedios well might think she was worshipping her own body. However, this bathing ritual had nothing to do with sexuality. Beautiful Remedios was lingering in the bathroom because she didn't know how to pass the time until she got hungry. One day, while Beautiful Remedios was bathing, one of the strangers removed the tiles from the roof and watched her, and he was breathless at the extraordinary sight of the girl's nakedness. When Beautiful Remedios saw the man's eyes through the broken tiles, her reaction was not embarrassment but fear and panic.",15.978,15.841,"Remedios, the beautiful, was the only one who remained immune to the banana plague. She stagnated in a magnificent adolescence, increasingly impervious to formalities, more indifferent to malice and suspicion, happy in her own world of simple realities. She did not understand why women complicated their lives with corsets and petticoats, so she sewed herself a hemp smock that she simply slipped over her head, solving the problem of dressing without further ado, without losing the impression of being naked, which, as she understood things, was the only decent way to be at home. They bothered her so much to cut her rain-like hair that reached her calves, and to make buns with combs and braids with red ribbons, that she simply shaved her head and made wigs for the saints. The astonishing thing about her simplifying instinct was that the more she freed herself from fashion seeking comfort, and the more she disregarded conventions in obedience to spontaneity, the more disturbing her incredible beauty became and the more provocative her behavior with men. When Colonel Aureliano Buendía's sons came to Macondo for the first time, Úrsula remembered that they carried the same blood as the great-granddaughter, and she shuddered with a forgotten fear. ""Open your eyes wide,"" she warned her. ""With any of them, your children will be born with pig tails."" She paid so little attention to the warning that she dressed as a man and rolled in the sand to climb the greasy pole, almost causing a tragedy among the seventeen cousins disturbed by the unbearable spectacle. That was why none of them slept in the house when they visited the town, and the four who stayed lived by Úrsula's arrangement in rented rooms. However, Remedios, the beautiful, would have died laughing if she had known about that precaution. Until the last moment she was on earth, she ignored that her irreparable destiny as a disturbing woman was a daily disaster. Every time she appeared in the dining room, contrary to Úrsula's orders, she caused a panic of exasperation among the strangers. It was too obvious that she was completely naked under the coarse nightgown, and no one could understand that her shaved and perfect skull was not a challenge, and that the audacity with which she uncovered her thighs to cool off, and the pleasure with which she sucked her fingers after eating with her hands, was not a criminal provocation. What no family member ever knew was that the strangers soon realized that Remedios, the beautiful, exuded a breath of disturbance, a gust of torment, which remained perceptible several hours after she had passed. Men experienced in love disorders, tested all over the world, claimed never to have suffered an anxiety similar to that produced by the natural scent of Remedios, the beautiful. In the begonias corridor, in the visiting room, in any place in the house, one could pinpoint the exact spot where she had been and the time elapsed since she had left. It was a defined, unmistakable trace that no one in the house could distinguish because it had long been incorporated into the everyday smells, but which the strangers identified immediately. That was why they were the only ones who understood that the young commander of the guard had died of love, and that a gentleman from other lands had fallen into despair. Unaware of the disturbing atmosphere in which she moved, of the unbearable state of intimate calamity she caused in her wake, Remedios, the beautiful, treated men without the slightest malice and ended up disturbing them with her innocent compliances. When Úrsula managed to impose the order that she eat with Amaranta in the kitchen so that the strangers would not see her, she felt more comfortable because, after all, she was safe from all discipline. In reality, it made no difference to her to eat anywhere, and not at fixed times but according to the whims of her appetite. Sometimes she would get up to have lunch at three in the morning, sleep all day, and spend several months with her schedule disrupted, until some casual incident would put her back in order. When things were going better, she would get up at eleven in the morning and lock herself up for two hours completely naked in the bathroom, killing scorpions while shaking off the dense and prolonged sleep. Then she would pour water from the pool over herself with a gourd. It was such a prolonged, meticulous act, so rich in ceremonial situations, that anyone who did not know her well might have thought she was engaged in a deserved adoration of her own body. For her, however, that solitary ritual lacked all sensuality and was simply a way to pass the time until she got hungry. One day, as she was beginning to bathe, a stranger lifted a tile from the roof and was left breathless at the tremendous spectacle of her nakedness. She saw the desolate eyes through the broken tiles and did not react with shame, but with alarm.",50.544,50.496

The foreigners who heard the noise in the dining room and hastened to remove the body noticed the suffocating odor of Remedios the Beauty on his skin. It was so deep in his body that the cracks in his skull did not give off blood but an amber-colored oil that was impregnated with that secret perfume, and then they understood that the smell of Remedios the Beauty kept on torturing men beyond death, right down to the dust of their bones. Nevertheless, they did not relate that horrible accident to the other two men who had died because of Remedios the Beauty. A victim was still needed before the outsiders and many of the old inhabitants of Macondo would credit the legend that Remedios Buendía did not give off a breath of love but a fatal emanation. The occasion for the proof of it came some months later on one afternoon when Remedios the Beauty went with a group of girl friends to look at the new plantings. For the girls of Macondo that novel game was reason for laughter and surprises, frights and jokes, and at night they would talk about their walk as if it had been an experience in a dream. Such was the prestige of that silence that Úrsula did not have the heart to take the fun away from Remedios the Beauty, and she let her go one afternoon, providing that she wore a hat and a decent dress. As soon as the group of friends went into the plantings the air became impregnated with a fatal fragrance. The men who were working along the rows felt possessed by a strange fascination, menaced by some invisible danger, and many succumbed to a terrible desire to weep. Remedios the Beauty and her startled friends managed to take refuge in a nearby house just as they were about to be assaulted by a pack of ferocious males. A short time later they were rescued by the flour Aurelianos, whose crosses of ash inspired a sacred respect, as if they were caste marks, stamps of invulnerability. Remedios the Beauty did not tell anyone that one of the men, taking advantage of the tumult, had managed to attack her stomach with a hand that was more like the claw of an eagle clinging to the edge of a precipice. She faced the attacker in a kind of instantaneous flash and saw the disconsolate eyes, which remained stamped on her heart like the hot coals of pity. That night the man boasted of his audacity and swaggered over his good luck on the Street of the Turks a few minutes before the kick of a horse crushed his chest and a crowd of outsiders saw him die in the middle of the street, drowned in his own bloody vomiting.","The sound of broken bricks falling clattered like a harbinger of disaster, and the strange man could only let out a terrifying scream, his skull shattered, and he died instantly on the cement floor. The strangers in the dining room heard the crashing sound and rushed out to carry the young man's body, feeling the suffocatingly strong smell of Remedios the Beauty emanating from his skin, a smell that continued to torment the men even after death, even when they were nothing but a handful of bones. However, they did not connect that terrible accident with the deaths of two other men also because of Remedios the Beauty. It wasn't until there was another victim that the strangers and many people born in Macondo began to believe the legendary tale that the breath of Remedios the Beauty was not a breath of love but a killing vapor. The story took place a few months later, one afternoon when Remedios the Beauty and some girlfriends went to see the new plantations. Recently, the people of Macondo had a new pastime of strolling along the seemingly endless, wet roads lined with banana trees on both sides, where the silence seemed to originate from some desolate place, making sounds difficult to travel far. Sometimes, even when only half a meter apart, they couldn't hear each other, but voices from the far end of the field echoed very clearly. This new game gave the girls of Macondo hearty laughs or thrilling scares as they teased and frightened each other. In the evenings, the girls often recounted these strolls as if they were dreams. The silence was so revered that Úrsula did not dare to stop Remedios the Beauty's pastime, and one afternoon allowed her to go out on the condition that she wore a wide-brimmed hat and dressed beautifully. From the moment the girls entered the plantation, the atmosphere seemed to be filled with a deadly fragrance. The men working in the fields felt enchanted, threatened by an invisible danger, and many were overwhelmed by tearful terror. Remedios the Beauty and her frightened friends just managed to hide in a nearby house when they were almost assaulted by a group of frenzied men. They were later rescued by the four Aureliano brothers, whose holy cross marks on their foreheads commanded respect, as if they were a sign of rank, of inviolability. Remedios the Beauty did not tell anyone about one of them taking advantage of the commotion to touch her lower abdomen, his hand feeling like an eagle's claw gripping the edge of an abyss. In an instant, she brushed off the young man's reckless hand and saw a pair of sorrowful eyes that made her heart twinge with compassion. That night, the young man went to the Turkish street boasting about his daring and luck. A few minutes later, he was kicked in the chest by a horse, and the crowd of onlookers witnessed him writhing in a pool of blood, dying in the middle of the street.",18.969,18.769,"The rotten tiles broke with a noise and the man only had time to let out a scream of fear before hitting the cement floor and breaking his head. He died immediately and lay sprawled on the ground. When strangers, who had heard the noise from the dining room, came running, they smelled the breathtaking scent of Beautiful Remedios lingering on the man's skin as they lifted his body. This scent had permeated him so deeply that from the cracks in his head, instead of blood, an amber-colored oily liquid exuding the scent of Beautiful Remedios flowed. Then they realized that the scent of Beautiful Remedios did not leave men alone even after killing them, penetrating their marrow and bones. Nevertheless, they did not connect this horrifying accident with the other two men who had died because of Beautiful Remedios. A new victim was needed for the strangers and the people of Macondo to believe in the legend that Remedios Buendia spread death, not love, around her and to pass this word from mouth to mouth. The event that would prove this rumor happened a few months later when Beautiful Remedios went to look at the newly built structures with her girlfriends. For the girls of Macondo, this had become a new game. The things they saw made them laugh, surprised them, scared them, and entertained them. At night, they would sit and recount these outings as if they had dreamed them, talking about them again. Faced with the silence of Beautiful Remedios, Ursula's heart couldn't bear to deprive her of this amusement, and one day, on the condition that she wore proper clothing and a hat, she allowed her to go with the girls. As soon as the girls entered among the structures, a deadly smell filled the air. The workers were seized by a strange enchantment, sensing they were facing an invisible danger, and most of them felt a desire to cry uncontrollably. When the men, their eyes glazed over, advanced towards them, Beautiful Remedios and her friends, surprised, took refuge in one of the structures. Shortly after, four Aurelianos saved them. The ash crosses on the foreheads of the Aurelianos endowed them with a sacred dignity, considered a mark of a certain caste, a sign of inviolability. Beautiful Remedios did not tell anyone that in the chaos, one of the men clutched his stomach with a hand that resembled an eagle's claw gripping the edge of a cliff. She briefly locked eyes with the man attacking her, and Beautiful Remedios saw the pain in his eyes. Those eyes, filled with pain, burned her heart like two hot coals. That night, while boasting about his daytime audacity and strutting around in Turks Street, the man suddenly received a kick to his chest from a horse. Strangers who gathered around watched as the man, coughing up blood and choking on his own blood, died in the middle of the street.",17.972,17.763,"The rotten tiles shattered with a crash of disaster, and the man barely managed to let out a scream of terror, and he broke his skull and died without agony on the cement floor.

The opportunity to verify it came months later, one afternoon when Remedios, the beautiful, went with a group of friends to see the new plantations. For the people of Macondo, it was a recent distraction to walk through the humid and endless avenues lined with banana trees, where the silence seemed to come from somewhere else, still unused, and was therefore so clumsy at transmitting the voice. Sometimes what was said half a meter away was not very well understood, and yet it was perfectly comprehensible at the other end of the plantation. For the girls of Macondo, that novel game was a reason for laughter and surprises, for scares and jokes, and at night they talked about the walk as if it were a dream experience. Such was the prestige of that silence that Úrsula did not have the heart to deprive Remedios, the beautiful, of the fun and allowed her to go one afternoon, as long as she wore a hat and suitable attire.

545,"The supposition that Remedios the Beauty Possessed powers of death was then borne out by four irrefutable events. Although some men who were easy with their words said that it was worth sacrificing one’s life for a night of love with such an arousing woman, the truth was that no one made any effort to do so. Perhaps, not only to attain her but also to conjure away her dangers, all that was needed was a feeling as primitive and as simple as that of love, but that was the only thing that did not occur to anyone. Úrsula did not worry about her any more. On another occasion, when she had not yet given up the idea of saving her for the world, she had tried to get her interested in basic domestic affairs. “Men demand much more than you think,” she would tell her enigmatically. “There’s a lot of cooking, a lot of sweeping, a lot of suffering over little things beyond what you think.” She was deceiving herself within, trying to train her for domestic happiness because she was convinced that once his passion was satisfied them would not be a man on the face of the earth capable of tolerating even for a day a negligence that was beyond all understanding. The birth of the latest José Arcadio and her unshakable will to bring him up to be Pope finally caused her to cease worrying about her great-granddaughter. She abandoned her to her fate, trusting that sooner or later a miracle would take place and that in this world of everything there would also be a man with enough sloth to put up with her. For a long time already Amaranta had given up trying to make her into a useful woman. Since those forgotten afternoons when her niece barely had enough interest to turn the crank on the sewing machine, she had reached the conclusion that she was simpleminded. “Were going to have to raffle you off,” she would tell her, perplexed at the fact that men’s words would not penetrate her. Later on, when Úrsula insisted that Remedios the Beauty go to mass with her face covered with a shawl, Amaranta thought that a mysterious recourse like that would turn out to be so provoking that soon a man would come who would be intrigued enough to search out patiently for the weak point of her heart. But when she saw the stupid way in which she rejected a pretender who for many reasons was more desirable than a prince, she gave up all hope. Fernanda did not even make any attempt to understand her. When she saw Remedios the Beauty dressed as a queen at the bloody carnival she thought that she was an extraordinary creature. But when she saw her eating with her hands, incapable of giving an answer that was not a miracle of simplemindedness, the only thing that she lamented was the fact that the idiots in the family lived so long. In spite of the fact that Colonel Aureliano Buendía kept on believing and repeating that Remedios the Beauty was in reality the most lucid being that he had ever known and that she showed it at every moment with her startling ability to put things over on everyone, they let her go her own way. Remedios the Beauty stayed there wandering through the desert of solitude, bearing no cross on her back, maturing in her dreams without nightmares, her interminable baths, her unscheduled meals, her deep and prolonged silences that had no memory until one afternoon in March, when Fernanda wanted to fold her brabant sheets in the garden and asked the women in the house for help. She had just begun when Amaranta noticed that Remedios the Beauty was covered all over by an intense paleness.","Thus, the speculation about Remedios the Beauty - who carried the authority of death within her - was proven by four irrefutable cases. Although some gossipers often said for the sake of talking that if they could spend one night with such an alluring woman, they would die happy, in reality, none of them made any effort to do so. Perhaps a simple and primal emotion like love would be enough not only to conquer her but also to avoid all dangers, but that was the one thing no one thought of. Ursula no longer paid any attention to her. In the past, when she had not yet given up on the idea of turning her into a useful person for life, she often tried to get her interested in the main household chores. ""Men often demand more than you think,"" she would vaguely say, ""Cooking, cleaning, and countless other trivial things to worry about, beyond what you imagine. "" In reality, she had deceived herself by teaching her to enjoy family happiness, because she believed that once desires were satisfied, no man on earth could endure, even for a day, such incomprehensible neglect... When the last man of the Jose Arcadio family was born, she was determined to raise him to become the Pope, so she had no energy left to worry about her great-granddaughter. She left her alone, thinking that sooner or later a miracle would happen, and in this world where anything is possible, there would surely be a man patient enough to take her. Amaranta had long given up any intention of trying to turn her into a useful girl. From those long-forgotten afternoons of sewing, when her niece only liked to turn the handle of the sewing machine, she had concluded that she was a foolish girl. "" We'll have to auction you off,"" she said, and was very surprised by her calm attitude towards the men's flirtations. Later, when Ursula insisted that Remedios the Beauty cover her face with a veil when going to church, Amaranta thought that this mysterious act might become so provocative that soon there would be a man curious and patient enough to find the weak spot in her heart. But when she saw the foolish manner in which she rejected a suitor who was superior to any prince, she lost all hope. Fernanda didn't even want to understand her anymore. When she saw Remedios the Beauty dressed in royal attire during the bloody Carnival, Fernanda thought she was an extraordinary girl. But when she saw her eating with her hands and responding with silly remarks, Fernanda only regretted that the fools in the family had such long lives. Although Colonel Aureliano Buendía still believed and often repeated that Remedios the Beauty was the most intelligent and perceptive person he had ever seen, and although she often showed a strange cleverness in teasing others, the whole family had left her to the mercy of God's kindness. Remedios the Beauty swam alone in the desert of loneliness, without a cross to bear, immersed in beautiful dreams, in endless baths, in meals without schedules, in deep silences without memories, until one March afternoon when Fernanda was in the garden wanting to fold the rough bedspreads and called the women to help her. They had just begun when Fernanda discovered that Remedios the Beauty was completely pale. - Are you sick or something?",22.208,22.063,"After that, the assumption that Beautiful Remedios possessed deadly powers was proven by four undeniable events. Although some men who spoke without thinking claimed they would sacrifice their lives for a night of lovemaking with such an attractive and seductive woman, it was clear that no one dared to attempt such a thing. Perhaps not only to possess her but also to eliminate the dangers she created, a very primitive and simple emotion was sufficient. Falling in love would have been enough. But such a simple thing did not occur to anyone's mind or heart. Ursula no longer worried about her. At a time when she had not yet lost hope in raising her, she had tried to teach the girl household chores. ""Men expect more than you think,"" she had said. ""You need to cook, sweep the place, and deal with trivial matters and make them your concern."" Ursula was keeping herself busy by trying to teach her household chores and make her enjoy them. Because she believed that no man would be able to tolerate the girl's incredible sloppiness for even a day after satisfying his passion. The birth of her son Jose Arcadio and Ursula's intention to raise him to become a pope distracted her from worrying about her great-grandson. Ursula decided to leave Beautiful Remedios to her own fate. She believed that in this world where everything exists, there would also be a lazy man willing to put up with her sloppiness. Amaranta, on the other hand, had long given up on turning her into a useful woman. On the days when her niece couldn't properly turn the machine's handle, Amaranta had decided that the girl was mentally retarded. Seeing that Beautiful Remedios was not affected by the words of men, Amaranta would tease her, saying, -We'll have to put you in the lottery and sell you. Later, when Ursula forced the girl to wear a veil over her face while going to church, Amaranta thought that this mysterious demeanor would be very enticing and that soon enough, a man who got captivated would show patience until he found a weak spot in the girl's heart. But when she saw that Beautiful Remedios rejected a suitor who, in many ways, could not be exchanged even for princes, Amaranta lost all hope. Fernanda, on the other hand, did not make the slightest effort to understand Beautiful Remedios. When she saw Beautiful Remedios dressed as a queen at that carnival, she thought she was an extraordinary creature. But when she saw her diving into her food with her hands, unable to give a single response that wasn't an example of foolishness, she did nothing but lament the long lives of the fools in the family. No matter how much Colonel Aureliano Buendia tried to say that Beautiful Remedios was the smartest person he had ever seen in his life and that she constantly demonstrated this power with her ability to blame everything on others, no one listened to him and they left Beautiful Remedios to her own devices. Beautiful Remedios began to wander in the desert of loneliness without carrying her cross on her back, and to mature in her dreams without seeing nightmares. Her endless baths, untimely meals, and long, pensive silences continued on. Nothing changed until one day in March when Fernanda wanted to fold the sheets in the garden and called the women in the house to help her. They had just started folding the sheets when Amaranta saw that Beautiful Remedios had turned completely pale.",18.73,18.569,"The assumption that Remedios, the beautiful, possessed powers of death was then supported by four irrefutable facts. Although some men, light of tongue, delighted in saying that it was well worth sacrificing life for a night of love with such a disturbing woman, the truth was that none made efforts to achieve it. Perhaps, not only to subdue her but also to ward off her dangers, a feeling as primitive and simple as love would have sufficed, but that was the only thing that did not occur to anyone. Úrsula no longer concerned herself with her. At another time, when she had not yet given up the purpose of saving her for the world, she tried to get her interested in the basic affairs of the house. ""Men ask for more than you think,"" she would say enigmatically. "" There is much to cook, much to sweep, much to suffer for trivialities, besides what you think. "" Deep down, she was deceiving herself by trying to train her for domestic happiness, because she was convinced that once passion was satisfied, there was not a man on earth capable of enduring even for a day a negligence that was beyond all comprehension. The birth of the last José Arcadio, and her unbreakable will to educate him to become Pope, eventually made her give up her concerns for her great-granddaughter. She abandoned her to her fate, trusting that sooner or later a miracle would occur, and that in this world where there was everything, there would also be a man with enough patience to take her on. Long before, Amaranta had given up all attempts to turn her into a useful woman. From the forgotten afternoons in the sewing room, when her niece barely showed interest in turning the crank of the sewing machine, she came to the simple conclusion that she was foolish. "" We are going to have to raffle you off,"" she would say, perplexed at her impermeability to men's words. Later, when Úrsula insisted that Remedios, the beautiful, attend mass with her face covered with a mantilla, Amaranta thought that mysterious resource would be so provocative that very soon there would be a man intrigued enough to patiently seek the weak point of her heart. But when she saw the senseless way in which she scorned a suitor who for many reasons was more desirable than a prince, she gave up all hope. Fernanda did not even attempt to understand her. When she saw Remedios, the beautiful, dressed as a queen in the bloody carnival, she thought she was an extraordinary creature. But when she saw her eating with her hands, incapable of giving a response that was not a prodigy of simplicity, the only thing she regretted was that the family's fools had such long lives. Despite Colonel Aureliano Buendía still believing and repeating that Remedios, the beautiful, was actually the most lucid being he had ever known, and that she demonstrated it at every moment with her astonishing ability to mock everyone, they abandoned her to God's mercy. Remedios, the beautiful, was left wandering through the desert of solitude, without crosses to bear, maturing in her dreamless dreams, in her endless baths, in her meals without schedules, in her deep and prolonged silences without memories, until one March afternoon when Fernanda wanted to fold her linen sheets in the garden and asked for help from the women of the house. They had barely started when Amaranta noticed that Remedios, the beautiful, was becoming transparent with an intense pallor.",43.175,43.089

548,"“Quite the opposite,” she said, “I never felt better.”","- It's not true, - she said, - I feel healthier than ever.",15.37,10.344,"Beautiful Remedios, clinging to the other end of the sheet, replied with a pitiable smile, ""No, I've never been this good.""",5.49,1.997,"—On the contrary —he said—, I have never felt better.",26.138,19.86
549,"She had just finished saying it when Fernanda felt a delicate wind of light pull the sheets out of her hands and open them up wide. Amaranta felt a mysterious trembling in the lace on her petticoats and she tried to grasp the sheet so that she would not fall down at the instant in which Remedios the Beauty began to rise. Úrsula, almost blind at the time, was the only person who was sufficiently calm to identify the nature of that determined wind and she left the sheets to the mercy of the light as she watched Remedios the Beauty waving good-bye in the midst of the flapping sheets that rose up with her, abandoning with her the environment of beetles and dahlias and passing through the air with her as four o’clock in the afternoon came to an end, and they were lost forever with her in the upper atmosphere where not even the highest-flying birds of memory could reach her.","As she spoke, Fernanda felt a pleasant breeze full of light that snatched the blanket from her hands and tossed it into the sky. Amaranta felt a chill down her spine and clung to the blanket to avoid falling, just as Remedios the Beauty ascended. Úrsula, nearly blind at that time, was the only one who calmly recognized the true nature of the irresistible breeze and let the blankets fly as she watched Remedios the Beauty waving her final goodbye. In the flickering light of the blankets rising with her, there was also the scent of scorpions and peonies, all following her in the atmosphere that ended at four in the afternoon, and all vanished with her forever in the high air where even the highest-flying birds never beat their wings.",16.594,15.894,"Beautiful Remedios had just finished speaking when Fernanda heard a slight breeze billow and open the sheets in her hand. Amaranta felt a mysterious shiver in the lace of her petticoats and had to cling tightly to the sheet to avoid falling to the ground. Because at that moment, Beautiful Remedios' feet had lifted off the ground, and she had started to fly. At that time, Ursula, who was almost completely blind, was the only one who understood what this distinct breeze was, and she let go of the edges of the sheets and began to watch Beautiful Remedios wave among the fluttering sheets as she ascended with them. The sheets and Beautiful Remedios rose among the dahlias and cicadas, and by four o'clock, they had disappeared at a height unreachable even by the highest-flying birds.",10.674,9.652,"She had just said it, when Fernanda felt a delicate wind of light snatch the sheets from her hands and spread them out in all their breadth. Amaranta felt a mysterious tremor in the lace of her petticoats and tried to grab the sheet to avoid falling, at the moment when Remedios the Beautiful began to rise. Úrsula, almost blind by then, was the only one who had the composure to identify the nature of that irreparable wind, and she let the sheets be at the mercy of the light, watching Remedios the Beautiful, who was waving goodbye to her, amidst the dazzling flutter of the sheets that rose with her, that left with her the air of beetles and dahlias, and passed with her through the air where four in the afternoon ended, and were lost with her forever in the high airs where not even the highest birds of memory could reach her.",33.619,33.124
550,"The outsiders, of course, thought that Remedios the Beauty had finally succumbed to her irrevocable fate of a queen bee and that her family was trying to save her honor with that tale of levitation. Fernanda, burning with envy, finally accepted the miracle, and for a long time she kept on praying to God to send her back her sheets. Most people believed in the miracle and they even lighted candles and celebrated novenas. Perhaps there might have been talk of nothing else for a long time if the barbarous extermination of the Aurelianos had not replaced amazement with honor. Although he had never thought of it as an omen, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had foreseen the tragic end of his sons in a certain way. When Aureliano Serrador and Aureliano Arcaya, the two who arrived during the tumult, expressed a wish to stay in Macondo, their father tried to dissuade them. He could not understand what they were going to do in a town that had been transformed into a dangerous place overnight. But Aureliano Centeno and Aureliano Triste, backed by Aureliano Segundo. gave them work in their businesses. Colonel Aureliano Buendía had reasons that were still very confused and were against that determination. When he saw Mr. Brown in the first automobile to reach Macondo—an orange convertible with a horn that frightened dogs with its bark—the old soldier grew indignant with the servile excitement of the people and he realized that something had changed in the makeup of the men since the days when they would leave their wives and children and toss a shotgun on their shoulders to go off to war. The local authorities, after the armistice of Neerlandia, were mayors without initiative, decorative judges picked from among the peaceful and tired Conservatives of Macondo. “This is a regime of wretches,” Colonel Aureliano Buendía would comment when he saw the barefoot policemen armed with wooden clubs pass. “We fought all those wars and all of it just so that we didn’t have to paint our houses blue.” When the banana company arrived, however, the local functionaries were replaced by dictatorial foreigners whom Mr. Brown brought to live in the electrified chicken yard so that they could enjoy, as he explained it, the dignity that their status warranted and so that they would not suffer from the heat and the mosquitoes and the countless discomforts and privations of the town. The old policemen were replaced by hired assassins with machetes. Shut up in his workshop, Colonel Aureliano Buendía thought about those changes and for the first time in his quiet years of solitude he was tormented by the definite certainty that it had been a mistake not to have continued the war to its final conclusion. During that time a brother of the forgotten Colonel Magnífico Visbal was taking his seven-year-old grandson to get a soft drink at one of the pushcarts on the square and because the child accidentally bumped into a corporal of police and spilled the drink on his uniform, the barbarian cut him to pieces with his machete, and with one stroke he cut off the head of the grandfather as he tried to stop him. The whole town saw the decapitated man pass by as a group of men carried him to his house, with a woman dragging the head along by its hair, and the bloody sack with the pieces of the child.","The strangers naturally thought that Remedios the Beauty had transformed according to her predestined fate as the queen bee, and her family had tried to salvage their honor with the myth that she had flown away on her own. Fernanda was extremely jealous, but eventually accepted the bizarre story, and for a long time afterward continued to pray for the return of the blankets. Everyone believed in the miraculous story and they all burned incense and prayed. Perhaps no one would have talked about anything else for a long time if it hadn't been for the brutal massacre of Colonel Aureliano Buendía's sons, which turned astonishment into horror! Although he had never spoken his prediction out loud, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had somehow foreseen the tragic end of his sons. When Aureliano Serrador and Aureliano Arcaya expressed their desire to stay in Macondo, their father tried to dissuade them. He couldn't understand what they would do in a village that had turned dangerous overnight. But Aureliano Centeno and Aureliano Triste, supported by Aureliano Segundo, took them into their business. Colonel Aureliano Buendía had many mixed reasons for not agreeing with that decision. Ever since he saw Mr. Brown in the first automobile to arrive in Macondo—a bright orange car with a horn that terrified the dogs, making them bark furiously—the old soldier had been annoyed by the villagers' obsequiousness and realized that something had changed in human dignity since he had left his family, shouldered his rifle, and gone to war. After the Neclandia truce agreement, the local authorities had become mayors without initiative, judges in name only, chosen from among the tired and gentle conservatives of Macondo. ""This is a regime of hungry devils,"" Colonel Aureliano Buendía commented when he saw the barefoot policemen with their batons walking by. ""How many times have we risen up in war just so they wouldn't make us whitewash our own houses."" However, when the banana company arrived, the local officials were replaced by strange functionaries brought in by Mr. Brown to live in the communal housing, the ""electric chicken coop,"" so that they could enjoy—according to his explanation—the honor befitting their positions and not suffer the heat, mosquitoes, and countless hardships of the people. The old policemen were replaced by sugarcane-cutting murderers. Buried in his workshop, Colonel Aureliano Buendía pondered these changes, and for the first time in his years of silent solitude, he wrestled with the firm conviction that not continuing the war to the end had been a mistake. During those days, a forgotten brother of Colonel Magnífico Visbal took his seven-year-old nephew to drink a soda at a street vendor's stand in the square. Unfortunately, the child bumped into a police sergeant and spilled the soda on his clothes. The savage sergeant immediately drew his knife and hacked the child into pieces, and when the grandfather tried to intervene, he was beheaded. The entire village witnessed the old man being carried home headless, while a woman followed, holding the severed head by the hair and carrying the blood-soaked sack containing the child's body.",25.747,25.605,"Of course, the outsiders did not believe what was told and thought that Beautiful Remedios had succumbed to the inevitable fate of the queen bees, and that her family was trying to save her honor by fabricating this tale of flight. Driven mad by jealousy, Fernanda finally had to accept this miracle. In the meantime, she did not forget to pray and ask God to send her sheets back. Most of the people of Macondo believed in miracles. They even lit candles and held prayer ceremonies. This event would have been talked about for a long time, but the barbaric slaughter of the Aurelianos replaced astonishment with horror. Colonel Aureliano Buendia, although he had never seen a definite sign, had foreseen the tragic ends of his sons. When his two sons, Aureliano Serrador and Aureliano Arcaya, who had come along with those flocking to Macondo, said they wanted to stay in Macondo, their father tried to dissuade them. He couldn't understand what his sons were doing in this town, which had become a dangerous place overnight. However, Aureliano Centeno and Aureliano Triste, supported by Aureliano Segundo, gave them work. Colonel Aureliano Buendia opposed this decision, saying that they were not yet able to think clearly. Especially when he saw Mister Brown in the orange car with a canopy, scaring the dogs with the horn of the first automobile to arrive in Macondo, and witnessed the people running around with a slave-like excitement, the old soldier went mad with rage. He realized that since the days when men left their wives and children and went to war with rifles on their shoulders, people's morals and structures had changed. After the Treaty of Neerlandia, the mayors were always figureheads, lacking initiative, chosen from among the docile and weary Conservatives of Macondo. Whenever Colonel Aureliano Buendia saw the barefoot policemen with their wooden batons, he would say, ""This is a regime of the miserable."" ""A bunch of slackers have gathered,"" he would say. ""We fought and worked so hard just to avoid painting our houses blue,"" he would say. However, after the banana company set foot in Macondo, the local officials were replaced by foreigners with dictatorial aspirations. According to Mister Brown, they were placed in an area surrounded by electric chicken wire to ensure they gained the respect their positions required and were not disturbed by the heat, mosquitoes, countless discomforts, and deprivations in the town. The old policemen were replaced by hired killers armed with machetes used for cutting cane. Colonel Aureliano Buendia had shut himself in his workshop, pondering these changes. For the first time during the years he spent buried in loneliness, he felt pain, horrified by these events that determined how wrong it was not to carry the war to the end, and he felt regret. While the Colonel was thinking about these things, the brother of Colonel Magnifico Zlisbal, who had long been forgotten, wanted to give sherbet to his seven-year-old grandson from one of the itinerant vendors roaming the field with their carts. The child accidentally bumped into a policeman and spilled the sherbet on the policeman's uniform. The barbarian brute chopped the child into pieces with the cleaver in his hand and with one blow, decapitated the grandfather who tried to stop him. While a few people were taking the dismembered man to his home, the entire town witnessed this incident. A woman was dragging the man's severed head by the hair and carrying the child's dismembered parts, which she had stuffed into a bloody sack, in her hand.",21.209,21.045,"The outsiders, of course, thought that Remedios the Beauty had finally succumbed to her irrevocable destiny as queen bee, and that her family was trying to save their honor with the tale of levitation. Fernanda, bitten by envy, ended up accepting the miracle, and for a long time continued to pray to God to return the sheets. The majority believed in the miracle, and candles were even lit and novenas prayed. Perhaps nothing else would have been talked about for a long time if the barbaric extermination of the Aurelianos had not replaced astonishment with horror.

He did not understand what they were going to do in a town that overnight had become a place of danger. But Aureliano Centeno and Aureliano Triste, supported by Aureliano Segundo, gave them work in their businesses. Colonel Aureliano Buendía had still very confused reasons for not sponsoring that decision. Since he saw Mr. Brown in the first car that arrived in Macondo —an orange convertible with a horn that scared the dogs with its honking—, the old warrior was outraged by the servile fuss of the people, and realized that something had changed in the nature of men since the times when they abandoned women and children and slung a shotgun over their shoulder to go to war. The local authorities, after the armistice of Neerlandia, were mayors without initiative, decorative judges, chosen among the peaceful and tired conservatives of Macondo.

The former policemen were replaced by machete-wielding thugs. Locked in the workshop, Colonel Aureliano Buendía thought about these changes, and for the first time in his silent years of solitude, he was tormented by the definite certainty that it had been a mistake not to continue the war to its ultimate consequences. In those days, a brother of the forgotten Colonel Magnífico Visbal took his seven-year-old grandson to have a refreshment at the carts in the square, and because the child accidentally bumped into a police corporal and spilled the refreshment on his uniform, the barbarian hacked him to pieces with a machete and decapitated the grandfather who tried to stop him with a single stroke.

553,"During the course of that week, at different places along the coast, his seventeen sons were hunted down like rabbits by invisible criminals who aimed at the center of their crosses of ash. Aureliano Triste was leaving the house with his mother at seven in the evening when a rifle shot came out of the darkness and perforated his forehead. Aureliano Centeno was found in the hammock that he was accustomed to hang up in the factory with an icepick between his eyebrows driven in up to the handle. Aureliano Serrador had left his girl friend at her parents’ house after having taken her to the movies and was returning through the well-lighted Street of the Turks when someone in the crowd who was never identified fired a revolver shot which knocked him over into a caldron of boiling lard. A few minutes later someone knocked at the door of the room where Aureliano Arcaya was shut up with a woman and shouted to him: “Hurry up, they’re killing your brothers.” The woman who was with him said later that Aureliano Arcaya jumped out of bed and opened the door and was greeted with the discharge of a Mauser that split his head open. On that night of death, while the house was preparing to hold a wake for the four corpses, Fernanda ran through the town like a madwoman looking for Aureliano Segundo, whom Petra Cotes had locked up in a closet, thinking that the order of extermination included all who bore the colonel’s name. She would not let him out until the fourth day, when the telegrams received from different places along the coast made it clear that the fury of the invisible enemy was directed only at the brothers marked with the crosses of ash. Amaranta fetched the ledger where she had written down the facts about her nephews and as the telegrams arrived she drew lines through the names until only that of the eldest remained. They remembered him very well because of the contrast between his dark skin and his green eyes. His name was Aureliano Amador and he was a carpenter, living in a village hidden in the foothills. After waiting two weeks for the telegram telling of his death, Aureliano Segundo sent a messenger to him in order to warn him, thinking that he might not know about the threat that hung over him. The emissary returned with the news that Aureliano Amador was safe. The night of the extermination two men had gone to get him at his house and had shot at him with their revolvers but they had missed the cross of ashes. Aureliano Amador had been able to leap over the wall of the courtyard and was lost in the labyrinth of the mountains, which he knew like the back of his hand thanks to the friendship he maintained with the Indians, from whom he bought wood. Nothing more was heard of him.","During that week, in different locations along the coastal region, seventeen of his children were targeted by invisible killers and shot at the mark on their foreheads as if they were rabbits. Aureliano Triste left his mother's house at seven in the evening when a shot from the darkness pierced his forehead. Aureliano Centeno died stiff on the hammock he usually tied in the factory, with an awl driven to the hilt between his eyebrows. Aureliano Serradoro was returning home from the cinema with his lover when, on the way back to Turkish Street, someone mingled in the crowd shot him with a revolver, causing him to collapse into a pan of boiling butter. A few minutes later, someone knocked on the door of the room where Aureliano Arcadio was sleeping with a woman and called out: ""Hurry up, they're killing your brothers out there."" The woman who was in the room with him later recounted that Aureliano Arcadio jumped out of bed, opened the door, and ran out, only to have his skull shattered by a burst of Mauser bullets. On that deadly night, as the family prepared candles for the wake of four corpses, Fernanda ran frantically around the village looking for Aureliano Segundo, who was being hidden in a wardrobe by Petra Cotes, convinced that the secret order to massacre was aimed at all those bearing the colonel's name. It wasn't until four days later, when telegrams received from various places along the coast made it clear that the invisible enemy's madness only targeted Aureliano's brothers with the cross mark on their foreheads, that Petra Cotes let him out. Amaranta searched through the small notebook where she recorded her nephews' names, crossing out each one as she received a death telegram, until only the eldest nephew remained. She remembered this nephew clearly because he had dark skin that contrasted with his large blue eyes. That was Aureliano Amador, a carpenter living in a small village deep in the forest. After two weeks of waiting without receiving any telegrams about him, Aureliano Segundo sent someone to warn him, fearing he was unaware of the danger hanging over his head. The messenger returned saying that Aureliano Amador had escaped harm. Two men had come looking for him at his house on the night of the massacre. They had shot at him, but missed the spot with the cross mark on his forehead. Aureliano Amador jumped over the yard fence and ran into the forest, which he knew like the back of his hand due to his timber trade with the indigenous people. Since then, there has been no further news of him.",20.785,20.574,"That week, in various places along the coastal region, the colonel's seventeen sons were shot like rabbits by unknown killers aiming at the ashen cross marks on their foreheads. Aureliano Triste was shot by a bullet fired in the dark that pierced through the middle of his forehead as he was leaving the house with his mother at seven in the evening. Aureliano Centeno was lying in his hammock at the factory, as usual. An ice axe was embedded between his eyebrows. After leaving the cinema with his lover, Aureliano Serrador dropped the girl off at her home and was walking through the brightly lit Turkish Street when someone from the crowd, whose identity could not be discerned, drew his gun and shot the young man in the forehead, causing him to fall into a boiling cauldron of pig fat. A few minutes later, the door of the room where Aureliano Arcaya had secluded himself with a woman was pounded on. Someone shouted, ""Get out, they are killing your brothers. "" According to the woman who was with him, Aureliano Arcaya jumped out of bed, and as soon as he opened the door, his head was shattered by the Mauser bullets that rained down on him. On that night when death was prowling, while the household was preparing to light candles and pray for the four dead, Fernanda was frantically running through the streets searching for Aureliano Segundo. However, Petra Cotes, thinking that everyone named after the colonel would be killed, had hidden Aureliano Segundo in a cupboard. From the telegrams coming from various places in the coastal region, it was understood that the wrath of the unseen enemy was directed only at the brothers with the cross mark on their foreheads, and for four days and four nights, Petra Cotes did not take Aureliano Segundo out of the cupboard. Amaranta took out the notebook in which she wrote information about her nephews and crossed out the names as telegrams arrived. Only the eldest remained. They remembered him very well because of the contrast between his very dark skin and his bright green eyes. His name was Aureliano Amador, he worked as a carpenter and lived in a village squeezed between the mountains. After waiting two weeks for the telegram that would bring news of his death, Aureliano Segundo sent a man to warn him, thinking he might not be aware of the danger looming over him. The man brought news that Aureliano Amador was alive. On the night of the massacre, two men had gone to his house, emptied their guns on him, but had missed the mark of the ashen cross. Aureliano Amador had jumped over the garden wall and escaped through the mountain crevices he knew like the back of his hand, befriending the Indians from whom he used to get wood. He was never heard from again.",29.464,29.304,"During the course of that week, in various places along the coast, his seventeen sons were hunted like rabbits by invisible criminals who aimed at the center of their ash crosses. Aureliano Triste was leaving his mother's house at seven in the evening when a rifle shot from the darkness pierced his forehead. Aureliano Centeno was found in the hammock he used to hang in the factory, with an ice pick stabbed to the hilt between his eyebrows. Aureliano Serrador had left his girlfriend at her parents' house after taking her to the movies, and was returning through the illuminated Calle de los Turcos when someone who was never identified among the crowd fired a revolver shot that knocked him into a cauldron of boiling lard. A few minutes later, someone knocked on the door of the room where Aureliano Arcaya was locked in with a woman, and shouted: ""Hurry up, they are killing your brothers."" The woman who was with him later recounted that Aureliano Arcaya jumped out of bed and opened the door, and was met with a Mauser volley that shattered his skull. That night of death, while the house was preparing to mourn the four corpses, Fernanda roamed the town like a madwoman looking for Aureliano Segundo, whom Petra Cotes had locked in a wardrobe believing that the extermination order included anyone bearing the colonel's name. She did not let him out until the fourth day, when the telegrams received from various places along the coast made it clear that the invisible enemy's fury was directed only against the brothers marked with ash crosses. Amaranta searched for the account book where she had noted the nephews' details, and as the telegrams arrived, she crossed out names until only the eldest remained. They remembered him well for the contrast of his dark skin with his large green eyes. His name was Aureliano Amador, he was a carpenter, and he lived in a remote village in the foothills of the mountains. After waiting two weeks for the telegram of his death, Aureliano Segundo sent an emissary to warn him, thinking he was unaware of the threat hanging over him. The emissary returned with the news that Aureliano Amador was safe. The night of the extermination, two men had gone to his house and emptied their revolvers at him, but they had not hit the ash cross. Aureliano Amador managed to jump over the backyard fence and disappeared into the labyrinths of the mountains, which he knew inch by inch thanks to his friendship with the Indians with whom he traded in wood. He had not been heard from again.",45.924,45.822
554,"Those were dark days for Colonel Aureliano Buendía. The president of the republic sent him a telegram of condolence in which he promised an exhaustive investigation and paid homage to the dead men. At his command, the mayor appeared at the services with four funeral wreaths, which he tried to place on the coffins, but the colonel ordered him into the street. After the burial he drew up and personally submitted to the president of the republic a violent telegram, which the telegrapher refused to send. Then he enriched it with terms of singular aggressiveness, put it in an envelope, and mailed it. As had happened with the death of his wife, as had happened to him so many times during the war with the deaths of his best friends, he did not have a feeling of sorrow but a blind and directionless rage, a broad feeling of impotence. He even accused Father Antonio Isabel of complicity for having marked his sons with indelible ashes so that they-could be identified by their enemies. The decrepit priest, who could no longer string ideas together and who was beginning to startle his parishioners with the wild interpretations he gave from the pulpit, appeared one afternoon at the house with the goblet in which he had prepared the ashes that Wednesday and he tried to anoint the whole family with them to show that they could be washed off with water. But the horror of the misfortune had penetrated so deeply that not even Fernanda would let him experiment on her and never again was a Buendía seen to kneel at the altar rail on Ash Wednesday.","These were truly dark days for Colonel Aureliano Buendía. The President of the Republic sent him a condolence telegram, promising to order a thorough investigation and to honor the memory of the deceased. Following the President's orders, the mayor brought four wreaths to the funeral and intended to place them on the coffins, but the Colonel had them put outside on the street. After the funeral, the Colonel drafted a harshly worded telegram and personally took it to the telegraph office for the President, but the telegraph operator refused to send it. So he wrote a few more lines with even harsher words and sent it in an envelope. Just like when his wife died, and the many deaths of dear friends during the war, the Colonel did not feel sorrow, but only a sense of helpless fatigue and blind madness. He even accused Father Antonio Isabel of colluding with the murderers because he had marked his children with a cross of indelible ash, making it easier for the enemies to identify them. This senile priest, who was no longer very lucid and had begun to frighten his flock with his rambling sermons, one afternoon came to the Colonel's house carrying a bowl of pre-mixed ash for marking the cross on Wednesdays, and insisted on calling the entire family to use the ash to mark a cross on their foreheads to prove that it could be washed off with plain water. But the horror of misfortune was so deeply ingrained that even Fernanda didn't pay attention to that act, and from then on, no one in the Buendía family was ever seen kneeling before the altar during the fourth weekly Ash Wednesday mass.",21.056,20.732,"Those days were dark days for Colonel Aureliano Buendia. The President sent a telegram expressing his condolences and promised that a wide-ranging investigation and inquiry would be launched. Again, by the President's order, the mayor bought four wreaths and attended the funeral. While trying to place the wreaths on the coffins, the colonel drove him away. After the funeral, he wrote a harsh telegram to the President and took it to the post office by hand. The telegraph operator reported that he could not send this. Upon this, the colonel put the telegram in an envelope, expanding and enriching it with personal attacks and insults, and mailed it. As in the case of his wife's death, and the deaths of his closest friends during the war, this time too, the emotion he felt was not sorrow, but a blind and aimless rage, a sense of helplessness. He even accused Father Antonio Isabel of being an accomplice to the murderers for marking his sons with identifying signs that helped their enemies recognize them. The senile priest, who could no longer organize his thoughts and bewildered the congregation with his nonsensical comments during his sermons, came home on that Wednesday when the children went to church, clutching the ash jar he had prepared, and attempted to mark the foreheads of the household members to prove that the ash would wash off. However, this disaster had instilled such terror in everyone that even Fernanda did not consent to this experiment. After that, it was never seen that anyone from the Buendia family knelt before the altar on Ash Wednesday before Easter.",18.1,17.713,"They were dark days for Colonel Aureliano Buendía.

555,"Colonel Aureliano Buendía did not recover his calm for a long time. He abandoned the manufacture of little fishes, ate with great difficulty, and wandered all through the house as if walking in his sleep, dragging his blanket and chewing on his quiet rage. At the end of three months his hair was ashen, his old waxed mustache poured down beside his colorless lips, but, on the other hand, his eyes were once more the burning coals that had startled those who had seen him born and that in other days had made chairs rock with a simple glance. In the fury of his torment he tried futilely to rouse the omens that had guided his youth along dangerous paths into the desolate wasteland of glory. He was lost, astray in a strange house where nothing and no one now stirred in him the slightest vestige of affection. Once he opened Melquíades’ room, looking for the traces of a past from before the war, and he found only rubble, trash, piles of waste accumulated over all the years of abandonment. Between the covers of the books that no one had ever read again, in the old parchments damaged by dampness, a livid flower had prospered, and in the air that had been the purest and brightest in the house an unbearable smell of rotten memories floated. One morning he found Úrsula weeping under the chestnut tree at the knees of her dead husband. Colonel Aureliano Buendía was the only inhabitant of the house who still did not see the powerful old man who had been beaten down by half a century in the open air. “Say hello to your father,” Úrsula told him.

He stopped making goldfish, had difficulty eating and drinking, and wandered around the house like a sleepwalker, dragging his cloak and simmering with a deep-seated anger. After three months, his hair turned completely white, his once well-groomed mustache now bristled and covered his pale lips, but on the contrary, his eyes once again shone brightly like two coals, terrifying anyone who saw him at birth and once making chairs spin when he looked at them. In that frenzied torment, Colonel Aureliano Buendía desperately sought in vain the omens that had led his youth down dangerous paths to the tragic desert of glory. He seemed lost, adrift in a strange house where no one and nothing evoked any feelings of affection in him. Once again, he opened Melquíades' room to search for traces of the past war, but found only piles of rubble, trash, and discarded items accumulated over years of neglect. On the covers of the leather-bound books that no one had opened, now moldy and green with mildew, in the space that was once the brightest and freshest in the house, there lingered the unbearable smell of rotting mattresses. One morning, he saw Úrsula sitting and crying under the chestnut tree, at the feet of her dead husband. Colonel Aureliano Buendía was the only person in the house who did not continue to see the robust old woman deteriorate over half a century of hardships.

But his eyes regained that fiery, coal-like intensity that had surprised those present at his birth and had made chairs shake with his gaze when he was a child. The Colonel, driven mad with pain and anger, tried in vain to revive the intuitions that had guided him through the swamps of fame and glory in his youth. He was utterly lost, left all alone in a house that felt completely foreign to him, where nothing and no one inside stirred even the slightest flicker of affection in his heart. Once, in the hope of finding a trace from the pre-war years, he opened Melquiades' room and was met with a heap of dust, filth, and debris accumulated from years of neglect. Among the covers of books that no one reads anymore, within the moldy manuscripts decayed from dampness, a flower of a leaden color tinged with purple had bloomed, and this room, which was once the brightest and most airy place in the house, had filled with a heavy air of decayed memories. One morning, the Colonel found Ursula under the chestnut tree, crying, clinging to the knees of her dead husband.

563,"IN THE BEWILDERMENT of her last years, Úrsula had had very little free time to attend to the papal education of José Arcadio, and the time came for him to get ready to leave for the seminary right away. Meme, his sister, dividing her time between Fernanda’s rigidity and Amaranta’s bitterness, at almost the same moment reached the age set for her to be sent to the nuns’ school, where they would make a virtuoso on the clavichord of her. Úrsula felt tormented by grave doubts concerning the effectiveness of the methods with which she had molded the spirit of the languid apprentice Supreme Pontiff, but she did not put the blame on her staggering old age or the dark clouds that barely permitted her to make out the shape of things, but on something that she herself could not really define and that she conceived confusedly as a progressive breakdown of time. “The years nowadays don’t pass the way the old ones used to,” she would say, feeling that everyday reality was slipping through her hands. In the past, she thought, children took a long time to grow up. All one had to do was remember all the time needed for José Arcadio, the elder, to go away with the gypsies and all that happened before he came back painted like a snake and talking like an astronomer, and the things that happened in the house before Amaranta and Arcadio forgot the language of the Indians and learned Spanish. One had to see only the days of sun and dew that poor José Arcadio Buendía went through under the chestnut tree and all the time weeded to mourn his death before they brought in a dying Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who after so much war and so much suffering from it was still not fifty years of age. In other times, after spending the whole day making candy animals, she had more than enough time for the children, to see from the whites of their eyes that they needed a dose of castor oil. Now, however, when she had nothing to do and would go about with José Arcadio riding on her hip from dawn to dusk, this bad kind of time compelled her to leave things half done. The truth was that Úrsula resisted growing old even when she had already lost count of her age and she was a bother on all sides as she tried to meddle in everything and as she annoyed strangers with her questions as to whether they had left a plaster Saint Joseph to be kept until the rains were over during the days of the war. No one knew exactly when she had begun to lose her sight. Even in her later years, when she could no longer get out of bed, it seemed that she was simply defeated by decrepitude, but no one discovered that she was blind. She had noticed it before the birth of José Arcadio. At first she thought it was a matter of a passing debility and she secretly took marrow syrup and put honey on her eyes, but quite soon she began to realize that she was irrevocably sinking into the darkness, to a point where she never had a clear notion of the invention of the electric light, for when they put in the first bulbs she was only able to perceive the glow. She did not tell anyone about it because it would have been a public recognition of her uselessness. She concentrated on a silent schooling in the distances of things and peoples voices, so that she would still be able to see with her memory what the shadows of her cataracts no longer allowed her to. Later on she was to discover the unforeseen help of odors, which were defined in the shadows with a strength that was much more convincing than that of bulk and color, and which saved her finally from the shame of admitting defeat. In the darkness of the room she was able to thread a needle and sew a buttonhole and she knew when the milk was about to boil. She knew with so much certainty the location of everything that she herself forgot that she was blind at times. On one occasion Fernanda had the whole house upset because she had lost her wedding ring, and Úrsula found it on a shelf in the children’s bedroom. Quite simply, while the others were going carelessly all about, she watched them with her four senses so that they never took her by surprise, and after some time she discovered that every member of the family, without realizing it, repeated the same path every day, the same actions, and almost repeated the same words at the same hour. Only when they deviated from meticulous routine did they run the risk of losing something. So when she heard Fernanda all upset be cause she had lost her ring, Úrsula remembered that the only thing different that she had done that day was to put the mattresses out in the sun because Meme had found a bedbug the might before. Since the children had been present at the fumigation, Úrsula figured that Fernanda had put the ring in the only place where they could not reach it: the shelf. Fernanda, on the other hand, looked for it in vain along the paths of her everyday itinerary without knowing that the search for lost things is hindered by routine habits and that is why it is so difficult to find them.","In the tumultuous recent years, Úrsula had very little free time to take care of José Arcadio's studies to become a Pope. When he needed to urgently prepare for exams, Meme, his sister, who grew up between Fernanda's harshness and Amaranta's bitterness, had also reached the age to enter the convent school to be trained as a small organ artist. Úrsula was very worried and doubtful about the effectiveness of the methods used to cultivate the future Pope's lagging academic spirit, but she did not blame her own senility or her clouded eyes that almost prevented her from clearly seeing the shapes of objects; instead, she attributed it to something she couldn't precisely identify but misunderstood as an increasing waste of time. "" Years now are not like the years before,"" she often said, feeling her daily tasks slipping out of her grasp. She thought: children used to grow up much slower. She only needed to recall the time it took for José Arcadio, her eldest son, to follow the gypsies and everything that happened before he returned, tattooed like a snake and speaking like an astrologer, and all the events in the house before Amaranta and Arcadio stopped speaking the Indian dialect to learn Spanish; she only needed to remember the serene, sunlit afternoons when the poor José Arcadio Buendía suffered under the chestnut tree, and all the sorrowful events before they brought her a dying Colonel Aureliano Buendía, despite all the wars and suffering she endured for him, and yet she was still not fifty years old. In the past, after spending the whole day making animal-shaped candies, she still had time to care for her children and look into their eyes to know if they were sick and needed a bottle of oil. But now, with nothing to do and José Arcadio riding on her back, she wandered from dawn till late at night, this bad kind of time forced her to leave her work unfinished. In fact, Úrsula resisted old age even when she couldn't remember her own age and hobbled around everywhere, trying to participate in everything, and teasing strangers with questions like whether during the war a plaster statue of Saint Joseph was sent to this house for the family to take care of during the rainy season. No one knew exactly when she became blind. Even in her final years when she was bedridden, everyone thought she was bedridden due to old age, not realizing she was blind. She had noticed it before José Arcadio was born. At first, she thought her eyes were just mildly sore, so she secretly drank tiger bone liquor and applied honey to her eyes, but soon she realized her vision was irreparably deteriorating to the point where she never had a clear concept of electric lights, because when the first bulbs were installed, she could only perceive a faint glow. She didn't tell anyone because doing so would mean publicly admitting her incapacity. She quietly learned to distinguish the distances of objects and the voices of each person, to continue seeing with her memory when her eyes had completely failed. Later, she unexpectedly discovered that the sense of taste helped her identify objects in the dim darkness better than shapes and colors, and they helped her permanently escape the shame of being a burden. In the darkness of her room, she could thread a needle and sew buttonholes, and know when the milk pot was about to boil. She remembered the position of every object in the house so clearly that she sometimes forgot she was blind. Once, Fernanda caused an uproar in the house because her wedding ring went missing, yet Úrsula found it on a shelf in the children's room. While everyone was moving around the house, she silently stretched her four senses to monitor them to avoid being surprised, and after a while, she discovered that everyone in this family repeated the same paths, the same tasks, and even the same phrases at the same times every day without realizing it. Only when they didn't follow that meticulous routine could something be lost. So when she heard Fernanda panic about losing the ring, Úrsula remembered that the only unusual thing Fernanda did that day was to air out the children's mats because Meme had caught a bedbug the night before. Since the children also participated in the cleaning, Úrsula thought Fernanda had placed the ring on the high shelf, the only place they couldn't reach. In contrast, Fernanda only searched the usual places she frequented daily, not realizing that the habit of daily routine hindered the search for the lost item, causing her to waste so much effort.",20.273,20.169,"In the bewilderment of her later years, Ursula didn't have much opportunity to raise Jose Arcadio in a manner befitting a Pope, and in the blink of an eye, the time came for the child to enter the seminary. His sister Meme, meanwhile, spent her days caught between Fernanda's rigidity and Amaranta's bitterness, and reached the age to attend the convent school. At this school, they would train her to become a piano virtuoso. Ursula couldn't quite determine whether the methods she used to shape and mold the soul of the papal candidate were effective. Nevertheless, she did not accept that she hadn't been able to devote enough attention to Jose Arcadio because she was now very old, barely able to move around, or unable to see her surroundings clearly due to the cataracts over her eyes; if there was any flaw in the child's upbringing, she believed it stemmed from the corruption of the times they lived in. As I hear that daily realities and events slip away from my grasp, ""Years don't pass like they used to nowadays,"" she was saying. Ursula used to think that it took a long time for children to grow up. To prove this thought, it was enough for her to remember the past of her own children. How much time had passed since his eldest son, Jose Arcadio, left with the gypsies. How many things had happened until Jose Arcadio returned, covered in snake-like mottled paints, speaking like an astronomer. How many changes had occurred in the house until Amaranta and Arcadio forgot the Indian language and learned Spanish. Poor Jose Arcadio Buendia, how many times had he sat under the chestnut tree, baking in the sun, getting soaked by dew drops. They had mourned for a long time thinking Colonel Aureliano Buendia was dead, but when the colonel was finally brought back in a critically wounded state, they saw that despite all the years filled with wars and suffering, the colonel was not even fifty yet. In the past, Ursula would spend her entire day making animal-shaped sweets, yet she would still find time to take care of the children, looking into their eyes and determining when they needed castor oil. However, now she had no work or occupation, she could wander around from morning till night with Jose Arcadio leaning on her hip, but time had become so corrupted that every task she started remained unfinished. The truth was different, of course: although Ursula had lost track of her own age, she could not accept that she had grown old, wanting to meddle in everything and unsettling those around her, disturbing the peace by asking strangers who came to the house if they had left a statue of a saint there to be picked up after the rainy season during the war. No one knew for sure when Ursula's eyes had started to fail. Even in the years when she was so frail that she couldn't get out of bed, everyone thought she was bedridden because she was physically weak, not realizing she was blind. Ursula had noticed this even before Jose Arcadio was born. At first, she thought the defect in her eyes was a temporary result of fatigue, so without letting anyone know, she boiled bones and drank their marrow, and applied honey to her eyes. However, he soon realized that this was not something temporary, but that he was being constantly engulfed in darkness. The deterioration in her eyesight reached such a point that she couldn't fully grasp even an invention like the electric bulb, because when the electricity was turned on, Ursula's eyes could only perceive a faint light. Ursula didn't mention this to anyone, because once people realized she couldn't see, they would be convinced that she had become useless. To see the things obscured by the curtain that had fallen over her eyes with the help of her memory, Ursula firmly imprinted in her mind where objects were placed, the distances between them, and people's voices. Later, she found an unexpected helper. In the dark world, smells became more defining than the color and mass of objects. By distinguishing smells, Ursula freed herself from the shame of admitting that she had succumbed to nature. In the darkness of her room, she could thread a needle and sew on a button, and she could tell when the milk was about to boil. She knew the location of everything with such precision that sometimes she forgot she was blind. Once, Fernanda lost her engagement ring, turned the house upside down, couldn't find it, but Ursula found the ring on a shelf in the children's bedroom. The reason was simple. While the others wandered around the house without paying attention to what they were doing, Ursula mobilized all her senses with full force to avoid being caught off guard. Soon, she noticed that everyone in the family unconsciously performed the same actions every day, followed the same paths, and repeated almost the same words at nearly the same times. It was only when they deviated from their daily routines that they risked losing something. So when Fernanda lost her ring and panicked, Ursula remembered that on that day, unlike usual, she had entered the children's room, found a bedbug in Meme's bed, and put the mattresses out in the sun. Since the children were in the room, she guessed that Fernanda might have placed her ring on the shelf, the only place they couldn't reach. However, Fernanda was searching in vain in the places she frequented daily and didn't realize that daily habits made it harder to find lost items.",16.123,15.995,"In the bewilderment of recent years, Úrsula had very few breaks to attend to José Arcadio's papal formation, when he had to be hastily prepared to go to the seminary. Meme, his sister, divided between Fernanda's rigidity and Amaranta's bitterness, reached almost at the same time the age to be sent to the nuns' school where they would make her a virtuoso of the clavichord. Úrsula was tormented by serious doubts about the effectiveness of the methods with which she had tempered the spirit of the languid apprentice of the Supreme Pontiff, but she did not blame her stumbling old age or the clouds that barely allowed her to glimpse the outline of things, but rather something she herself could not define but vaguely conceived as a progressive wear of time. "" The years now don't come like they used to,"" she would say, feeling that everyday reality was slipping through her fingers. Before, she thought, children took a long time to grow up. One only had to remember all the time it took for José Arcadio, the eldest, to go with the gypsies, and everything that happened before he returned painted like a snake and speaking like an astronomer, and the things that happened in the house before Amaranta and Arcadio forgot the Indian language and learned Spanish. You had to see the sun and rain endured by poor José Arcadio Buendía under the chestnut tree, and all the mourning for his death before they carried a dying Colonel Aureliano Buendía who, after so much war and suffering for him, was still not fifty years old. In another era, after spending all day making little caramel animals, she still had time to take care of the children, to see in the whites of their eyes that they needed a potion of castor oil. But now, when she had nothing to do and walked around with José Arcadio straddling her hip from dawn to night, the poor quality of time forced her to leave things unfinished. The truth was that Úrsula resisted aging even though she had lost count of her age, and she was in the way everywhere, and tried to get involved in everything, and annoyed visitors with questions about whether they had left a plaster Saint Joseph in the house during the war to keep it safe from the rain. Nobody knew for sure when she started losing her sight. Even in her last years, when she could no longer get out of bed, it simply seemed that she was overcome by decrepitude, but no one discovered that she was blind. She had noticed it before José Arcadio's birth. At first, she thought it was a temporary weakness and secretly took marrow syrup and put honey in her eyes, but very soon she became convinced that she was sinking irretrievably into darkness, to the point that she never had a clear notion of the invention of electric light, because when the first bulbs were installed, she only managed to perceive the glow. She didn't tell anyone, as it would have been a public acknowledgment of her uselessness. She committed to a silent learning of the distances of things and people's voices, to keep seeing with her memory when the shadows of cataracts no longer allowed her to. Later, she discovered the unexpected help of smells, which defined themselves in the darkness with a force much more convincing than volumes and color, and they definitively saved her from the shame of surrender. In the darkness of the room, she could thread a needle and sew a buttonhole, and she knew when the milk was about to boil. She knew so surely the place of each thing that she sometimes forgot she was blind. Once, Fernanda stirred up the house because she had lost her wedding ring, and Úrsula found it on a shelf in the children's bedroom. Simply, while the others wandered carelessly everywhere, she watched them with her four senses so they would never catch her by surprise, and after some time, she discovered that each family member repeated the same routes, the same acts, and almost the same words at the same time every day. Only when they deviated from that meticulous routine did they risk losing something. So when she heard Fernanda distressed because she had lost the ring, Úrsula remembered that the only different thing she had done that day was to sun the children's mats because Meme had found a bedbug the night before. Since the children attended the cleaning, Úrsula thought that Fernanda had placed the ring in the only place they couldn't reach: the shelf. Fernanda, on the other hand, only searched in the paths of her daily itinerary, not knowing that the search for lost things is hindered by routine habits, and that is why it is so hard to find them.",43.643,43.586

569,"She was sure of it. But that day she began to realize something that no one had noticed and it was that with the passage of the year the sun imperceptibly changed position and those who sat on the porch had to change their position little by little without being aware of it. From then on Úrsula had only to remember the date in order to know exactly where Amaranta was sitting. Even though the trembling of her hands was more and more noticeable and the weight of her feet was too much for her, her small figure was never seen in so many places at the same time. She was almost as diligent as when she had the whole weight of the house on her shoulders. Nevertheless, in the impenetrable solitude of decrepitude she had such clairvoyance as she examined the most insignificant happenings in the family that for the first time she saw clearly the truths that her busy life in former times had prevented her from seeing. Around the time they were preparing José Arcadio for the seminary she had already made a detailed recapitulation of life in the house since the founding of Macondo and had completely changed the opinion that she had always held of her descendants. She realized that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had not lost his love for the family because he had been hardened by the war, as she had thought before, but that he had never loved anyone, not even his wife Remedios or the countless one-night women who had passed through his life, and much less his sons. She sensed that he had fought so many wars not out of idealism, as everyone had thought, nor had he renounced a certain victory because of fatigue, as everyone had thought, but that he had won and lost for the same reason, pure and sinful pride. She reached the conclusion that the son for whom she would have given her life was simply a man incapable of love. One night when she was carrying him in her belly she heard him weeping. It was such a definite lament that José Arcadio Buendía woke up beside her and was happy with the idea that his son was going to be a ventriloquist. Other people predicted that he would be a prophet. She, on the other hand, shuddered from the certainty that the deep moan was a first indication of the fearful pig tail and she begged God to let the child die in her womb. But the lucidity of her old age allowed her to see, and she said so many times, that the cries of children in their mothers’ wombs are not announcements of ventriloquism or a faculty for prophecy but an unmistakable sign of an incapacity for love. The lowering of the image of her son brought out in her all at once all the compassion that she owed him. Amaranta, however, whose hardness of heart frightened her, whose concentrated bitterness made her bitter, suddenly became clear to her in the final analysis as the most tender woman who had ever existed, and she understood with pitying clarity that the unjust tortures to which she had submitted Pietro Crespi had not been dictated by a desire for vengeance, as everyone had thought, nor had the slow martyrdom with which she had frustrated the life of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez been determined by the gall of her bitterness, as everyone had thought, but that both actions had been a mortal struggle between a measureless love and an invincible cowardice, and that the irrational fear that Amaranta had always had of her own tormented heart had triumphed in the end. It was during that time that Úrsula, began to speak Rebeca’s name, bringing back the memory of her with an old love that was exalted by tardy repentance and a sudden admiration, coming to understand that only she, Rebeca, the one who had never fed of her milk but only of the earth of the land and the whiteness of the walls, the one who did not carry the blood of her veins in hers but the unknown blood of the strangers whose bones were still clocing in their grave. Rebeca, the one with an impatient heart, the one with a fierce womb, was the only one who bad the unbridled courage that Úrsula had wanted for her line.","You are right. From that day on, she began to notice something that no one else had realized, which was that the sun gradually shifted its position with each season of the year, causing those who usually sat in the corridor to gradually change their seats without even knowing it. From that day, Úrsula only needed to remember the dates to know exactly where Amaranta would be sitting. Although her hands trembled more and her legs increasingly felt like they couldn't lift, never before had people seen her familiar figure appear in so many places at once. She was almost as agile as when she managed all the household chores. However, in the unfathomable loneliness of old age, she was still sharp enough to notice the smallest changes in the family, so for the first time, she recognized truths that her duties had previously prevented her from seeing. During the time she was preparing José Arcadio for his exams, she summarized the family's life from the day the village of Macondo was founded and completely changed her opinion about her descendants. She realized that it wasn't because of the brutal war that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had lost his family affection, but rather that he had never loved anyone, not even Remedios—his wife, nor the countless women he had spent nights with, and certainly not his children. She understood that he had participated in so many wars not out of a passion for ideals as everyone thought, and he had abandoned visible victories not just out of fatigue as people believed, but because his victories and defeats were driven by one cause: sheer sinful pride. She concluded that the son she had given birth to was a man incapable of love. One night, while she was still pregnant, she had heard him cry. It was a clear, mournful wail that woke José Arcadio Buendía beside her, who then felt amused by the thought that the child would be a ventriloquist. Others guessed he would be a prophet, but she shuddered at the clear thought that the deep roar was the first sign of a terrible pig's tail, and she prayed that he would die in the womb. But the clarity of old age helped her realize that the cry of the child in the womb was not a sign of ventriloquism or prophetic ability, but an unmistakable sign of an incapacity for love, and she repeated this many times. This unfavorable assessment of her son suddenly stirred all her compassion. In contrast, Amaranta, whose emotional rigidity horrified her, whose bitterness concentrated in her feelings saddened her, through the final trial revealed herself to be an extraordinarily gentle woman. She understood with regrettable clarity that Amaranta's unreasonable torment of Pietro Crespi was not out of a desire for revenge as everyone thought, nor was her persistent torment that disappointed Colonel Gerineldo Márquez's life due to her own bitterness as people believed, but rather both actions were a life-and-death struggle between boundless love and an insurmountable weakness, and ultimately, Amaranta's irrational fear triumphed over her tormented heart. At that moment, Úrsula began to call for Rebeca, mentioning her with an increased affection born of belated remorse and unexpected admiration, understanding that only Rebeca, the child who did not nurse from her but grew up eating earth, earth and lime from the four walls, was the child in her bloodline who did not carry her blood but carried the blood of strangers whose bones still groaned in their graves, only Rebeca, the girl with a restless heart, a large stomach, and boundless courage, was the one Úrsula had longed for in her lineage.",17.782,17.628,"Ursula was confident in the truth of what she said. That day, she sensed something that the others did not notice. According to the season, the sun was changing its position, and those sitting on the veranda were unknowingly adjusting their positions according to the sun. After that, Ursula began to figure out where Amaranta was sitting by thinking about which month and which day it was. Even though her hands were trembling more noticeably each day and she could barely lift her feet to walk, Ursula's petite body roamed every corner of the house. She was as active and industrious as she had been when she shouldered almost all the burden of the house. In the insurmountable loneliness of old age, Ursula could scrutinize family events in every detail, now appreciating the truths she couldn't see in the old days amidst a thousand tasks. At the time they were preparing to send Jose Arcadio to the seminary, Ursula had summarized, compiled in detail, and completely changed her opinion about her children and grandchildren regarding the family's life from the founding of Macondo to that day. She realized that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had not, as she once thought, become hardened and detached from his family and family love during the years of war. She came to believe that the Colonel had never loved anyone, not his wife Remedios, nor the countless one-night women who entered his life, nor his sons, not in the slightest. Úrsula sensed that the Colonel had not fought all those wars for ideals, as everyone thought, nor had he given up on achieving definitive victory because he was exhausted, as everyone believed, but solely because of his pride, he had both won and lost. In the end, she concluded that her son, for whom she would not hesitate to give her life, was a man devoid of the ability to love. Ursula, when she was pregnant, had heard the child crying in her womb one night. The sound was so distinct that even Jose Arcadio Buendia, who was lying beside Ursula, woke up and was very happy, thinking their son would become a ventriloquist. However, the neighbors, upon hearing about this event, said that the child would become a prophet. Yet Ursula believed that this faint moaning, which she heard so deeply, was a sign of the pig's tail she always feared, and she prayed to God for the child to die in her womb. But after growing old and going through the experiences of many years, Ursula realized that the crying of children in the womb was not a sign of ventriloquism or a harbinger of prophecy, but an undeniable proof of the inability to love. When her son fell from grace, the feelings of affection and pity that Ursula had never felt the need to show him until that day surfaced in her heart. On the other hand, in the final analysis, it turned out that Amaranta, who frightened Ursula with her stone-heartedness and scared her with her deliberate malice, was the most compassionate, most loving woman in the world. Ursula saw with a broken heart that the torment Amaranta inflicted on Pietro Crespi was not, as everyone thought, out of a sense of revenge, nor was the stubbornness that poisoned Colonel Gerineldo Marquez's life, as everyone believed, due to malice, but rather it was the result of a deadly conflict between an unbounded love and an insurmountable fear. And Amaranta's fear of her own heart had ultimately outweighed all other emotions. Around that same time, Ursula began to speak frequently about Rebeca. He remembered her with a love exalted by belated regret and unexpected admiration, and saw that the impatient heart, fiery womb, and boundless courage that Ursula longed for in her own lineage were present only in Rebeca. He understood that Rebeca, who had not been nourished by Ursula's milk, who had grown up eating dirt and plaster, and who carried in her veins the blood of strangers whose bones rattled in their graves rather than Ursula's blood, was the only person who possessed all the qualities he longed for.",14.654,14.457,"For her, it was true. But that day she began to realize something that no one had discovered, and it was that over the course of the year the sun was imperceptibly changing position, and those who sat in the corridor had to gradually change places without noticing it. From then on, Úrsula only had to remember the date to know the exact place where Amaranta was sitting. Although the trembling of her hands was increasingly noticeable and she couldn't bear the weight of her feet, her tiny figure was never seen in so many places at the same time. She was almost as diligent as when she carried the entire weight of the house on her shoulders. However, in the impenetrable solitude of decrepitude, she had such clairvoyance to examine even the most insignificant events of the family, that for the first time she clearly saw the truths that her past occupations had prevented her from seeing. By the time they were preparing José Arcadio for the seminary, she had already made an infinitesimal recapitulation of the house's life since the founding of Macondo, and had completely changed her opinion of her descendants. She realized that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had not lost his affection for the family due to the hardening effects of war, as she had previously thought, but that he had never loved anyone, not even his wife Remedios or the countless one-night women who passed through his life, and much less his children. She glimpsed that he had not fought so many wars out of idealism, as everyone believed, nor had he renounced imminent victory out of exhaustion, as everyone believed, but that he had won and lost for the same reason, out of pure and sinful pride. She concluded that the son for whom she would have given her life was simply a man incapable of love. One night, when she had him in her womb, she heard him cry. It was such a defined lament that José Arcadio Buendía woke up beside her and rejoiced at the idea that the child was going to be a ventriloquist. Other people predicted he would be a seer. She, on the other hand, shuddered with the certainty that that deep bellow was the first indication of the dreaded pig's tail, and she prayed to God to let the child die in her womb. But the lucidity of decrepitude allowed her to see, and she repeated it many times, that the crying of children in the mother's womb is not a sign of ventriloquism or divinatory ability, but an unequivocal sign of incapacity for love. That devaluation of her son's image suddenly aroused all the compassion she owed him. Amaranta, on the other hand, whose hardness of heart frightened her, whose concentrated bitterness embittered her, was clarified in the final examination as the most tender woman who had ever existed, and she understood with pitiful clairvoyance that the unjust tortures she had subjected Pietro Crespi to were not dictated by a will for revenge, as everyone believed, nor was the slow martyrdom with which she frustrated the life of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez determined by the bad bile of her bitterness, as everyone believed, but that both actions had been a life-and-death struggle between a boundless love and an invincible cowardice, and that the irrational fear Amaranta always had of her own tormented heart had finally triumphed. It was around that time that Úrsula began to mention Rebeca, to evoke her with an old affection exalted by late repentance and sudden admiration, having understood that only she, Rebeca, who never fed on her milk but on the earth, the earth and the lime of the walls, who did not carry in her veins blood of her blood but the unknown blood of the unknown whose bones continued to cluck in the grave, Rebeca, the one with the impatient heart, the one with the unrestrained belly, was the only one who had the unbridled courage that Úrsula had wished for her lineage.",50.871,50.81

571,"In the house they simply thought that her mind was wandering, especially since the time she had begun walking about with her right arm raised like the Archangel Gabriel. Fernanda, however, realized that there was a sun of clairvoyance in the shadows of that wandering, for Úrsula could say without hesitation how much money had been spent in the house during the previous year. Amaranta had a similar idea one day as her mother was stirring a pot of soup in the kitchen and said all at once without knowing that they were listening to her that the corn grinder they had bought from the first gypsies and that had disappeared during the time before José Arcadio, had taken his sixty-five trips around the world was still in Pilar Ternera’s house. Also almost a hundred years old, but fit and agile in spite of her inconceivable fatness, which frightened children as her laughter had frightened the doves in other times, Pilar Ternera was not surprised that Úrsula was correct because her own experience was beginning to tell her that an alert old age can be more keen than the cards.","Everyone in the house thought the old lady was senile, especially since she always raised her right hand to the sky like Saint Gabriel whenever she walked. However, Fernanda noticed a sharp clarity hidden within the shadow of that senility; for instance, Úrsula could immediately state without hesitation the amount of money the whole family had spent in the past year. Amaranta had such a thought one day when her mother was carrying a pot of soup in the kitchen, and although she had no idea that everyone was listening, the old lady said that the corn mill bought from the first gypsies, the mill that had disappeared before José Arcadio wandered around the world sixty-five times, was still at Pilar Ternera's house, who had also lived nearly a hundred years but was still healthy and agile. Despite her oversized body that terrified the children just as her laughter once scared the pigeons, Pilar Ternera was not surprised by Úrsula's clarity, because her own experience had begun to show that an old age with a clear mind could be more reliable than fortune-telling.",19.619,19.003,"The household thought that he was starting to go senile. Especially when he started walking around with his right arm raised like the archangel Gabriel, this belief among the household members became even more reinforced. However, Fernanda noticed that a great sun of intuition was shining in the shadow of these meaningless wanderings. For instance, without any hesitation, Ursula could tell exactly how much money had been spent in the house the previous year, down to the last cent. One day, while Ursula was stirring soup in the kitchen, without knowing that Amaranta and Fernanda were listening to her, she mentioned that the corn mill they had bought from the first gypsies who came to Macondo, and which they had lost long before Jose Arcadio circled the world sixty-five times, was still in Pilar Ternera's house. Upon hearing this, Amaranta also believed that her mother had an extraordinary power of intuition. Pilar Ternera, who herself was nearing a hundred years old but remained vigorous and agile despite her incredible obesity, and who once scared pigeons with her laughter and now frightened children, was not at all surprised that Ursula's words turned out to be true. Because he knew from his own experiences that a meticulous old age reached much more accurate decisions than playing cards.",19.551,19.099,"In the house, they simply believed that she was raving, especially since she started walking around with her right arm raised, like the archangel Gabriel. Fernanda, however, realized that there was a sun of clairvoyance in the shadows of that delirium, as Úrsula could say without hesitation how much money had been spent in the house during the last year. Amaranta had a similar idea one day when her mother was stirring a pot of soup in the kitchen, and suddenly said, without knowing she was being heard, that the corn mill they bought from the first gypsies, which had disappeared before José Arcadio had circled the world sixty-five times, was still in Pilar Ternera's house. Also almost a centenarian, but whole and agile despite the inconceivable fatness that scared children as her laughter once scared pigeons, Pilar Ternera was not surprised by Úrsula's accuracy, because her own experience was beginning to indicate that an alert old age can be more accurate than the inquiries of cards.",48.697,48.454
572,"Nevertheless, when Úrsula realized that she had not had enough time to consolidate the vocation of José Arcadio, she let herself be disturbed by consternation. She began to make mistakes, trying to see with her eyes the things that intuition allowed her to see with greater clarity. One morning she poured the contents of an inkwell over the boy’s head thinking that it was rose water. She stumbled so much in her insistence in taking part in everything that she felt herself upset by gusts of bad humor and she tried to get rid of the shadows that were beginning to wrap her in a straitjacket of cobwebs. It was then that it occurred to her that her clumsiness was not the first victory of decrepitude and darkness but a sentence passed by time. She thought that previously, when God did not make the same traps out of the months and years that the Turks used when they measured a yard of percale, things were different. Now children not only grew faster, but even feelings developed in a different way. No sooner had Remedios the Beauty ascended to heaven in body and soul than the inconsiderate Fernanda was going about mumbling to herself because her sheets had been carried off. The bodies of the Aurelianos were no sooner cold in their graves than Aureliano Segundo had the house lighted up again, filled with drunkards playing the accordion and dousing themselves in champagne, as if dogs and not Christians had died, and as if that madhouse which had cost her so many headaches and so many candy animals was destined to become a trash heap of perdition. Remembering those things as she prepared José Arcadio’s trunk, Úrsula wondered if it was not preferable to lie down once and for all in her grave and let them throw the earth over her, and she asked God, without fear, if he really believed that people were made of iron in order to bear so many troubles and mortifications, and asking over and over she was stirring up her own confusion and she felt irrepressible desires to let herself go and scamper about like a foreigner and allow herself at last an instant of rebellion, that instant yearned for so many times and so many times postponed, putting her resignation aside and shitting on everything once and for all and drawing out of her heart the infinite stacks of bad words that she had been forced to swallow over a century of conformity.","However, when Úrsula realized there wasn't enough time to nurture José Arcadio's enthusiasm, she became panic-stricken and fearful. She began making mistakes by trying to see with her eyes what her instincts had always allowed her to see more clearly. One morning, she poured an entire bottle of ink over the boy's head, thinking it was a bottle of holy water. Because she wanted to meddle in everything, she caused so many conflicts that she became irritable and tried to escape the dark cloud surrounding her like a shroud of cobwebs. It was then that she thought her clumsy awkwardness was not the first victory of old age and darkness, but the failure of time. She thought that in the past, when God and the years had not yet set the same traps that the Turks used when measuring a yard of silk, everything was very different. Nowadays, not only do children grow up faster, but even emotions transform in a different way. Right after Remedios the Beauty ascended to heaven, Fernanda grumbled everywhere about how she had taken the bedspreads with her. When the Aureliano brothers had just been laid to rest, Aureliano Segundo invited a houseful of drunken guests, playing accordions and popping champagne as if the sheep of God had not just died but rather some dogs, acting as if the house of the mad, which had annoyed so many people and produced countless animal-shaped candies, was destined to become a dump filled with ruffians. While packing José Arcadio's trunk and recalling these things, Úrsula wondered if she should choose the path to eternal rest, have the earth packed tightly over her coffin, and then ask God without fear if He truly believed that humans were born as beasts to endure such cruel suffering. One question after another muddled her mind, making her want to jump out, dance wildly, and babble like a foreigner. Finally, she wanted to give herself a moment of rebellion, a moment she had longed for many times but had always submitted to reason, wanting to defecate on everything and unleash the entire stockpile of vulgar words she had suppressed for a century of constant appeasement.",16.597,16.337,"In this state of affairs, Ursula was horrified when she realized that she had not found enough time to prepare Jose Arcadio for his duty on the path of God, and she let herself go. Trying to see with her eyes the things she could discern better with her intuition, she started making mistakes - One morning, mistaking a large bottle of ink for rosewater, she poured it over Jose Arcadio's head. She was so persistent in meddling in everything that, in the end, her clumsiness disturbed her own peace, and she tried to free herself from the shadows that enveloped her like a straitjacket made of cobwebs. Ursula decided that this clumsiness was not the victory of old age and the darkness that clouded her eyes, but a judgment of time. She thought that everything was different in the times when the Turks measured cotton fabrics by the yard and God did not deceive people so much about months and years. However, in the present time, not only do children grow up faster, but emotions also change. As soon as beautiful Remedios flew to heaven, the emotionless, thoughtless, disrespectful Fernanda started lamenting not for the girl but for her flying sheets. Before the bodies of the Aurelianos had even cooled in their graves, Aureliano Segundo had redecorated the house with lights, filling it once again with drunken accordion players bathed in champagne. It was as if the dead were not Christians but stray dogs. It was as if the fate of this madhouse, which had cost Ursula so many headaches, so many cakes and sweets, was to decay and collapse, becoming a heap of rubbish. While Ursula was preparing Jose Arcadio's trunk, she was also thinking that it would be better to enter the grave and be covered with soil than to witness all of this. He was fearlessly rebelling against God, demanding an account, ""Do you think the people whose lives you have filled with so much trouble and misery are made of iron?"" The more he dwelled on this question, the more his mind became completely confused, and he felt an irresistible urge to leave and wander aimlessly like a stranger. He wanted to grant himself the right to rebel, even if just for a moment, in the end. He was burning with the desire to fulfill this longing, which he had postponed countless times, to mess everything up, to spill out all the harsh words and curses he had swallowed for the sake of avoiding unpleasantness for an entire century, and to unburden himself.",12.355,12.03,"However, when Úrsula realized that she hadn't had enough time to consolidate José Arcadio's vocation, she was stunned by consternation. She began to make mistakes, trying to see with her eyes the things that intuition allowed her to see more clearly. One morning she poured the contents of an inkwell over the child's head, thinking it was Florida water. She caused so many mishaps with her stubbornness to intervene in everything that she felt disturbed by bursts of bad temper, and she tried to shake off the darkness that was finally entangling her like a nightgown of cobwebs. It was then that she thought her clumsiness was not the first victory of decrepitude and darkness, but a flaw in time. She thought that before, when God didn't play the same tricks with months and years that the Turks did when measuring a yard of calico, things were different. Now not only did children grow faster, but even feelings evolved differently. No sooner had Remedios the Beauty ascended to heaven in body and soul, than the inconsiderate Fernanda was already grumbling in the corners because she had taken the sheets. No sooner had the bodies of the Aurelianos cooled in their graves, than Aureliano Segundo had the house lit up again, full of drunkards playing the accordion and soaking themselves in champagne, as if Christians hadn't died but dogs, and as if that madhouse that had cost so many headaches and so many little caramel animals, was destined to become a garbage dump of perdition. Remembering these things while they were packing José Arcadio's trunk, Úrsula wondered if it wouldn't be better to lie down in the grave once and for all and have the earth thrown over her, and she asked God, without fear, if He really thought people were made of iron to endure so much sorrow and mortification; and asking and asking, she stoked her own bewilderment, and felt an irrepressible desire to start ranting like a stranger, and to finally allow herself a moment of rebellion, the moment so often longed for and so often postponed of shoving resignation up her fundament and shitting on everything once and for all, and getting out of her heart the infinite heaps of bad words she had had to swallow in a whole century of conformity.",43.098,42.965

582,"Three months later Aureliano Segundo and Fernanda took Meme to school and came back with a clavichord, which took the place of the pianola. It was around that time that Amaranta started sewing her own shroud. The banana fever had calmed down. The old inhabitants of Macondo found themselves surrounded by newcomers and working hard to cling to their precarious resources of times gone by, but comforted in any case by the sense that they had survived a shipwreck. In the house they still had guests for lunch and the old routine was never really set up again until the banana company left years later. Nevertheless, there were radical changes in the traditional sense of hospitality because at that time it was Fernanda who imposed her rules. With Úrsula relegated to the shadows and with Amaranta absorbed In the work of her winding cloth, the former apprentice queen had the freedom to choose the guests and impose on them the rigid norms that her parents had taught her. Her severity made the house a redoubt of old customs in a town convulsed by the vulgarity with which the outsiders squandered their easy fortunes. For her, with no further questions asked, proper people were those who had nothing to do with the banana company. Even José Arcadio Segundo, her brother-in-law, was the victim of her discriminatory jealousy because during the excitement of the first days he gave up his stupendous fighting cocks again and took a job as foreman with the banana company.","Three months later, Aureliano Segundo and Fernanda took Meme to school and returned with a small organ, placing it where the automatic piano had been. At that time, Amaranta began sewing her own shroud. The fever surrounding the banana plantation had subsided. The native inhabitants of Macondo were pushed into a corner by the foreigners, struggling to maintain their meager old ways, but they were encouraged by the feeling that they had survived a shipwreck. Guests still came for lunch at the house, but in reality, the old habit was not reestablished until the Banana Company packed up and left a few years later. However, there were fundamental changes in the family's hospitality traditions, because that was when Fernanda took control of the household finances. Úrsula retreated into the shadows, and Amaranta spent her days fussing with mourning clothes and shrouds, so the younger sister who had learned to act like a queen now had the freedom to choose the guests and impose the strict rules she had learned from her parents. Fernanda's strictness kept the family adhering to their old habits in a town disrupted by the vices of the foreigners who had squandered their easily earned wealth. She openly stated that good people had nothing to do with the Banana Company.

On their way back, they brought a small piano instead of the lantern. At that time, Amaranta also began to sew her own shroud. The passion for bananas had lost its initial momentum. The old Macondo residents found themselves surrounded by newcomers. They had to work excessively to regain their past earnings. Even so, they saw themselves as the fortunate ones who had survived a shipwreck and were grateful for their situation. There was never a shortage of guests coming to dine at the Buendía house. The old order of the house could not be reestablished until years after the banana company left Macondo. There were significant changes in the usual concept of hospitality. Because at that time, it was Fernanda who had the final say at home. When Ursula withdrew into the shadows and Amaranta devoted herself to sewing her shroud, the former queen candidate was free to do as she pleased. She would choose and accept the guests she wanted and tried to forcibly impose the strict rules she had learned from her family on these guests.

584,"Such was the narrowness imposed in the house that Aureliano Segundo felt more comfortable at Petra Cotes’s. First, with the pretext of taking the burden off his wife, he transferred his parties. Then, with the pretext that the animals were losing their fertility, he transferred his barns and stables. Finally, with the pretext that it was cooler in his concubine’s house, he transferred the small office in which he handled his business. When Fernanda realized that she was a widow whose husband had still not died, it was already too late for things to return to their former state. Aureliano Segundo barely ate at home and the only appearances he put in, such as to sleep with his wife, were not enough to convince anyone. One night, out of carelessness, morning found him in Petra Cotes’s bed. Fernanda, contrary to expectations, did not reproach him in the least or give the slightest sigh of resentment, but on the same day she sent two trunks with his clothing to the house of his concubine. She sent them in broad daylight and with instructions that they be carried through the middle of the street so that everyone could see them, thinking that her straying husband would be unable to bear the shame and would return to the fold with his head hung low. But that heroic gesture was just one more proof of how poorly Fernanda knew not only the character of her husband but the character of a community that had nothing to do with that of her parents, for everyone who saw the trunks pass by said that it was the natural culmination of a story whose intimacies were known to everyone, and Aureliano Segundo celebrated the freedom he had received with a party that lasted for three days. To the greater disadvantage of his wife, as she was entering into a sad maturity with her somber long dresses, her old-fashioned medals, and her out-of-place pride, the concubine seemed to be bursting with a second youth, clothed in gaudy dresses of natural silk and with her eyes tiger-striped with a glow of vindication. Aureliano Segundo gave himself over to her again with the fury of adolescence, as before, when Petra Cotes had not loved him for himself but because she had him mixed up with his twin brother and as she slept with both of them at the same time she thought that God had given her the good fortune of having a man who could make love like two. The restored passion was so pressing that on more than one occasion they would look each other in the eyes as they were getting ready to eat and without saying anything they would cover their plates and go into the bedroom dying of hunger and of love. Inspired by the things he had seen on his furtive visits to the French matrons, Aureliano Segundo bought Petra Cotes a bed with an archiepiscopal canopy, put velvet curtains on the windows, and covered the ceiling and the walls of the bedroom with large rock-crystal mirrors. At the same time he was more of a carouser and spendthrift than ever. On the train, which arrived every day at eleven o’clock, he would receive cases and more cases of champagne and brandy. On the way back from the station he would drag the improvised cumbiamba along in full view of all the people on the way, natives or outsiders, acquaintances or people yet to be known, without distinctions of any kind. Even the slippery Mr. Brown, who talked only in a strange tongue, let himself be seduced by the tempting signs that Aureliano Segundo made him and several times he got dead drunk in Petra Cotes’s house and he even made the fierce German shepherd dogs that went everywhere with him dance to some Texas songs that he himself mumbled in one way or another to the accompaniment of the accordion.","The discipline in the house was so strict that Aureliano Segundo only felt comfortable when he went to Petra Cotes' house. First, under the pretext of lessening the burden on his wife, he moved the parties and festivities there. Then, using the excuse that the livestock were reproducing less, he moved the cattle and horse stables there. Finally, claiming that it was cooler at his mistress's house, he moved his small office there to handle business matters. By the time Fernanda realized that she was a widow but her husband was not dead, it was too late to return things to the way they were. Aureliano Segundo hardly ever ate at home, and the only outward appearances he tried to maintain, such as sleeping with his wife at home, were not enough to convince anyone. Due to carelessness, one time he stayed overnight with Petra Cotes until dawn. Contrary to what he expected, Fernanda did not scold or complain, but on that very day, she ordered his two trunks of clothes to be sent to his mistress's house. She openly ordered the servants to carry the trunks conspicuously down the street for everyone to see, thinking that by doing so, her wayward husband would be unable to bear the shame and would repent and return. But that heroic gesture was just another proof that Fernanda did not understand her husband's character, nor the customs of a village that was nothing like her parents' village, because everyone who saw the servants carrying the trunks said it was the inevitable outcome of a story everyone knew well. Aureliano Segundo threw a party, eating and drinking for three days straight to celebrate his freedom. The biggest disadvantage for his wife was that while she was beginning to age with dark-colored clothes, old-fashioned garlands, and misplaced pride, the mistress seemed to be in her prime, always dressed in thin, colorful silk dresses, with eyes that were always blazing. Aureliano Segundo threw himself at her with the fervor of his youth, just like before, when Petra Cotes, not out of love but because she mistook him for his twin brother and ended up sleeping with both of them at the same time, thinking that God had blessed her with a man who had the strength of two when lying with her. Their passion was so intense that more than once they looked into each other's eyes while eating, and without saying a word, they covered the food with a cloche and dragged each other into the bedroom, where they succumbed to hunger and love. Imitating what he had seen on his secret trips with French-style prostitutes, Aureliano Segundo bought Petra Cotes a bed with a canopy, hung velvet curtains on the windows, and lined the ceiling and walls of the bedroom with huge mirrors. By then, he appeared even more indulgent in drinking. From the trains that usually arrived at eleven o'clock, he received crates of champagne and brandy every day. On the way back from the station, he would invite anyone he met to dance, whether they were fellow villagers or foreigners, acquaintances or strangers, wealthy or poor. Even Mr. Brown, who only mumbled in a foreign language, was captivated by Aureliano Segundo's charming gestures and often got drunk at Petra Cotes's house, to the point where his fierce German shepherds, which followed him everywhere, would dance to the Texan tunes he hummed, struggling to keep up with the accordion.",21.362,21.21,"The restrictions at home were so annoying that Aureliano Segundo felt more comfortable at Petra Cotes' house. At first, under the pretext of not wanting to burden his wife too much, he moved his wild parties to Petra Cotes' house. Then, using the excuse that the animals were losing their fertility, he moved their pens and stables there. Finally, with the excuse that his mistress's house was cooler, he moved the small office where he managed his affairs there. By the time it dawned on Fernanda that she was a widow whose husband had not yet died, it was already too late, and there was no way to return to the old situation. Aureliano Segundo would come to dinner once in a blue moon, and even the things he did to keep up appearances, like sleeping with his wife, did not fool anyone. One night he drifted off and spent the night in Petra Cotes' bed. Contrary to expectations, Fernanda neither reproached him nor showed the slightest sign of resentment, but on the same day, she packed his clothes into two trunks and sent them to his house. Fernanda sent the trunks in broad daylight and told the porters to walk down the middle of the street so everyone could see. She hoped that this way, her wayward husband would be ashamed and return home with his head down. However, this tear-jerking heroism once again proved that Fernanda not only did not understand her husband's personality but also how different the society they lived in was from her own family's views. Because those who saw the trunks being carried down the street considered this event as the natural outcome of a story everyone knew very well. Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, celebrated his newfound freedom by throwing a party that lasted three days and three nights. To her misfortune, while Fernanda entered a pitiful old age with her modest long dresses, outdated medallions, and misplaced pride, her husband's mistress, dressed in colorful silk garments and with eyes gleaming with the light of victory, seemed to be entering a second youth. Aureliano Segundo, caught up once again in the fervor of youth, fell for his mistress anew. They made love with a passion reminiscent of the days when Petra Cotes thanked God for giving her a lover who, because she confused him with his twin brother, made love to her as if he were two different men. This rekindled love was so powerful that, on numerous occasions, just as they were about to sit down for a meal, they would catch each other's eyes, cover the food without a word, and, dying of hunger and passion, throw themselves into the bedroom. Inspired by the things he saw during his secret visits to French brothels, Aureliano Segundo bought Petra Cotes a canopy bed. He had velvet curtains installed on the bedroom windows, and covered the walls and ceiling with large crystal mirrors. He became more generous, more extravagant, and more cheerful than ever before. Every day, he had crates of champagne and cognac delivered by the train that arrived at eleven. When returning from the station, he would load the liquor bottles onto a makeshift cart and, whether local or foreign, familiar or yet to be known, he would pull the cart in full view of everyone. Even Mister Brown, who spoke in a strange language, was captivated by Aureliano Segundo's behavior, and after coming to Petra Cotes' house a few times and getting drunk, he even played the accordion and hummed Texas tunes, making his dog, who never left his side, dance to the music.",20.224,20.068,"The restrictions imposed in the house were so severe that Aureliano Segundo felt definitively more comfortable at Petra Cotes' place. First, under the pretext of easing his wife's burden, he moved the parties. Then, under the pretext that the animals were losing fertility, he moved the stables and barns. Finally, under the pretext that it was cooler at the concubine's house, he moved the small office where he managed his business. When Fernanda realized that she was a widow whose husband had not yet died, it was too late for things to return to their previous state. Aureliano Segundo barely ate at home, and the only appearances he maintained, such as sleeping with his wife, were not enough to convince anyone. One night, by accident, morning found him in Petra Cotes' bed. Contrary to what he expected, Fernanda did not reproach him in the slightest nor did she show the least sign of resentment, but that same day she sent his two trunks of clothes to the concubine's house. She sent them in broad daylight with instructions to carry them down the middle of the street, so that everyone could see them, believing that the wayward husband would not be able to bear the shame and would return to the fold with his head bowed. But that heroic gesture was just another proof of how little Fernanda knew not only her husband's character but also the nature of a community that had nothing to do with that of her parents, because everyone who saw the trunks pass by thought that after all, this was the natural culmination of a story whose intimacies no one was unaware of, and Aureliano Segundo celebrated his newfound freedom with a three-day party. To the further disadvantage of the wife, while she began to age poorly with her somber clerical garments, her anachronistic medallions, and her misplaced pride, the concubine seemed to burst into a second youth, clad in bright natural silk dresses and with eyes blazing with the fire of vindication. Aureliano Segundo returned to her with the fervor of adolescence, as before, when Petra Cotes loved him not for who he was but because she confused him with his twin brother, and by sleeping with both at the same time, she thought that God had granted her the fortune of having a man who made love as if he were two. The restored passion was so urgent that more than once they looked into each other's eyes as they were about to eat, and without saying a word, they covered the plates and went to die of hunger and love in the bedroom. Inspired by the things he had seen on his furtive visits to the French matrons, Aureliano Segundo bought Petra Cotes a bed with an archbishop's canopy, put velvet curtains on the windows, and covered the ceiling and walls of the bedroom with large rock crystal mirrors. He was then seen more partying and extravagant than ever. On the train, which arrived every day at eleven, he received box after box of champagne and brandy. On the way back from the station, he dragged every human being he encountered, native or foreigner, known or unknown, without any distinctions, to the improvised cumbiamba. Even the elusive Mr. Brown, who only mingled in a foreign language, was seduced by the tempting gestures Aureliano Segundo made to him, and several times he got dead drunk at Petra Cotes' house and even made the fierce German dogs that accompanied him everywhere dance to Texan songs that he himself mumbled in any way to the rhythm of the accordion.",44.449,44.369
585,"“Cease, cows,” Aureliano Segundo shouted at the height of the party. “Cease, because life is short.”","- Oh, cows, spread your legs! - Aureliano Segundo shouted amidst the chaos of the night festival. - Spread your legs or life will be really short?",12.272,9.131,"Aureliano Segundo appears at the height of the party's excitement, ""Stop already, you cows, life passes in the blink of an eye!"" he was shouting.",18.402,15.26,"—Move aside, cows —Aureliano Segundo shouted in the frenzy of the party—. Move aside because life is short.",26.708,22.574
586,"He never looked better, nor had he been loved more, nor had the breeding of his animals been wilder. There was a slaughtering of so many cows, pigs, and chickens for the endless parties that the ground in the courtyard turned black and muddy with so much blood. It was an eternal execution ground of bones and innards, a mud pit of leftovers, and they had to keep exploding dynamite bombs all the time so that the buzzards would not pluck out the guests’ eyes. Aureliano Segundo grew fat, purple-colored, turtle-shaped, because of an appetite comparable only to that of José Arcadio when he came back from traveling around the world. The prestige of his outlandish voracity, of his immense capacity as a spendthrift, of his unprecedented hospitality went beyond the borders of the swamp and attracted the best-qualified gluttons from all along the coast. Fabulous eaters arrived from everywhere to take part in the irrational tourneys of capacity and resistance that were organized in the house of Petra Cotes. Aureliano Segundo was the unconquered eater until the luckless Saturday when Camila Sagastume appeared, a totemic female known all through the land by the good name of “The Elephant.” The duel lasted until dawn on Tuesday. During the first twenty-four hours, having dispatched a dinner of veal, with cassava, yams, and fried bananas, and a case and a half of champagne in addition, Aureliano Segundo was sure of victory. He seemed more enthusiastic, more vital than his imperturbable adversary, who possessed a style that was obviously more professional, but at the same time less emotional for the large crowd that filled the house. While Aureliano Segundo ate with great bites, overcome by the anxiety of victory, The Elephant was slicing her meat with the art of a surgeon and eating it unhurriedly and even with a certain pleasure. She was gigantic and sturdy, but over her colossal form a tenderness of femininity prevailed and she had a face that was so beautiful, hands so fine and well cared for, and such an irresistible personal charm that when Aureliano Segundo saw her enter the house he commented in a low voice that he would have preferred to have the tourney in bed and not at the table. Later on, when he saw her consume a side of veal without breaking a single rule of good table manners, he commented seriously that that delicate, fascinating, and insatiable proboscidian was in a certain way the ideal woman. He was not mistaken. The reputation of a bone crusher that had preceded The Elephant had no basis. She was not a beef cruncher or a bearded lady from a Greek circus, as had been said, but the director of a school of voice. She had learned to eat when she was already the respectable mother of a family, looking for a way for her children to eat better and not by means of any artificial stimulation of their appetites but through the absolute tranquility of their spirits. Her theory, demonstrated in practice, was based on the principle that a person who had all matters of conscience in perfect shape should be able to eat until overcome by fatigue. And it was for moral reasons and sporting interest that she left her school and her home to compete with a man whose fame as a great, unprincipled eater had spread throughout the country. From the first moment she saw him she saw that Aureliano Segundo would lose not his stomach but his character. At the end of the first night, while The Elephant was boldly going on, Aureliano Segundo was wearing himself out with a great deal of talking and laughing. They slept four hours. On awakening each one had the juice of forty oranges, eight quarts of coffee, and thirty raw eggs. On the second morning, after many hours without sleep and having put away two pigs, a bunch of bananas, and four cases of champagne, The Elephant suspected that Aureliano Segundo had unknowingly discovered the same method as hers, but by the absurd route of total irresponsibility. He was, therefore, more dangerous than she had thought. Nevertheless, when Petra Cotes brought two roast turkeys to the table, Aureliano Segundo was a step away from being stuffed.","Never before had he had such a cheerful face, and no one needed more than that, and his livestock had never reproduced so much. So many cows, pigs, and chickens were slaughtered in the endless feasts that the ground in the yard became gray and muddy with blood. The backyard became a place piled with bones, offal, and all sorts of waste, and people had to burn packets of explosives all day to keep the flocks of kites and crows from pecking out the guests' eyes. Aureliano Segundo became obese, his face always red like a fighting cock, moving slowly because he ate as heartily as José Arcadio after returning from his wanderings. His unprecedented gluttony, extravagant spending, and unparalleled hospitality made his reputation surpass all boundaries of the swamp region, attracting the most voracious eaters from the coastal area. Top eaters from everywhere flocked to participate in the bizarre eating contests held at Petra Cotes's house. Aureliano Segundo was always the winner until one unfortunate Saturday when Camila Sagastume appeared, a strange woman famous throughout the country by the name ""The Female Elephant."" The eating contest lasted from Saturday until Tuesday morning. In the first twenty-four hours, after devouring a whole roasted lamb with cassava, potatoes, and fried bananas, and drinking a barrel and a half of champagne, Aureliano Segundo was confident of his victory. He appeared cheerful and full of life compared to his silent, more seasoned female opponent, who was less exciting to the diverse crowd packed into the house. While Aureliano Segundo chewed and gobbled eagerly anticipating victory, ""The Female Elephant"" sliced her meat with the skill of a surgeon and ate slowly, even savoring the pleasure of eating. She was a tall, robust woman, but her feminine gentleness overshadowed her enormous bulk. She had a beautiful face, well-cared-for slender hands, and an overwhelming charm that made Aureliano Segundo whisper that he would rather compete with her in bed than at the table when he saw her walk in. Later, seeing her politely eating a lamb leg, he seriously commented that the courteous, charming, and tireless ""Female Elephant"" might be an ideal type of woman. He was not mistaken: the fierce reputation like an eagle that had been attributed to ""The Female Elephant"" was entirely unfounded. She was not a meat grinder, nor the bearded lady from the Greek circus as people said; she was the director of a music school. She began learning to eat when she was already a mother looking for ways to ensure her children ate well, not through artificial stimulation but through absolute mental calmness. Her theory, proven in practice, was based on the principle that anyone who is completely comfortable in their mind can eat continuously until they are too tired to eat anymore. Thus, it was for spiritual reasons, not a love of sport, that she left her school and family to compete with a man famous throughout the country for his eating prowess but who followed no principles. From the first meeting, she realized that Aureliano Segundo would lose because of his character, not his stomach. After the first night, while she remained calm, Aureliano Segundo was almost exhausted from constantly talking and laughing. They slept for four hours. When they woke up, each drank the juice of forty oranges, eight liters of coffee, and thirty raw eggs. After the second night, after many sleepless hours and having eaten two pigs, a bunch of bananas, and drunk four barrels of champagne, she felt that Aureliano Segundo might have discovered her method but was following it foolishly under the guidance of a completely irresponsible attitude. He was a more dangerous man than she thought. Nevertheless, when Petra Cotes brought out two more roasted turkeys, Aureliano Segundo was on the verge of bursting a blood vessel.",23.137,23.017,"Aureliano Segundo had never been as healthy and cheerful as he was in those days, never been so loved, and the animals had never reproduced so quickly. The garden had turned into a black mud from the blood of countless pigs, cows, and chickens slaughtered at his endless parties. Heaps of bones and intestines piled up in the garden, and the garbage pits where the remains were thrown were filled to the brim. They had to constantly set off dynamite to prevent hawks and falcons from gouging out the guests' eyes. Aureliano Segundo grew a belly from eating and drinking with a gluttony similar to Jose Arcadio's when he returned from his travels around the world, and his face turned purple. Aureliano Segundo's gluttony, reckless spending, and unprecedented hospitality became legendary; his fame spread beyond the boundaries of the swamp region and reached the ears of the most renowned gluttons of all the towns and cities along the coast. Food enthusiasts began to flock from all directions. Gluttony and endurance tournaments were organized at Petra Cotes' house. Until that fateful Saturday when Camila Sagastume, a woman known throughout the country as 'The Elephant' and resembling a totem, arrived, no one could defeat Aureliano Segundo in the gluttony contest. When Camila arrived, the eating duel between her and Aureliano lasted from Saturday to Tuesday morning. In the first twenty-four hours, Aureliano Segundo, who devoured beef with a garnish of Jerusalem artichoke, cassava, and fried plantains, along with one and a half cases of champagne, considered victory to be in the bag. He appeared more lively and enthusiastic than his opponent, who was more professional but did not excite the large crowd that filled the house. Dizzy with the intoxication of victory, Aureliano Segundo stuffed large chunks into his mouth, while the Elephant, with the precision of an operator, cut his meat and ate it unhurriedly, even savoring it. The woman was a giant, a creature of immense proportions. Even on her large frame, there was an air of feminine softness. Her face was so beautiful, her hands so neat and well-groomed, and her demeanor so attractive that Aureliano Segundo couldn't help but murmur that he would prefer to compete in bed rather than at the table upon seeing her. Later, when he saw the woman eat half a calf without losing any of her elegance and fully adhering to table manners, he confidently declared that this beautiful, attractive, and insatiable elephant was the ideal woman. He was not mistaken. Even before she was called 'Elephant,' she was known: they called her 'Bone Crusher.' However, there was no truth to this saying. As rumored, the Elephant was not a bearded lady or a gluttony queen displayed in a Greek circus, but the director of a music school. She had learned to eat a lot after getting married and having children. She had avoided feeding her children artificial appetite stimulants like vitamins or medicines, trying to ensure they developed a natural appetite to stay healthy, and in doing so, she had accustomed herself to gluttony to set an example for them. The method he tried to instill in his children and applied himself was based on the principle that if one's conscience is clear, they can eat until they are exhausted from fatigue. He had come here, leaving his home and school, with such a moralistic view and sportsmanlike excitement to compete with Aureliano Segundo, who was renowned throughout the country as a man without principles who indulged in gluttony whenever he felt like it. Camila, at the first sight of Aureliano Segundo, understood that he would lose the race not because of the weakness of his stomach, but because of his personality. At the end of the first night, while the Elephant continued eating tirelessly, Aureliano Segundo had started to wear himself out with a barrage of chatter and laughter. They took a four-hour sleep break. When they woke up, both had breakfast with forty glasses of orange juice, eight liters of coffee, and thirty raw eggs each. By the time they reached the second morning, after a sleepless night during which they consumed two pigs, a bunch of bananas, and four cases of champagne, the Elephant sensed that Aureliano Segundo, without realizing it, had found his own method from an unexpected angle of irresponsibility. In this state, it was more dangerous than the Elephant's trunk. However, when Petra Cotes brought two turkeys roasted to a golden brown to the table, Aureliano Segundo was about to burst.",20.269,20.144,"He never looked better, nor was he more loved, nor was the birthing of his animals more frenzied. So many cattle, pigs, and chickens were sacrificed in the endless parties that the ground in the yard turned black and muddy from so much blood. It was an eternal dumping ground of bones and guts, a refuse heap of leftovers, and they had to be burning dynamite chambers at all hours to keep the vultures from gouging out the guests' eyes. Aureliano Segundo became fat, purplish, and sluggish as a result of an appetite barely comparable to that of José Arcadio when he returned from his trip around the world. The prestige of his unrestrained voracity, his immense capacity for wastefulness, and his unprecedented hospitality surpassed the limits of the swamp and attracted the best-rated gluttons from the coast. From all over, fabulous gluttons arrived to take part in the irrational tournaments of capacity and endurance that were organized at Petra Cotes' house. Aureliano Segundo was the undefeated eater until the unfortunate Saturday when Camila Sagastume appeared, a totemic female known throughout the country by the good name of The Elephant. The duel lasted until dawn on Tuesday. In the first twenty-four hours, having dispatched a calf with yucca, yam, and roasted plantains, and additionally a box and a half of champagne, Aureliano Segundo was confident of victory. He seemed more enthusiastic, more vital than the imperturbable adversary, who had an evidently more professional style, but for that reason less exciting to the colorful crowd that overflowed the house. While Aureliano Segundo ate in bites, driven by the anxiety of triumph, The Elephant sectioned the meat with the skills of a surgeon, and ate it unhurriedly and even with a certain pleasure. She was gigantic and solid, but against her colossal corpulence prevailed the tenderness of femininity, and she had such a beautiful face, such fine and well-cared-for hands, and such irresistible personal charm, that when Aureliano Segundo saw her enter the house, he commented in a low voice that he would have preferred to hold the tournament in bed rather than at the table. Later, when he saw her consume the calf's haunch without violating a single rule of the best manners, he seriously commented that this delicate, fascinating, and insatiable proboscidean was in some way the ideal woman. He was not mistaken. The bone-crushing fame that preceded The Elephant was unfounded. She was not an ox crusher, nor a bearded woman in a Greek circus, as was said, but the director of a singing academy. She had learned to eat already being a respectable mother of a family, seeking a method for her children to eat better, not through artificial appetite stimulants but through absolute peace of mind. Her theory, demonstrated in practice, was based on the principle that a person who had perfectly settled all matters of their conscience could eat without pause until overcome by fatigue. So it was for moral reasons, and not for sporting interest, that she neglected the academy and home to compete with a man whose fame as a great, unprincipled eater had spread across the country. From the first time she saw him, she realized that Aureliano Segundo would not be undone by his stomach but by his character. At the end of the first night, while The Elephant remained impassive, Aureliano Segundo was exhausted from so much talking and laughing. They slept for four hours. Upon waking, each drank the juice of fifty oranges, eight liters of coffee, and thirty raw eggs. By the second dawn, after many hours without sleep and having dispatched two pigs, a bunch of plantains, and four boxes of champagne, The Elephant suspected that Aureliano Segundo, unknowingly, had discovered the same method as she had, but through the absurd path of total irresponsibility.

588,"She said it from her heart, understanding that she could not eat another mouthful either, out of remorse for bringing on the death of her adversary. But Aureliano Segundo interpreted it as another challenge and he filled himself with turkey beyond his incredible capacity. He lost consciousness. He fell face down into the plate filled with bones, frothing at the mouth like a dog, and drowning in moans of agony. He felt, in the midst of the darkness, that they were throwing him from the top of a tower into a bottomless pit and in a last flash of consciousness he realized that at the end of that endless fall death was waiting for him.","She spoke sincerely and understood that she couldn't eat another bite, feeling a pang of conscience for driving her opponent quickly towards death. But Aureliano Segundo took it as a new challenge and continued to chew on the turkey until he far exceeded his own terrifying capacity to eat. He collapsed unconscious. He fell face down onto the plate of bones, foaming at the mouth, gasping for breath in his death throes.

Because he understood that if he took one more bite, it would lead to his opponent's death, and for this reason, he did not want to eat.

With his mouth foaming like a dog, groaning bitterly, he collapsed face down into the plate filled with bones. In that great darkness, it felt as if he was being thrown from the top of a high tower into a bottomless pit. For a moment, he came to his senses and realized that at the end of this endless fall, death was waiting for him.",25.505,24.87,"She said it from the heart, understanding that she too could not eat another bite due to the remorse of facilitating the death of the adversary.

In the detailed messages that she sent them every two weeks there was not a single line of truth. She hid her troubles from them. She hid from them the sadness of a house which, in spite of the light on the begonias, in spite of the heaviness at two in the afternoon, in spite of the frequent waves of festivals that came in from the street was more and more like the colonial mansion of her parents.

Amaranta was tall and dignified, always dressed properly, with a noble attitude towards time and bitter memories. Amaranta seemed to bear the mark of the cross of chastity on her forehead. In fact, she bore the holy mark on her hand, on the black ribbon that she wore even when she slept, a ribbon she washed and ironed herself. All her life, she constantly sewed mourning cloths and shrouds. It could be said that she sewed by day and unraveled by night, and by doing so, she did not seek to defeat loneliness but rather to sustain it.",21.616,21.086,"Amaranta was weaving the shroud. Fernanda could not understand why she sometimes wrote letters to Meme, even sent gifts, and why she did not even want to hear the name of Jose Arcadio. Fernanda, to find out why this was the case, asked Ursula to intervene and inquire. Amaranta said, ""They will die without ever learning the reason."" These words planted the seeds of a doubt in Fernanda's heart that she could never shake off. Amaranta, tall, broad-shouldered, proud, always wearing lacy, voluminous petticoats, and resisting the weight of years and bad memories, seemed to have a mark of virginity drawn with ash on her forehead. In fact, she carried this sign of virginity in the bandage on her arm, which she never took off even at night, washed herself, and ironed herself. She had dedicated all her days to weaving the shroud cloth. You would think that during the day she wove until evening, and out of fear that her weaving would be finished, she unraveled it from night until morning. She did this not to forget her loneliness, but on the contrary, to intensify it.",18.686,18.158,"Amaranta was weaving her shroud. Fernanda did not understand why she wrote occasional letters to Meme, and even sent her gifts, yet did not even want to talk about José Arcadio. “They will die without knowing why,” Amaranta answered when she asked her the question through Úrsula, and that response planted an enigma in her heart that she could never unravel. Tall, slender, haughty, always dressed in abundant frothy petticoats and with an air of distinction that resisted the years and bad memories, Amaranta seemed to bear the ash cross of virginity on her forehead. In reality, she bore it in her hand, in the black bandage that she did not remove even to sleep, and which she herself washed and ironed. Her life was spent embroidering the shroud. One might have said that she embroidered during the day and unembroidered at night, not with the hope of defeating loneliness in that way, but quite the opposite, to sustain it.",44.616,44.3
595,"The greatest worry that Fernanda had during her years of abandonment was that Meme would come to spend her first vacation and not find Aureliano Segundo at home. His congestion had put an end to that fear. When Meme returned, her parents had made an agreement that not only would the girl think that Aureliano Segundo was still a domesticated husband but also that she would not notice the sadness of the house. Every year for two months Aureliano Segundo played his role of an exemplary husband and he organized parties with ice cream and cookies which the gay and lively schoolgirl enhanced with the clavichord. It was obvious from then on that she had inherited very little of her mother’s character. She seemed more of a second version of Amaranta when the latter had not known bitterness and was arousing the house with her dance steps at the age of twelve or fourteen before her secret passion for Pietro Crespi was to twist the direction of her heart in the end. But unlike Amaranta, unlike all of them, Meme still did not reveal the solitary fate of the family and she seemed entirely in conformity with the world, even when she would shut herself up in the parlor at two in the afternoon to practice the clavichord with an inflexible discipline. It was obvious that she liked the house, that she spent the whole year dreaming about the excitement of the young people her arrival brought around, and that she was not far removed from the festive vocation and hospitable excesses of her father. The first sign of that calamitous inheritance was revealed on her third vacation, when Meme appeared at the house with four nuns and sixty-eight classmates whom she had invited to spend a week with her family on her own Initiative and without any previous warning.","Fernanda's greatest worry during the years of abandonment was what would happen if Meme came home for her first summer vacations and didn't find Aureliano Segundo at home. The story of nearly dying from overeating put an end to that fear. When Meme returned, her parents had agreed not only to make her believe that Aureliano Segundo was still her mother's devoted husband but also to ensure she didn't feel the dullness of the house. Every year, Aureliano Segundo played the role of a model father for two months. He organized fun events with ice cream and sweets along with the lively music of the enthusiastic and energetic student. Her personality from that time on was clearly not much like her mother's. Perhaps it was only a shadow of Amaranta before bitterness took over, always dancing and singing, making noise around the house when she was twelve or fourteen years old, that is, before her secret desires for Pietro Crespi completely changed the direction of her heart. But unlike Amaranta, unlike everyone else, Meme showed no signs of the family's solitude, as if she were completely in harmony with the world even when she sat alone in the living room practicing the piano diligently. It was clear that she enjoyed the house, as she eagerly awaited the children's excitement to welcome her home all year long, and she shared her father's penchant for fun and extraordinary hospitality. The first sign of inheriting that trait emerged in the third summer, when Meme returned with four nuns and sixty-eight classmates. She spontaneously thought of inviting them home for a week without any prior notice. - Isn't it miserable?",22.821,22.531,"During the years of abandonment, Fernanda's greatest sorrow was the worry that Meme would come home for her first vacation and not find Aureliano Segundo at home. Fortunately, Aureliano Segundo's illness put an end to this fear. The husband and wife reached an agreement: When Meme arrived, they would do whatever was necessary so that she would still see Aureliano Segundo as a man tied to his home and not notice the unhappiness and pain in the house. After that, every year Aureliano Segundo started playing the role of an exemplary husband for two months. He would host parties where only ice cream and cookies were served to the guests instead of alcohol, and the young girl who had returned from school for the holidays would enliven these parties by playing the piano. It was already clear at that time that the young girl did not take after her mother at all. She resembled Amaranta more, in her twelve to fourteen-year-old self, in the days when she did not know what pain was, when her secret passion for Pietro Crespi had not yet turned her heart in the opposite direction, the Amaranta who would set the house on its feet by dancing. The aspect that set Amaranta apart from the other family members was that she had not been engulfed by the family's destiny of solitude. Meme seemed to be keeping up with the ways of the world. Even when she shut herself in the living room to practice piano at two o'clock every day without deviating from her strict principles, she was not disconnected from the world... It was clear that she loved the house, spending the entire year dreaming of the excitement and joy her return from school would bring to the young ones, and that she had inherited her father's excessive hospitality and love for entertainment. The first sign of these dangerous traits inherited from her father was when, without prior notice, she brought along four nuns and sixty-eight classmates to spend a week with them during the third summer.",19.52,19.219,"The greatest concern Fernanda had during her years of abandonment was that Meme would come home for her first vacation and not find Aureliano Segundo in the house.

The invitation turned into a disaster because the noisy schoolgirls, after finishing breakfast, started having lunch in shifts, then continued with dinner, and throughout the whole week, they only went out once. In the evening, the nuns were exhausted, too tired to move, let alone shout orders, while the tireless young students kept singing loudly in the yard. Once, the girls almost trampled on old Úrsula, who always wanted to do something right where she couldn't. Another time, the nuns made a fuss because Colonel Aureliano Buendía was urinating under the chestnut tree without paying any attention to the girls gathered in the yard.

This vacation was nothing like what they had imagined. Because as the lively young girls were finishing their breakfast shift, they had to get in line for lunch, and as soon as the last group finished lunch, the first group was already sitting down for dinner.

By evening, the nuns were exhausted, unable to move, and couldn't even muster the energy to tell the girls what to do or not to do. The tireless youngsters were playing in the garden, singing school songs with discordant voices. One day, they almost trampled Ursula, who was trying to be useful but was more of a hindrance. One day, Colonel Aureliano Buendia, without caring that the girls were in the garden, urinated under the chestnut tree, causing the nuns to nearly lose their minds.

599,"The night of their arrival the students carried on in such a way, trying to go to the bathroom before they went to bed, that at one o’clock in the morning the last ones were still going in. Fernanda then bought seventy-two chamberpots but she only managed to change the nocturnal problem into a morning one, because from dawn on there was a long line of girls, each with her pot in her hand, waiting for her turn to wash it. Although some of them suffered fevers and several of them were infected by mosquito bites, most of them showed an unbreakable resistance as they faced the most troublesome difficulties, and even at the time of the greatest heat they would scamper through the garden. When they finally left, the flowers were destroyed, the furniture broken, and the walls covered with drawings and writing, but Fernanda pardoned them for all of the damage because of her relief at their leaving. She returned the borrowed beds and stools and kept the seventy-two chamberpots in Melquíades’ room. The locked room, about which the spiritual life of the house revolved in former times, was known from that time on as the “chamberpot room.” For Colonel Aureliano Buendía it was the most appropriate name, because while the rest of the family was still amazed by the fact that Melquíades’ room was immune to dust and destruction, he saw it turned into a dunghill. In any case, it did not seem to bother him who was correct, and if he found out about the fate of the room it was because Fernanda kept passing by and disturbing his work for a whole afternoon as she put away the chamberpots.","The night they first arrived, the girls made a lot of noise about going to the bathroom before bed, yet even at one in the morning, there were still people waiting outside the toilet. Fernanda then bought seventy-two chamber pots, but that only shifted the nighttime chaos to the morning, because at dawn the girls would line up in front of the bathroom, each holding her own pot, waiting for her turn to wash it. Although a few girls had fevers and some were itchy from mosquito bites, most of the girls showed remarkable endurance in the face of the greatest difficulties, and even during the hottest hours, they still chattered away in the garden. In the end, when the girls had left, the flower beds were in ruins, furniture was broken and scattered, and the walls were covered with drawings and writings, but Fernanda forgave all the destruction in exchange for the relief of their departure. She returned the beds and chairs and stored the seventy-two chamber pots in Melquíades' room. The empty room, which had once belonged to the person who brought spiritual life to the whole house, was from then on called the chamber pot room. To Colonel Aureliano Buendía, it was the most fitting name, because while everyone marveled at how Melquíades' room remained undamaged and dust-free, he saw it as having turned into a dung pen. In any case, the question of who was right or wrong did not matter to him. He knew the fate of the room because Fernanda kept interrupting his work all afternoon to arrange dozens of chamber pots in there.",21.634,21.282,"The students kept moving to the bathroom on their first night. They wanted to use the bathroom before going to bed. Even though it was one in the morning, the line at the girls' bathroom door seemed endless. As a result, Fernanda bought seventy-two chamber pots. But by doing so, she only transferred the night problem to the morning. Because this time, the girls were lining up at dawn with their chamber pots in hand, waiting for their turn to empty and wash them. Despite some of them suffering from malaria and others being bothered by mosquito bites, most of the girls endured the harshest conditions with unyielding resilience, wandering around the garden even during the hottest hours of the day. Eventually, they left. The flowers in the garden were crushed and broken, the furniture in the house was damaged, and drawings and writings were scribbled on the walls. But Fernanda was so relieved that the girls had left that she overlooked all the damage they had caused. He returned the beds and stools they had borrowed from the neighbors. He also moved seventy-two chairs into Melquiades' room. The locked room, which had once been the center of the house's spiritual life, began to be referred to as the 'prison room' from then on. Colonel Aureliano Buendia found this name quite fitting. Because while the other members of the family were constantly amazed that Melquiades' room never gathered dust and that nothing in there ever aged, the colonel saw the room as a heap of manure. Moreover, whether it was one way or another, it didn't matter to the colonel; he didn't care which side was right.

In spite of the fact that she could not see him, Úrsula analyzed the clicking of his foreman’s boots and was surprised at the unbridgeable distance that separated him from the family, even from the twin brother with whom he had played ingenious games of confusion in childhood and with whom he no longer had any traits in common. He was linear, solemn, and had a pensive air and the sadness of a Saracen and a mournful glow on his face that was the color of autumn. He was the one who most resembled his mother, Santa Sofía de la Piedad. Úrsula reproached herself for the habit of forgetting about him when she spoke about the family, but when she sensed him in the house again and noticed that the colonel let him into the workshop during working hours, she reexamined her old memories and confirmed the belief that at some moment in childhood he had changed places with his twin brother, because it was he and not the other one who should have been called Aureliano. No one knew the details of his life. At one time it was discovered that he had no fixed abode, that he raised fighting cocks at Pilar Ternera’s house and that sometimes he would stay there to sleep but that he almost always spent the night in the rooms of the French matrons. He drifted about, with no ties of affection, with no ambitions, like a wandering star in Úrsula’s planetary system.","In those days, Hôsê Accađiô Sêgunđô was seen at home again. He walked hurriedly through the hallway, greeted no one, and sat in the workshop talking to the colonel. Even without seeing him, Ucsula only needed to hear the sound of the overseer's heels to be surprised by the irreparable distance that had grown between him and the family, even with his twin brother, who had once played innocent hide-and-seek games with him and now bore no resemblance to him. He was tall, solemn, contemplative, somewhat sad, and his pale face revealed a tragic gleam. He was the man who resembled Santa Sôphia de la Piêđat, his mother, the most. Ucsula had blamed the desire to forget him when discussing household matters, but when she felt his presence at home once more and realized that the colonel received him for hours in his jewelry workshop, she immediately revisited her distant memories and became even more convinced of her belief that at some point in his childhood, he had swapped names with his twin brother, because it was he, not the other, who had been called Aurêlianô. No one knew the small details of his private life. There were times when people knew he wasn't in any specific place; sometimes he raised fighting cocks at Pila Tecnêra's house and occasionally slept there, but most nights he slept in the rooms of the prostitutes. He lived a wandering life, without any emotion, without any desire, like a bright star in Ucsula's universe.",17.359,16.975,"In those days, Jose Arcadio Segundo came back home. Without greeting anyone, he passed through the veranda and went into the workshop to talk to the colonel. Even though Ursula couldn't see him, she recognized him by the clatter of his studded foreman boots and was astonished by the vastness of the unbridgeable chasm that separated him from the family. Jose Arcadio Segundo was so estranged from his twin brother, with whom he used to play deception games by switching places during their childhood, that now they had nothing in common. There were deep lines on his thin face. He was serious and thoughtful. He had a melancholic air typical of Arabs and an autumnal hue on his face. He was the one who most resembled his mother, Santa Sofia de la Piedad. Ursula felt resentful towards herself for forgetting about Jose Arcadio Segundo when talking about the family. But when she started to hear Jose Arcadio Segundo in the house again and realized that the colonel allowed him to enter the workshop during his working hours, Ursula revisited her old memories and became even more convinced that the two brothers had switched places during their childhood. Because the one who should bear the name Aureliano was this one, not the other. No one knew anything about the details of his life. It was understood that he had no fixed home, organized cockfights at Pilar Ternera's house, stayed there occasionally, but spent most of his nights in the rooms of French prostitutes.

601,"In reality, José Arcadio Segundo was not a member of the family, nor would he ever be of any other since that distant dawn when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez took him to the barracks, not so that he could see an execution, but so that for the rest of his life he would never forget the sad and somewhat mocking smile of the man being shot. That was not only his oldest memory, but the only one he had of his childhood. The other one, that of an old man with an old-fashioned vest and a hat with a brim like a crow’s wings who told him marvelous things framed in a dazzling window, he was unable to place in any period. It was an uncertain memory, entirely devoid of lessons or nostalgia, the opposite of the memory of the executed man, which had really set the direction of his life and would return to his memory clearer and dearer as he grew older, as if the passage of time were bringing him closer to it. Úrsula tried to use José Arcadio Segundo to get Colonel Aureliano Buendía. to give up his imprisonment. “Get him to go to the movies,” she said to him. “Even if he doesn’t like the picture, as least he’ll breathe a little fresh air.” But it did not take her long to realize that he was as insensible to her begging as the colonel would have been, and that they were armored by the same impermeability of affection. Although she never knew, nor did anyone know, what they spoke about in their prolonged sessions shut up in the workshop, she understood that they were probably the only members of the family who seemed drawn together by some affinity.","In fact, José Arcadio Segundo was not a member of this family and would never be a member of any other family, ever since that distant early morning when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez led him to the barracks not to witness an execution but so that he would never forget the sorrowful smile tinged with irony of the condemned man. That was not only his oldest memory but also his only memory from his childhood. As for another memory, the memory of an old man wearing an outdated coat and a raven-wing hat sitting right in front of a brightly lit window telling wondrous tales, he still could not place it in any specific period. It was a vague memory, completely unnecessary for any teachings or for nostalgia, contrary to the memory of the condemned man which, in fact, had guided his life, and it returned to his memory more clearly as he grew older, as if the passage of time was gradually leading him back to it. Úrsula intended to use him to make Colonel Aureliano Buendía abandon the gold workshop where he had secluded himself. ""Convince your uncle to go see a movie,"" she told him. ""Even if he doesn't like movies, at least he'll have a chance to breathe some fresh air."" But it wasn't long before she realized that he was just like the Colonel, indifferent to her pleas, and she understood that he too had become impervious to all affectionate feelings. Although she did not know and no one knew what the two of them discussed during their long conversations in the gold workshop, she understood that they were the only two members of the family who seemed to be connected by deep mutual understanding.",25.64,25.343,"Actually, Jose Arcadio Segundo was not one of the family. Since the day Colonel Gerineldo Marquez took him at dawn to the barracks, Jose Arcadio Segundo had been estranged from his family. The Colonel had taken him there not to witness the execution of a death sentence, but so that he would never forget the pitiful and somewhat mocking smile of the man being executed. That execution was not only Jose Arcadio Segundo's oldest memory, but the only memory from his childhood. There was another memory. He couldn't place in which part of his life the memory of the old man who wore an old-fashioned vest, put on a hat resembling a crow's wing, and sat by the window telling him incredible things belonged. It was a vague memory. It was a memory loaded with teachings and aspirations, the exact opposite of the memory of the executed man, and it became clearer as he aged. This vague memory had given true direction to his life, and as time passed, it seemed as if he could almost grasp it. Ursula asked for Jose Arcadio Segundo's help to dissuade Colonel Aureliano Buendia from locking himself in the workshop. -Take him to the cinema. Even if he doesn't like the movie, at least he will get some fresh air, she said. However, Ursula soon realized that Jose Arcadio Segundo was as indifferent to her requests as the colonel, and that both men were shielded by an armor impervious to love. Neither others nor Ursula knew what they talked about for hours when they shut themselves in the workshop, but Ursula sensed that, within the large family, there was no one else bound by kinship as closely as these two.",18.865,18.503,"In reality, José Arcadio Segundo was not a member of the family, nor would he ever be of another, since the distant dawn when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez took him to the barracks, not to witness an execution, but so that he would never forget for the rest of his life the sad and slightly mocking smile of the executed man.

The other, of an old man with an anachronistic vest and a hat with crow wings who told wonders in front of a dazzling window, he could not place in any time period.

602,"The truth is that not even José Arcadio Segundo would have been able to draw the colonel out of his confinement. The invasion of schoolgirls had lowered the limits of his patience. With the pretext that his wedding bedroom was at the mercy of the moths in spite of the destruction of Remedios’ appetizing dolls, he hung a hammock in the workshop and then he would leave it only to go into the courtyard to take care of his necessities. Úrsula was unable to string together even a trivial conversation with him. She knew that he did not look at the dishes of food but would put them at one end of his workbench while he finished a little fish and it did not matter to him if the soup curdled or if the meat got cold. He grew harder and harder ever since Colonel Gerineldo Márquez refused to back him up in a senile war. He locked himself up inside himself and the family finally thought of him is if he were dead. No other human reaction was seen in him until one October eleventh, when he went to the. street door to watch a circus parade. For Colonel Aureliano Buendía it had been a day just like all those of his last years. At five o’clock in the morning the noise of the toads and crickets outside the wall woke him up. The drizzle had persisted since Saturday and there was no necessity for him to hear their tiny whispering among the leaves of the garden because he would have felt the cold in his bones in any case. He was, as always, wrapped in his woolen blanket and wearing his crude cotton long drawers, which he still wore for comfort, even though because of their musty, old-fashioned style he called them his “Goth drawers.” He put on his tight pants but did not button them up, nor did he put the gold button into his shirt collar as he always did, because he planned to take a bath. Then he put the blanket over his head like a cowl. brushed his dripping mustache with his fingers, and went to urinate in the courtyard. There was still so much time left for the sun to come out that José Arcadio Buendía was still dozing under the shelter of palm fronds that had been rotted by the rain. He did not see him, as he had never seen him, nor did he hear the incomprehensible phrase that the ghost of his father addressed to him as he awakened, startled by the stream of hot urine that splattered his shoes. He put the bath off for later, not because of the cold and the dampness, but because of the oppressive October mist. On his way back to the workshop he noticed the odor of the wick that Santa Sofía de la Piedad was using to light the stoves, and he waited in the kitchen for the coffee to boil so that he could take along his mug without sugar. Santa Sofía de la Piedad asked him, as on every morning, what day of the week it was, and he answered that it was Tuesday, October eleventh. Watching the glow of the fire as it gilded the persistent woman who neither then nor in any instant of her life seemed to exist completely, he suddenly remembered that on one October eleventh in the middle of the war he had awakened with the brutal certainty that the woman with whom he had slept was dead. She really was and he could not forget the date because she had asked him an hour before what day it was. In spite of the memory he did not have an awareness this time either of to what degree his omens had abandoned him and while the coffee was boiling he kept on thinking out of pure curiosity but without the slightest risk of nostalgia about the woman whose name he had never known and whose face he had not seen because she had stumbled to his hammock in the dark. Nevertheless, in the emptiness of so many women who came into his life in the same way, he did not remember that she was the one who in the delirium of that first meeting was on the point of foundering in her own tears and scarcely an hour before her death had sworn to love him until she died. He did not think about her again or about any of the others after he went into the workshop with the steaming cup, and he lighted the lamp in order to count the little gold fishes, which he kept in a tin pail. There were seventeen of them. Since he had decided not to sell any, he kept on making two fishes a day and when he finished twenty-five he would melt them down and start all over again. He worked all morning, absorbed, without thinking about anything, without realizing that at ten o’clock the rain had grown stronger and someone ran past the workshop shouting to close the doors before the house was flooded, and without thinking even about himself until Úrsula came in with his lunch and turned out the light.","In fact, even José Arcadio Segundo could not drag the colonel out from where he had imprisoned himself. The noisy visits of Meme's school friends to the house had exceeded the limits of the colonel's patience. Using the excuse that their bedroom was infested with cockroaches that had chewed up Remedios' beautiful dolls, he hung a hammock right in the goldsmith's workshop, and from then on, he stayed there, only coming out when absolutely necessary. Úrsula couldn't find an opportunity to talk to him. She knew well that he didn't look at the food tray but just left it at the end of the large table while he finished making a goldfish, not even noticing the soup that had formed a skin and the cold fried meat. He had become more difficult since Colonel Gerineldo Márquez refused to help him ignite a hopeless bloody war. He isolated himself even more, as if he had locked his heart, and thus the family thought of him as a dead man. He was not seen again until he stepped out the front door to watch the circus parade on October 11. For Colonel Aureliano Buendía, it was a day like any other in the final years of his life. At five in the morning, the chaotic croaking of frogs and the droning of insects outside the four walls woke him up. The steady rain had been falling since Saturday, and he didn't need to hear the raindrops pattering on the garden leaves because he could feel the rain in his very bones. As usual, he put on his wool coat with long cotton underwear, which, though dusty and old, he still called ""the underwear of the strong."" He wore narrow trousers but didn't button them and didn't use the gold button to fasten his shirt collar because he intended to go to the bathroom. Then he draped the wool coat over his head like a hood, combed his thick beard with his fingers, and urinated in the yard. Dawn was still far off, and José Arcadio Buendía was still sleeping fitfully in the palm-leaf hut, decayed by the rain. He didn't see him as he never did, nor did he hear the incomprehensible words his father's ghost said when it woke with a start from the hot urine splashing on its shoes. He didn't go to the bathroom immediately, not because of the cold or dampness, but because of the thick October fog. Returning to the goldsmith's workshop, he smelled the strong odor of the stoves that Santa Sofía de la Piedad was lighting, and he stood in the kitchen waiting for the coffee to boil so he could take a cup of unsweetened coffee back to his room. As every morning, Santa Sofía de la Piedad asked him what day it was, and he replied that it was Wednesday, October 11. Seeing the bold woman glowing in the firelight, he remembered, as he did at any other time in his life, a day, October 11, during the fierce war, when a rough certainty that the girl who had slept with him had died woke him up. Indeed, the girl had died, and he never forgot that day because she had asked him what day it was just an hour before. Despite this recollection, he still didn't fully realize how much the omens had abandoned him, and while the coffee boiled, purely out of curiosity and without a hint of nostalgia, he continued to think about the woman whose name he never knew and whose face he never clearly saw because she had stumbled in the dark to find his hammock. However, among the many women who had come into his life in that manner, he didn't remember that she was the one who, in that first emotional encounter, had nearly drowned in her tears and had promised to love him forever, even until death, less than an hour before she died. He didn't think about her anymore, nor would he think about anyone else, once he entered the goldsmith's workshop, lit the lamp, and counted the goldfish in the tin box. Ten in total, since deciding not to sell them anymore, he made only two a day, and when he had twenty-five, he melted them down to start over. He worked diligently all morning, completely focused on his work, unaware that it started raining at ten o'clock, and someone passing by the workshop door shouted for everyone to close their doors to avoid flooding, and he was completely oblivious to himself until Úrsula entered the workshop with his lunch and turned off the lamp.",20.624,20.502,"To tell the truth, even Jose Arcadio Segundo couldn't get the colonel out of the room he had locked himself in. The arrival of Meme's classmates had further narrowed the colonel's patience. Even though Remedios' appetizing babies were burned and disposed of, the colonel set up a hammock in the workshop, using the excuse that the bridal chamber was still not cleaned of moths. After that, he only went outside to the garden to meet his natural needs and never went out otherwise. Ursula tried to talk to him, but she couldn't find an opportunity to discuss even the most trivial matters. She knew that the colonel would place the tray at one end of the counter without even looking at the plates, and whether the soup thickened or the meat got cold, he didn't care until he finished the fish in his hand. Since Colonel Gerineldo Marquez did not support that senile war idea, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was becoming more rigid day by day. He imprisoned himself within himself. Eventually, the household began to consider him as dead. Until the eleventh of October, no human reaction was observed in the colonel. On the eleventh of October, however, he went to the street door to watch the circus parade that had come to town. For Colonel Aureliano Buendia, that day was no different from the days he had spent in recent years. At five in the morning, the sound of black frogs and crickets by the wall woke him up. It had been drizzling continuously since Saturday. It wasn't necessary to hear the sound of raindrops falling on the leaves in the garden to understand that the rain hadn't stopped, because Colonel Aureliano Buendia felt the cold in his bones. As usual, he was wrapped in his old wool blanket; he had long cotton underwear on. He called them 'barbarian underwear' because of their outdated style, but he still wore them because they were comfortable. He put on his tight pants, but did not button them up, nor did he attach the gold button he always wore on his collar, because he intended to wash. Then, holding his blanket over his head like a hood, he stroked his mustache and went to the garden to urinate. Since there was still a long time before sunrise, Jose Arcadio Buendia had not yet gotten up and was dozing under the rotting palm leaves. Colonel Aureliano Buendia did not see the ghost of his father, whom he had never seen, that day either, and he did not hear his father complaining about the hot urine splashing on his shoes like streams. The Colonel postponed washing not because the weather was cold and rainy, but because the fog typical of October had settled in. As he returned to his workshop, he smelled the wick that Santa Sofia de la Piedad had lit to ignite the gas stove, and he waited in the kitchen for the coffee to boil, intending to take his plain coffee and retreat to his room. As she asked every morning, Santa Sofia de la Piedad asked what day it was, and the colonel told her it was Tuesday, October eleventh. The colonel, who was lost in the light of the flames illuminating the face of the woman who never seemed to be truly living at any moment of her life, suddenly remembered waking up with a start on an eleventh of October day in the midst of the war, with the premonition that the woman in his arms had died. The woman had indeed died. Because she had asked him the date just an hour earlier, the colonel never forgot that date. Despite this memory, he couldn't realize to what extent his intuitions had left him this time either. While waiting for the coffee to boil, he began to think about the woman whose name he never knew and whose face he never saw because she came to his bed in the dark, not with longing but with mere curiosity. In the void of so many women who had entered his life in the same way, the colonel couldn't remember the woman who cried her heart out at their first meeting and swore an hour before her death that she would love him until she died. After taking the steaming coffee cup and entering his workshop, he forgot both that woman and the others, and lit the lamp to count the fish he had filled in a tin bucket. There were seventeen fish in the bucket. Since Colonel Aureliano Buendia had given up selling the fish, he made two fish a day, and when the fish accumulated in the bucket reached twenty-five, he melted them all down and started anew. The Colonel devoted himself to work all morning. He was thinking of nothing. He didn't even notice someone running past the workshop at ten o'clock, saying that they should close the doors before the house got flooded as the rain intensified. The colonel worked, lost in himself, until Ursula came in with a food tray and turned off the lamp.",21.791,21.671,"The truth is that not even José Arcadio Segundo could have gotten the colonel out of his seclusion. The school invasion had exceeded the limits of his patience. With the pretext that the bridal bedroom was at the mercy of moths despite the destruction of Remedios' appetizing dolls, he hung a hammock in the workshop, and then he only left it to go to the patio to relieve himself. Úrsula couldn't manage to stitch together a trivial conversation with him. She knew that he didn't look at the plates of food, but placed them at one end of the counter while he finished the little fish, and didn't care if the soup got a skin on it and the meat got cold. He hardened more and more since Colonel Gerineldo Márquez refused to support him in a senile war. He locked himself up with a bar inside himself, and the family ended up thinking of him as if he were dead. He wasn't seen to have a human reaction again until an October eleventh when he went out to the street door to see a circus parade. That day had been for Colonel Aureliano Buendía a day like all the others in his later years. At five in the morning, he was awakened by the commotion of frogs and crickets outside the wall. The drizzle had persisted since Saturday, and he wouldn't have needed to hear its meticulous whispering on the garden leaves, because he would have felt it in the cold of his bones anyway. He was, as always, wrapped in the wool blanket, and with the long raw cotton underwear that he continued to wear for comfort, although because of their dusty anachronism he himself called them ""Gothic underwear. "" He put on his narrow pants, but didn't fasten the loops or put the gold button he always used on the collar of his shirt, because he intended to take a bath. Then he put the blanket over his head like a hood, combed his dripping mustache with his fingers, and went to urinate in the patio. It was so early that José Arcadio Buendía was still dozing under the shed of palms rotted by the drizzle. He didn't see him, as he had never seen him, nor did he hear the incomprehensible phrase that his father's ghost addressed to him when he woke up startled by the stream of hot urine that splashed his shoes. He postponed the bath for later, not because of the cold and humidity, but because of the oppressive October fog. Returning to the workshop, he perceived the smell of wick from the stoves that Santa Sofía de la Piedad was lighting, and waited in the kitchen for the coffee to boil to take his cup without sugar. Santa Sofía de la Piedad asked him, as she did every morning, what day of the week it was, and he replied that it was Tuesday, October eleventh. Seeing the impassive woman gilded by the glow of the fire, who neither at that moment nor at any other in her life seemed to exist completely, he suddenly remembered that on an October eleventh, in the middle of the war, he was awakened by the brutal certainty that the woman he had slept with was dead. She was, in fact, and he didn't forget the date because she too had asked him an hour earlier what day it was. Despite the recollection, this time too he wasn't aware of how much the omens had abandoned him, and while the coffee boiled, he continued thinking out of pure curiosity, but without the slightest risk of nostalgia, about the woman whose name he never knew, and whose face he didn't see alive because she had reached his hammock stumbling in the dark. However, in the void of so many women who came into his life in the same way, he didn't remember that it was she who, in the delirium of their first encounter, was about to drown in her own tears, and barely an hour before dying had sworn to love him until death. He didn't think of her again, nor of any other, after he entered the workshop with the steaming cup, and turned on the light to count the little gold fish he kept in a tin can. There were seventeen. Since he decided not to sell them, he continued making two little fish a day, and when he completed twenty-five, he melted them down in the crucible to start making them again. He worked all morning, absorbed, without thinking about anything, without realizing that at ten the rain intensified and someone passed in front of the workshop shouting to close the doors so the house wouldn't flood, and without even realizing himself until Úrsula came in with lunch and turned off the light.",44.061,43.998
603,“What a rain!” Úrsula said.,"- Oh my God, why is it raining so heavily, - Ucsula said. - October rain!",9.678,5.415,"Ursula said, ""What kind of rain is this!""",11.731,4.457,—What rain! —said Úrsula.,23.263,13.833

605,"When he said it he did not raise his eyes from the first little fish of the day because he was putting in the rubies for the eyes. Only when he finished it and put it with the others in the pail did he begin to drink the soup. Then, very slowly, he ate the piece of meat roasted with onions, the white rice, and the slices of fried bananas all on the same plate together. His appetite did not change under either the best or the harshest of circumstances. After lunch he felt the drowsiness of inactivity. Because of a kind of scientific superstition he never worked, or read, or bathed, or made love until two hours of digestion had gone by, and it was such a deep-rooted belief that several times he held up military operations so as not to submit the troops to the risks of indigestion. So he lay down in the hammock, removing the wax from his ears with a penknife, and in a few minutes he was asleep. He dreamed that he was going into an empty house with white walls and that he was upset by the burden of being the first human being to enter it. In the dream he remembered that he had dreamed the same thing the night before and on many nights over the past years and he knew that the image would be erased from his memory when he awakened because that recurrent dream had the quality of not being remembered except within the dream itself. A moment later, indeed, when the barber knocked at the workshop door, Colonel Aureliano Buendía awoke with the impression that he had fallen asleep involuntarily for a few seconds and that he had not had time to dream anything.","While saying that sentence, he did not take his eyes off the first golden fish he made that day, because he was trying to inlay the golden pupils into its eyes. Only after finishing and placing it into the tin bucket did he start sipping the soup. After that, he ate very slowly, stir-fried meat with onions, white rice along with slices of fried bananas, all of these dishes were placed together on a large plate. His way of enjoying food was not disrupted in the most beautiful circumstances nor in the most difficult and harsh ones. When he was about to finish eating, he felt the desire to rest. According to a scientific belief, he never worked, read books, bathed, or even entered a room unless two hours had passed for his digestive system to function, and this was such a firm belief that sometimes he delayed carrying out battles to prevent his soldiers from suffering congestion. So he lay down in a hammock, used a pocket knife to remove the wax plug from his ear, and within a few minutes, he was sound asleep. He dreamed that he was entering an empty house with white walls, and the worry that he was the first person to step into this house made him uneasy. In that dream, he remembered that the night before he had dreamed the same thing, and not just the night before, but every night in the last years of his life, he had dreamed the same thing. He knew that this image would be erased from his memory upon waking, because this recurring dream could only be remembered within the dream itself. Indeed, a moment later, when the barber knocked on the jeweler's workshop door, Colonel Aureliano Buendía woke up with the feeling that he had accidentally fallen asleep for a few brief minutes and that he hadn't had time to dream of anything at all.",23.152,22.854,"While saying this, he did not take his eyes off the first of the two fish that belonged to that day, which he was preparing on the table. Because he was placing tiny rubies into the eye sockets of the fish. After finishing the fish and putting it into the bucket with the others, he started to drink his soup. Then he slowly ate the onion steak, rice, and baked bananas on the same plate. His appetite did not change in the best conditions or the most difficult situations. After the meal, a heaviness settled over him. With a thought that could be called a kind of scientific superstition, he neither worked, read, bathed, nor made love during the two-hour digestion period after a meal. This belief was so deeply rooted that he had postponed military operations several times to avoid causing digestive problems for the soldiers. He lay down in his hammock and cleaned the inside of his ear with the tip of his penknife. Within a few minutes, he fell asleep. In his dream, he saw himself entering an empty house with white walls. It bothered him to be the first person to set foot in the house. In his dream, he remembered having this dream the night before and that he had been having the same dream occasionally for years. Even before waking up, he knew that the moment he woke up, he would forget the dream. Because the characteristic of this dream, which recurred from time to time, was that it was remembered within the dream. Indeed, a moment later, when the barber knocked on the workshop door, Colonel Aureliano Buendia woke up, thinking he had dozed off for a few seconds and had not dreamed at all.",20.132,19.773,"When he said it, he did not lift his gaze from the first little fish of the day, because he was setting the rubies in its eyes. Only when he finished it and placed it with the others in the jar did he start to eat the soup. Then he ate, very slowly, the piece of meat stewed with onions, the white rice, and the slices of fried plantain, all together on the same plate. His appetite was unaffected by either the best or the harshest circumstances. At the end of lunch, he experienced the anxiety of idleness. Due to a kind of scientific superstition, he never worked, read, bathed, or made love before two hours of digestion had passed, and this belief was so ingrained that he had several times delayed military operations to avoid exposing the troops to the risks of congestion. So he lay down in the hammock, cleaning the wax from his ears with a penknife, and within a few minutes, he fell asleep. He dreamed that he was entering an empty house with white walls, and he was troubled by the burden of being the first human being to enter it.

""Come on Friday.""",13.964,9.314,—Not today —he said to the barber—. See you on Friday.,15.913,10.856
607,"He had a three-day beard speckled with white hairs, but he did not think it necessary to shave because on Friday he was going to have his hair cut and it could all be done at the same time. The sticky sweat of the unwanted siesta aroused the scars of the sores in his armpits. The sky had cleared but the sun had not come out. Colonel Aureliano Buendía released a sonorous belch which brought back the acidity of the soup to his palate and which was like a command from his organism to throw his blanket over his shoulders and go to the toilet. He stayed there longer than was necessary, crouched over the dense fermentation that was coming out of the wooden box until habit told him that it was time to start work again. During the time he lingered he remembered again that it was Tuesday, and that José Arcadio Segundo had not come to the workshop because it was payday on the banana company farms. That recollection, as all of those of the past few years, led him to think about the war without his realizing it. He remembered that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez had once promised to get him a horse with a white star on its face and that he had never spoken about it again. Then he went on toward scattered episodes but he brought them back without any judgment because since he could not think about anything else, he had learned to think coldly so that inescapable memories would not touch any feeling. On his way back to the workshop, seeing that the air was beginning to dry out, he decided that it was a good time to take a bath, but Amaranta had got there ahead of him. So he started on the second little fish of the day. He was putting a hook on the tail when the sun came out with such strength that the light creaked like a fishing boat. The air, which had been washed by the three-day drizzle, was filled with flying ants. Then he came to the realization that he felt like urinating and he had been putting it off until he had finished fixing the little fish. He went out into the courtyard at ten minutes after four, when he heard the distant brass instruments, the beating of the bass drum and the shouting of the children, and for the first time since his youth he knowingly fell into a trap of nostalgia and relived that prodigious afternoon Of the gypsies when his father took him to see ice. Santa Sofía de la Piedad dropped what she was doing in the kitchen and ran to the door.","The speckled beard with white strands of his had not been shaved for three days, but he felt it was not yet necessary to shave, as he would cut his hair on Friday and do it all at once. The sticky sweat from an unwanted afternoon nap had reddened the mosquito bite scars under his armpits. The rain had stopped, but the sun had not yet appeared. Colonel Aureliano Buendía burped loudly, and this burp brought back to his tongue the sour taste of the soup he had just eaten. And it felt like a command from his body, forcing him to throw on his coat and head to the latrine immediately. He sat in the latrine longer than necessary, squatting over the mushy feces spilling out of the wooden bucket below, until habit reminded him that it was time for the afternoon's work. While sitting and waiting, he remembered that today was Wednesday and that José Arcadio Segundo was not yet at the goldsmith's workshop because today was payday at the banana company's plantations. This memory, like all other memories in the last years of his life, he carried not to recall the years of war. He remembered that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez had once promised him that he would find a horse with a white star on its forehead, and that it had been a long time since the colonel had mentioned it again. Then he thought about other scattered stories, but he remembered them without any particular order. To avoid thinking about other matters, he had learned to think about them in the coldness of his life, so that those unavoidable memories, when they returned, would not make him sentimental. When he returned to the goldsmith's workshop, seeing the sky had cleared, he decided that it would be perfect to take a bath now, but Amaranta stopped him. So he began working on the second goldfish of the day. While he was attaching the tail to the fish, the sun burst out so strongly that the light roared like the sound of a fishing boat. The sky, cleansed by the three-day rain, was now thick with flying ants. Immediately, he felt the urge to urinate again, but he held it until he finished the goldfish. He stepped into the yard at four fifteen, hearing from afar the sound of brass instruments, loud drums, and the joyful shouts of children, and for the first time since he was a young man, he consciously fell into the trap of nostalgia, reliving the marvelous afternoon of the gypsies that his father had taken him to see the ice. Santa Sofía de la Piedad left her work in the kitchen unfinished and ran to the front door:",25.233,25.036,"He had a three-day stubble with patches of gray on his face. But he found shaving unnecessary. After all, he would get a haircut on Friday, and then he would do both at the same time. The sticky sweat that drenched him in the sleep he reluctantly succumbed to had swollen the glands under his armpits. The sky had cleared, but the sun had not come out. Colonel Aureliano Buendia burped as the sourness of the soup came up to his mouth, and this burp, as if it were a reflex of his organism, made him immediately throw his blanket over his shoulder and head to the bathroom. He stayed in the bathroom longer than necessary, sitting until he remembered he needed to get back to work, squatting over the sour, foul smell coming from the wooden box. While he was dawdling in the bathroom, he remembered again that it was Tuesday and thought that Jose Arcadio Segundo hadn't come because it was the day for the weekly distribution at the banana company. Remembering these things, as always in recent years, unconsciously led him to think about the war. He recalled that Colonel Gerineldo Marquez had once promised to find him a horse with a white blaze on its forehead, and never brought up the subject again. Then fragmented memories came to his mind. He was thinking about them without making any judgments. Because since he had no room to think about anything else, he had learned to think rigidly so that the inevitable memories wouldn't touch his emotions. When he saw that the weather was starting to clear up as he returned to his workshop, he thought it was the perfect time to take a bath. However, Amaranta had acted before him and had already entered the bathroom. So, Colonel Aureliano Buendia began making his second fish of the day. Just as he was about to attach the tail to the fish, the sun suddenly came out so intensely that the light creaked like a fishing boat. The air, which had been washed and cleansed by three days of rain, suddenly filled with winged ants. The Colonel remembered that he needed to pee and had held it in until he finished the fish. When he heard the distant sounds of trumpets, drums, and children's shouts, he went out to the garden at ten past four and, for the first time since his youth, he deliberately allowed himself to be overwhelmed by a sense of longing, reliving the day his father took him to the gypsies' tent to see ice. Santa Sofia de la Piedad, who heard the sounds, left her work in the kitchen and ran to the door.",28.6,28.431,"He had a three-day beard, speckled with white fuzz, but he didn't think it necessary to shave if he was going to get a haircut on Friday and could do it all at once. The sticky sweat from the unwanted nap revived the scars of the boils under his armpits. It had cleared up, but the sun had not yet come out. Colonel Aureliano Buendía let out a loud burp that brought back the acidity of the soup to his palate, and which was like an order from his body to throw the blanket over his shoulders and go to the toilet. There he stayed longer than necessary, squatting over the dense fermentation rising from the wooden box, until habit told him it was time to resume work. During the wait, he remembered again that it was Tuesday, and that José Arcadio Segundo had not been in the workshop because it was payday at the banana company plantations. That memory, like all those of recent years, led him to think about the war without any particular reason. He remembered that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez had once promised to get him a horse with a white star on its forehead, and that it had never been mentioned again. Then he drifted into scattered episodes, but he recalled them without qualifying them, because by not being able to think of anything else, he had learned to think coldly, so that the unavoidable memories would not hurt any feelings. Back in the workshop, seeing that the air was starting to dry, he decided it was a good time to bathe, but Amaranta had beaten him to it. So he started the second little fish of the day. He was attaching the tail when the sun came out so strongly that the brightness cracked like a sloop. The air washed by the three-day drizzle filled with flying ants. Then he realized he wanted to urinate, and he was postponing it until he finished assembling the little fish. He was heading to the patio at ten past four when he heard the distant brass, the drumbeats, and the children's jubilation, and for the first time since his youth, he consciously stepped into a trap of nostalgia and relived the prodigious afternoon of gypsies when his father took him to see the ice.

609,"Instead of going to the chestnut tree, Colonel Aureliano Buendía also went to the street door and mingled with the bystanders who, were watching the parade. He saw a woman dressed in gold sitting on the head of an elephant. He saw a sad dromedary. He saw a bear dressed like a Dutch girl keeping time to the music with a soup spoon and a pan. He saw the clowns doing cartwheels at the end of the parade and once more he saw the face of his miserable solitude when everything had passed by and there was nothing but the bright expanse of the street and the air full of flying ants with a few onlookers peering into the precipice of uncertainty. Then he went to the chestnut tree, thinking about the circus, and while he urinated he tried to keep on thinking about the circus, but he could no longer find the memory. He pulled his head in between his shoulders like a baby chick and remained motionless with his forehead against the trunk of the chestnut tree. The family did not find him until the following day at eleven o’clock in the morning when Santa Sofía de la Piedad went to throw out the garbage in back and her attention was attracted by the descending vultures.","Instead of going to the chestnut tree, Colonel Aureliano Buendía went to the gate and blended into the crowd of curious onlookers watching the circus parade. He saw a woman dressed in yellow riding on the back of an elephant. He saw a sad-looking dromedary. He saw a bear holding a ladle, tapping it against a pot in rhythm with the music. He saw clowns performing tightrope acts at the end of the procession. Once again, his face displayed his pitiful loneliness as the circus passed by, leaving behind only a brightly lit void on the road, with the air thick again with flying ants and some curious people peering into the endless abyss of ambiguity. Only then did he return to the chestnut tree, and while urinating, he tried to continue thinking about the circus, but he couldn't grasp the memory anymore. He raised his arms to embrace his head, like a chick, then stood still, his forehead resting against the trunk of the chestnut tree. The family was unaware of this.

Despite secretly disliking the Colonel, Fernanda, moved by the solemn respect the government showed in commemorating their arch-enemy, meticulously organized the funeral.

612,"Meme had finished her course of study. The diploma that certified her as a concert clavichordist was ratified by the virtuosity with which she executed popular melodies of the seventeenth century at the gathering organized to celebrate the completion of her studies and with which the period of mourning came to in end. More than her art, the guests admired her duality. Her frivolous and even slightly infantile character did not seem up to any serious activity, but when she sat down at the clavichord she became a different girl, one whose unforeseen maturity gave her the air of an adult. That was how she had always been. She really did am have any definite vocation, but she had earned the highest grades by means of inflexible discipline simply in order not to annoy her mother. They could have imposed on her an apprenticeship in any other field and the results would have been the same. Since she had been very small she had been troubled by Fernanda’s strictness, her custom of deciding in favor of extremes; and she would have been capable of a much more difficult sacrifice than the clavichord lessons merely not to run up against her intransigence. During the graduation ceremonies she had the impression that the parchment with Gothic letters and illuminated capitals was freeing her from a compromise that she had accepted not so much out of obedience as out of convenience, and she thought that from then on not even the insistent Fernanda would worry any more about an instrument that even the nuns looked upon as a museum fossil. During the first years she thought that her calculations were mistaken because after she had put half the town to sleep, not only in the parlor but also at all charitable functions, school ceremonies, and patriotic celebrations that took place in Macondo, her mother still invited to the house every newcomer whom she thought capable of appreciating her daughter’s virtues. Only after the death of Amaranta, when the family shut itself up again in a period of mourning, was Meme able to lock the clavichord and forget the key in some dresser drawer without Fernanda’s being annoyed on finding out when and through whose fault it had been lost. Meme bore up under the exhibitions with the same stoicism that she had dedicated to her apprenticeship. It was the price of her freedom. Fernanda was so pleased with her docility and so proud of the admiration that her art inspired that she was never against the house being fall of girl friends, her spending the afternoon in the groves, and going to the movies with Aureliano Segundo or some muted lady as long as the film was approved by Father Antonio Isabel from the pulpit. During those moments of relaxation Meme’s real tastes were revealed. Her happiness lay at the other extreme from discipline, in noisy parties, in gossip about lovers, in prolonged sessions with her girl friends, where they learned to smoke and talked about male business, and where they once got their hands on some cane liquor and ended up naked, measuring and comparing the parts of their bodies. Meme would never forget that night when she arrived home chewing licorice lozenges, and without noticing their consternation, sat down at the table where Fernanda and Amaranta were eating dinner without saying a word to each other. She had spent two tremendous hours in the bedroom of a girl friend, weeping with laughter and fear, and beyond an crises she had found the rare feeling of. bravery that she needed in order to run away from school and tell her mother in one way or another that she could use the clavichord as an enema. Sitting at the head of the table, drinking a chicken broth that landed in her stomach like an elixir of resurrection, Meme then saw Fernanda and Amaranta wrapped in an accusatory halo of reality. She had to make a great effort not to throw at them their prissiness, their poverty of spirit their delusions of grandeur. From the time of her second vacation she had known that her father was living at home only in order to keep up appearances, and knowing Fernanda as she did and having arranged later to meet Petra Cotes, she thought that her father was right. She also would have preferred being the daughter of the concubine. In the haziness of the alcohol Meme thought with pleasure about the scandal that would have taken place if she were to express her thoughts at that moment, and the intimate satisfaction of her roguishness was so intense that Fernanda noticed it.","Mêmê has finished her studies. The diploma certifies that she is a recognized harpsichord artist, thanks to the skill she used to play 17th-century folk music at the graduation ceremony, which also served as a memorial for the late Colonel. The guests admired her not only for her performance art but also for her dual nature... Her frivolous and sometimes childish demeanor seemed incompatible with any serious activity, but the moment she sat down at the harpsichord, she became a completely different girl. The maturity that was not previously evident gave her an adult appearance. She was always like that. In fact, Mêmê had no clear inclination, but she achieved the highest results by always working with strict discipline to avoid conflicts with her mother. If she had been forced to learn any other profession, she would certainly have achieved similar results. From a very young age, Fernanda's strict nature made her uncomfortable, but she was accustomed to sacrificing for others, and often this habit was even greater than her pursuit of the harpsichord, which she followed just to avoid clashing with her stubborn mother. At the graduation ceremony, she felt a joyful sense that the diploma, written in Gothic letters with decorative capital letters, would free her from the commitment she had accepted not just to obey, nor to keep the peace, and she believed that from this moment on, even the stubborn Fernanda would no longer be concerned with the harpsichord, which the nuns had considered an outdated artifact in the museum. In the early years, she thought her calculations were completely wrong because after half the town had gone to sleep, not only in her living room but in countless social gatherings, school events, and celebrations organized in Macondo, her mother continued to invite new audiences whom she knew could appreciate her daughter's qualities. After Amaranta's death, and only then, when everyone stayed home during the mourning period, Mêmê could completely detach herself from the harpsichord and leave the keychain in any wardrobe without worrying that Fernanda would be upset and search to see when and who had lost the key. Mêmê endured her mother's displays with the same patience she had during her studies. That was the price she had to pay for her freedom. Fernanda was so delighted with her daughter's gentle demeanor, so proud of everyone's admiration for her talent, that she did not prevent her friends from filling the house, from spending entire afternoons in the banana fields, and from watching movies that Father Antonio Isabel publicly permitted, along with Aureliano Segundo or trusted family friends. During those joyful moments, Mêmê's true interests became evident. Her happiness lay on the other side of strict discipline, in noisy festivities, in idle conversations about love, in gatherings where the girls locked their room to practice smoking and talk about boys, and once they even passed around and drank three bottles of white liquor, ending up naked to compare their body parts. Mêmê would never forget the night she walked into the house chewing licorice root, and because no one noticed she was drunk, she sat down at the table where Fernanda and Amaranta were quietly having dinner. Before that, she had spent two terrible hours in a friend's room, crying incessantly out of sadness and fear, and on the other side of that emotional crisis, she found a strange boldness she had lacked to run away from school, to tell her mother things that would make her furious about the harpsichord. Sitting at the head of the table, sipping chicken broth that felt like an elixir reviving the dead when it reached her stomach, Mêmê saw Fernanda and Amaranta immersed in the harsh light of reality. She had to restrain herself from telling them directly about their falseness, intellectual poverty, and vain desire for honor. From the second summer vacation onward, she knew her father only stayed home for appearances, and by understanding Fernanda as she did and by helping her to later understand Petra Cotes, she sided with her father. There were times when she wished to be the daughter of her father's lover. In her drunken stupor, Mêmê thought that if she expressed her thoughts at that moment, everyone would be surprised, and the silent joy of her mischievousness was so strong that Fernanda noticed:",17.476,17.329,"Meme had graduated from school. The extent to which she deserved the diploma certifying her as a concert pianist was proven by her masterful interpretation of popular seventeenth-century melodies, performed at the ceremony held to mark the completion of her studies. With this ceremony, the mourning period also came to an end. The guests were more impressed by the duality in her personality than by her art. This young girl, who liked to laugh and have fun and had a childish demeanor, was thought to be incapable of doing serious work. However, when she sat at the piano, Meme became a completely different girl. She suddenly seemed to have matured and grown up. But, Meme was always like this. In fact, she had neither great enthusiasm nor talent. She had subjected herself to strict discipline, worked very hard, and achieved the highest grades solely to avoid upsetting her mother. If they had trained him in another field, the result would have been the same. Since her childhood, Meme had suffered greatly from Fernanda's strictness and her decisions based on the principle of all or nothing. For this reason, just to avoid her mother's wrath, she could endure sacrifices much greater than piano lessons. She thought that the gilded, Gothic-lettered paper handed to her at the diploma ceremony would free her from the unpleasant compromise she had submitted to, not so much to fulfill her family's wishes, but to avoid trouble, and she believed that once she received her diploma, even the stubborn Fernanda would forget about this old model piano that even the nuns considered a museum piece. For a few years after finishing school, she thought she was mistaken in this belief. Because not only at home but also at all charity events, school ceremonies, and all national holidays celebrated in Macondo, where she put half the town to sleep out of boredom, her mother never tired of inviting every new stranger she thought could appreciate her daughter's talents to the house. Meme, however, was only able to lock the piano and throw the key into the bottom of a drawer after Amaranta died and the house was once again shrouded in mourning. Fernanda no longer got upset when she learned who had destroyed the key and when. Meme had endured these musical performances, organized to showcase her talent, as if she were enduring her lessons, with a sense of suffering. This was the price of her freedom. Fernanda was so pleased with Meme's docility, and so proud of the admiration her art evoked, that she did not object to Meme filling the house with her friends, going to the grove in the afternoons, or attending movies approved by Father Antonio Isabel, accompanied by Aureliano Segundo or a trustworthy neighbor woman. Meme's true tastes and real inclinations emerged during these moments of freedom. The young girl found happiness at the opposite extreme of discipline, reveling in noisy parties, love gossip, secretly smoking with her girlfriends for hours, and talking about boys. One day, during one of these gatherings, they got hold of some sugarcane liquor and, once drunk, stripped naked to compare their bodies, measuring their breasts, waists, and hips. Meme would never forget the evening she came home chewing mint pastilles to mask the smell of alcohol. Fernanda and Amaranta were sitting at the table, eating without speaking to each other. Meme sat down at the table without noticing the astonishment and sadness on their faces. In a friend's bedroom for two hours, tears streaming from her eyes he had laughed, cried in fear, and finally mustered enough courage to run away from school and tell his mother that it would be best to use the piano as firewood. He sat down at the table and, while drinking the chicken broth that felt like a lifesaver, saw Fernanda and Amaranta enveloped in an accusatory aura of truth. He struggled to keep himself from pointing out their empty arrogance, soullessness, and obsession with grandeur to their faces. Since coming for the second vacation, Meme knew that her father stayed at home only to save appearances. After getting to know Fernanda well and secretly meeting and talking with Petra Cotes, she agreed with her father. In fact, she would have preferred to be the daughter of her father's mistress rather than her mother. Meme thought about the chaos that would ensue if she were to say what was on her mind in the haze of alcohol at that moment. Thinking about this mischief gave Meme such intense satisfaction that it did not go unnoticed by Fernanda.",17.053,16.905,"Meme had finished her studies. The diploma that certified her as a harpsichord concert performer was ratified by the virtuosity with which she played popular 17th-century themes at the party organized to celebrate the completion of her studies and with which the mourning period was ended.

Her frivolous and even somewhat childish character did not seem suitable for any serious activity, but when she sat at the harpsichord she transformed into a different girl, whose unexpected maturity gave her an adult air. It was always like that. In truth, she did not have a defined vocation, but she achieved the highest grades through inflexible discipline, so as not to displease her mother. They could have imposed the learning of any other trade on her, and the results would have been the same.

In the early years, she thought her calculations were wrong, because after having put half the town to sleep not only in the living room but at every charity event, school session, and patriotic commemoration held in Macondo, her mother continued inviting every newcomer she thought capable of appreciating her daughter's virtues.

Meme endured the exhibitions with the same stoicism with which she dedicated herself to learning. It was the price of her freedom. Fernanda was so pleased with her docility and so proud of the admiration her art aroused that she never opposed having the house full of friends, spending the afternoon in the plantations, and going to the movies with Aureliano Segundo or with trusted ladies, as long as the movie had been authorized from the pulpit by Father Antonio Isabel. In those moments of leisure, Meme's true tastes were revealed. Her happiness lay at the opposite end of discipline, in noisy parties, in lovers' gossip, in prolonged seclusions with her friends where they learned to smoke and talked about men's matters, and where once they went overboard with three bottles of cane rum and ended up naked, measuring and comparing parts of their bodies. Meme would never forget the night she entered the house chewing licorice rhizomes, and without them noticing her condition, sat at the table where Fernanda and Amaranta dined without speaking to each other.

615,"Amaranta was startled by the obvious burden of hate that the declaration carried. But Fernanda felt so moved that she thought she would go mad when Meme awoke at midnight with her head splitting with pain and drowning in vomited gall. She gave her a vial of castor oil, put compresses on her stomach and ice cubes on her head, and she made her stay in bed for five days and follow the diet ordered by the new and outlandish French doctor, who after examining her for more than two hours reached the foggy conclusion that she had an ailment peculiar to women. Having lost her courage, in a miserable state of demoralization, Meme had no other recourse but to bear up under it. Úrsula, completely blind by then but still active and lucid, was the only one who guessed the exact diagnosis. “As far as I can see,” she thought, “that’s the same thing that happens to drunken people.” But she not only rejected the idea, she reproached herself for the frivolity of her thought. Aureliano Segundo felt a twinge of conscience when he saw Meme’s state of prostration and he promised himself to take better care of her in the future. That was how the relationship of jolly comradeship was born between father and daughter, which freed him for a time from the bitter solitude of his revels and freed her from Fernanda’s watchful eye without necessity of provoking the domestic crisis that seemed inevitable by then. At that time Aureliano Segundo postponed any appointments in order to be with Meme, to take her to the movies or the circus, and he spent the greater part of his idle time with her. In recent times his annoyance with the absurd obesity that prevented him from tying his shoes and his abusive satisfaction with all manner of appetites had began to sour his character. The discovery of his daughter restored his former joviality and the pleasure of being with her was slowly leading him away from dissipation. Meme was entering a fruitful age. She was not beautiful, as Amaranta had never been, but on the other hand she was pleasant, uncomplicated, and she had the virtue of making a good impression on people from the first moment. She had a modem spirit that wounded the antiquated sobriety and poorly disguised miserly heart of Fernanda, and that, on the other hand, Aureliano Segundo took pleasure in developing. It was he who resolved to take her out of the bedroom she had occupied since childhood, where the fearful eyes of the saints still fed her adolescent terrors, and he furnished for her a room with a royal bed, a large dressing table, and velvet curtains, not realizing that he was producing a second version of Petra Cotes’s room. He was so lavish with Meme that he did not even know how much money he gave her because she herself would take it out of his pockets, and he kept abreast of every kind of new beauty aid that arrived in the commissary of the banana company. Meme’s room became filled with pumice-stone cushions to polish her nails with, hair curlers, toothbrushes, drops to make her eyes languid, and so many and such new cosmetics and artifacts of beauty that every time Fernanda went into the room she was scandalized by the idea that her daughter’s dressing table must have been the same as those of the French matrons. Nevertheless Fernanda divided her time in those days between little Amaranta Úrsula, who was mischievous and sickly, and a touching correspondence with the invisible physicians. So that when she noticed the complicity between father and daughter the only promise she extracted from Aureliano Segundo was that he would never take Meme to Petra Cotes’s house. It was a meaningless demand because the concubine was so annoyed with the comradeship between her lover and his daughter that she did not want anything to do with her. Petra was tormented by an unknown fear, as if instinct were telling her that Meme, by just wanting it, could succeed in what Fernanda had been unable to do: deprive her of a love that by then she considered assured until death. For the first time Aureliano Segundo had to tolerate the harsh expressions and the violent tirades of his concubine, and he was even afraid that his wandering trunks would make the return journey to his wife’s house. That did not happen. No one knew a man better than Petra Cotes knew her lover and she knew that the trunks would remain where they had been sent because if Aureliano Segundo detested anything it was complicating his life with modifications and changes. So the trunks stayed where they were and Petra Cotes set about reconquering the husband by sharpening the only weapons that his daughter could not use on him. It too was an unnecessary effort because Meme had no desire to intervene in her father’s affairs and if she had, it would certainly have been in favor of the concubine. She had no time to bother anybody. She herself swept her room and made her bed, as the nuns had taught her. In the morning she took care of her clothes, sewing on the porch or using Amaranta’s old pedal machine. While the others were taking their siestas she would practice the clavichord for two hours, knowing that the daily sacrifice would keep Fernanda calm. For the same reason she continued giving concerts at church fairs and school parties, even though the requests were less and less frequent. At nightfall she would fix herself up, put on one of her simple dresses and her stiff high shoes, and if she had nothing to do with her father she would go to the homes of her girl friends, where she would stay until dinnertime. It was rare that Aureliano Segundo would not call for her then to take her to the movies.","Amaranta was startled to realize that the answer contained a hint of resentment. In contrast, Fernanda was so moved that she felt she was going mad when Meme woke up in the middle of the night, her head writhing in pain and choking on bile. She gave her a bottle of castor oil, placed a mustard plaster on her stomach, and applied an ice bag to her head, then put her on a diet and kept her in a draft-free room for five days according to the prescription of the newly arrived eccentric French doctor, who, after two hours of examination, came to the bizarre conclusion: the girl had menstrual disorders. In her state of mental collapse, Meme had no choice but to remain silent. Úrsula, now completely blind but still active and sharp, was the only one who diagnosed correctly. ""To me,"" she thought, ""these symptoms are clearly those of a drunkard. "" But not only did she dismiss that thought, she also blamed herself for her superficial thinking. Aureliano Segundo felt a pang of conscience when he saw Meme's exhausted condition, so he promised to pay more attention to her in the future. Thus, a close and cheerful relationship between father and daughter was born, which for a time freed him from lonely revelries and freed Meme from Fernanda's supervision without causing inevitable family quarrels. At that time, Aureliano Segundo ignored all commitments to be by her side. Meme, spending most of his free time taking her to the movies or the circus. In recent days, his bulky and slow body no longer allowed him to bend down to tie his shoelaces, and his exuberance had begun to wane. The discovery of his daughter revived his youthful exuberance, and the pleasure of being close to her gradually distanced him from his wasteful indulgences. Meme blossomed into adulthood. She was not beautiful, just as Amaranta had never been beautiful, but she was open, approachable, and gave an immediate impression of likability. She had a progressive mind. And this progressive mind pitied Fernanda's outdated pride and hardened heart, and was strongly supported by Aureliano Segundo. He was the one who decided to take her out of the bedroom from a young age, where the terrifying eyes of the saints continued to scare her even into adulthood, and he arranged for her a room with a cushioned bed, a spacious dressing room, and velvet curtains, not realizing that it was a replica of Petra Cotes' room. He was so generous with her that he didn't even know how much money he had, as she took it from his pockets, and he provided her with countless new jewelry whenever she visited the banana company's agents. Meme's room was filled with bags of pumice for polishing nails, hair curlers, tooth polishers, boxes of eye shadow, and an array of cosmetics and strange jewelry that every time Fernanda entered, she worried that her daughter's dressing room resembled that of modern prostitutes. However, during that period, Fernanda followed a schedule divided between caring for little Amaranta Úrsula, who was still fussy and often sick, and writing heartfelt letters to unseen doctors. So, when she discovered the collusion between her husband and daughter, the only promise she demanded from Aureliano Segundo was that he would not take Meme to Petra Cotes' house. It was a meaningless demand because the mistress was so upset by the intimacy between Aureliano Segundo and his daughter that she had no desire to get to know Meme. An unprecedented anxiety tormented her as if instinct had warned her that Meme only needed to love him to take away what Fernanda could not: a love considered to be a lifelong bond. For the first time, Aureliano Segundo had to endure the sulking and terrible tantrums of his mistress, so much so that he feared his traveling trunks would be sent back to his wife's house. But this did not happen. No woman understood a man as well as Petra Cotes understood her lover, and she knew that those trunks would remain where they were because if there was one thing Aureliano Segundo detested, it was disrupting his life with reforms and changes. So the trunks stayed put, and Petra Cotes set out to win back the man using the only weapon her daughter could not match. It was an unnecessary effort, as Meme had no intention of involving herself in her father's personal matters. She didn't have time to bother anyone. She swept her own room and made her bed as the nuns had taught her. In the morning, she sewed her dresses, sometimes embroidering on the porch, sometimes sewing with Amaranta's hand-cranked sewing machine. During siesta time, she practiced the piano for two hours, knowing that daily diligence would keep Fernanda calm. For the same reason, she continued to perform symphonies at charity sales and school events, even though invitations were becoming less frequent. In the evening, she groomed herself, wore the simplest clothes, put on high boots, and if she didn't need to accompany Aureliano Segundo, she would visit her friends until dinner time. It was rare for Aureliano Segundo not to come find her to take her to the movies.",24.665,24.579,"Amaranta shuddered when she sensed the obvious hatred in Meme's words. However, Fernanda was deeply moved by these words, and when Meme woke up at midnight with a splitting headache and began to vomit bile as if she were choking, her mother went mad with worry. She immediately gave her daughter castor oil. She applied water to her stomach, ice to her head, and kept her in bed for five days, following the diet prescribed by the newly arrived French doctor. The doctor had examined her for more than two hours, and in the end, unable to determine what it was, he dismissed it by saying it was a disease specific to women. Meme had lost her courage, her morale was broken, and she had no choice but to endure the doctor's advice. At that time, Ursula, who had become completely blind but had not lost her mobility and thinking ability, was the only person who found the real cause of the illness. -I think, this is something that happens to drunkards, he thought. Not only did he push this thought away from his mind, but he also felt resentful towards himself for even thinking such a thing. When Aureliano Segundo saw Meme's condition, he felt a pang of guilt and decided to pay more attention to his daughter from then on. The joyful friendship between father and daughter, which saved Aureliano Segundo from the painful loneliness of the parties he organized alone and from Fernanda's supervision without leading to an inevitable family tragedy, began after that incident. Aureliano Segundo was canceling his appointments to be with Meme, taking her to the cinema or the circus, and spending most of his free time with her. His gluttony, which had caused him to become so fat that he couldn't tie his shoes, had begun to tarnish his cheerful personality. Finding his daughter restored his former liveliness and joy. The pleasure he derived from being with his daughter gradually started to pull him out of his disarray. Meme was living the brightest period of her young womanhood. Just like Amaranta, Meme was not beautiful. But she was cute and good-natured. He knew how to make a positive impression on the people he met right from the start. Meme had a modern spirit that was very touching and quite contrary to Fernanda's antiquated dignity and the heart she tried to hide her misery in. Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, was trying to develop this aspect of his daughter. It was also Aureliano Segundo who decided that Meme should leave the room she had slept in since childhood, filled with statues of saints that frightened even his daughter with their fearful eyes. He furnished a new bedroom for his daughter. He bought a large bed, a big dressing table, hung velvet curtains, and while doing so, he didn't realize that he was creating a replica of Petra Cotes's room. He was so generous towards his daughter that he didn't even know how much money he gave to Meme. Because whenever the girl asked for money, she would reach into her father's pocket and take as much as she wanted. Aureliano Segundo made sure not to deprive his daughter of the new beauty products that arrived at the Banana Company's store. Meme's room was filled with nail polishes, curling irons, toothbrushes, drops to make her eyes look dreamy, and all kinds of new makeup and beauty products. Every time Fernanda entered the room, she would lose her mind thinking that her daughter's vanity table looked like that of a French courtesan. Well, in those days, Fernanda was spending all her time dealing with Amaranta Ursula, a mischievous and unhealthy child, and writing letters to invisible doctors seeking advice about her little daughter's health. When he saw that the father and daughter were inseparable, all he could do was to extract a promise from Aureliano Segundo that he would not take his daughter to Petra Cotes' house. This was a meaningless and unnecessary request. Because Aureliano Segundo's mistress was so disturbed and irritated by the friendship between her lover and the girl that she did not even want to hear the girl's name mentioned. Petra was seized by an inexplicable fear. It seemed to her as if Meme would accomplish what Fernanda could not, depriving her of the love she thought would last until death. For the first time, Aureliano Segundo tolerated his mistress's outbursts and shouting. He even feared that the traveling trunks would once again be on the road to his wife's house. Fortunately, that did not happen. No one could know anyone as Petra Cotes knew her lover, and Petra Cotes knew that if she sent the trunks, they would stay wherever they were sent. Because the thing Aureliano Segundo hated the most was disrupting his life due to changes. The chests remained in their places. Petra Cotes began sharpening weapons that her daughter couldn't use in order to win back her man. This was an unnecessary effort; because Meme had no intention of meddling in her father's affairs, and even if she did, she would undoubtedly side with her father's mistress, not her mother. Meme had no time to deal with anyone. As the nuns taught, she swept her room herself and made her own bed. In the mornings, she would sit on the veranda and sew her own clothes on Amaranta's old pedal machine. While the others took their afternoon nap, he practiced the piano for two hours. He knew that this daily sacrifice would keep Fernanda's mouth shut. Although the calls for her to give concerts were becoming less frequent, she still played the piano at church benefits and school meetings to keep her mother's mouth shut. In the late afternoon, she would tidy herself up, put on a simple outfit, wear her high-heeled shoes, and if she wasn't going somewhere with her father, she would go to one of her girlfriends' places and stay there until dinner time. After dinner, it was quite rare for Aureliano Segundo not to take her to the cinema.",18.501,18.389,"Amaranta was frightened by the evident load of hatred carried by the declaration. But Fernanda was so moved that she thought she would go crazy when Meme woke up at midnight with her head split by pain and choking on bile vomit. She gave her a bottle of castor oil, applied poultices to her abdomen and ice packs to her head, and forced her to follow the diet and five-day confinement ordered by the new and extravagant French doctor who, after examining her for more than two hours, came to the nebulous conclusion that she had a woman's disorder. Abandoned by courage, in a miserable state of demoralization, Meme had no other recourse but to endure. Úrsula, already completely blind but still active and lucid, was the only one who intuited the exact diagnosis. ""To me,"" she thought, ""these are the same things that happen to drunkards. "" But she not only rejected the idea, she reproached herself for the lightness of her thoughts. Aureliano Segundo felt a pang of conscience when he saw Meme's state of prostration and promised himself to take better care of her in the future. Thus was born the relationship of cheerful camaraderie between father and daughter, which freed him for a time from the bitter loneliness of his revelries and freed her from Fernanda's tutelage without having to provoke the domestic crisis that already seemed inevitable. Aureliano Segundo would then postpone any commitment to be with Meme, to take her to the movies or the circus, and he dedicated most of his leisure time to her. In recent times, the hindrance of absurd obesity that no longer allowed him to tie his shoelaces, and the abusive satisfaction of all kinds of appetites, had begun to sour his character. The discovery of his daughter restored his old joviality, and the pleasure of being with her gradually drew him away from dissipation. Meme was blossoming into a fruitful age. She was not beautiful, as Amaranta never was, but she was charming, uncomplicated, and had the virtue of being likable from the first moment. She had a modern spirit that hurt the outdated sobriety and poorly concealed miserly heart of Fernanda, which Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, delighted in sponsoring. He was the one who decided to move her out of the bedroom she had occupied since childhood, where the fearful eyes of the saints continued to feed her adolescent terrors, and furnished her a room with a throne-like bed, a large dresser, and velvet curtains, without realizing that he was making a second version of Petra Cotes's room. He was so generous with Meme that he didn't even know how much money he provided her, because she would take it from his pockets herself, and kept her informed of every beautifying novelty that arrived at the banana company's commissaries. Meme's room filled with pumice stone pads to polish her nails, hair curlers, tooth brighteners, eye drops to languish her gaze, and so many new cosmetics and beauty gadgets that every time Fernanda entered the bedroom, she was scandalized by the idea that her daughter's dresser must be like that of French matrons. However, Fernanda was at that time dividing her time between little Amaranta Úrsula, who was capricious and sickly, and an exciting correspondence with the invisible doctors. So when she noticed the complicity between father and daughter, the only promise she extracted from Aureliano Segundo was that he would never take Meme to Petra Cotes's house. It was a meaningless warning because the concubine was so upset with her lover's camaraderie with his daughter that she wanted nothing to do with her. She was tormented by an unknown fear, as if instinct told her that Meme, just by wishing it, could achieve what Fernanda could not: deprive her of a love she already considered assured until death. For the first time, Aureliano Segundo had to endure the hard faces and virulent tirades of the concubine, and he even feared that his carried and brought trunks would make their way back to his wife's house. This did not happen. Nobody knew a man better than Petra Cotes knew her lover, and she knew that the trunks would stay where they were sent because if there was something Aureliano Segundo detested, it was complicating his life with rectifications and moves. So the trunks stayed where they were, and Petra Cotes set out to win back her husband by sharpening the only weapons with which his daughter could not compete. It was also an unnecessary effort because Meme never intended to interfere in her father's affairs, and surely if she had, it would have been in favor of the concubine. She had no time to bother anyone. She herself swept the bedroom and made the bed, as the nuns had taught her. In the morning, she took care of her clothes, embroidering in the corridor or sewing on Amaranta's old hand-crank machine. While the others took a siesta, she practiced the clavichord for two hours, knowing that the daily sacrifice would keep Fernanda calm. For the same reason, she continued to give concerts at church bazaars and school soirées, although the requests were becoming less frequent. In the evening, she would get ready, put on her simple dresses and stiff boots, and if she had nothing to do with her father, she would go to friends' houses, where she stayed until dinner time. It was exceptional for Aureliano Segundo not to go and fetch her then to take her to the movies.",46.461,46.41
616,"Among Meme’s friends there were three young American girls who broke through the electrified chicken fence barrier and made friends with girls from Macondo. One of them was Patricia Brown. Grateful for the hospitality of Aureliano Segundo, Mr. Brown opened the doors of his house to Meme and invited her to the Saturday dances, which were the only ones where gringos and natives mingled. When Fernanda found out about it she forgot about Amaranta Úrsula and the invisible doctors for a moment and became very melodramatic. “Just think,” she said to Meme, “what the colonel must be thinking in his grave.” She sought, of course, the backing of Úrsula. But the blind old woman, contrary to what everyone expected, saw nothing reproachable in Meme’s going to the dances and making friends with American girls her own age as long as she kept her strict habits and was not converted to the Protestant religion. Meme sensed the thought of her great-great-grandmother very well and the day after the dances she would get up earlier than usual to go to mass. Fernanda’s opposition lasted until the day when Meme broke down her resistance with the news that the Americans wanted to hear her play the clavichord. The instrument was taken out of the house again and carried to Mr. Brown’s, where the young concert artist really did receive very sincere applause and the most enthusiastic congratulations. From then on she was invited not only to the dances but also to the Sunday swim parties in the pool and to lunch once a week. Meme learned to swim like a professional, to play tennis, and to eat Virginia ham with slices of pineapple. Among dances, swimming, and tennis she soon found herself getting involved in the English language. Aureliano Segundo was so enthusiastic over the progress of his daughter that from a traveling salesman he bought a six-volume English encyclopedia with many color prints which Meme read in her spare time. The reading occupied the attention that she had formerly given to gossip about sweethearts and the experimental retreats that she would go through with her girl friends, not because it was imposed as discipline but because she had lost all interest by then in talking about mysteries that were in the public domain. She looked back on the drunken episode as an infantile adventure and it seemed so funny to her that she told Aureliano Segundo about it and he thought it was more amusing than she did. “If your mother only knew,” he told her, doubling up with laughter, as he always said when he told her something in confidence. He had made her promise that she would let him know about her first love affair with the same confidence, and Meme told him that she liked a redheaded American boy who had come to spend his vacation with his parents. “What do you know,” Aureliano Segundo said, laughing. “If your mother only knew.” But Meme also told him that the boy had gone back to his country and had disappeared from sight. The maturity of her judgment ensured peace in the family. Aureliano Segundo then devoted more time to Petra Cotes, and although his body and soul no longer permitted him the debauches of days gone by, he lost no chance to arrange them and to dig out the accordion, which by then had some keys held in place by shoelaces. At home, Amaranta was weaving her interminable shroud and Úrsula dragged about in her decrepitude through the depths of the shadows where the only thing that was still visible was the ghost of José Arcadio Buendía under the chestnut tree. Fernanda consolidated her authority. Her monthly letters to her son José Arcadio at that time did not carry a string of lies and she hid from him only her correspondence with the invisible doctors, who had diagnosed a benign tumor in her large intestine and were preparing her for a telepathic operation.","Among Meme's friends, there were three American girls who had broken through the fence of the apartment complex, which resembled a ""chicken coop with electric wiring,"" and had formed friendships with the girls from Macondo village. One of these three girls was Patricia Brown. Out of gratitude for Aureliano Segundo's generosity, Mr. Brown opened his home to Meme and invited her to the Saturday dances, which were the only occasions where Americans and locals mingled. When Fernanda found out, she temporarily put aside caring for little Amaranta Úrsula and writing letters to her invisible doctors to make a big fuss about it. ""Just think about it,"" she said to Meme, ""what would the Colonel think from his grave?"". She sought Ursula's support. But the blind old woman, contrary to everyone's expectations, believed there was nothing to worry about in Meme attending the dances and maintaining friendships with the American girls, as long as her great-granddaughter always held firm to her principles and didn't become a follower of Protestantism. Meme understood her great-great-grandmother's thoughts perfectly, and the day after the dances, she would wake up earlier than usual to attend mass. Fernanda's opposition persisted until the day Meme announced that the Americans wanted to hear her play the piano, which made her change her stance. Once again, the piano was taken out of the house and brought to Mr. Brown's home, where the young pianist received the most sincere applause and the warmest congratulations. From then on, she was invited not only to the Saturday afternoon dances but also to the Sunday swimming sessions at the pool and a weekly lunch. Meme swam like a professional athlete, played tennis, and learned to eat Virginia sausages with pineapple slices. She quickly learned English during the dances, swimming sessions, and tennis practices. Aureliano Segundo was so delighted with his daughter's progress that he bought a six-volume English encyclopedia with many colored pictures from a traveling bookseller for her to read in her spare time. Reading consumed the time and attention she previously devoted to her beloved friend or to closing herself in her room with her girlfriends, not because she was forced to read as a discipline but because she had no interest in idle chatter, which was a common affliction among people. She recalled her drunken escapade as an innocent adventure that she found amusing enough to share with Aureliano Segundo, who enjoyed it even more than she did. ""If your mother knew,"" he said to his daughter, laughing heartily. As he often told her to believe in herself, he also told her that with that same confidence, she could reveal her first love to him. And so Meme told him about her closeness with a red-haired American boy who had come there for summer vacation with his parents. ""Quite the guy, huh?"" Aureliano Segundo laughed, ""If your mother knew."" But Meme also told him that the young American had returned to his country, and she hadn't heard from him since. Thus, her maturity in thinking ensured peace and harmony in the family. At this time, Aureliano Segundo spent more time with Petra Cotes, and although his body and soul no longer allowed him to indulge in wild partying as before, he didn't miss an opportunity to organize them and didn't leave the accordion alone, even though many keys had to be tied with shoelaces. At home, Amaranta sewed her shroud without knowing when it would be finished, while Ursula let old age drag her into the depths of blindness, where the only visible image was that of José Arcadio Buendía under the chestnut tree. Fernanda consolidated her power. The monthly letters she sent to her son José Arcadio now contained no lies, except for her correspondence with the invisible doctors, who had diagnosed an inflammation in her colon and were preparing to experiment with a remote treatment method.",29.501,29.384,"Among Meme's friends, there were three American girls who overcame the electric chicken wire barrier and made friends with the girls from Macondo. One of them was Patricia Brown. Mr. Brown, who gratefully accepted the hospitality shown to him by Aureliano Segundo, opened the doors of his house to Meme and invited her to the Saturday dances. The only place where the locals gathered and mingled was these dance meetings. When Fernanda learned this, she forgot about Amaranta Ursula and the invisible doctors for a moment and started to live a melodrama. To Meme, ""Imagine what the Colonel might be thinking in his grave,"" he said. Of course, he wanted Ursula to support him in this matter as well. However, the old, blind woman, contrary to what everyone thought, said that as long as Meme didn't lose her manners and didn't accept Protestantism, there was no harm in her going to dances and befriending American girls her age. Meme understood very well what her great-grandmother thought and would get up earlier than ever and rush to church the mornings after she went to the dance. Fernanda's opposition continued. However, one day, when Meme informed her that the Americans wanted her to play the piano, Fernanda gave up resisting. The piano was taken out of the house. It was moved to Mister Brown's house. The young concert artist received great applause at the concert she gave at Mister Brown's house. The guests warmly congratulated the young girl. From that day on, Meme started being invited to parties held at the swimming pool on Sundays, in addition to the Saturday dances, and to a weekly dinner. Meme learned to swim like professional swimmers, play tennis, and eat Virginia-style pineapple ham. Between dancing, swimming, and tennis, Meme suddenly realized that she had started to speak English, albeit imperfectly. Aureliano Segundo was very pleased with this development in his daughter and bought a six-volume English encyclopedia filled with colorful pictures from a traveling salesman. Meme never put down the encyclopedia in her free time. She stopped sitting with her girlfriends and talking about boys as she used to, gave up the experiments she did with the girls, and devoted all the time she had allocated to them to reading. There was no pressure for her to do so, but she no longer enjoyed talking about the secret things everyone already knew. She had started to see the day they drank as a childish adventure. This event seemed so ridiculous to her that she couldn't help but tell Aureliano Segundo. Aureliano Segundo found it even more ridiculous and amusing than his daughter had thought. Laughing so hard he doubled over, as he did whenever he talked about something related to his daughter, he said, ""Your mother should hear this."" He made her promise that she would confide in him about her first love with the same sense of trust, and Meme said she liked a red-haired American boy who had come to spend his vacation with the family. Aureliano Segundo burst into laughter and said, ""If your mother heard this."" Ama Meme also said that the young man had gone to his country and never returned. The maturity in Meme's decisions was preserving the family's harmony. After that, Aureliano Segundo started to spend more time with Petra Cotes. Even though both his spirit and body had reached a state where they could no longer handle the old excesses, Aureliano Segundo never missed an opportunity to throw a party. He even found and brought out his accordion, so old that some of its keys had to be held together with shoelaces. At home, Amaranta was weaving the endless shroud, and Ursula was wandering in her dark world where nothing but the ghost of Jose Arcadio Buendia under the chestnut tree could be seen. Fernanda was the only one who had a say at home. She no longer needed to fill the letters she wrote to her son Jose Arcadio every month with lies. The only thing she kept from her son was that the invisible doctors had found a tumor in her through correspondence and were preparing to remove it with a telepathic surgery.",22.738,22.609,"Among Meme's friends, there were three young American women who broke through the electrified chicken coop fence and established friendships with the girls of Macondo. One of them was Patricia Brown. Grateful for Aureliano Segundo's hospitality, Mr. Brown opened the doors of his house to Meme and invited her to the Saturday dances, which were the only occasions when the gringos mingled with the natives.

But the blind old woman, contrary to everyone's expectations, considered that there was nothing wrong with Meme attending the dances and cultivating friendships with the American girls of her age, as long as she maintained her firmness of judgment and did not let herself be converted to the Protestant religion. Meme understood her great-great-grandmother's thoughts very well, and the day after the dances, she would get up earlier than usual to go to mass. Fernanda's opposition lasted until the day Meme disarmed her with the news that the Americans wanted to hear her play the clavichord.

From then on, she was not only invited to the dances but also to the Sunday baths in the pool and to lunch once a week. Meme learned to swim like a professional, to play tennis, and to eat Virginia ham with pineapple slices. Between dances, pool, and tennis, she suddenly found herself untangling English. Aureliano Segundo was so enthusiastic about his daughter's progress that he bought from a traveling salesman an English encyclopedia in six volumes with numerous color plates, which Meme read in her free time. Reading occupied the attention she previously devoted to lovers' gossip or experimental seclusions with her friends, not because she had imposed it as a discipline, but because she had already lost all interest in discussing mysteries that were public knowledge. She remembered the drunkenness as a childish adventure and found it so amusing that she told Aureliano Segundo, who found it even more amusing than she did. “If your mother knew,” he said, choking with laughter, as he always did when she confided in him. He had made her promise that she would inform him with the same confidence about her first romance, and Meme had told him that she liked a red-haired American who had come to spend the holidays with his parents. “How outrageous,” laughed Aureliano Segundo. “If your mother knew.” But Meme also told him that the boy had returned to his country and had not shown any signs of life since. Her maturity of judgment strengthened domestic peace. Aureliano Segundo then spent more hours with Petra Cotes, and although his body and soul no longer allowed him to party as before, he never missed an opportunity to promote them and to pull out the accordion, which already had some keys tied with shoelaces. At home, Amaranta was embroidering her endless shroud, and Úrsula was being dragged by decrepitude into the depths of darkness, where the only visible thing was the specter of José Arcadio Buendía under the chestnut tree. Fernanda consolidated her authority. The monthly letters to her son José Arcadio then did not contain a single line of falsehood, and she only hid her correspondence with the invisible doctors, who had diagnosed a benign tumor in her large intestine and were preparing her for a telepathic intervention.",46.468,46.394
617,"It might have been aid that peace and happiness reigned for a long time in the tired mansion of the Buendías if it had not been for the sudden death of Amaranta, which caused a new uproar. It was an unexpected event. Although she was old and isolated from everyone, she still looked firm and upright and with the health of a rock that she had always had. No one knew her thoughts since the afternoon on which she had given Colonel Gerineldo Márquez his final rejection and shut herself up to weep. She was not seen to cry during the ascension to heaven of Remedios the Beauty or over the extermination of the Aurelianos or the death of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who was the person she loved most in this world, although she showed it only when they found his body under the chestnut tree. She helped pick up the body. She dressed him in his soldier’s uniform, shaved him, combed his hair, and waxed his mustache better than he had ever done in his days of glory. No one thought that there was any love in that act because they were accustomed to the familiarity of Amaranta with the rites of death. Fernanda was scandalized that she did not understand the relationship of Catholicism with life but only its relationship with death, as if it were not a religion but a compendium of funeral conventions. Amaranta was too wrapped up in the eggplant patch of her memories to understand those subtle apologetics. She had reached old age with all of her nostalgias intact. When she listened to the waltzes of Pietro Crespi she felt the same desire to weep that she had had in adolescence, as if time and harsh lessons had meant nothing. The rolls of music that she herself had thrown into the trash with the pretext that they had rotted from dampness kept spinning and playing in her memory. She had tried to sink them into the swampy passion that she allowed herself with her nephew Aureliano José and she tried to take refuge in the calm and virile protection of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, but she had not been able to overcome them, not even with the most desperate act of her old age when she would bathe the small José Arcadio three years before he was sent to the seminary and caress him not as a grandmother would have done with a grandchild, but as a woman would have done with a man, as it was said that the French matrons did and as she had wanted to do with Pietro Crespi at the age of twelve, fourteen, when she saw him in his dancing tights and with the magic wand with which he kept time to the metronome. At times It pained her to have let that outpouring of misery follow its course, and at times it made her so angry that she would prick her fingers with the needles, but what pained her most and enraged her most and made her most bitter was the fragrant and wormy guava grove of love that was dragging her toward death. Just as Colonel Aureliano Buendía thought about his war, unable to avoid it, so Amaranta thought about Rebeca. But while her brother had managed to sterilize his memories, she had only managed to make hers more scalding. The only thing that she asked of God for many years was that he would not visit on her the punishment of dying before Rebeca. Every time she passed by her house and noted the progress of destruction she took comfort in the idea that God was listening to her. One afternoon, when she was sewing on the porch, she was assailed by the certainty that she would be sitting in that place, in the same position, and under the same light when they brought her the news of Rebeca’s death. She sat down to wait for it, as one waits for a letter, and the fact was that at one time she would pull off buttons to sew them on again so that inactivity would not make the wait longer and more anxious. No one in the house realized that at that time Amaranta was sewing a fine shroud for Rebeca. Later on, when Aureliano Triste told how he had seen her changed into an apparition with leathery skin and a few golden threads on her skull, Amaranta was not surprised because the specter described was exactly what she had been imagining for some time. She had decided to restore Rebeca’s corpse, to disguise with paraffin the damage to her face and make a wig for her from the hair of the saints. She would manufacture a beautiful corpse, with the linen shroud and a plush-lined coffin with purple trim. and she would put it at the disposition of the worms with splendid funeral ceremonies. She worked out the plan with such hatred that it made her tremble to think about the scheme, which she would have carried out in exactly the same way if it had been done out of love, but she would not allow herself to become upset by the confusion and went on perfecting the details so minutely that she came to be more than a specialist and was a virtuoso in the rites of death. The only thing that she did not keep In mind in her fearsome plan was that in spite of her pleas to God she might die before Rebeca. That was, in fact, what happened. At the final moment, however, Amaranta did not feel frustrated, but on the contrary, free of all bitterness because death had awarded her the privilege of announcing itself several years ahead of time. She saw it on one burning afternoon sewing with her on the porch a short time after Meme had left for school. She saw it because it was a woman dressed in blue with long hair, with a sort of antiquated look, and with a certain resemblance to Pilar Ternera during the time when she had helped with the chores in the kitchen. Fernanda was present several times and did not see her, in spite of the fact that she was so real, so human, and on one occasion asked of Amaranta the favor of threading a needle. Death did not tell her when she was going to die or whether her hour was assigned before that of Rebeca, but ordered her to begin sewing her own shroud on the next sixth of April. She was authorized to make it as complicated and as fine as she wanted, but just as honestly executed as Rebeca’s, and she was told that she would die without pain, fear, or bitterness at dusk on the day that she finished it. Trying to waste the most time possible, Amaranta ordered some rough flax and spun the thread herself. She did it so carefully that the work alone took four years. Then she started the sewing. As she got closer to the unavoidable end she began to understand that only a miracle would allow her to prolong the work past Rebeca’s death, but the very concentration gave her the calmness that she needed to accept the idea of frustration. It was then that she understood the vicious circle of Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s little gold fishes. The world was reduced to the surface of her skin and her inner self was safe from all bitterness. It pained her not to have had that revelation many years before when it had still been possible to purify memories and reconstruct the universe under a new light and evoke without trembling Pietro Crespi’s smell of lavender at dusk and rescue Rebeca from her slough of misery, not out of hatred or out of love but because of the measureless understanding of solitude. The hatred that she noticed one night in Memes words did not upset her because it was directed at her, but she felt the repetition of another adolescence that seemed as clean as hers must have seemed and that, however, was already tainted with rancor. But by then her acceptance of her fate was so deep that she was not even upset by the certainty that all possibilities of rectification were closed to her. Her only objective was to finish the shroud. Instead of slowing it down with useless detail as she had done in the beginning, she speeded up the work. One week before she calculated that she would take the last stitch on the night of February 4, and without revealing the motives, she suggested to Meme that she move up a clavichord concert that she had arranged for the day after, but the girl paid no attention to her. Amaranta then looked for a way to delay for forty-eight hours, and she even thought that death was giving her her way because on the night of February fourth a storm caused a breakdown at the power plant. But on the following day, at eight in the morning, she took the last stitch in the most beautiful piece of work that any woman had ever finished, and she announced without the least bit of dramatics that she was going to die at dusk. She not only told the family but the whole town, because Amaranta had conceived of the idea that she could make up for a life of meanness with one last favor to the world, and she thought that no one was in a better position to take letters to the dead.","It is rumored that in the weary house of the Buendía family, there would be eternal warmth and happiness if Amaranta's sudden death did not once again throw the entire town into chaos. It was an unexpected event. Although she was old and lived completely isolated from everyone, people still saw her as steady and strong, walking upright with the enduring health she had always possessed. No one knew her thoughts since she resolutely rejected Colonel Gerineldo Márquez and shut herself in her room to cry alone. When she emerged from the room, she had exhausted all her tears. People did not see her cry over Remedios the Beauty ascending to heaven, over the massacre of all seventeen sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía in a short period, or over the death of the Colonel himself, whom she loved most in the world. Although she expressed her sorrow when everyone found his body under the chestnut tree, she did not shed a single tear. She helped to set the corpse upright. She dressed him in his warrior outfit, shaved him, combed his hair, and groomed his beard even better than he had during his glorious days. No one thought that in this gesture, she revealed her love because everyone was accustomed to Amaranta's proficiency in funeral rites. Fernanda flew into a rage, thinking that Amaranta did not understand Christianity's relationship with life but only its relationship with death, as if it were not a religion but merely a flyer for funeral formalities. Amaranta was too deeply immersed in her chaotic memories to comprehend those profound insinuations. She had reached old age with all her fresh, vivid recollections. When she heard Pietro Crespi's waltzes, she still had the urge to cry like in her youth, as if time and self-punishment meant nothing. The music tapes she had once thrown away under the pretext that they were ruined by moisture continued to play and beat rhythmically in her memory. She had intended to drown those desires in the sinful passion within permissible limits with her nephew Aureliano José and sought refuge under the healthy and noble protection of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, but she could not completely extinguish those desires even in the most desperate act of old age; that was when she bathed little José Arcadio three years before sending him to school and caressed him not as a grandmother would a grandchild but as a woman would a man, just as the modern prostitute did according to rumors and as she herself had wanted to do with Pietro Crespi at twelve or fourteen, seeing him in his dancing clothes and holding the magical baton to keep time from the metronome. Sometimes the scar on her hand caused her anguish for having followed her, and sometimes it made her so furious that she pricked her fingers with a needle, but the lush, fragrant guava garden of love approaching death caused her the most suffering, the most anger, and the most bitterness. As Colonel Aureliano Buendía thought of war, Amaranta thought of Rebeca, meaning it was unavoidable. But while her brother had found a way to dry out those memories, she only sought to inflame them further. The only thing she had prayed to God for many years was that He would not let her die before Rebeca. Every time she passed by Rebeca's house and saw it deteriorating more and more, she felt joy at the thought that God was hearing her prayer. One afternoon, while sewing in the hallway, a clear thought suddenly arose in her mind, and she realized that she would be sitting in that very spot, in that very position, and in that very light, when the news of Rebecca would be brought to her. She waited for the news as someone waits for a letter, and it was clear that there was a time when she would rip off all the buttons only to sew them back on again, simply because sitting idle could not compete with the long and painful wait. No one in the family knew that Amaranta was at that moment weaving a precious shroud for Rebecca. Later, when Aureliano Triste recounted that he had seen her turn into a wrinkled ghost with only a few tufts of blonde hair left on her head, she was not surprised at all because the described image was exactly the same as the image of Rebecca she had imagined for a long time. She had decided to reconstruct Rebecca's corpse, using wax to make her face plump and using hair from saint statues to create a wig for Rebecca. She would create a beautiful corpse with a linen shroud and a velvet-lined coffin adorned with red tassels, and she would place this coffin in the presence of the attendants typically seen at lavish funerals. She built this plan with so much hatred that she shuddered at the thought that she had organized this funeral as if with all her love, but she could not let the confusion deter her; instead, she continued to perfect the smallest details to the point where she became more skilled than a professional in funerals. The only thing she did not realize in this meticulously crafted plan was that she might die before Rebecca, even though she had fervently prayed to God. Indeed, that happened. But in the last days of her life, Amaranta did not feel sorrow; on the contrary, she felt liberated from all bitterness, because death had given her the honor of being forewarned that her death would occur a few years earlier than she had planned. One scorching afternoon, shortly after Meme had started school, while she was sewing in the hallway, she saw death. She recognized it immediately, and it was not frightening at all, because it was a woman dressed in sky-blue with long flowing hair, looking somewhat outdated, somewhat resembling the image of Pilar Ternera in the days when she used to help cook for the family. Sometimes Fernanda stood right in front of her, but she did not recognize her, even though Fernanda was very real, very human, even when she asked her to thread a needle. Death did not tell her when she would die, nor did it say whether her death would occur before Rebecca's, but it simply told her to start sewing her own shroud on the sixth of April. Death allowed her to make the shroud as elaborate and beautiful as she wished, but also as dignified as the one she had made for Rebecca. And death also told her that she would die without pain, without fear, and without bitterness on the very night she finished sewing her own shroud. To intentionally prolong the time, Amaranta spun the linen thread herself and wove the fabric by hand. She worked so meticulously that this task alone took her four years. Then she began the embroidery on the shroud. Thus, the inevitable day of completion drew closer, and with it, she increasingly understood that only a miracle would allow her to extend the work beyond Rebecca's death, but the concentration on her work restored the peace of mind she had lacked to accept the unfortunate thought. It was then that she understood the somewhat morbid cycle of production and consumption in Colonel Aureliano Buendía's goldfish-making. The outside world shrank to the surface of his skin, while his inner self remained outside all bitterness. She felt pained for not understanding this many years earlier, when she could still purify her memories and build a new world under a new light, recalling the lavender scent of Pietro Crespi at dusk without shuddering, and freeing Rebecca from her hatred, neither out of anger nor love, but simply out of sympathy for her loneliness. The hatred she recognized in Meme's words one night agitated her not because it offended her, but because she felt herself being repeated in another adolescence that seemed as pure as the one she should have had, and it was a pity that it had been tainted by personal resentment. But that was the moment when her resignation to her fate was so profound that it did not shake her before the evident truth that all doors leading to repentance had been closed. Her sole purpose now was to complete the shroud. Instead of working slower as she had initially done, she now hurried to finish it. A week earlier, she had calculated that on the night of February fourth, she would make the final stitch. Without revealing the reason, she asked Meme to perform the piano concert earlier than planned, the very next day, but her niece refused. So Amaranta found a way to extend the work by forty-eight more hours, and she thought death had agreed with her because on the night of February fourth, a storm knocked down the power lines. But the next day, at eight in the morning, she made the final stitch on the extraordinarily beautiful shroud that no woman had ever made, and without any suffering, she announced that she would die in the afternoon. She not only informed her family but also the entire village. Because Amaranta thought that a small life could end with helping the entire community, and she believed that no favor could be greater than carrying letters for the dead.",26.634,26.577,"If it weren't for Amaranta's unexpected death, it could be said that peace and happiness reigned for a long time in the weary house of the Buendias. However, Amaranta's death led to new chaos. Because it was an entirely unexpected event. Despite aging and distancing herself from everyone, Amaranta was still vigorous and upright. She appeared as solid as a rock. Since the day she last rejected Colonel Gerineldo Marquez and locked herself in her room to cry, no one knew what Amaranta was thinking. Neither when Beautiful Remedios ascended to heaven, nor when the Aurelianos were killed, nor even at the death of Colonel Aureliano Buendia, the person she loved most in this world, was Amaranta seen crying. The love she felt for the Colonel was only revealed when they found his corpse under the chestnut tree. Amaranta helped lift and carry the body. She dressed him in his uniform, shaved his beard with her own hand, combed his hair, and oiled his mustache more meticulously than in his brightest days. Because they knew how accustomed Amaranta was to funeral ceremonies, no one understood that what she did was a demonstration of her love. Fernanda complained that she did not understand Catholicism, saying that for Amaranta, religion had no connection with life, and she saw Catholicism, all its customs, all its ceremonies as something developed around death, existing solely to continue funeral ceremonies. Amaranta was too buried in her memories to understand these hints. She had grown old without fulfilling any of her longings. Her longings remained just as they were. Whenever she heard Pietro Crespi's waltzes, she wanted to cry like she did in her youth, as if the years she had lived and the painful lessons she had learned meant nothing. The music tapes that she had thrown away with her own hands, using the excuse that they had rotted from the damp, continued to play and spin in her head. Amaranta had tried to bury these music tapes in the mire of her passionate relationship with her nephew Aureliano Jose; she had wanted to take refuge under the dignified and manly wing of Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, but she could never overcome the tapes. As the most desperate and hopeless act of her old age, she had undertaken to bathe Jose Arcadio. Three years before the young man went to the theology faculty, Amaranta was undressing and bathing him, caressing him not like a grandmother caresses her grandson, but like a woman caresses a man, as much as she had heard about how French courtesans did it, and squeezing him here and there as she had wanted to do when she watched Pietro Crespi dancing to the metronome in his tight dance pants when she was twelve or fourteen years old. However, these did not help either, and Amaranta could not get Pietro Crespi's waltzes out of her mind. Being caught up in this great passion sometimes saddened Amaranta, and sometimes made her so angry that she would prick her hand with a needle. But what hurt her the most, what made her the angriest, what devastated her the most was the love that resembled those heavy-scented and worm-infested guava groves that drove her to death. Just as Colonel Aureliano Buendia could think of nothing but his wars, Amaranta could not get Rebeca out of her mind. However, despite her brother's success in freezing and rendering harmless his memories, Amaranta was making her own memories increasingly more wounding and destructive. For years, the only thing she asked of God was not to take her life before Rebeca's. Every time she passed by Rebeca's house, seeing it collapse a little more, she felt at ease, thinking God was granting her wish. One day, while sewing on the veranda, she suddenly had a premonition that, while she was sitting in the same place, in the same light, they would bring the news of Rebeca's death. And just like waiting for a letter, she sat down and began to wait for this news. Sometimes, so that the waiting wouldn't be longer and more sorrowful with idle hands, she would tear off buttons and sew them back on again. None of the household members realized that Amaranta was meticulously sewing a shroud for Rebeca. Later, when Aureliano Triste described how he saw Rebeca, how her skin was like leather, how only three strands of yellow hair were left on her head, and how she resembled a ghost in that state, Amaranta was not surprised at all. Because what the young man described was no different from the image he had constructed in his own mind. He decided to beautify Rebeca's corpse. He would cover the wrinkles on her face with paraffin and make a wig for her from the hair of saint statues. He would reveal a very marvelous corpse with the linen woven shroud. He would line the inside of the coffin with plush velvet and surround the edges with purple ribbons. Then, with a grand funeral ceremony, he would offer the coffin and Rebeca to the wolves as prey. He conceived these with such great hatred that he shuddered whenever he thought of his own plots. If Amaranta had entered such an obsession because of love, she would have devised everything in the same way. She was preparing all the details of the funeral ceremony perfectly so as not to forget anything in the chaos. She gradually became an unparalleled expert on funeral ceremonies. The only thing she forgot in this terrible plan was the possibility that, despite all her prayers, she might die before Rebeca, which indeed happened. Ama, Amaranta did not feel any pain. On the contrary, she died free from all pain and evil because death had given her a privilege by announcing its arrival several years in advance. Shortly after Meme went to school, one day while sitting on the veranda, Amaranta saw death sitting with her, sewing. She saw it with her own eyes because death was in the guise of a woman dressed in blue, with long hair, from ancient times. It somewhat resembled the days when Pilar Ternera came to help with the kitchen chores. When Amaranta saw death, Fernanda was there a few times, but she did not see it. Yet the truth was as tangible as a human being. Once, she even asked Amaranta to thread her needle. Death never mentioned to Amaranta when she would die or whether her time would come before Rebeca's. It only told her to start sewing her shroud on the sixth of April. It allowed her to work as she wished and to make a beautiful shroud as she desired. However, it stipulated that she should prepare her own shroud with the same honesty she had shown while weaving Rebeca's shroud, without any procrastination and with meticulous care. And it said that on the evening of the day she finished the shroud, she would die without any pain, without any fear, and far from all evil. To prolong the task as much as possible, Amaranta ordered raw linen and spun the thread herself. He was doing the thread spinning job with such care that it took four years. Then she began to sew. As the inevitable end approached, she realized that it would only be possible to extend her work beyond Rebeca's death by a miracle. This thought gave her the composure needed to accept defeat. It was then that Amaranta understood the reason for the vicious cycle created by Colonel Aureliano Buendía's ornamental fish. The world now only lingered on Amaranta's skin; her inner self was purified of all evils. Amaranta was saddened that she had not grasped this years ago. Then she could have purified her memories, rebuilt the universe with a new light, recalled the lavender scent of Pietro Crespi in the evenings without shuddering, and could have saved Rebeca from that misery because she knew what loneliness meant, whether she hated or loved her. The hatred in Meme's drunken words when she came home that evening did not upset her. That evening, while looking at Meme, she felt as if she was seeing the vision of another young girl. She thought that once upon a time, that young girl also seemed as innocent as Meme, yet had long been tainted by feelings of hatred. When Amaranta realized this, she had accepted her fate so completely that knowing all chances of change and improvement were lost no longer shook her. He had no purpose left other than finishing his shroud. Therefore, he stopped wasting time on unnecessary details as he did in the beginning and sped up the work. A week before her death, she calculated that the sewing would be finished on the night of February 4th and, without giving any reason, told Meme to postpone the concert she had planned for the next day. Meme did not pay attention to her. As a result, Amaranta looked for ways to extend the work by forty-eight hours. When the storm that broke out on the night of February 4 caused damage to the power plant, he thought the solution he was looking for was given by death itself. However, until that day, the final stitch of the shroud, which was the most beautiful work ever created by a woman in the world, was also completed at eight the next morning, and without taking on a pitiful air, he announced that he would die that evening. He not only told this to the household but also announced it to the entire town. Because he believed that he could atone for a life spent in wickedness by doing one last good deed for the world, and he thought the best thing he could do was to deliver the letters of those who did not want to send news to their dead.",18.992,18.922,"It might have been said that in the weary mansion of the Buendías there was peace and routine happiness for a long time if Amaranta's untimely death had not caused a new scandal. It was an unexpected event. Although she was old and isolated from everyone, she still appeared firm and upright, with the stone-like health she had always had. Nobody knew her thoughts since the afternoon she definitively rejected Colonel Gerineldo Márquez and locked herself in to cry. When she came out, she had exhausted all her tears. She was not seen crying at the ascension of Remedios the Beauty, nor at the extermination of the Aurelianos, nor at the death of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who was the person she loved most in this world, although she could only show it when they found his body under the chestnut tree. She helped lift the body. She dressed him in his warrior gear, shaved him, combed him, and glued his mustache better than he had ever done in his years of glory. Nobody thought there was love in that act, because they were used to Amaranta's familiarity with the rites of death. Fernanda was scandalized that she did not understand the relations of Catholicism with life, but only its relations with death, as if it were not a religion, but a prospectus of funeral conventions. Amaranta was too entangled in the thicket of her memories to understand those apologetic subtleties. She had reached old age with all her nostalgias alive. When she listened to Pietro Crespi's waltzes, she felt the same desire to cry that she had in her adolescence, as if time and lessons had served no purpose. The music rolls she herself had thrown away, under the pretext that they were rotting with humidity, kept spinning and striking hammers in her memory. She had tried to sink them in the swampy passion she allowed herself with her nephew Aureliano José, and had tried to take refuge in the serene and virile protection of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, but she had not managed to defeat them even with the most desperate act of her old age, when she bathed little José Arcadio three years before he was sent to the seminary, and caressed him not as a grandmother would with a grandson, but as a woman would with a man, as it was said French matrons did, and as she had wanted to do with Pietro Crespi, at twelve, fourteen years old, when she saw him with his dancing pants and the magic wand with which he kept the metronome's beat. Sometimes it hurt her to have left that trail of misery in her wake, and sometimes she was so angry that she pricked her fingers with the needles, but it hurt her more and made her angrier and more bitter the fragrant and worm-eaten guava grove of love she was dragging towards death. Just as Colonel Aureliano Buendía thought about the war, unable to avoid it, Amaranta thought about Rebeca. But while her brother had managed to sterilize the memories, she had only managed to scald them. The only thing she prayed to God for many years was that He would not punish her by making her die before Rebeca. Every time she passed by her house and noticed the progress of the destruction, she was pleased with the idea that God was listening to her. One afternoon, while sewing in the corridor, she was struck by the certainty that she would be sitting in that place, in that same position and under that same light, when they brought her the news of Rebeca's death. She sat down to wait for it, as one waits for a letter, and it was true that at one time she would rip off buttons to sew them back on, so that idleness would not make the wait longer and more distressing. Nobody in the house noticed that Amaranta then wove a beautiful shroud for Rebeca. Later, when Aureliano Triste said he had seen her turned into an apparition, with cracked skin and a few yellowish strands on her skull, Amaranta was not surprised, because the specter described was exactly as she had imagined it for a long time. She had decided to restore Rebeca's corpse, to disguise the ravages of her face with paraffin and make her a wig with the hair of saints. She would make a beautiful corpse, with the linen shroud and a plush-lined coffin with purple trimmings, and she would put it at the disposal of the worms in a splendid funeral. She elaborated the plan with so much hatred that the idea of having done it the same way if it had been out of love made her shudder, but she did not let herself be dazed by the confusion, and continued perfecting the details so meticulously that she became, more than a specialist, a virtuoso in the rites of death. The only thing she did not take into account in her tremendous plan was that, despite her pleas to God, she might die before Rebeca. And so it happened, indeed. But in the final moment, Amaranta did not feel frustrated, but on the contrary, liberated from all bitterness, because death granted her the privilege of announcing itself several years in advance. She saw it one scorching midday, sewing with her in the corridor, shortly after Meme had gone to school. She recognized it immediately, and there was nothing terrifying about death, because it was a woman dressed in blue with long hair, somewhat old-fashioned in appearance, and with a certain resemblance to Pilar Ternera in the time when she helped them with kitchen chores. Several times Fernanda was present and did not see her, even though she was so real, so human, that on one occasion she asked Amaranta to thread a needle for her. Death did not tell her when she was going to die or if her time was set before Rebeca's, but ordered her to start weaving her own shroud on the next sixth of April. It authorized her to make it as complicated and exquisite as she wanted, but as honestly as she had made Rebeca's, and warned her that she would die without pain, fear, or bitterness, at dusk on the day she finished it. Trying to waste as much time as possible, Amaranta ordered the bayal linen threads and made the fabric herself. She did it so carefully that just that task took her four years. Then she began the embroidery. As the inevitable end approached, she understood that only a miracle would allow her to prolong the work beyond Rebeca's death, but the same concentration provided her with the calm she needed to accept the idea of frustration. It was then that she understood the vicious circle of Colonel Aureliano Buendía's goldfish. The world was reduced to the surface of her skin, and the interior was safe from all bitterness. It pained her not to have had that revelation many years earlier, when it was still possible to purify memories and rebuild the universe under a new light, and to evoke without shuddering the lavender scent of Pietro Crespi at dusk, and to rescue Rebeca from her mire of misery, not out of hatred or love, but out of boundless understanding of solitude. The hatred she noticed one night in Meme's words did not move her because it affected her, but because she felt herself repeated in another adolescence that seemed as clean as hers must have seemed and yet was already tainted by resentment. But then her acceptance of her destiny was so deep that not even the certainty that all possibilities of rectification were closed unsettled her. Her only goal was to finish the shroud. Instead of delaying it with useless embellishments, as she had done at the beginning, she sped up the work. A week before, she calculated that she would give the last stitch on the night of February fourth, and without revealing the reason, she suggested to Meme that she move up a clavichord concert she had planned for the next day, but she did not listen. Amaranta then sought a way to delay herself forty-eight hours, and even thought that death was pleasing her, because on the night of February fourth a storm disrupted the power plant. But the next day, at eight in the morning, she gave the last stitch in the most exquisite work any woman had ever finished, and announced without the slightest drama that she would die at dusk. She not only warned the family but the entire town, because Amaranta had come to the idea that a life of meanness could be repaired with one last favor to the world, and thought that none was better than taking letters to the dead.",50.495,50.466
618,"The news that Amaranta Buendía was sailing at dusk carrying the mail of death spread throughout Macondo before noon, and at three in the afternoon there was a whole carton full of letters in the parlor. Those who did not want to write gave Amaranta verbal messages, which she wrote down in a notebook with the name and date of death of the recipient. “Don’t worry,” she told the senders. “The first thing I’ll do when I get there is to ask for him and give him your message.” It was farcical. Amaranta did not show any upset or the slightest sign of grief, and she even looked a bit rejuvenated by a duty accomplished. She was as straight and as thin as ever. If it had not been for her hardened cheekbones and a few missing teeth, she would have looked much younger than she really was. She herself arranged for them to put the letters in a box sealed with pitch and told them to place it in her grave in a way best to protect it from the dampness. In the morning she had a carpenter called who took her measurements for the coffin as she stood in the parlor, as if it were for a new dress. She showed such vigor in her last hours that Fernanda thought she was making fun of everyone. Úrsula, with the experience that Buendías died without any illness, did not doubt at all that Amaranta had received an omen of death, but in any case she was tormented by the fear that with the business of the letters and the anxiety of the senders for them to arrive quickly they would bury her alive in their confusion. So she set about clearing out the house, arguing with the intruders as she shouted at them, and by four in the afternoon she was successful. At that time Amaranta had finished dividing her things among the poor and had left on the severe coffin of unfinished boards only the change of clothing and the simple cloth slippers that she would wear in death. She did not neglect that precaution because she remembered that when Colonel Aureliano Buendía died they had to buy a pair of new shoes for him because all he had left were the bedroom slippers that he wore in the workshop. A little before five Aureliano Segundo came to fetch Meme for the concert and was surprised that the house was prepared for the funeral. if anyone seemed alive at the moment it was the serene Amaranta, who had even had enough time to cut her corns. Aureliano Segundo and Meme took leave of her with mocking farewells and promised her that on the following Saturday they would have a big resurrection party. Drawn by the public talk that Amaranta Buendía was receiving letters for the dead, Father Antonio Isabel arrived at five o’clock for the last rites and he had to wait for more than fifteen minutes for the recipient to come out of her bath. When he saw her appear in a madapollam nightshirt and with her hair loose over her shoulders, the decrepit parish priest thought that it was a trick and sent the altar boy away. He thought however, that he would take advantage of the occasion to have Amaranta confess after twenty years of reticence. Amaranta answered simply that she did not need spiritual help of any kind because her conscience was clean. Fernanda was scandalized. Without caring that people could hear her she asked herself aloud what horrible sin Amaranta had committed to make her prefer an impious death to the shame of confession. Thereupon Amaranta lay down and made Úrsula give public testimony as to her virginity.","The news that at sunset Amaranta Buendía would depart from this world and could carry letters for the dead spread throughout the town of Macondo, and by three in the afternoon, there was a box full of letters in the living room. Those who did not want to write asked Amaranta to convey their messages orally, and she recorded the messages in a notebook along with the names and dates of death of the recipients. ""Don't worry,"" she reassured the message senders, ""The first thing I will do when I get there is to inquire about him, and I will relay your message."" It seemed like a farce. Amaranta did not show any signs of anxiety, nor did she grimace in pain; moreover, the task even made her look a bit younger. As usual, she was still cheerful and lively. If her cheeks were not wrinkled and her mouth had not lost a few teeth, she would surely appear less old than her current aged appearance. She herself had ordered that the letters be placed in a painted box and instructed how to place the box in the tomb to better protect it from the destructive effects of moisture. Early in the morning, she had called a carpenter and stood in the living room while he measured for the coffin, just as a tailor would measure for a suit. That strength suddenly revived in her in the final moments of her life, making Fernanda think she was mocking and playing with everyone. Úrsula, with her own experience showing that members of the Buendía family would die without illness, did not doubt that Amaranta had received a premonition of death. However, she first feared that in the process of delivering letters to the dead and the eagerness to get the letters to the recipients quickly, Amaranta might be buried alive. So she personally drove people out of the house, sometimes having to shout to argue with those who were too stubborn. Finally, by four in the afternoon, she had managed to significantly reduce the number of visitors. At that same hour, Amaranta distributed her personal belongings to the poor, leaving only a simple coffin made of unplaned boards, a set of clothes to change into, and a pair of velvet shoes she would wear in death. This caution was not in vain, as she remembered that when Colonel Aureliano Buendía died, she had to buy him a new pair of shoes because he only had slippers used in the gold workshop. Just before five o'clock, Aureliano Segundo came home to find Meme so they could attend a concert together, and he was surprised to see the house prepared for a funeral. If anyone was alive at that hour, it was the healthy Amaranta, who still had enough time to cut off the calluses on her skin. Aureliano Segundo and Meme bid her farewell with mocking words and promised her that next Saturday they would hold a resurrection celebration. Drawn by the rumors that Amaranta Buendía was receiving letters to deliver to the dead, Father Antonio Isabel brought the Eucharist for the dying to the house at five o'clock and had to wait fifteen minutes for the supposedly dying woman to come out of the bath. When he saw her appear in a cotton nightgown with her hair loose down her back, the old priest believed it was a joke and immediately canceled the last rites. However, he thought it necessary to take this opportunity to make Amaranta confess why she hadn't attended church in twenty years. Amaranta simply replied that she saw no need to attend any church services because her conscience was always very clear. Fernanda, irritated and unable to hold her tongue, loudly asked if Amaranta would commit a more heinous sin by wishing for a sacrilegious death without confession out of shame. So Amaranta lay down and forced Úrsula to publicly attest to her chastity.",22.028,21.881,"The news that Amaranta Buendía would be taking the mail from the realm of the dead with her to the other world that evening spread throughout Macondo before noon. By three o'clock in the afternoon, letters were piled high inside the cardboard box in the living room. Those who did not want to write letters sent messages by word of mouth, and Amaranta noted down the name of the recipient, the date of death, and the message in a notebook. ""Don't worry at all,"" she said. ""As soon as I get there, my first task will be to find them and deliver your message."" It was a ridiculous situation. Amaranta was neither panicking nor upset. In fact, she was filled with the liveliness and joy that comes from having completed a task. She was as upright and slender as always. If her cheeks hadn't sunken and if she hadn't lost a few teeth, she would have looked much younger than she was. She instructed them to put the letters in a chest, seal it with tar, and place it in her grave in a way that would minimize damage from moisture. In the morning, she summoned a carpenter. She stood in the living room as if she were getting a new dress made, and had her measurements taken for her coffin. In her final hours, she was so lively that Fernanda thought she was mocking everyone. However, Ursula, who knew well that the Buendías died without suffering, had no doubt that Amaranta was going to die. But she feared that in the chaos of those who wanted the letters to be sent off as soon as possible, the girl would be buried alive, as this letter business would cause trouble for them. Therefore, she set about getting rid of those who had crowded into the house. Someone was resisting coming out, arguing. Anyway, at four o'clock, Ursula managed to clear the house. By that time, Amaranta had finished distributing her belongings to the poor and had left only the clean clothes and slippers she would wear after death on the un-nailed coffin. She had not forgotten to take this precaution because she remembered how they had to buy new shoes when Colonel Aureliano Buendia died, as he had nothing left but the slippers he wore in his workshop. As it approached five o'clock, Aureliano Segundo arrived to take Meme to a concert and was surprised to see the house prepared for a funeral. If there was anyone who seemed like they would never die at that moment, it was Amaranta. She was sitting and cutting her corns. Aureliano Segundo and Meme jokingly said their goodbyes to her, promising to hold a big celebration in her honor when she returned to the world the following Saturday, and then left. Father Antonio Isabel, who had heard that Amaranta Buendia was collecting letters to take to the dead, arrived at five o'clock to perform her last rites and waited more than fifteen minutes for Amaranta to come out of the bathroom. When the priest saw Amaranta with her hair falling over her shoulders, appearing in her nightgown, he suspected something was amiss and sent his assistant boy back. Since he was already there, he decided to hear Amaranta's confession after twenty years of silence. Amaranta curtly replied that she did not need any spiritual assistance because her conscience was clear. Upon hearing this, Fernanda was horrified. Without caring whether those in the room could hear or not, she wondered what terrible sin Amaranta had committed to prefer going to her death without confession. he asked Amaranta if she was. Upon this, Amaranta lay down and had Ursula confirm in front of everyone that she was a virgin.",21.315,21.153,"The news that Amaranta Buendía was setting sail at dusk carrying the mail of death spread in Macondo before noon, and by three in the afternoon there was a box full of letters in the living room.

Amaranta did not reveal any disturbance, not the slightest sign of pain, and she even looked a bit rejuvenated by the duty fulfilled. She was as upright and slender as always. If it hadn't been for the hardened cheekbones and the lack of some teeth, she would have seemed much less old than she actually was. She herself arranged for the letters to be put in a tarred box, and indicated how it should be placed in the tomb to better preserve it from moisture. In the morning she had called a carpenter who took her measurements for the coffin, standing in the living room, as if they were for a dress. Such dynamism awoke in her in the last hours that Fernanda believed she was mocking everyone. Úrsula, with the experience that the Buendías died without illness, did not doubt that Amaranta had had the premonition of death, but in any case, she was tormented by the fear that in the rush of the letters and the anxiety for them to arrive soon, the confused senders might bury her alive.

Attracted by the public voices that Amaranta Buendía was receiving letters for the dead, Father Antonio Isabel arrived at five with the viaticum, and had to wait more than fifteen minutes for the dying woman to come out of the bathroom. When he saw her appear in a madapolán nightgown with her hair loose down her back, the decrepit priest thought it was a joke and dismissed the altar boy. He thought, however, to take advantage of the occasion to confess Amaranta after almost twenty years of reticence. Amaranta simply replied that she did not need any kind of spiritual assistance because she had a clear conscience. Fernanda was scandalized. Without caring that she might be overheard, she wondered aloud what dreadful sin Amaranta had committed that she preferred a sacrilegious death to the shame of a confession. Then Amaranta lay down and forced Úrsula to publicly testify to her virginity.",44.301,44.211

Even so she finally noticed the deep silences, the sudden outbursts, the changes in mood, and the contradictions of her daughter. She set about on a disguised but implacable vigilance. She let her go out with her girl friends as always, she helped her get dressed for the Saturday parties, and she never asked an embarrassing question that might arouse her. She already had a great deal of proof that Meme was doing different things from what she said, and yet she would give no indication of her suspicions, hoping for the right moment.

He was young, sallow, with dark and melancholy eyes which would not have startled her so much if she had known the gypsies, and a dreamy air that to any woman with a heart less rigid would have been enough to make her understand her daughter’s motives. He was wearing a shabby linen suit with shoes that showed the desperate defense of superimposed patches of white zinc, and in his hand he was carrying a straw hat he had bought the Saturday before. In all of his life he could never have been as frightened as at that moment, but he had a dignity and presence that spared him from humiliation and a genuine elegance that was defeated only by tarnished hands and nails that had been shattered by rough work.

He was wearing common linen clothes, shabby white patent leather shoes, and holding a straw hat he had bought the previous Saturday. In his life, he had never been as frightened as he was at this moment, but he possessed self-respect and self-control, precious qualities that saved him from falling into a state of subservience, and he had a well-proportioned body, though his hands were calloused and his nails chipped from hard labor. To Fernanda, just a glance was enough for her to recognize his profession as a mechanic. She noticed that he was still wearing his only Sunday outfit and beneath his shirt was a layer of skin mottled and flaking from the itch caused by the Banana Company.

He had an old linen garment on his back, shoes on his feet that had become unpatchable from being mended so many times, and a straw hat in his hand that he had bought on Saturday. The young man had never been as timid as he was at that moment in his entire life. Fortunately, he had a dignity and personality that saved him from making a fool of himself, along with a natural grace. The only aspect that marred this delicacy was his hands, worn out by hard work, and his neglected nails. Fernanda realized at first glance that he was a laborer.

630,"His name was Mauricio Babilonia. He had been born and raised in Macondo, and he was an apprentice mechanic in the banana company garage. Meme had met him by chance one afternoon when she went with Patricia Brown to get a car to take a drive through the groves. Since the chauffeur was sick they assigned him to take them and Meme was finally able to satisfy her desire to sit next to the driver and see what he did. Unlike the regular chauffeur, Mauricio Babilonia gave her a practical lesson. That was during the time that Meme was beginning to frequent Mr. Brown’s house and it was still considered improper for a lady to drive a car. So she was satisfied with the technical information and she did not see Mauricio Babilonia again for several months. Later on she would remember that during the drive her attention had been called to his masculine beauty, except for the coarseness of his hands, but that afterward she had mentioned to Patricia Brown that she had been bothered by his rather proud sense of security. The first Saturday that she went to the movies with her father she saw Mauricio Babilonia again, with his linen suit, sitting a few seats away from them, and she noticed that he was not paying much attention to the film in order to turn around and look at her. Meme was bothered by the vulgarity of that. Afterward Mauricio Babilonia came over to say hello to Aureliano Segundo and only then did Meme find out that they knew each other because he had worked in Aureliano Triste’s early power plant and he treated her father with the air of an employee. That fact relieved the dislike that his pride had caused in her. They had never been alone together nor had they spoken except in way of greeting, the night when she dreamed that he was saving her from a shipwreck and she did not feel gratitude but rage. It was as if she had given him the opportunity he was waiting for, since Meme yearned for just the opposite, not only with Mauricio Babilonia but with any other man who was interested in her. Therefore she was so indignant after the dream that instead of hating him, she felt an irresistible urge to see him. The anxiety became more intense during the course of the week and on Saturday it was so pressing that she had to make a great effort for Mauricio Babilonia not to notice that when he greeted her in the movies her heart was in her mouth. Dazed by a confused feeling of pleasure and rage, she gave him her hand for the first time and only then did Mauricio Babilonia let himself shake hers. Meme managed to repent her impulse in a fraction of a second but the repentance changed immediately into a cruel satisfaction on seeing that his hand too was sweaty and cold. That night she realized that she would not have a moment of rest until she showed Mauricio Babilonia the uselessness of his aspiration and she spent the week turning that anxiety about in her mind. She resorted to all kinds of useless tricks so that Patricia Brown would go get the car with her. Finally she made use of the American redhead who was spending his vacation in Macondo at that time and with the pretext of learning about new models of cars she had him take her to the garage. From the moment she saw him Meme let herself be deceived by herself and believed that what was really going on was that she could not bear the desire to be alone with Mauricio Babilonia, and she was made indignant by the certainty that he understood that when he saw her arrive.","His name was Mauricio Babilonia. He was born and raised in the town of Macondo and was an apprentice mechanic in the workshops of the banana company. It was only by chance that Meme met him one afternoon while she was out with Patricia Brown looking for a car to drive around the banana fields. Because the driver was sick, he was assigned to drive the girls around, and Meme fulfilled her wish of sitting close to the driver to watch him drive. Unlike the regular driver, Mauricio Babilonia put on a show for her. That was the time when Meme often visited Mr. Brown's house, and it was also a time when women drivers were still looked down upon. Yet, Meme was content with just learning the theory and did not visit Mauricio Babilonia for several months. But after a while, she might have remembered that during their outing, his strong and handsome body, except for his rough hands, had caught her attention, but later she complained to Patricia Brown about her discomfort caused by his somewhat arrogant confidence. On the first Saturday she went to the movies with her father, she saw Mauricio Babilonia again, still wearing his linen clothes, sitting not far from them, and she felt that he was not interested in the movie but kept turning his head to look at her, not just to see her but to let her know that he was looking at her. Meme was uncomfortable with this rude behavior. At the end of the movie, Mauricio Babilonia approached to greet Aureliano Segundo, and it was only then that Meme realized they knew each other because he had worked at the first power plant in Macondo, owned by Aureliano Triste, and he behaved towards her father with the attitude of a subordinate. Witnessing this eased the discomfort his arrogance had caused her. They did not meet privately, nor did they exchange any words beyond polite greetings, but the night she dreamed that he saved her from drowning, she was not grateful but angry with him. Because the dream suggested that she had given him the opportunity he had always wished for, while Meme desired the opposite, not just with Mauricio Babilonia but with any boy who loved her. Thus, she was so angry with him that after the dream, instead of hating him, she felt the need to see him immediately. The eagerness to see him again grew stronger throughout the week. And Saturday came so quickly that she had to make a great effort to ensure that Mauricio Babilonia, when greeting her at the cinema, did not notice her heart pounding out of her chest. Overwhelmed by mixed feelings of joy and anger, for the first time she extended her hand to him, and only then did Mauricio Babilonia allow himself to shake her hand firmly. For a moment, Meme began to regret her boldness, but the regret immediately turned into intense satisfaction when she realized that his hand was also sweaty and cold. That night she understood that she would not have a moment of peace until she showed Mauricio Babilonia the emptiness of her soul, and so she spent the entire week wandering around in that longing. She tried every trick to get Patricia Brown to take her to find the car but to no avail. Finally, she had to rely on the red-haired American boy who had come to Macondo for the summer with his family, and under the pretext of looking at new car models, she made him take her to the workshop. From the moment she saw him, Meme could no longer deceive herself and understood that in reality, she could not resist the desire to be alone with Mauricio Babilonia, but the certainty that he had understood her feelings as soon as he saw her made her angry.",26.216,26.082,"The young man's name was Mauricio Babilonia. He was born and raised in Macondo. He was the assistant foreman in the Banana Company's garage. Meme had met the young man when she went to the garage to get the car to go for a walk in the grove with Patricia Brown one day. Because the driver was sick, they had taken him along to drive the car. Meme had finally been able to do what she had wanted for a long time, sitting next to the driver and watching how he drove the car. Mauricio Babilonia, doing what the regular driver did not, had given Meme practical driving lessons. This event had occurred around the time Meme started visiting the Browns' house frequently. Back then, women driving cars was not well accepted. Therefore, Meme had to be content with the technical knowledge she had acquired and had not seen Mauricio Babilonia for a few months. She remembered much later that during the car ride, aside from the neglect of his hands, the young man's masculine beauty had caught her attention. However, when they got out of the car, Meme told Patricia Brown that she was annoyed by the young man's confident demeanor. On the first Saturday that Meme went to the cinema with her father, she saw Maurice Babilonia again. He was sitting a few seats away from them, wearing linen clothes. Meme noticed that the young man wasn't watching the movie; he kept turning around and looking at her. She was irritated by his rude, disrespectful behavior. Later, when Mauricio Babilonia came over to ask Aureliano Segundo how he was doing, Meme realized that the young man had known her father since the days he worked at Aureliano Triste's power plant. The young man stood beside her father with the demeanor of a worker talking to his boss. When Meme saw this, her anger at the young man's proud attitude vanished. During a time when they never found themselves alone together and only exchanged greetings, one night Meme dreamed of Mauricio Babilonia. In her dream, the ship was sinking and the young man was saving Meme. She felt as if the man had given her the opportunity she had been waiting for. Because Meme turned away not only from Mauricio Babilonia but from every man who showed interest in her. When she woke up, she was so angry that instead of hating the young man, she felt an urge to see him as soon as possible. This urge intensified more and more throughout the week. When they met at the cinema on Saturday night, Meme's heart was about to leap out of her chest. She was terrified that Mauricio Babilonia would notice her excitement. With a mix of anger and joy, Meme extended her hand for the first time, and Mauricio Babilonia shook her hand for the first time. Although Meme felt a moment of regret, when she saw that the young man's hand was as sweaty and cold from excitement as hers, her regret vanished in an instant, replaced by a sense of satisfaction. Meme realized that she would not feel at ease until she showed Mauricio Babilonia the futility of harboring an unattainable longing for her, and this urge gnawed at her for a week. She tried every trick she could think of to persuade Patricia Brown to go get the car, but she failed. In the end, she made up her mind to take advantage of the red-haired boy who had come to Macondo again to spend his vacation. She pretended to have a great interest in cars and said she wanted to see the new models. The red-haired American then took her to the garage. As soon as Meme saw Mauricio Babilonia, she started to deceive herself and convinced herself that she couldn't bear the desire to be alone with Mauricio. When she realized that the young man sensed this as soon as he saw her, she flew into a rage.",17.96,17.789,"His name was Mauricio Babilonia. He was born and raised in Macondo, and he was an apprentice mechanic in the banana company's workshops. Meme had met him by chance, one afternoon when she went with Patricia Brown to fetch the car for a drive through the plantations. Since the driver was sick, they entrusted him with driving them, and Meme was finally able to satisfy her desire to sit next to the steering wheel to closely observe the driving system. Unlike the regular driver, Mauricio Babilonia gave her a practical demonstration. That was around the time when Meme started to frequent Mr. Brown's house, and it was still considered unladylike to drive a car. So she settled for theoretical information and did not see Mauricio Babilonia again for several months. Later she would remember that during the drive, his masculine beauty caught her attention, except for the roughness of his hands, but she had commented to Patricia Brown afterward about the annoyance his somewhat arrogant confidence caused her. The first Saturday she went to the movies with her father, she saw Mauricio Babilonia again in his linen suit, sitting a short distance from them, and noticed that he was uninterested in the movie, turning to look at her, not so much to see her but to make sure she noticed he was looking at her. Meme was bothered by the vulgarity of that tactic. At the end, Mauricio Babilonia approached to greet Aureliano Segundo, and only then did Meme find out that they knew each other because he had worked in Aureliano Triste's primitive power plant and treated her father with a subordinate's attitude. That realization relieved her of the annoyance his arrogance caused her. They had not seen each other alone, nor exchanged a word beyond a greeting, the night she dreamed that he saved her from a shipwreck and she felt not gratitude but anger. It was like giving him an opportunity he desired, while Meme longed for the opposite, not only with Mauricio Babilonia but with any other man who showed interest in her. That is why she was so outraged that after the dream, instead of detesting him, she felt an irresistible urge to see him. The anxiety grew more intense over the week, and by Saturday it was so pressing that she had to make a great effort to ensure Mauricio Babilonia did not notice, when greeting her at the cinema, that her heart was about to leap out of her mouth. Confused by a mixed sensation of pleasure and anger, she extended her hand for the first time, and only then did Mauricio Babilonia allow himself to shake it. In a fraction of a second, Meme regretted her impulse, but the regret immediately turned into a cruel satisfaction when she realized that his hand was also sweaty and cold. That night she understood that she would not have a moment of peace until she demonstrated to Mauricio Babilonia the futility of his aspiration, and she spent the week fluttering around that anxiety. She resorted to all sorts of useless tricks to get Patricia Brown to take her to fetch the car. Finally, she took advantage of the red-haired American who was vacationing in Macondo at the time, and under the pretext of wanting to see the new car models, she got him to take her to the workshops. From the moment she saw him, Meme stopped deceiving herself and understood that what was really happening was that she could not bear the desire to be alone with Mauricio Babilonia, and she was outraged by the certainty that he had understood this upon seeing her arrive.",45.518,45.431

633,"Meme realized that he was burning in the heat of his pride, and she desperately looked for a way to humiliate him. But he would not give her any time. “Don’t get upset,” he said to her in a low voice. “It’s not the first time that a woman has gone crazy over a man.” She felt so defeated that she left the garage without seeing the new models and she spent the night turning over in bed and weeping with indignation. The American redhead, who was really beginning to interest her, looked like a baby in diapers. It was then that she realized that the yellow butterflies preceded the appearances of Mauricio Babilonia. She had seen them before, especially over the garage, and she had thought that they were drawn by the smell of paint. Once she had seen them fluttering about her head before she went into the movies. But when Mauricio Babilonia began to pursue her like a ghost that only she could identify in the crowd, she understood that the butterflies had something to do with him. Mauricio Babilonia was always in the audience at the concerts, at the movies, at high mass, and she did not have to see him to know that he was there, because the butterflies were always there. Once Aureliano Segundo became so impatient with the suffocating fluttering that she felt the impulse to confide her secret to him as she had promised, but instinct told her that he would laugh as usual and say: “What would your mother say if she found out?” One morning, while she was pruning the roses, Fernanda let out a cry of fright and had Meme taken away from the spot where she was, which was the same place in the garden where Remedios the Beauty had gone up to heaven. She had thought for an instant that the miracle was going to be repeated with her daughter, because she had been bothered by a sudden flapping of wings. It was the butterflies. Meme saw them as if they had suddenly been born out of the light and her heart gave a turn. At that moment Mauricio Babilonia came in with a package that according to what he said, was a present from Patricia Brown. Meme swallowed her blush, absorbed her tribulation, and even managed a natural smile as she asked him the favor of leaving it on the railing because her hands were dirty from the garden. The only thing that Fernanda noted in the man whom a few months later she was to expel from the house without remembering where she had seen him was the bilious texture of his skin.","Même knew that she was being roasted in the proud flames of his passion and she hurried to find a way to humiliate him. But he did not give her the time. ""Don't be startled,"" he said gently: ""It's not the first time a woman has gone mad over a man."" She felt so deeply insulted that she left the workshop without even looking at the new car models, and that night she tossed and turned in bed, crying from the frustration in her heart. The red-haired American young man, who by now had actually started to like her, felt she was just a child. That was the time she began to notice the yellow butterflies that heralded the presence of Mauricio Babilonia. Before that, she had seen them, especially at the workshop, and thought they were attracted by the smell of paint. A few times, she felt them fluttering right above her head in the cinema. But when Mauricio Babilonia began to pursue her like a ghost that only she could recognize in the crowd, she understood that these yellow butterflies were intimately connected to him. Mauricio Babilonia was always present in the crowd at concerts, in the cinema, at mass, and she didn't need to see him to know he was there because the yellow butterflies pointed out his location. Once, Aureliano Segundo felt very uncomfortable with the suffocating flutter of the yellow butterflies, so she felt an urge to reveal her secret to him as promised, but her instincts told her that this time he wouldn't laugh as he usually did. ""What will your mother say when she sees him."" One morning, while mother and daughter were pruning the rose bushes, Fernanda suddenly screamed in panic and hurriedly pulled Meme away from where they were standing because it was the very garden where Remedios the Beauty had ascended to the sky. She had a fleeting feeling that the miracle might happen again to her daughter because the sudden buzzing made her jump. It was the sound of the yellow butterflies. Même saw them as if they had just been born in the light, and her heart raced. At that moment, Mauricio Babilonia appeared, carrying a box, which he said was a gift from Patricia Brown. Même tried to act naturally, suppressing the redness in her face and calming the storm in her heart, until she managed a serene smile and asked him to kindly place it on the balcony because her hands were dirty with soil. The only thing Fernanda noted about the man she would not allow into the house in the following months, and did not recognize having seen him before, was his pale, sallow complexion.",25.975,25.78,"Meme noticed that the young man was feeling confident and proud, and she tried to do something to humiliate him. However, the young man did not give him a chance: ""Don't get angry,"" he whispered. -It's not the first time a woman has gone crazy over a man. Because of the defeat she felt, Meme left the garage without looking at the cars. All night long, she tossed and turned in her bed, crying out of frustration. The American red-haired boy who had really started to interest Meme now seemed no different from a baby who wet his bed. Around that time, whenever Meme saw yellow butterflies, she noticed that she would see Mauricio Babilonia afterwards. Previously, when she once saw a swarm of yellow butterflies over the garage, she thought they were attracted by the smell of paint. Once, as she was about to enter the cinema, yellow butterflies fluttered above her head. But when Mauricio Babilonia started to follow her like a shadow in a way that only Meme could notice in the crowd, she realized that the yellow butterflies were related to the young man. Wherever Meme went, Mauricio Babilonia would also go. At concerts, in cinemas, in church, Mauricio Babylon would be somewhere in the midst of the absolute crowd, and Meme could understand where he was without seeing him, because almost wherever the young man was, butterflies would not be missing from there. Once, Aureliano Segundo was so disturbed by the fluttering of the butterflies that Meme almost broke her promise to hide nothing from her father and was about to tell him the situation. However, a voice inside told her to stay silent, as her father would just laugh it off as he always did, saying -What would your mother say if she heard? One morning, while Fernanda was cutting roses in the garden, she suddenly screamed. At that moment, Meme, who was standing exactly where Beautiful Remedios had ascended to the sky, heard her mother's scream and ran, leaving the spot where she stood. Fernanda had suddenly heard the sound of wings and feared that the miracle that had taken Beautiful Remedios would also happen to her own daughter. But it was the butterflies flapping their wings. Meme's heart skipped a beat when she saw the butterflies that seemed to have suddenly emerged from the light. At that moment, Mauricio Babilonia came with a package in his hand, saying that he brought a gift from Patricia Brown. Meme tried not to blush or tremble and, smiling as if nothing was wrong, told the young man to leave the package on the railing because her hands were muddy. Fernanda looked at the young man whom she would throw out of the house a few months later without recognizing where she knew him from, and the only thing that caught her attention was his pallor.",19.23,19.018,"Meme realized that she was burning in the fire of her pride, and desperately sought a way to humiliate him. But he didn't give her time. ""Don't be scared,"" he said in a low voice. ""It's not the first time a woman has gone crazy over a man."" She felt so helpless that she left the workshop without seeing the new models, and spent the night tossing and turning in bed and crying in indignation. The red-haired American, who was actually starting to interest her, seemed like a baby to her. It was then that she realized the yellow butterflies preceded the appearances of Mauricio Babilonia. She had seen them before, especially in the mechanic's workshop, and had thought they were fascinated by the smell of the paint. Sometimes she had felt them fluttering over her head in the dim light of the cinema. But when Mauricio Babilonia started to pursue her, like a specter that only she could identify in the crowd, she understood that the yellow butterflies had something to do with him. Mauricio Babilonia was always in the audience at concerts, in the cinema, at high mass, and she didn't need to see him to discover him, because the butterflies indicated his presence.

Meme saw them, as if they had suddenly been born in the light, and her heart skipped a beat. At that moment, Mauricio Babilonia entered with a package that, according to him, was a gift from Patricia Brown. Meme swallowed her blush, assimilated the tribulation, and even managed a natural smile to ask him to put it on the handrail because her fingers were dirty with soil.

635,"Meme thought that her mother had been impressed by the butterflies When they finished pruning the row bushes she washed her hands and took the package to her bedroom to open it. It was a kind of Chinese toy, made up of five concentric boxes, and in the last one there was a card laboriously inscribed by someone who could barely write: We’ll get together Saturday at the movies. Meme felt with an aftershock that the box had been on the railing for a long time within reach of Fernanda’s curiosity, and although she was flattered by the audacity and ingenuity of Mauricio Babilonia, she was moved by his Innocence in expecting that she would keep the date. Meme knew at that time that Aureliano Segundo had an appointment on Saturday night. Nevertheless, the fire of anxiety burned her so much during the course of the week that on Saturday she convinced her father to leave her alone in the theater and come back for her after the show. A nocturnal butterfly fluttered about her head while the lights were on. And then it happened. When the lights went out, Mauricio Babilonia sat down beside her. Meme felt herself splashing in a bog of hesitation from which she could only be rescued, as had occurred in her dreams, by that man smelling of grease whom she could barely see in the shadows.","Meme thought that her mother enjoyed those butterflies. After the mother and daughter finished pruning the roses, she went to wash her hands and then brought the gift box to her room to open it. It was a Chinese toy, consisting of five concentric boxes, and in the innermost box there was a card written by someone who seemed to have just learned to write very neatly: ""We will meet on Saturday at the cinema."" Meme felt foolish for leaving the gift box on the balcony for so long, right in front of Fernanda's curious eyes, even though at that moment she was content with Mauricio Babilonia's cleverness and boldness, and his innocence encouraged her to keep the appointment. From then on, Meme knew that Aureliano Segundo had an appointment with his lover on Saturday night. However, the burning desire that had been consuming her all week led her to persuade her father to let her be alone at the cinema on Saturday, and to pick her up when the show ended. A butterfly fluttered above her head as the lights were on. And so the story began from there. When the lights went out, Mauricio Babilonia sat down next to her. Meme felt like she was drowning in a swamp of sorrow, and only a man reeking of machine oil could save her from it.",25.344,24.976,"Meme thought that her mother was speaking that way because of the butterflies. After finishing pruning the roses, Meme washed her hands and went up to her room to open the package. It was a kind of Chinese toy. It was made of five nested boxes. Inside the smallest box, there was a piece of paper with scrawled writing that seemed to be from someone who barely knew how to read and write. On the paper, it said - We'll meet at the cinema on Saturday. Meme's heart leapt into her throat when she remembered that the package had been sitting on the railing for so long, thinking what if her mother had taken and opened it. Although she liked Mauricio Babilonia's sincere and bold gesture, she pitied him for being naive enough to think that she would go to this rendezvous. He knew that Aureliano Segundo would meet with his friends on Saturday night. But after writhing with excitement and curiosity all week, she tricked her father, convincing him to drop her off at the cinema and pick her up once the film was over. Before the lights went out, a butterfly made its nocturnal flight over Meme's head. Then it happened. When the lights went out, Mauricio Babilonia sat next to her.

639,"She lost her mind over him. She could not sleep and she lost her appetite and sank so deeply into solitude that even her father became an annoyance. She worked out an intricate web of false dates to throw Fernanda off the track, lost sight of her girl friends, leaped over conventions to be with Mauricio Babilonia at any time and at any place. At first his crudeness bothered her. The first time that they were alone on the deserted fields behind the garage he pulled her mercilessly into an animal state that left her exhausted. It took her time to realize that it was also a form of tenderness and it was then that she lost her calm and lived only for him, upset by the desire to sink into his stupefying odor of grease washed off by lye. A short time before the death of Amaranta she suddenly stumbled into in open space of lucidity within the madness and she trembled before the uncertainty of the future. Then she heard about a woman who made predictions from cards and went to see her in secret. It was Pilar Ternera. As soon as Pilar saw her come in she was aware of Meme’s hidden motives. “Sit down,” she told her. “I don’t need cards to tell the future of a Buendía,” Meme did not know and never would that the centenarian witch was her great-grandmother. Nor would she have believed it after the aggressive realism with which she revealed to her that the anxiety of falling in love could not find repose except in bed. It was the same point of view as Mauricio Babilonia’s, but Meme resisted believing it because underneath it all she imagined that it had been inspired by the poor judgment of a mechanic. She thought then that love on one side was defeating love on the other, because it was characteristic of men to deny hunger once their appetites were satisfied. Pilar Ternera not only cleared up that mistake, she also offered the old canopied bed where she had conceived Arcadio, Meme’s grandfather, and where afterward she conceived Aureliano José. She also taught her how to avoid an unwanted conception by means of the evaporation of mustard plasters and gave her recipes for potions that in cases of trouble could expel “even the remorse of conscience.” That interview instilled In Meme the same feeling of bravery that she had felt on the drunken evening. Amaranta’s death, however, obliged her to postpone the decision. While the nine nights lasted she did not once leave the side of Mauricio Babilonia, who mingled with the crowd that invaded the house. Then came the long period of mourning and the obligatory withdrawal and they separated for a time. Those were days of such inner agitation, such irrepressible anxiety, and so many repressed urges that on the first evening that Meme was able to get out she went straight to Pilar Ternera’s. She surrendered to Mauricio Babilonia, without resistance, without shyness, without formalities, and with a vocation that was so fluid and an intuition that was so wise that a more suspicious man than hers would have confused them with obvious experience. They made love twice a week for more than three months, protected by the innocent complicity of Aureliano Segundo, who believed without suspicion in his daughter’s alibis simply in order to set her free from her mother’s rigidity.","She went mad and crazy because of him. She lost sleep, lost her appetite, and sank deeper into loneliness to the point that her father had become an obstacle for her. She concocted an intricate web of empty promises to deceive Fernanda, avoided visiting her girlfriends, and broke all conventions to meet Mauricio Babilonia anytime and anywhere. At first, his crudeness made her uncomfortable. The first time they met alone, right in the open field behind the mechanical workshop, he wore her out without a hint of pity. It took her some time to realize that it was also a form of caress, and because of it, she was eager to see him. She lived only for him, only for the desire to immerse herself in his oil-scented breath. Shortly before Amaranta died, while she was passionately in love, she suddenly encountered a flash of insight and became fearful for her future. At that time, she heard about a woman who had the talent of reading cards and secretly sought her out. That woman was Pila Tecnêra. From the moment she saw her step into the house, the old woman knew right away the reason for Meme's fortune-telling visit. ""Come, sit down,"" the old woman said. ""I don't need cards to see the future of a Buendía."" Meme did not know, and would never know, that the hundred-year-old medium was actually her great-great-grandmother. She also did not believe in the terrible reality that the medium had shown her: the craving for love could only be satisfied in bed. That was Maurício Babilônia's viewpoint, but Meme tried not to let him, because deep down she suspected that her craving had been sparked by the mechanic's vile thoughts. Now she thought that one kind of love would overthrow the other, because she knew well that men's hunger would be sated once they were satisfied. Pilar Ternera not only consoled her but also lent her the old bed where the old woman had conceived Arcadio, Meme's grandfather, and later Aureliano José. Additionally, the old woman taught her how to avoid pregnancy by inhaling mustard leaf fumes and gave her potions that, in the most critical cases, would expel ""even the pangs of conscience."" That heart-to-heart talk instilled in Meme the bold feelings she exhibited during the drunken night. However, Amaranta's death forced her to postpone her daring decision. During the nine-day funeral, she did not leave Maurício Babilônia's side for a moment, who often mingled with the crowd that flocked into the house. Afterward, due to the extended mourning period and being required to stay home, the two did not see each other for a while. Those were days of restlessness, uncontrollable cravings, and repressed desires so intense that the very afternoon Meme was allowed to leave the house, she went straight to Pilar Ternera's home. She gave herself to Maurício Babilônia, gave herself without resistance, without shame, without pretense, and with such an easy-going disposition and intuitive understanding that a suspicious man like hers would have mistaken it for experienced expertise. They made love twice a week for over three months. Their secret trysts were tacitly supported by Aureliano Segundo, who wanted to see his daughter freed from her mother's strict supervision.",18.983,18.798,"The young man had swept her off her feet. She could neither sleep nor eat. She had become so withdrawn that she even got bored being with her father. She found a thousand excuses to avoid Fernanda, saying she was going elsewhere. She stopped seeing her girlfriends. Wherever and whenever it was, to meet Mauricio Babilonia, she gave up all her habits and disregarded all customs. At first, the young man's roughness bothered her. When they were alone for the first time in the empty field behind the garage, Mauricio, without any mercy, had reduced her to an animal state and left her breathless. It took some time for her to understand that this was a form of love. After she understood, she lost her mind and began to live only for Mauricio. The smell of machine oil washed with ash water from the young man drove her crazy, and she couldn't resist the desire to lose herself in that scent. Shortly before Amaranta's death, Meme had a moment of clarity and trembled at the uncertainty of the future. Then, she heard about a woman who read the future by looking at playing cards. She went to her in secret. This was Pilar Ternera. As soon as Pilar saw her, she understood why she had come. He said to the girl, Sit down. I don't need to look at the cards to tell the future of a Buendia. Meme did not know that this century-old witch was her great-grandmother and she would never know. After hearing the words of this woman, who had such a bold realism to say that the ailment called love could not be cured anywhere but in bed, Meme would not believe that she was her great-grandmother even if she learned it. Mauricio Babilonia thought like the fortune-teller woman. However, Meme opposed his view and secretly believed that the judgments of a worker should not be taken seriously. Meme thought that one aspect of love overpowered the other and destroyed itself. Because the greatest characteristic of men was to deny hunger after being satisfied. However, Pilar Ternera not only changed this wrong view, but also offered the girl the canopy bed where she first became pregnant by Meme's grandfather Arcadio, and later by Aureliano Jose. Sitting in the steam of the mustard poultice, she taught how to avoid an unwanted pregnancy and gave recipes for medicines that would completely erase any guilt if she ever got into trouble. Pilar Ternera's talk gave Meme a courage similar to the one she felt on the night she was drunk. However, Amaranta's death postponed her decision. During the nine-night mourning period, Meme did not leave Mauricio Babilonia's side for a moment amidst the crowd that filled the house. Then the long-term mourning began, and this forced separation distanced them from each other for a while. During these days, Meme felt such an irresistible desire, uncontrollable excitement, and so many urges that had been suppressed until then, that on the first evening she could go out, she went straight to Pilar Ternera's house. Without any resistance, without shame or hesitation, and without seeing any need for formalities, she gave herself to Mauricio Babilonia. Her sincerity had brought such agility to her actions and given such skill to her instincts that if there had been a suspicious person in Mauricio's place, they would have thought the girl had been through the mill upon seeing her in this state. They met and made love twice a week for more than three months. Aureliano Segundo, who said that Meme was with him just to save his daughter from her mother's bad temper and suspected nothing, was unknowingly complicit in their affair.",17.352,17.179,"She went crazy for him.

""Sit down,"" she said. ""I don't need cards to find out the future of a Buendía. "" Meme did not know, and never knew, that this centenarian fortune-teller was her great-grandmother. Nor would she have believed it after the aggressive realism with which she revealed that the anxiety of love found no rest except in bed. It was the same point of view as Mauricio Babilonia, but Meme resisted giving it credit, for deep down she assumed it was inspired by a poor craftsman's judgment. She thought then that one kind of love defeated another kind of love, because it was in the nature of men to repudiate hunger once appetite was satisfied. Pilar Ternera not only dispelled the error but also offered her the old canvas bed where she had conceived Arcadio, Meme's grandfather, and later conceived Aureliano José. She also taught her how to prevent unwanted conception by steaming mustard poultices, and gave her recipes for potions that in case of mishaps would expel ""even the pangs of conscience."" That interview instilled in Meme the same feeling of bravery she had experienced on the afternoon of her drunkenness. Amaranta's death, however, forced her to postpone her decision. During the nine nights of mourning, she did not leave Mauricio Babilonia's side for a moment, who was mingling with the crowd that had invaded the house. Then came the prolonged mourning and the obligatory confinement, and they were separated for a time. Those were days of such inner turmoil, such irrepressible anxiety, and so many repressed longings that the first afternoon Meme managed to go out, she went straight to Pilar Ternera's house. She surrendered to Mauricio Babilonia without resistance, without shame, without formalities, and with such fluid vocation and wise intuition that a more suspicious man than hers might have mistaken them for refined experience. They made love twice a week for more than three months, protected by the innocent complicity of Aureliano Segundo, who unwittingly vouched for his daughter's alibis, just to see her freed from her mother's rigidity.",43.952,43.857

But Meme denied everything. She was so sure of herself, so anchored in her solitude that Aureliano Segundo had the impression that no link existed between them anymore, that the comradeship and the complicity were nothing but an illusion of the past. He thought of speaking to Mauricio Babilonia, thinking that his authority as his former boss would make him desist from his plans, but Petra Cotes convinced him that it was a woman’s business, so he was left floating in a limbo of indecision, barely sustained by the hope that the confinement would put an end to his daughter’s troubles.","The night Fernanda caught them kissing in the movie theater, Aureliano Segundo felt suffocated by the weight of his conscience and he visited Meme in her room, where she was locked up by Fernanda, hoping that she would share the faith that he still owed her.

He thought of talking to Mauricio Babilonia, believing that his former authority would force him to give up all intentions, but Petra Cotes convinced him that it was a matter for women.

He trusted that his daughter would reveal the secrets she needed to share with him. However, Meme denied everything. Seeing the girl's confident demeanor and her introversion, Aureliano Segundo got the impression that there was no bond left between them, that their friendship and complicity were a thing of the past. Mauricio thought about talking to Babilonia. With the advantage of being his former boss, he was planning to prevent the young man from persisting in this matter. However, Petra Cotes convinced him that this was a problem only a woman could solve. Aureliano Segundo was wavering in indecision. He could do nothing but hope that staying away from the young man would put an end to his daughter's troubles.",15.512,14.715,"The night Fernanda caught them at the cinema, Aureliano Segundo felt overwhelmed by the weight of his conscience, and visited Meme in the bedroom where Fernanda had locked her up, hoping that she would confide in him the secrets she owed him.

On the contrary, from the next room Úrsula perceived the peaceful rhythm of her sleep, the serenity of her tasks, the order of her meals, and the good health of her digestion. The only thing that intrigued Úrsula after almost two months of punishment was that Meme did not take a bath in the morning like everyone else, but at seven in the evening. Once she thought of warning her about the scorpions, but Meme was so distant, convinced that she had given her away, that she preferred not to disturb her with the impertinences, of a great-great-grandmother. The yellow butterflies would invade the house at dusk. Every night on her way back from her bath Meme would find a desperate Fernanda killing butterflies with an insecticide bomb. “This is terrible,” she would say, “All my life they told me that butterflies at night bring bad luck.” One night while Meme was in the bathroom, Fernanda went into her bedroom by chance and there were so many butterflies that she could scarcely breathe. She grabbed for the nearest piece of cloth to shoo them away and her heart froze with terror as she connected her daughter’s evening baths with the mustard plasters that rolled onto the floor. She did not wait for an opportune moment as she had the first time. On the following day she invited the new mayor to lunch. Like her, he had come down from the highlands, and she asked him to station a guard in the backyard because she had the impression that hens were being stolen. That night the guard brought down Mauricio Babilonia as he was lifting up the tiles to get into the bathroom where Meme was waiting for him, naked and trembling with love among the scorpions and butterflies as she had done almost every night for the past few months. A bullet lodged in his spinal column reduced him to his bed for the rest of his life. He died of old age in solitude, without a moan, without a protest, without a single moment of betrayal, tormented by memories and by the yellow butterflies, who did not give him a moment’s peace, and ostracized as a chicken thief.","Mêmê did not reveal her suffering at all. On the contrary, from the next room, Ucsula sensed her rhythmic breathing while she slept, the calmness in her daily tasks, the regular order of her meals, and her strong digestion. The only thing that worried Ucsula after nearly two months of her being punished with confinement was that Mêmê no longer bathed in the morning as she used to, but instead bathed at seven in the evening. Once, she thought of reminding Mêmê to beware of scorpions, but since Mêmê was very upset with her, thinking that she had betrayed her, she did not want to trouble her great-granddaughter with untimely words. From the afternoon onwards, yellow butterflies filled the house again. Every evening, upon leaving the bathroom, Mêmê would find Fernanda frantically killing yellow butterflies with a mosquito spray. ""This is a misfortune,"" she said, ""All my life I've heard people say that moths bring bad luck to the house."" One evening, while Mêmê was in the bathroom, Fernanda happened to step into her room and found it so full of yellow butterflies that there was hardly any air left to breathe. So she grabbed any piece of clothing to shoo them away, and her heart suddenly chilled when she connected her daughter's evening baths with the mustard leaves scattered on the floor. She did not wait for a good opportunity as she had before. The next day, she angrily invited the new mayor to have lunch with the family. Like her, he had just moved from the highlands to live on the coast. She asked him to have soldiers guard the backyard at night because recently thieves had been stealing chickens. That very night, the guards shot Maurício Babilônia as he was lifting tiles to sneak into the bathroom where Mêmê was waiting for him.

About two months had passed since Meme was confined to the room, and during this time, something had occurred that disturbed Ursula and seemed contrary to her. Meme, unlike everyone else, did not bathe in the mornings but at seven in the evenings. Once, Ursula wanted to warn her, to tell her that there could be a scorpion in the bathroom at that hour. However, Meme never approached Ursula, thinking that she had betrayed her. Thereupon, Ursula also stopped bothering him like a nagging old grandmother. In the evenings, the house began to be swarmed by yellow butterflies.

She did not see the oxcarts on the dusty roads loaded down with bunches of bananas. She did not see the girls diving into the transparent rivers like tarpons, leaving the passengers on the train with the bitterness of their splendid breasts, or the miserable huts of the workers all huddled together where Mauricio Babilonia’s yellow butterflies fluttered about and in the doorways of which there were green and squalid children sitting on their pots, and pregnant women who shouted insults at the train. That fleeting vision, which had been a celebration for her when she came home from school, passed through Meme’s heart without a quiver. She did not look out of the window, not even when the burning dampness of the groves ended and the train went through a poppy-laden plain where the carbonized skeleton of the Spanish galleon still sat and then came out into the dear air alongside the frothy, dirty sea where almost a century before José Arcadio Buendía’s illusions had met defeat.","She did not explain to the girl.

647,"At five o’clock in the afternoon, when they had come to the last station in the swamp, she got out of the train because Fernanda made her. They got into a small carriage that looked like an enormous bat, drawn by an asthmatic horse, and they went through the desolate city in the endless streets of which, split by saltiness, there was the sound of a piano lesson just like the one that Fernanda heard during the siestas of her adolescence. They went on board a riverboat, the wooden wheel of which had a sound of conflagration, and whose rusted metal plates reverberated like the mouth of an oven. Meme shut herself up in her cabin. Twice a day Fernanda left a plate of food by her bed and twice a day she took it away intact, not because Meme had resolved to die of hunger, but because even the smell of food was repugnant to her and her stomach rejected even water. Not even she herself knew that her fertility had outwitted the mustard vapors, just as Fernanda did not know until almost a year later, when they brought the child. In the suffocating cabin, maddened by the vibration of the metal plates and the unbearable stench of the mud stirred up by the paddle wheel, Meme lost track of the days. Much time had passed when she saw the last yellow butterfly destroyed in the blades of the fan and she admitted as an irremediable truth that Mauricio Babilonia had died. She did not let herself be defeated by resignation, however. She kept on thinking about him during the arduous muleback crossing of the hallucinating plateau where Aureliano Segundo had become lost when he was looking for the most beautiful woman who had ever appeared on the face of the earth, and when they went over the mountains along Indian trails and entered the gloomy city in whose stone alleys the funereal bronze bells of thirty-two churches tolled. That night they slept in the abandoned colonial mansion on boards that Fernanda laid on the floor of a room invaded by weeds, wrapped in the shreds of curtains that they pulled off the windows and that fell to pieces with every turn of the body. Meme knew where they were because in the flight of her insomnia she saw pass by the gentleman dressed in black whom they delivered to the house inside a lead box on one distant Christmas Eve. On the following day, after mass, Fernanda took her to a somber building that Meme recognized immediately from her mother’s stories of the convent where they had raised her to be a queen, and then she understood that they had come to the end of the journey. While Fernanda was speaking to someone in the office next door, Meme remained in a parlor checkered with large oil paintings of colonial archbishops, still wearing an etamine dress with small black flowers and stiff high shoes which were swollen by the cold of the uplands. She was standing in the center of the parlor thinking about Mauricio Babilonia under the yellow stream of light from the stained glass windows when a very beautiful novice came out of the office carrying her suitcase with the three changes of clothing. As she passed Meme she took her hand without stopping.","At five o'clock in the afternoon, when the train arrived at the final station in the swamp region, she followed her mother off the train. The two of them climbed into a carriage that looked like a giant bat, pulled by a wheezing horse, and they passed through a desolate city, where on the endless, cracked streets from the sulfur fumes, the same piano practice piece that Fernanda used to hear during her afternoon naps in her youth still echoed. They boarded a riverboat with a wooden paddle wheel that roared like the noise of a great fire, and the rusted iron plates, full of holes, reflected the sunlight like the mouths of furnaces. Memé locked herself in a private cabin on the boat. Twice a day, Fernanda placed a tray of food by her bed, and twice a day she took it away untouched, not because Memé had resolved to starve herself, but because just the smell of food was enough to terrify her and make her stomach tighten and retch. She herself did not know that the mustard plaster no longer had a contraceptive effect, and Fernanda did not find this out until a year later when a baby boy was brought to her. Being in the stifling private cabin, disturbed by the vibration of the boat and the pungent smell of mud stirred up by the paddle wheel, Memé lay in a stupor, unaware of the passage of time. It had been a long time since Memé had seen the last yellow butterfly crushed by the propeller, and she felt it as an undeniable truth: Mauricio Babilonia was dead. However, she did not let resignation overcome her. She continued to think of him throughout the journey across the vast plains where Aureliano Segundo had once gotten lost while searching for the most beautiful woman in the world, and as they climbed the mountain pass along the Indian trails to a dreary city, where the narrow cobblestone streets still echoed with the mournful, raspy bells of thirty-two churches. That night, she and her mother slept in an abandoned colonial church, lying on planks that Fernanda had laid over the floor of a room overgrown with weeds, and they covered themselves with pieces of window curtains that tore with every movement. Memé knew exactly where she was because in her fearful insomnia, she had seen a young nobleman dressed in black pass by, who had been brought to the house in a lead coffin on the night before a long-ago Christmas Eve. The next day, after attending mass, Fernanda led her to a castle shaded by trees, and Memé recognized it immediately from her mother's stories about the convent where she had been educated to become a queen, and thus Memé understood that her journey had ended. While Fernanda talked to someone in the next room, she stayed in the parlor, which was adorned with oil paintings of colonial bishops, shivering because she was still wearing a dress made of black-embroidered leather and boots swollen with the snowmelt from the plains. She stood in the middle of the parlor under the yellow light filtering through the stained glass windows, thinking of Mauricio Babilonia, until a very beautiful young nun carrying her small suitcase and three sets of clothes emerged from the next room. As she passed Memé without stopping, she extended her hand to her.",19.206,19.005,"When they arrived at the last station of the swamp area at five in the afternoon, Meme got off because Fernanda made her get off the train. They boarded a small carriage, reminiscent of a large bat, pulled by a wheezing horse, and passed through the endless, deserted streets of the city. On the street, a piano sound reminiscent of the piano lessons Fernanda heard during her afternoon naps in her youth could be heard. They boarded a riverboat. The wooden wheel of the steamboat was turning with a crackling sound as if it had caught fire, and the rusted metal plates were burning like the mouth of an opened furnace. Meme shut herself in her cabin. Fernanda would leave a plate of food next to her bed twice a day, and twice a day she would take the untouched plate back. Meme was not eating, not because she had decided to starve to death, but because her stomach couldn't even handle water. At that time, neither Fernanda nor the girl herself knew that her fertility outweighed the mustard plasters. Fernanda would only learn this a year later when they brought the child. Shut in the suffocating cabin, Meme lost track of the days, driven mad by the vibration of the metal plates and the unbearable smell of the water churned by the wheel next to her. It had been a long time since she had seen the last of the yellow butterflies crash into the ceiling fan's blade and die, making her believe, as an undeniable fact, that Mauricio Babilonia was dead. Yet she did not let herself go. She never got Mauricio Babilonia out of her mind. When Aureliano Segundo set out to find the most beautiful woman on earth and lost his way in the highlands, Meme was always thinking of Mauricio as they passed through on muleback. As they crossed the mountains following the trails of the Indians, she was always thinking of Mauricio. As they entered the gloomy town where the thirty-two death bells stolen from thirty-two churches echoed through the cobblestone streets, she was always thinking of Mauricio. That night, they slept on the planks Fernanda had placed on the floor in a room overgrown with weeds in the mansion that had turned into a ruin. They wrapped themselves in old curtains that they took out from the windows and that fell apart piece by piece with every turn in their sleep. Meme had understood where they were. Because when he couldn't sleep and was curled up in fear, the man in black clothes who had come out of the chest on a Christmas day long ago had passed by him. The next day, after praying in the church, Fernanda took him to a place that darkened one's soul with every step. When Meme, recalling the stories her mother told her in childhood, realized that this was the convent where Fernanda was raised and prepared for queenship, she understood that their journey had come to an end. While Fernanda was talking to someone in the adjacent room, Meme waited in the hall filled with large oil paintings of colonial bishops. She was still wearing a dress made of black etamine with small flowers, and on her feet, swollen from the mountain chill, she had high-heeled shoes. Meme, standing under the yellow light filtering through the stained glass, was thinking of Mauricio Babilonia when a novice nun entered the room. He had a suitcase containing Meme's three layers of laundry in his hand. As he passed by, without breaking his stride, he took Meme's hand.",19.566,19.379,"At five in the afternoon, when they arrived at the final station of the swamp, he got off the train because Fernanda did. They got into a little carriage that looked like a huge bat, pulled by an asthmatic horse, and crossed the desolate city, in whose endless streets cracked by saltpeter, a piano exercise echoed just like the one Fernanda heard during the siestas of her adolescence. They embarked on a riverboat, whose wooden wheel made a noise like a conflagration, and whose iron sheets corroded by rust reverberated like the mouth of a furnace. Meme locked herself in the cabin. Twice a day, Fernanda left a plate of food next to the bed, and twice a day she took it back untouched, not because Meme had decided to starve herself, but because the mere smell of the food repulsed her and her stomach expelled even water. Not even she knew then that her fertility had defied the mustard vapors, just as Fernanda did not know until almost a year later when they brought the child to her. In the stifling cabin, disturbed by the vibration of the iron walls and the unbearable stench of the silt stirred by the boat's wheel, Meme lost track of the days. A long time had passed when she saw the last yellow butterfly being torn apart by the fan blades and admitted as an irremediable truth that Mauricio Babilonia was dead. However, she did not let herself be overcome by resignation. She kept thinking about him during the arduous mule-back journey through the hallucinatory wasteland where Aureliano Segundo got lost while searching for the most beautiful woman ever to walk the earth, and when they climbed the mountain range along Indian paths and entered the gloomy city where the funeral bells of thirty-two churches echoed through the stone labyrinths. That night they slept in the abandoned colonial mansion, on the planks that Fernanda laid on the floor of a room overrun by weeds, covered with scraps of curtains they tore from the windows and that crumbled with every turn of the body. Meme knew where they were because in the terror of insomnia she saw the gentleman dressed in black who, on a distant Christmas Eve, had been brought to the house inside a lead coffin. The next day, after mass, Fernanda led her to a somber building that Meme immediately recognized from the recollections her mother used to make of the convent where she was educated to be a queen, and then she understood that she had reached the end of the journey. While Fernanda spoke with someone in the adjoining office, she remained in a checkered hall with large oil paintings of colonial archbishops, trembling with cold, because she was still wearing a dress of etamine with little black flowers and the hard boots swollen from the ice of the wasteland. She was standing in the center of the hall, thinking of Mauricio Babilonia under the yellow stream of the stained glass windows, when a very beautiful novice came out of the office carrying her little suitcase with the three changes of clothes. As she passed by Meme, she extended her hand without stopping.",46.771,46.676

649,"Meme took her hand and let herself be led. The last time that Fernanda saw her, trying to keep up with the novice, the iron grating of the cloister had just closed behind her. She was still thinking about Mauricio Babilonia, his smell of grease, and his halo of butterflies, and she would keep on thinking about him for all the days of her life until the remote autumn morning when she died of old age, with her name changed and her head shaved and without ever having spoken a word, in a gloomy hospital in Cracow.","Meme took her hand and let her lead her away. The last time Fernanda saw her was when she was walking with the nun, just as the iron door of the convent slowly closed behind her. She still thought of Mauricio Babilonia, of the smell of grease and the yellow butterflies incarnate, thought of him throughout her entire life, a life with constantly changing names and without uttering a word until the early morning of an autumn day when she died old in a hospital in Krakow.",19.601,18.507,"Meme gave her hand to the girl and followed her.

Many years later, in a gloomy hospital in Krakow, with her name changed, her hair shaved, and without having spoken a single word, she would still be thinking of Mauricio Babilonia until the day she died on an autumn day.",30.452,29.681,"Meme took her hand and let herself be led. The last time Fernanda saw her, trying to match her pace with that of the novice, the iron gate of the cloister had just closed behind her. She was still thinking of Mauricio Babilonia, of his smell of oil and his realm of butterflies, and she would continue thinking of him every day of her life, until the distant autumn dawn when she would die of old age, with their names changed and never having spoken a word, in a gloomy hospital in Krakow.",52.073,51.626
650,"Fernanda returned to Macondo on a train protected by armed police. During the trip she noticed the tension of the passengers, the military preparations in the towns along the line, and an atmosphere rarified by the certainty that something serious was going to happen, but she had no information until she reached Macondo and they told her that José Arcadio Segundo was inciting the workers of the banana company to strike. “That’s all we need,” Fernanda said to herself. “An anarchist in the family.” The strike broke out two weeks later and it did not have the dramatic consequences that had been feared. The workers demanded that they not be obliged to cut and load bananas on Sundays, and the position seemed so just that even Father Antonio Isabel interceded in its favor because he found it in accordance with the laws of God. That victory, along with other actions that were initiated during the following months, drew the colorless José Arcadio Segundo out of his anonymity, for people had been accustomed to say that he was only good for filling up the town with French whores. With the same impulsive decision with which he had auctioned off his fighting cocks in order to organize a harebrained boat business, he gave up his position as foreman in the banana company and took the side of the workers. Quite soon he was pointed out as the agent of an international conspiracy against public order. One night, during the course of a week darkened by somber rumors, he miraculously escaped four revolver shots taken at him by an unknown party as he was leaving a secret meeting. The atmosphere of the following months was so tense that even Úrsula perceived it in her dark corner, and she had the impression that once more she was living through the dangerous times when her son Aureliano carried the homeopathic pills of subversion in his pocket. She tried to speak to José Arcadio Segundo, to let him know about that precedent, but Aureliano Segundo told her that since the night of the attempt on his life no one knew his whereabouts.","Fernanda returned to Macondo on a train protected by armed police officers: Throughout the journey, she noticed the passengers' anxious tension, the military measures applied in the villages along the railway, and the atmosphere of fear due to the belief that a serious event was about to happen, but she was completely unaware of any news until she reached Macondo. Upon arriving home, she was told that José Arcadio Segundo was inciting the banana company workers to protest. "" Oh, this is the last thing we needed,"" Fernanda said to herself, ""An anarchist right in our house."" Two weeks later, the strike broke out and did not cause the tragic consequences that people had feared. The workers only demanded not to cut and transport bananas on Sundays, and this demand was so reasonable that even Father Antonio Isabel joined in because he saw it as in line with God's laws. The success of this strike, along with several other activities that occurred in the following months, made José Arcadio Segundo, an obscure person whom people often said was good for nothing but filling the village with modern prostitutes, become famous. With the same resolute determination he had shown in killing all his fighting cocks to build a plan to open a waterway from Macondo to the world, he resigned from his position as foreman of the banana company to side with the workers. He was immediately suspected of being a member of an international organization against public order. In the sad week following the pessimistic rumors, one night he narrowly escaped death from four pistol bullets fired at him by a stranger as he stepped out of a secret meeting. The political atmosphere in the following months was so tense that even Úrsula, sitting in the dark, could feel it, and she had the sensation of reliving the unhappy days when her son, Colonel Aureliano Buendía, always carried homeopathic pills from a rebellious organization in his pocket. She wanted to talk to José Arcadio Segundo to understand what had happened before, but Aureliano Segundo informed her that since the night he narrowly escaped being shot, no one knew where he was staying.",27.064,26.836,"Fernanda returned to Macondo on a train guarded by armed police. Throughout the journey, the tension among the passengers, the military preparations in the towns along the railway, and the electric atmosphere indicating that something definitive was about to happen did not escape Fernanda's notice. However, he received no information until he arrived in Macondo. When he arrived in Macondo, they informed him that Jose Arcadio Segundo was inciting the workers at the Banana Company to strike. Fernanda muttered to herself, -This was the last thing we needed. -An anarchist was missing in the family. Although the strike broke out two weeks later, it did not lead to the feared outcomes. The workers did not want to cut and load bananas on Sundays either. Peder Antonia Isabel, finding this request in accordance with God's laws, supported the strike. The success of the strike and the actions initiated in the following months brought the obscure Jose Arcadio Segundo to the forefront and made his name known. However, until that day, it was said that he was good for nothing other than filling the town with French harlots. Just as one day he whimsically sold his fighting cocks and got into that foolish boat business, this time he left his foreman position at the Banana Company and sided with the workers. Soon after, he was branded as an agent of a foreign-rooted action aimed at disrupting the country's order: At the end of a silent week darkened by rumors, one night, he miraculously survived four bullets fired by unknown assailants as he was leaving a secret meeting. In the months following the incident, the atmosphere was so heavy and tense that even Ursula sensed it from her dark corner, and she felt as if she was reliving those dangerous days when her son Aureliano walked around with bullets in his pocket. He wanted to talk to Jose Arcadio Segundo, recount old events, and bend his ear. But Aureliano Segundo said that after the night they tried to kill him, no one knew where Jose Arcadio Segundo was.",25.495,25.248,"Fernanda returned to Macondo on a train protected by armed police.

652,"Fernanda, was immune to the uncertainty of those days. She had no contact with the outside world since the violent altercation she had had with her husband over her having decided Memes fate without his consent. Aureliano Segundo was prepared to rescue his daughter with the help of the police if necessary, but Fernanda showed him some papers that were proof that she had entered the convent of her own free will. Meme had indeed signed once she was already behind the iron grating and she did it with the same indifference with which she had allowed herself to be led away. Underneath it all, Aureliano Segundo did not believe in the legitimacy of the proof. Just as he never believed that Mauricio Babilonia had gone into the yard to steal chickens, but both expedients served to ease his conscience, and thus he could go back without remorse under the shadow of Petra Cotes, where he revived his noisy revelry and unlimited gourmandizing. Foreign to the restlessness of the town, deaf to Úrsula’s quiet predictions. Fernanda gave the last tam to the screw of her preconceived plan. She wrote a long letter to her son José Arcadio, who was then about to take his first orders, and in it she told him that his sister Renata had expired in the peace of the Lord and as a consequence of the black vomit. Then she put Amaranta Úrsula under the care of Santa Sofía de la Piedad and dedicated herself to organizing her correspondence with the invisible doctors, which had been upset by Meme’s trouble. The first thing that she did was to set a definite date for the postponed telepathic operation. But the invisible doctors answered her that it was not wise so long as the state of social agitation continued in Macondo. She was so urgent and so poorly Informed that she explained to them In another letter that there was no such state of agitation and that everything was the result of the lunacy of a brother-in-law of hers who was fiddling around at that time in that labor union nonsense just as he had been involved with cockfighting and riverboats before. They were still not in agreement on the hot Wednesday when an aged nun knocked at the door bearing a small basket on her arm. When she opened the door Santa Sofía de la Piedad thought that it was a gift and tried to take the small basket that was covered with a lovely lace wrap. But the nun stopped her because she had instructions to give it personally and with the strictest secrecy to Doña Fernanda del Carpio de Buendía. It was Meme’s son. Fernanda’s former spiritual director explained to her in a letter that he had been born two months before and that they had taken the privilege of baptizing him Aureliano, for his grandfather, because his mother would not open her lips to tell them her wishes. Fernanda rose up inside against that trick of fate, but she had sufficient strength to hide it in front of the nun.","In those hazy days, Fernanda often lived isolated from the outside world. She lost contact with the outside world ever since the fierce argument with her husband over unilaterally deciding Meme's fate without his consent. Aureliano Segundo was ready to search for his daughter, even if it meant involving the police, but Fernanda showed him documents confirming that their daughter had voluntarily entered a cloistered convent. Indeed, Meme had signed those papers when she was already inside the iron gates of the convent, signing with the same indifference with which she had let herself be taken there. In his heart, Aureliano Segundo did not believe the documents were legitimate, just as he never believed that Mauricio Babilonia had snuck into the backyard to steal chickens, but the papers gave him peace of mind, allowing him to leisurely return to the shadow of Petra Cotes. He resumed organizing noisy parties and indulging in lavish feasts. Living detached from the worries of the people and deliberately ignoring Ursula's terrible predictions, Fernanda tightened the final screws of her meticulously crafted plan. She wrote a long letter to her son José Arcadio, who was about to receive minor orders, informing him that his sister Meme had gone to serve God after coughing up black blood. Afterward, she left little Amaranta Ursula in the care of Santa Sophia de la Piedad and resolved to resume correspondence with the invisible doctors, tormented by Meme's misfortune. The first thing she did was set a definite date for the telepathic treatment. But the invisible doctors replied that during the turmoil in Macondo, it was not the right time for such actions. Being too confused and out of touch with reality, she explained in another letter that there was no social instability in Macondo, that all the commotion was the result of her brother-in-law's mad endeavors, just as he had once killed all the fighting cocks in a rage and rushed to open a river route from Macondo to the world. Thus, they still had not reached an agreement. On a hot Wednesday, an old nun carrying a basket arrived at the house and knocked on the door. Upon opening the door, Santa Sophia de la Piedad thought it was a gift and was about to embrace the basket covered with a precious silk cloth. But the nun stopped her in time, having been instructed to hand it directly to Fernanda del Carpio de Buendía. It was Meme's son. Fernanda's former confessor explained in a long letter that the boy had been born two months earlier and was named Aureliano after his grandfather, as the mother had refused to reveal her final wishes. Fernanda was very upset by this mockery of fate but still had enough strength to retort in front of the nun:",26.876,26.723,"Fernanda was indifferent to the chaos of those days. Since the day she fought with Aureliano Segundo for deciding Meme's fate without consulting him, she had cut off her connection with the outside world. Aureliano Segundo was determined to rescue his daughter with the help of the police if necessary, but Fernanda produced and showed some documents indicating that Meme had entered the convent of her own free will. After the iron door closed behind Meme, she had indeed signed the papers of her own free will, and she did it with the indifference she showed while following the novice nun. Regardless, Aureliano Segundo could never believe in the validity of the documents his wife presented as evidence; just as he couldn't believe that Mauricio Babilonia had entered the garden to steal chickens. But the apparent evidence made it easier for him to silence his conscience, and without feeling any remorse, Aureliano Segundo took refuge in Petra Cotes' embrace and resumed his lavish spending and noisy festivities. Fernanda, who remained oblivious to the unrest in the town and turned a deaf ear to Ursula's silent prophecies, tightened the last screw of her premeditated plan. She wrote a long letter to her son Jose Arcadio, who was about to enter the priesthood, informing him that his sister Renata had coughed up blood and finally found peace in the presence of God. Then, leaving the care of Amaranta Ursula to Santa Sofia de la Piedad, she resumed the correspondence she had paused due to Meme's troubles, dedicating all her time to communicating with invisible doctors. Her first task was to set a date for the postponed telepathic surgery. However, the invisible doctors advised that it would not be wise to proceed with the surgery as long as the turmoil in Macondo continued. Fernanda was in such a hurry for the surgery to be performed as soon as possible and was so unaware of what was happening in the town that she immediately wrote another letter to the doctors. He reported that there was no confusion, no provocative action, and that everything that happened was the doing of his brother-in-law, who once obsessed over cockfighting and riverboats, and now was fixated on the nonsense of unionism. Until that hot Wednesday when the old nun with a small basket on her arm knocked on the door, Fernanda and the doctors had not yet come to an agreement. When Santa Sofia de la Piedad opened the door, she thought a gift had arrived and wanted to take the small basket covered with a beautiful lace cloth. However, the nun did not give her the basket, because she had been strictly instructed to give it to Dona Fernanda del Carpio de Buendia with great secrecy. Inside the basket was Meme's son. Fernanda's former religion teacher, in the letter he wrote, was informing that the child was born two months ago and since the mother did not open her mouth to speak, they baptized the child with his grandfather's name, calling him Aureliano.

657,"The new Aureliano was a year old when the tension of the people broke with no forewarning. José Arcadio Segundo and other union leaders who had remained underground until then suddenly appeared one weekend and organized demonstrations in towns throughout the banana region. The police merely maintained public order. But on Monday night the leaders were taken from their homes and sent to jail in the capital of the province with two-pound irons on their legs. Taken among them were José Arcadio Segundo and Lorenzo Gavilán, a colonel in the Mexican revolution, exiled in Macondo, who said that he had been witness to the heroism of his comrade Artemio Cruz. They were set free, however, within three months because of the fact that the government and the banana company could not reach an agreement as to who should feed them in jail. The protests of the workers this time were based on the lack of sanitary facilities in their living quarters, the nonexistence of medical services, and terrible working conditions. They stated, furthermore, that they were not being paid in real money but in scrip, which was good only to buy Virginia ham in the company commissaries. José Arcadio Segundo was put in jail because he revealed that the scrip system was a way for the company to finance its fruit ships; which without the commissary merchandise would have to return empty from New Orleans to the banana ports. The other complaints were common knowledge. The company physicians did not examine the sick but had them line up behind one another in the dispensaries and a nurse would put a pill the color of copper sulfate on their tongues, whether they had malaria, gonorrhea, or constipation. It was a cure that was so common that children would stand in line several times and instead of swallowing the pills would take them home to use as bingo markers. The company workers were crowded together in miserable barracks. The engineers, instead of putting in toilets, had a portable latrine for every fifty people brought to the camps at Christmas time and they held public demonstrations of how to use them so that they would last longer. The decrepit lawyers dressed in black who during other times had besieged Colonel Aureliano Buendía and who now were controlled by the banana company dismissed those demands with decisions that seemed like acts of magic. When the workers drew up a list of unanimous petitions, a long time passed before they were able to notify the banana company officially. As soon as he found out about the agreement Mr. Brown hitched his luxurious glassed-in coach to the train and disappeared from Macondo along with the more prominent representatives of his company. Nonetheless some workers found one of them the following Saturday in a brothel and they made him sign a copy of the sheet with the demands while he was naked with the women who had helped to entrap him. The mournful lawyers showed in court that that man had nothing to do with the company and in order that no one doubt their arguments they had him jailed as an impostor. Later on, Mr. Brown was surprised traveling incognito, in a third-class coach and they made him sign another copy of the demands. On the following day he appeared before the judges with his hair dyed black and speaking flawless Spanish. The lawyers showed that the man was not Mr. Jack Brown, the superintendent of the banana company, born in Prattville Alabama, but a harmless vendor of medicinal plants, born in Macondo and baptized there with the name of Dagoberto Fonseca. A while later, faced with a new attempt by the workers the lawyers publicly exhibited Mr. Brown’s death certificate, attested to by consuls and foreign ministers which bore witness that on June ninth last he had been run over by a fire engine in Chicago. Tired of that hermeneutical delirium, the workers turned away from the authorities in Macondo and brought their complaints up to the higher courts. It was there that the sleight-of-hand lawyers proved that the demands lacked all validity for the simple reason that the banana company did not have, never had had, and never would have any workers in its service because they were all hired on a temporary and occasional basis. So that the fable of the Virginia ham was nonsense, the same as that of the miraculous pills and the Yuletide toilets, and by a decision of the court it was established and set down in solemn decrees that the workers did not exist.","When little Aureliano had just turned one, the social situation suddenly became tense. José Arcadio Segundo and some union officials, who had been operating secretly until now, made an untimely appearance to organize several demonstrations in the villages belonging to the banana company. The police, following orders from above, closely monitored them daily. But on the second night, the union officials were arrested right in their homes, shackled with five-kilogram chains, and then imprisoned in the provincial jail. Among those arrested were José Arcadio Segundo and Lorenzo Gavilán, a colonel of the Mexican revolution currently exiled in Macondo, who often proudly claimed that he was a witness to the heroism of Artemio Cruz, a close friend of his. However, within less than three months, they were released; because the government and the banana company could not agree on who should feed them in prison. This time, the workers' protests were based on the following factors: housing that did not ensure the health of the workers, hypocritical medical services, and very unfair working conditions. Additionally, the workers asserted that the company did not pay them in cash but in coupons (vouchers) that could only be used to buy Virginia ham in the company's commissary stores. José Arcadio Segundo was arrested because he had proven that the wage payment in coupons was merely an economic ploy by the company to sustain its fruit-carrying ships. If there were no goods for the commissary stores, those ships would have had to run empty from New Orleans to the ports to pick up bananas. As for the other crimes, everyone knew about them. The company's doctor did not examine the sick but merely lined them up in front of the clinic, and a nurse placed a copper sulfate-colored pill on their tongues, regardless of whether they had malaria, gonorrhea, or constipation. This treatment method was so common that children sometimes lined up several times, and instead of taking the pills, they brought them home to play with. The workers lived crammed in shabby huts. Instead of building public latrines, on Christmas occasions, the company's technicians brought in mobile latrines for fifty people and even instructed how to use them for longevity. Old, decrepit lawyers dressed in black, who previously clung to Colonel Aureliano Buendía to bother him, now represented the banana company, using their deceitful judgments like magic tricks to bail out the banana company. When the workers united to draft a single petition with common demands, these demands were not officially submitted to the banana company for a long time. When Mr. Brao heard the news about the new petition from the workers, he immediately attached his luxurious glass-roofed carriage to the train and, along with the permanent representatives of the Company, quickly disappeared from Macondo. However, the workers managed to catch one of those representatives right at a certain brothel and forced him to sign a copy of the petition while he was still stark naked with a woman. This woman had voluntarily used her charms to lure him into the trap. In a court session, the despondent lawyers argued that this person had nothing to do with the Banana Company, and to ensure no one doubted their argument, the lawyers ordered his imprisonment for impersonation. Not long after, Mr. Brao was caught during an inspection trip on a third-class carriage, and the workers made him sign another copy of the petition. The next day, he appeared before the judges with dyed black hair and spoke Spanish very fluently. The lawyers then explained that this person was not Mr. Jack Brao, the General Manager of the Banana Company, born in Britvin, Alabama, but merely a mild-mannered drug seller born and residing in Macondo, named Dugoberto Fonseca. Not long after, to counter the workers' new actions, the lawyers displayed an obituary at public places, certified by the consul and American diplomats, stating that Mr. Brao had been run over by a fire truck on a street in Chicago on the ninth of June. Fed up with these absurd explanations, the workers ignored the authorities in Macondo and filed a lawsuit with the Supreme Court. It was here that the judges, adept at twisting words and manipulating the law like circus performers, declared that the workers' complaints were entirely baseless, simply because the Banana Company did not, never had, and never would have workers, only temporary laborers. Thus, in this way, the lawyers overturned the workers' petition exposing the deceit about Virginia ham, the bizarre pills, and the mobile latrines that only appeared during Christmas, and the Court ruled and solemnly announced the non-existence of the workers.",22.628,22.511,"When the tension among the people suddenly erupted without any prior warning, the new Aureliano was one year old. Until then, Jose Arcadio Segundo and the other union leaders, who had been underground, suddenly emerged one weekend and organized demonstrations in the towns of the banana region. The police only maintained public order. But on Monday night, the leaders were individually gathered from their homes, shackled with one-kilogram weights on their feet, and thrown into the central prison of the province. Among them were Jose Arcadio Segundo and Lorenzo Gavilan, who was a colonel in the Mexican revolution and was in exile in Macondo. Gavilan would constantly recount witnessing the heroics of his comrade Artemio Cruz. Since the government and the Banana Company could not reach an agreement on who would take responsibility for the care of the prisoners, the detainees were released after three months. This time, the workers mobilized to protest the lack of plumbing in their homes, the absence of healthcare services, and the harsh working conditions. The workers claimed that their wages were not paid in cash, but instead they were given coupons, which could only be used to buy Virginia ham at the company's store. Jose Arcadio Segundo was imprisoned for exposing the truth behind the coupon system. If the company's fruit-carrying ships did not bring goods to the store, they would have to return empty from the ports where they loaded bananas in New Orleans. However, the coupons given to the workers led to demands for goods that would provide cargo for the company's ships on their return journey. The other demands and complaints of the workers were well-known to everyone. The company's doctors would not examine sick workers; they would line them up in a single file at the dispensary, and the nurse, without any distinction, would place a copper sulfate-colored pill on the tongue of each one, whether they had malaria, gonorrhea, or constipation. This method of treatment was so customary that children would get in line several times in a row, not swallow the pills placed on their tongues, and take them home to use as bingo chips. The workers at the company lived in overcrowded, deplorable barracks. Instead of building toilets where the workers lived, the engineers would bring portable field latrines, one for every fifty people, every Christmas and show everyone how to use them so they would last longer. The once black-clad, now elderly lawyers who surrounded Colonel Aureliano Buendia and are now managed by the Banana Company, were rejecting the workers' demands with decisions that seemed neither magical nor miraculous. The workers prepared a collective agreement outlining their common demands. However, it took quite some time for them to officially notify the company of these demands. As soon as Mister Brown learned that the workers had signed the agreement, he attached his luxurious private carriage to the train, took the company's top representatives with him, and fled from Macondo. However, a few of the workers cornered them in a brothel the following Saturday, and while Mister Brown was having a wild time completely naked with the women who helped set him up, they made him sign a copy of the contract. The lawyers in black suits proved in court that the man who signed the contract had no connection with the company, and to leave no doubt about it, they had the man imprisoned for fraud. Later, while Mister Brown was traveling under another name and in third class, the workers found him again and made him sign another copy of the contract. Mister Brown appeared in court the next day with his hair dyed black and speaking with a perfect Spanish accent. The lawyers said that he was not the manager of the Banana Company, Mister Jack Brown, born in Prattville, Alabama, but rather a modest pharmaceutical propagandist named Dagoberto Fonseca, who was born and raised in Macondo. After a while, faced with a new attempt by the workers to get the contract signed, the lawyers made Mister Brown's death report public. In the report, signed by consuls and foreign representatives as witnesses, it was documented that Mister Brown had died on the ninth of last June, being run over by a fire truck in Chicago. The workers, weary of these sleights of hand, lost hope in the authorities in Macondo and presented their complaints to the supreme court. Here too, the lawyers swiftly proved that the demands put forward were invalid. Because it was proven with documents that the Banana Company neither in the past, nor now, nor in the future has employed or will employ workers, and that the complainants were hired as temporary and contract laborers. Therefore, the Virginia ham story, the miracle cure stories, and the makeshift desert latrines fabrications held no meaning. This situation was determined by a court decision and it was grandly recorded in the minutes that the workers did not exist.",24.207,24.1,"The new Aureliano had turned one year old when the public tension erupted without any warning. José Arcadio Segundo and other union leaders who had remained in hiding until then appeared unexpectedly one weekend and promoted demonstrations in the towns of the banana zone. The police were content to monitor the order. But on Monday night, the leaders were taken from their homes and sent with five-kilo shackles on their feet to the provincial capital's jail. Among them were José Arcadio Segundo and Lorenzo Gavilán, a colonel of the Mexican revolution, exiled in Macondo, who claimed to have witnessed the heroism of his comrade Artemio Cruz. However, within three months they were free, because the government and the banana company could not agree on who should feed them in jail. The workers' discontent this time was based on the unsanitary housing, the deceit of medical services, and the inequity of working conditions. They also claimed that they were not paid in cash, but with vouchers that were only good for buying Virginia ham at the company's commissaries. José Arcadio Segundo was imprisoned because he revealed that the voucher system was a company scheme to finance their fruit ships, which would have had to return empty from New Orleans to the banana shipping ports if not for the commissary goods. The other charges were public knowledge. The company's doctors did not examine the sick, but made them stand in single file in front of the dispensaries, and a nurse would place a pill the color of piedralipe on their tongues, whether they had malaria, gonorrhea, or constipation. It was such a widespread therapy that children would get in line several times, and instead of swallowing the pills, they would take them home to mark the numbers called in the lottery game. The company workers were crammed into miserable shacks. The engineers, instead of building latrines, brought a portable toilet for every fifty people to the camps at Christmas and gave public demonstrations on how to use them to make them last longer. The decrepit lawyers dressed in black who once harassed Colonel Aureliano Buendía, and who were then agents of the banana company, discredited these charges with tricks that seemed like magic. When the workers drafted a unanimous list of demands, a long time passed without being able to officially notify the banana company. As soon as he learned of the agreement, Mr. Brown hooked his luxurious glass car to the train and disappeared from Macondo along with the most well-known representatives of his company.

Shortly after, in response to a new attempt by the workers, the lawyers displayed in public places the death certificate of Mr. Brown, authenticated by consuls and chancellors, which certified that on the past June ninth, he had been run over by a fire truck in Chicago. Tired of that hermeneutic delirium, the workers repudiated the authorities of Macondo and took their complaints to the supreme courts. It was there that the legal illusionists demonstrated that the claims were entirely invalid, simply because the banana company did not have, had never had, and would never have workers in its service, but recruited them occasionally and temporarily. Thus, the charade of the Virginia ham, the miraculous pills, and the Easter toilets was dismantled, and it was established by court ruling and solemnly proclaimed that the workers did not exist.",42.468,42.393
658,"The great strike broke out. Cultivation stopped halfway, the fruit rotted on the trees and the hundred-twenty-car trains remained on the sidings. The idle workers overflowed the towns. The Street of the Turks echoed with a Saturday that lasted for several days and in the poolroom at the Hotel Jacob they had to arrange twenty-four-hour shifts. That was where José Arcadio Segundo was on the day it was announced that the army had been assigned to reestablish public order. Although he was not a man given to omens, the news was like an announcement of death that he had been waiting for ever since that distant morning when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez had let him see an execution. The bad omen did not change his solemnity, however. He took the shot he had planned and it was good. A short time later the drumbeats, the shrill of the bugle, the shouting and running of the people told him that not only had the game of pool come to an end, but also the silent and solitary game that he had been playing with himself ever since that dawn execution. Then he went out into the street and saw them. There were three regiments, whose march in time to a galley drum made the earth tremble. Their snorting of a many-headed dragon filled the glow of noon with a pestilential vapor. They were short, stocky, and brutelike. They perspired with the sweat of a horse and had a smell of suntanned hide and the taciturn and impenetrable perseverance of men from the uplands. Although it took them over an hour to pass by, one might have thought that they were only a few squads marching in a circle, because they were all identical, sons of the same bitch, and with the same stolidity they all bore the weight of their packs and canteens, the shame of their rifles with fixed bayonets, and the chancre of blind obedience and a sense of honor. Úrsula heard them pass from her bed in the shadows and she made a crow with her fingers. Santa Sofía de la Piedad existed for an instant, leaning over the embroidered tablecloth that she had just ironed, and she thought of her son, José Arcadio Segundo, who without changing expression watched the last soldiers pass by the door of the Hotel Jacob.","The general strike broke out. The banana plantations were abandoned, bananas lay at the roots, and trains with one hundred and twenty cars stopped right in the middle of the tracks... Workers left their jobs and flooded into the town. Turkish Street became unusually bustling. The billiard room in the Giacop hotel stayed open for more than four hours straight to welcome guests. José Arcadio Segundo was there on the very day the news came that the army had been ordered to restore public order. Although he was not a person with premonitions, that news to him was an omen of the death he had been waiting for since that distant morning when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez took him to witness an execution. However, that ominous sign did not make him uneasy. He played billiards and did not miss a single shot. Afterward, the sound of drums, brass instruments, shouting, and the commotion of the crowd informed him that everything had finally ended, including the billiard game and the solitary and silent game he had been playing with himself since the morning of the execution. He stepped out onto the street and saw the soldiers. It was a regiment of three battalions, marching to the beat of drums, shaking the ground. The stench emanating from the regiment was like the breath of a multi-segmented dragon, clouding the clear midday sky. All the soldiers were short, stocky, and coarse. They were drenched in horse sweat, smelled like rotting meat left in the sun, and were as fierce as prairie men. Even though they had been marching for over an hour, people still thought that the regiment was just a few companies marching in circles, because the soldiers looked identical, like children of the same mother, with the same dull expressions. They carried heavy backpacks and canteens, brazenly brandished bayoneted rifles, bore the frustration of blind obedience, and the complex of honor. From her darkened bed, Úrsula heard the soldiers march by and made the sign of the cross. Santa Sofía de la Piedad stood still for a long time, bent over the freshly ironed cloth, thinking of her son, José Arcadio Segundo, whom she had just seen pass by the Giacop hotel door without fear in front of the last soldiers of that regiment...",20.008,19.75,"The big strike began. Work in the banana plantations came to a halt halfway, fruits rotted on the trees, and trains with one hundred and twenty wagons waited empty on the sidetracks. The workers who were not working filled the towns. The Turkish Street experienced the hustle and bustle of a Saturday for several days. Hotel Jacob's billiard room had to remain open twenty-four hours a day. At the time it was announced that the army was tasked with restoring order, Jose Arcadio Segundo was playing billiards. Although Jose Arcadio Segundo was not one to believe in prophecies, this news still seemed to him like the harbinger of the death he had been expecting since the day he watched the man executed by firing squad with Colonel Gerineldo Marquez's permission. But he did not lose his composure due to this bad premonition. He made the shot he had planned and sent the billiard ball to the desired spot. The sound of drums and trumpets heard shortly after, along with the people's rush, made Jose Arcadio Segundo realize that not only the billiard game but also the game he had been playing by himself since the execution scene had come to an end. Then he went out to the street and saw them. Three regiments were marching in step with the drumbeat. Their breaths, resembling the growl of a many-headed monster, seemed to emit poisonous vapor into the air shining with the midday sun. The soldiers were short, stocky, and animal-like in build. They were sweating like horses, smelling of sunburnt animal hide, and enduring with the stubborn and silent resistance typical of mountain people. Although the passage of the regiments lasted more than an hour, they were no different from a few squads circling in successive loops. Because they were all equals, all children of the same whore, and they carried the weight of their backpacks and canteens, the shame of their bayoneted rifles, the incurable boil of blind obedience, and their so-called sense of honor with the same indifference. Ursula heard the passing of the soldiers from her shadowy bed and crossed herself. Santa Sofia de la Piedad leaned on the freshly ironed embroidered tablecloth, thinking of her son Jose Arcadio Segundo, and existed for a moment. At that moment, Jose Arcadio Segundo, without changing the expression on his face, was watching the passing soldiers from the door of Hotel Jacob.",18.696,18.414,"The great strike broke out. The crops were left half-finished, the fruit overripe on the vines, and the trains with one hundred and twenty cars stopped on the branches. Idle workers overflowed the towns.

659,"Martial law enabled the army to assume the functions of arbitrator in the controversy, but no effort at conciliation was made. As soon as they appeared in Macondo, the soldiers put aside their rifles and cut and loaded the bananas and started the trains running. The workers, who had been content to wait until then, went into the woods with no other weapons but their working machetes and they began to sabotage the sabotage. They burned plantations and commissaries, tore up tracks to impede the passage of the trains that began to open their path with machine-gun fire, and they cut telegraph and telephone wires. The irrigation ditches were stained with blood. Mr. Brown, who was alive in the electrified chicken coop, was taken out of Macondo with his family and those of his fellow countrymen and brought to a safe place under the protection of the army.

The military quickly deployed throughout Macondo. The soldiers put down their guns in one place, then spread out to cut bananas, load them onto cars, and move the trains. The workers, who until now had been silently waiting, rushed up the mountain carrying nothing but their machetes, their work tools, and began to reclaim what had been taken from them. They set fire to the warehouses, the Company's trust stores, destroyed the railway tracks to stop the passage of trains that had begun to clear the way with machine gun fire, and they cut the electric and telephone lines. The trenches of the banana plantation were stained with blood. Mr. Brao, who lived in a chicken coop-like apartment complex with electric wiring, along with his family and some of his compatriots, had been secretly taken out of Macondo to a safe place under the protection of the army.

660,"José Arcadio Segundo was in the crowd that had gathered at the station on Friday since early in the morning. He had taken part in a meeting of union leaders and had been commissioned, along with Colonel Gavilán, to mingle in the crowd and orient it according to how things went. He did not feel well and a salty paste was beginning to collect on his palate when he noticed that the army had set up machine-gun emplacements around the small square and that the wired city of the banana company was protected by artillery pieces. Around twelve o’clock, waiting for a train that was not arriving, more than three thousand people, workers, women, and children, had spilled out of the open space in front of the station and were pressing into the neighboring streets, which the army had closed off with rows of machine guns. At that time it all seemed more like a jubilant fair than a waiting crowd. They had brought over the fritter and drink stands from the Street of the Turks and the people were in good spirits as they bore the tedium of waiting and the scorching sun. A short time before three o’clock the rumor spread that the official train would not arrive until the following day. The crowd let out a sigh of disappointment. An army lieutenant then climbed up onto the roof of the station where there were four machine-gun emplacements aiming at the crowd and called for silence. Next to José Arcadio Segundo there was a barefooted woman, very fat, with two children between the ages of four and seven. She was carrying the smaller one and she asked José Arcadio Segundo, without knowing him, if he would lift up the other one so that he could hear better. José Arcadio Segundo put the child on his shoulders. Many years later that child would still tell, to the disbelief of all, that he had seen the lieutenant reading Decree No. 4 of the civil and military leader of the province through an old phonograph horn. It had been signed by General Carlos Cortes Vargas and his secretary, Major Enrique García Isaza, and in three articles of eighty words he declared the strikers to be a “bunch of hoodlums” and he authorized the army to shoot to kill.","José Arcadio Segundo stood in the crowd that had gathered at the train station since Friday morning. He had attended the union officials' meeting and was assigned, along with Colonel Gavilan, to mingle with the large masses to lead them according to the specific circumstances. He was not feeling very well and, moreover, his mouth was bitter as if he had swallowed a bitter pill when he learned that the army had placed machine gun emplacements around the station, and he also knew that the company's building with barbed wire had been protected by cannons. It was nearly twelve noon, and due to waiting for the train that did not arrive, more than three thousand people, including workers, children, and women, had crowded the station and spilled over into the adjacent streets blocked by machine guns. The scene resembled a bustling fair more than a festive gathering. The food stalls and refreshment stands on Turkish Street had been moved elsewhere, and the public patiently and cheerfully endured the inconvenience of waiting under the scorching sun. A little before three o'clock, there was a rumor that the official train might not arrive until the next day. The weary crowd sighed in disappointment. At that moment, an army lieutenant climbed onto the roof of the station where four machine guns were lined up, pointing towards the crowd. A brass bugle sounded, signaling the crowd to be silent. Standing next to José Arcadio Segundo was a fat barefoot woman with two children, one four years old and the other seven. She carried the younger child and, although they were strangers, she asked him to hold the older one so that the child could hear what was about to be said. Hose Arcadio Segundo carried the boy on his shoulders. In the many years that followed, the boy would recount repeatedly, though no one believed him, that he had seen a lieutenant read Decree Number Four through a loudspeaker, signed by Colonel Carlos Cortés Vargas and Major Enrique García Isaza, the secretary of the governor. With three clauses comprising about eighty words, Decree Number Four labeled the strikers as a band of thieves and thus ordered the military to shoot them.",20.572,20.295,"Jose Arcadio Buendia was among the crowd gathered at the station early Monday morning. He had attended the meeting held by the union leaders and, along with Colonel Gavilan, was tasked with mingling with the crowd and managing it according to the developments of the events. He was not in a good mood. His mouth felt dry. As he looked around, he saw soldiers lined up with machine guns around the small area and the Banana Company's site surrounded by barbed wire and protected by cannons. By around twelve o'clock, the crowd of over three thousand people, men and women, young and old, waiting for the train that never came, had filled the open space in front of the station and started to spill into the streets held by soldiers with machine guns. They had the air of people having fun at a fair rather than a waiting crowd. They had brought in pita carts and lemonade vendors from Turkish Street, and despite the tension of waiting and the scorching sun, they had not lost their cheerfulness. As it approached three o'clock, rumors spread that the train would not arrive before the next day. The crowd sighed in disappointment. Upon this, a lieutenant climbed onto the roof of the station where four machine guns were aimed at the crowd and told them to be quiet.

Without knowing who Jose Arcadio Segundo was, she turned to him and asked him to take the other child in his arms so she could hear better. Jose Arcadio Segundo took the child onto his shoulder.

By noon, waiting for a train that did not arrive, more than three thousand people, including workers, women, and children, had overflowed the open space in front of the station and were crowding the adjacent streets that the army had closed off with rows of machine guns. It seemed then, more than a reception, a joyous fair. They had moved the food stalls and drink shops from the Street of the Turks, and people endured the annoyance of waiting and the scorching sun with very good spirits. A little before three, a rumor spread that the official train would not arrive until the next day. The tired crowd exhaled a sigh of discouragement. An army lieutenant then climbed onto the roof of the station, where there were four machine gun nests aimed at the crowd, and called for silence. Next to José Arcadio Segundo was a very fat, barefoot woman with two children about four and seven years old. She picked up the younger one and asked José Arcadio Segundo, without knowing him, to lift the other so he could hear better what was going to be said. José Arcadio Segundo hoisted the child onto his shoulders. Many years later, that child would continue to tell, without anyone believing him, that he had seen the lieutenant reading with a gramophone horn the Decree Number 4 of the Civil and Military Chief of the province. It was signed by General Carlos Cortes Vargas, and by his secretary, Major Enrique García Isaza, and in three articles of eighty words, it declared the strikers a gang of criminals and empowered the army to shoot them.",44.299,44.156

This stream was also being fired upon by machine guns facing them, raining bullets like another lash of the dragon's tail. The strikers were encircled, spinning wildly like a giant whirlwind whose center was gradually narrowing as the outer rings of this whirlwind were being sliced by the sharp blade of machine gun fire, peeling them away like an onion. The boy saw a woman kneeling, her arms folded in the shape of a cross, standing in a clean patch of ground that was miraculously kept free from the crowd. Before the crowd filled that empty space, José Arcadio Segundo had placed the boy down there, and right at that spot, with his face covered in blood, he fell beside the kneeling woman, under the blazing light from the high sky during the sunny season, in the mystical world where Úrsula Iguarán once sold wonderful candies shaped like little animals.",13.578,13.036,"The ones in front had already been mowed down by the first wave of bullets and had fallen to the ground.

They were diminishing towards the center like an onion being peeled layer by layer by the unceasing fire of the machine guns. The child saw a woman kneeling in the open, holding her arms in a cross shape, mysteriously protected from the bullets. At the moment Jose Arcadio Segundo fell to the ground with his face covered in blood, he left the child there.

671,"When José Arcadio Segundo came to he was lying face up in the darkness. He realized that he was riding on an endless and silent train and that his head was caked with dry blood and that all his bones ached. He felt an intolerable desire to sleep. Prepared to sleep for many hours, safe from the terror and the horror, he made himself comfortable on the side that pained him less, and only then did he discover that he was lying against dead people. There was no free space in the car except for an aisle in the middle. Several hours must have passed since the massacre because the corpses had the same temperature as a plaster in autumn and the same consistency of petrified foam that it had, and those who had put them in the car had had time to pile them up in the same way in which they transported bunches of bananas. Trying to flee from the nightmare, José Arcadio Segundo dragged himself from one car to an other in the direction in which the train was heading, and in the flashes of light that broke through the wooden slats as they went through sleeping towns he saw the man corpses, woman corpses, child corpses who would be thrown into the sea like rejected bananas. He recognized only a woman who sold drinks in the square and Colonel Gavilán, who still held wrapped in his hand the belt with a buckle of Morelia silver with which he had tried to open his way through the panic. When he got to the first car he jumped into the darkness and lay beside the tracks until the train had passed. It was the longest one he had ever seen, with almost two hundred freight cars and a locomotive at either end and a third one in the middle. It had no lights, not even the red and green running lights, and it slipped off with a nocturnal and stealthy velocity.

Intending to sleep a long sleep to get through the horror and terror, he turned to the side that hurt less, and only then did he discover that he was lying on top of dead people. There was not a single open space in the car, except for the main aisle. The massacre might have happened a few hours ago, because these bodies were already as cold as kaolin in autumn, and those who had arranged these corpses in the car had had time to stack them in an orderly manner, just like bunches of bananas being transported by train. Trying to escape the heavy atmosphere, José Arcadio Segundo crawled from car to car in the direction the train was moving, and by the light filtering through the gaps between the planks as the train passed sleeping villages, he saw the bodies of men, the bodies of women, the bodies of children that would soon be dumped into the sea like discarded bananas. He only recognized a woman who sold refreshments at the station and Colonel Gavilan, who was still holding the silver-buckled belt from Morelia that he used to carve his way through the horror. When he reached the first car, he jumped off the train, hid in the darkness, and lay still for a long time in a ditch waiting for the train to pass. It was an unprecedentedly long train of about two hundred freight cars, each end hooked to a locomotive and another one in the middle. It had no lights, not even the green and red signal lights, and it sped through the silent night. On the roof of the cars, the dark shapes of soldiers with machine guns ready to fire stood out.",25.688,25.433,"When Jose Arcadio Segundo came to, he was lying on his back in the dark. He sensed that he was on an endless journey on a silent train. Clots of blood had dried on his head. All his bones ached. He felt an irresistible desire to sleep.

Inside the wagon, there was no space except for the narrow path to pass through. Several hours must have passed since the massacre; because the corpses had reached the coldness and dullness that plaster would take on in the autumn air. Moreover, those who had placed them in the wagon had found enough time to stack them one on top of the other, just like they loaded banana bunches. Jose Arcadio Segundo, from this nightmare He started to move forward in the direction the train was going, dragging himself from car to car to escape and survive. As they passed through sleeping towns, in the light seeping through the boards, he saw the corpses of men, women, and children that would be thrown into the sea like unwanted rotten bananas. Among the corpses, he could only recognize a woman who sold lemonade in the square and General Gavilan, who still held the belt with a Marelya silver buckle that he had swung to clear a path through the panic. When he reached the frontmost car, he threw himself into the dark void and lay down beside the tracks, waiting for the train to pass. This was the longest train Jose Arcadio Segundo had ever seen. It had nearly two hundred freight cars and three locomotives: one in the front, one in the back, and one in the middle. The train was pitch dark, it hadn't even turned on its red and green lights.

She brought him a blanket so that he could wrap himself up while his clothes dried by the fire, she warmed some water to wash his wound, which was only a flesh wound, and she gave him a clean diaper to bandage his head.

He went through the small square by the station and he saw the fritter stands piled one on top of the other and he could find no trace of the massacre. The streets were deserted under the persistent rain and the houses locked up with no trace of life inside. The only human note was the first tolling of the bells for mass. He knocked at the door at Colonel Gavilán’s house. A pregnant woman whom he had seen several times closed the door in his face. “He left,” she said, frightened. “He went back to his own country.” The main entrance to the wire chicken coop was guarded as always by two local policemen who looked as if they were made of stone under the rain, with raincoats and rubber boots. On their marginal street the West Indian Negroes were singing Saturday psalms. José Arcadio Segundo jumped over the courtyard wall and entered the house through the kitchen. Santa Sofía de la Piedad barely raised her voice. “Don’t let Fernanda see you,” she said. “She’s just getting up.” As if she were fulfilling an implicit pact, she took her son to the “chamberpot room.” arranged Melquíades’ broken-down cot for him and at two in the afternoon, while Fernanda was taking her siesta, she passed a plate of food in to him through the window.","With a look of pity, the mother looked at him questioningly.

Before returning to his own home, José Arcadio Segundo visited three families, and each one told him the same thing: ""Not that many people died."" He crossed the platform, saw the food stalls piled up on each other, and right here he also did not see any trace of the massacre. Under the heavy rain, the streets were silent and deserted, all the houses were tightly closed, with no sign of life inside. Only the church bell calling the faithful to mass was the sole human activity. Stopping right at Colonel Gavilan's door, he called out.

The main gate leading into the compound, surrounded by barbed wire as usual, was guarded by militiamen in raincoats and pith helmets, standing like stone statues in the rain. On their small streets, the black people from Antidat were singing hymns in unison. José Arcadio Segundo jumped over the fence in front of the house and entered through the kitchen. Santa Sofía de la Piedad could only exclaim, ""Don't let Fernanda see you.""She said, ""She just got up.""

In the kitchens of the other three houses Jose Arcadio Segundo visited before reaching his own, they said the same thing: ""No one has ever died."" Jose Arcadio Segundo stepped out into the small area in front of the station. The trays of the pie vendors were stacked on top of each other. There was no trace of the massacre. The streets were completely empty under the constant rain. It seemed as if there was no one behind the closed doors and windows of the houses. The only thing indicating the presence of life in the town was the sound of the church bells calling for mass. Jose Arcadio Segundo stopped by Colonel Gavilan's house. A pregnant woman he had seen a few times before slammed the door in his face. In a fearful voice, she said, ""Gavilan is gone."" ""He returned to his homeland."" The local police were on guard at the main entrance of the chicken wire fence, as usual. They stood like stones in the rain with their rubber boots and oilskins. When Jose Arcadio Segundo came home, he jumped over the garden wall and entered through the kitchen. Santa Sofia de la Piedad, afraid to raise her voice, said, ""Don't let Señora Fernanda see you."" ""She will wake up soon,"" Santa Sofia de la Piedad, as if adhering to a secret agreement, led her son to the 'sitting room' he took it, fixed Melquiades' broken bed, and when Fernanda went to sleep at two in the afternoon, he put his son's meal on a plate and handed it out the window.",20.106,19.79,"The woman measured him with a look of pity. “There have been no deaths here,” she said. “Since the times of your uncle, the colonel, nothing has happened in Macondo.” In three kitchens where José Arcadio Segundo stopped before reaching the house, they told him the same thing: “There were no deaths.” He passed by the station square and saw the tables of fried foods piled on top of each other, and there too he found no trace of the massacre. The streets were deserted under the relentless rain and the houses were closed, with no signs of life inside. The only human news was the first bell for mass. He knocked on the door of Colonel Gavilán's house. A pregnant woman, whom he had seen many times, shut the door in his face. “He’s gone,” she said, frightened. “He went back to his homeland.” The main entrance of the fenced chicken coop was guarded, as always, by two local policemen who seemed like stone under the rain, with raincoats and rubber helmets. In their marginal street, the Antillean blacks sang the Saturday psalms in chorus. José Arcadio Segundo jumped over the backyard fence and entered the house through the kitchen. Santa Sofía de la Piedad barely raised her voice. “Don’t let Fernanda see you,” she said. “She was getting up a while ago.” As if fulfilling an implicit pact, she took the son to the chamber pot room, fixed Melquíades' rickety cot for him, and at two in the afternoon, while Fernanda was taking a nap, she passed him a plate of food through the window.",53.867,53.716

But the night when the soldiers looked at him without seeing him while he thought about the tension of the past few months, the misery of jail, the panic at the station, and the train loaded with dead people, José Arcadio Segundo reached the conclusion that Colonel Aureliano Buendía was nothing but a faker or an imbecile. He could not understand why he had needed so many words to explain what he felt in war because one was enough: fear. In Melquíades’ room, on the other hand, protected by the supernatural light, by the sound of the rain, by the feeling of being invisible, he found the repose that he had not had for one single instant during his previous life, and the only fear that remained was that they would bury him alive. He told Santa Sofía de la Piedad about it when she brought him his daily meals and she promised to struggle to stay alive even beyond her natural forces in order to make sure that they would bury him dead. Free from all fear, José Arcadio Segundo dedicated himself then to peruse the manuscripts of Melquíades many times, and with so much more pleasure when he could not understand them. He became accustomed to the sound of the rain, which after two months had become another form of silence, and the only thing that disturbed his solitude was the coming and going of Santa Sofía de la Piedad. He asked her, therefore, to leave the meals on the windowsill and padlock the door. The rest of the family forgot about him including Fernanda, who did not mind leaving him there when she found that the soldiers had seen him without recognizing him. After six months of enclosure, since the soldiers had left Macondo Aureliano Segundo removed the padlock, looking for someone he could talk to until the rain stopped. As soon as he opened the door he felt the pestilential attack of the chamberpots, which were placed on the floor and all of which had been used several times. José Arcadio Segundo, devoured by baldness, indifferent to the air that had been sharpened by the nauseating vapors, was still reading and rereading the unintelligible parchments. He was illuminated by a seraphic glow. He scarcely raised his eyes when he heard the door open, but that look was enough for his brother to see repeated in it the irreparable fate of his great-grandfather.","As the door of the room closed, José Arcadio Segundo clearly realized that his war was over. Years before, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had spoken to him about the joy of war and had intended to prove it with countless examples drawn from his own life experiences. He had believed him. But that night, when the soldiers looked at him without seeing him, thinking about the tense situation of the recent months, the hardships in prison, the horrors at the train station, and the train carrying the dead, José Arcadio Segundo concluded that Colonel Aureliano Buendía was nothing more than a clown or a coward. He did not understand that he had to use too many words to describe what he felt in the war, not knowing that just one word was enough to express it. That word was fear. In contrast, in Melquíades' room, protected by supernatural light, by the sound of the rain, and by the feeling of being invisible, José Arcadio Segundo lived in a rest he had never had before, with a lingering fear that he would be buried alive. He shared this with Santa Sofía de la Piedad, who brought him food twice a day, and she promised him that she would live until her strength gave out to ensure that he would be buried only when he was truly dead. Freed from all fears, José Arcadio Segundo buried himself in reading Melquíades' parchments, and the more enthusiastically he read, the less he understood them. Having become accustomed to the constant rain, which after two months had become a new form of tranquility, the only thing that disturbed his solitude was the comings and goings of Santa Sofía de la Piedad. So he asked her to leave his food on the window sill and lock the door from the outside. The others in the family had forgotten him, including Fernanda, who disapproved of him living there when she knew that the soldiers had looked at him without seeing him. When José Arcadio Segundo had been locked in the room for six months, and now that the soldiers had withdrawn from Macondo, Aureliano Segundo unlatched the door to find someone to talk to while waiting for the rain to stop. Upon opening the door, he was overwhelmed by the stench from the chamber pots full of excrement and urine placed on the floor. José Arcadio Segundo, suffering from skin sores, unaware of the gloomy scene caused by the rain, was still engrossed in reading the incomprehensible writings on the parchments. He was illuminated by a beam of angelic light. It seemed that as soon as he looked up when he heard the door open, that glance was enough for his twin brother to see the inherent fate of their great-great-grandfather repeated in him.",31.4,31.24,"When the door closed, Jose Arcadio Segundo believed that the war had ended. Years ago, Colonel Aureliano Buendia had told him how war had a fascinating aspect, showing countless examples from his own experiences. Jose Arcadio Segundo had believed him. On the night when the soldiers looked at his face without seeing him, Jose Arcadio Segundo, thinking about the tension of the past few months, the misery in prison, the panic at the station, and the train full of dead bodies, concluded that Colonel Aureliano Buendia was either a fraud or an idiot. He couldn't understand why the Colonel had spoken at such length to describe what he had heard in the war. Because a single word was enough: Fear, yet in Melquiades' room, with the supernatural light, the sound of rain, and the sense of being invisible, he felt a peace he had never experienced for even a moment in his entire life until that day. Now he was only afraid of being buried alive. He told Santa Sofia de la Piedad, who brought him his food, about this fear. His mother also promised to outlive him, defying natural forces, to ensure he would be buried after he died. Free from all fears, Jose Arcadio Segundo devoted himself to reading Melquiades' manuscripts. When he couldn't decipher the writings, he would tackle the task with even more enthusiasm. He got used to the sound of the rain, which had been falling incessantly for two months and had become another form of silence. The only thing that disturbed his solitude was the comings and goings of Santa Sofia de la Piedad. Therefore, he told his mother to leave the food by the window and to put a padlock on the door. After hearing that the soldiers did not see him even though they looked at him, the household, including Fernanda who did not object to her brother-in-law staying there, forgot about him. Six months after the soldiers left Macondo, Aureliano Segundo unlocked the door because he was looking for someone to chat with until the rains stopped. As soon as he opened the door, he was confronted with the nauseating smell of chamber pots. All the chamber pots were lined up on the floor, and all had been used several times. Jose Arcadio Segundo, whose hair had almost completely fallen out, was reading and rereading the writings that could not be erased, without paying attention to the nauseating smells. He was illuminated by a light similar to a halo surrounding angels. When he heard the door open, he only lifted his head and looked. But this look was enough for his brother to see the incurable fate of their great-grandfather in his eyes.",29.005,28.832,"When the door closed, José Arcadio Segundo was certain that his war had ended. Years before, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had spoken to him about the fascination of war and had tried to demonstrate it with countless examples drawn from his own experience. He had believed him.

He couldn't understand why so many words were needed to explain what one felt in war, when a single word sufficed: fear. In Melquíades' room, however, protected by the supernatural light, the sound of the rain, and the sensation of being invisible, he found the rest he had never had for a single moment in his previous life, and the only fear that persisted was that of being buried alive. He told this to Santa Sofía de la Piedad, who brought him his daily meals, and she promised to fight to stay alive beyond her strength to ensure that he would be buried dead. Free from all fear, José Arcadio Segundo then dedicated himself to reviewing Melquíades' parchments many times, and all the more content the less he understood them. Accustomed to the sound of the rain, which after two months became a new form of silence, the only thing that disturbed his solitude were the comings and goings of Santa Sofía de la Piedad.

From the moment he opened the door, he felt assaulted by the stench of the chamber pots that were placed on the floor, all of them often used. José Arcadio Segundo, devoured by hair, indifferent to the air thickened by nauseating vapors, continued reading and rereading the unintelligible parchments. He was illuminated by a seraphic glow.

693,"IT RAINED FOR four years, eleven months, and two days. There were periods of drizzle during which everyone put on his full dress and a convalescent look to celebrate the clearing, but the people soon grew accustomed to interpret the pauses as a sign of redoubled rain. The sky crumbled into a set of destructive storms and out of the north came hurricanes that scattered roofs about and knocked down walls and uprooted every last plant of the banana groves. Just as during the insomnia plague, as Úrsula came to remember during those days, the calamity itself inspired defenses against boredom. Aureliano Segundo was one of those who worked hardest not to be conquered by idleness. He had gone home for some minor matter on the night that Mr. Brown unleashed the storm, and Fernanda tried to help him with a half-blown-out umbrella that she found in a closet. “I don’t need it,” he said. “I’ll stay until it clears.” That was not, of course, an ironclad promise, but he would accomplish it literally. Since his clothes were at Petra Cotes’s, every three days he would take off what he had on and wait in his shorts until they washed. In order not to become bored, he dedicated himself to the task of repairing the many things that needed fixing in the house. He adjusted hinges, oiled locks, screwed knockers tight, and planed doorjambs. For several months he was seen wandering about with a toolbox that the gypsies must have left behind in José Arcadio Buendía’s days, and no one knew whether because of the involuntary exercise, the winter tedium or the imposed abstinence, but his belly was deflating little by little like a wineskin and his face of a beatific tortoise was becoming less bloodshot and his double chin less prominent until he became less pachydermic all over and was able to tie his own shoes again. Watching him putting in latches and repairing clocks, Fernanda wondered whether or not he too might be falling into the vice of building so that he could take apart like Colonel Aureliano Buendía and his little gold fishes, Amaranta and her shroud and her buttons, José Arcadio and the parchments, and Úrsula and her memories. But that was not the case. The worst part was that the rain was affecting everything and the driest of machines would have flowers popping out among their gears if they were not oiled every three days, and the threads in brocades rusted, and wet clothing would break out in a rash of saffron-colored moss. The air was so damp that fish could have come in through the doors and swum out the windows, floating through the atmosphere in the rooms. One morning Úrsula woke up feeling that she was reaching her end in a placid swoon and she had already asked them to take her to Father Antonio Isabel, even if it had to be on a stretcher, when Santa Sofía de la Piedad discovered that her back was paved with leeches. She took them off one by one, crushing them with a firebrand before they bled her to death. It was necessary to dig canals to get the water out of the house and rid it of the frogs and snails so that they could dry the floors and take the bricks from under the bedposts and walk in shoes once more. Occupied with the many small details that called for his attention, Aureliano Segundo did not realize that he was getting old until one afternoon when he found himself contemplating the premature dusk from a rocking chair and thinking about Petra Cotes without quivering. There would have been no problem in going back to Fernanda’s insipid love, because her beauty had become solemn with age, but the rain had spared him from all emergencies of passion and had filled him with the spongy serenity of a lack of appetite. He amused himself thinking about the things that he could have done in other times with that rain which had already lasted a year. He had been one of the first to bring zinc sheets to Macondo, much earlier than their popularization by the banana company, simply to roof Petra Cotes’s bedroom with them and to take pleasure in the feeling of deep intimacy that the sprinkling of the rain produced at that time. But even those wild memories of his mad youth left him unmoved, just as during his last debauch he had exhausted his quota of salaciousness and all he had left was the marvelous gift of being able to remember it without bitterness or repentance. It might have been thought that the deluge had given him the opportunity to sit and reflect and that the business of the pliers and the oilcan had awakened in him the tardy yearning of so many useful trades that he might have followed in his life and did not; but neither case was true, because the temptation of a sedentary domesticity that was besieging him was not the result of any rediscovery or moral lesion. it came from much farther off, unearthed by the rain’s pitchfork from the days when in Melquíades’ room he would read the prodigious fables about flying carpets and whales that fed on entire ships and their crews. It was during those days that in a moment of carelessness little Aureliano appeared on the porch and his grandfather recognized the secret of his identity. He cut his hair, dressed him taught him not to be afraid of people, and very soon it was evident that he was a legitimate Aureliano Buendía, with his high cheekbones, his startled look, and his solitary air. It was a relief for Fernanda. For some time she had measured the extent of her pridefulness, but she could not find any way to remedy it because the more she thought of solutions the less rational they seemed to her. If she had known that Aureliano Segundo was going to take things the way he did, with the fine pleasure of a grandfather, she would not have taken so many turns or got so mixed up, but would have freed herself from mortification the year before Amaranta Úrsula, who already had her second teeth, thought of her nephew as a scurrying toy who was a consolation for the tedium of the rain. Aureliano Segundo remembered then the English encyclopedia that no one had since touched in Meme’s old room. He began to show the children the pictures, especially those of animals, and later on the maps and photographs of remote countries and famous people. Since he did not know any English and could identify only the most famous cities and people, he would invent names and legends to satisfy the children’s insatiable curiosity.","Rain for four years, eleven months, and two days. There were times when the drizzle was so persistent that everyone wore ceremonial clothes and put on a solemn face to pray for the rain to stop, but soon people got used to the brief dry spells that foretold even more prolonged rains to come. The sky seemed to break open in a thunderous storm, and from the north, gales came, tearing off roofs, toppling walls, and sweeping away the last remaining vines in the fields. Just like during the insomnia plague that Ursula now recalled, it seemed this calamity had come to punish them with a monotonous life. Aureliano Segundo was one of those who worked the hardest to avoid falling into idleness. He returned home to take on some chores on the night when Mr. Brown summoned the storm that caused the rain and wind, and Fernanda found him an old umbrella in a cupboard. ""No need,"" he said, ""I'll stay here until the rain stops. ""Of course, it wasn't a promise set in stone, but he did exactly that. Since his clothes were all at Petra Cotes' house, he changed his outer clothes every three days and wore shorts until his laundry dried. To avoid boredom, he threw himself into repairing countless broken things around the house: sometimes fixing a hinge, oiling a lock, tightening screws, or straightening nails. For several months, he was seen wandering around the house with a set of tools left behind by the gypsies since the time of old José Arcadio Buendía, and no one knew if he did it out of a reluctant need to stay active, because the winter made him bored, or because he forced himself to indulge in moderate play. He became so passionate about working that his once-bulging belly shrank, wrinkling like a piece of leather, and his once-handsome, turtle-like face lost its charm, his sagging chin firmed up until he was less obese and could bend down to tie his shoes again. As she watched him fix hinges and dismantle clocks, Fernanda wondered if her husband was also afflicted with the compulsion to create and destroy, like Colonel Aureliano Buendía making goldfish, like Amaranta sewing buttons and weaving shrouds, like José Arcadio Segundo reading the inscriptions on parchment, and like Ursula reminiscing about her life. But it wasn't quite like that. The worst part was that the rain changed everything; even the driest machines grew moldy if left unoiled for three days, steel wires and copper nets rusted, and wet clothes grew green moss. The air was so damp that fish could swim through it to enter the house through the front door and exit through the windows. One morning, Ursula woke up feeling faint and demanded to be taken to Father Antonio Isabel even if she had to be carried on a stretcher, and at that moment, Santa Sofía de la Piedad saw leeches all over her back. They had to use red-hot embers to detach each leech before they sucked all her blood. They had to dig many trenches to drain the water from the house and sweep away the toads and snails to dry the floors, remove the bricks under the bed legs, and once again wear shoes indoors. Absorbed in the many small tasks that fascinated him, Aureliano Segundo didn't realize he was aging until one afternoon when he found himself sitting in a rocking chair, watching the early evening with indifference, thinking of Petra Cotes. Nothing prevented him from returning to the tepid love of Fernanda, whose beauty had now faded behind the maturity of age, but the rain had freed him from all sudden passions and instilled in him a calm, unexcited love. He enjoyed the incessant rain that had lasted almost a handful of years, thinking about the things he could have done in the past when he was one of the first to bring corrugated iron to Macondo, before the banana company made it fashionable, and he used it only to roof Petra Cotes' bedroom, relishing the intimate feeling it gave him as the rain pattered on it. But even the wild memories of his youthful debauchery couldn't cheer him up. In his most recent binge, he had lost his lustful enthusiasm. All that remained was the indifferent joy of organizing feasts. One might think that the flood had given him time to reflect, and the small tasks with pliers and oil cans had awakened in him a late regret for the practical trades he could have pursued but never did in his life, regretting that none of them were concrete, because the desire to sit still and the household chores that once stimulated him were not the result of thoughtful contemplation nor a learned lesson. That nostalgia was unearthed by the rainy season, coming to him from far away, from the days he sat reading in Melquíades' room about the legendary tales of flying carpets and giant whales swallowing ships. Those were also the days when little Aureliano appeared on the porch due to Fernanda's negligence, and his grandfather learned of his origins. He cut its hair, dressed it, taught it to get used to crowds, and soon the boy had the appearance of a true Aureliano Buendía: the same high cheekbones, the same startled look, the same air of solitude. For Fernanda, it was a respite. She had once considered her great honor but had not yet found a way to explain it, because the more she thought about the solutions, the less convincing they seemed. Knowing that Aureliano Segundo would handle everything as he had, with all the delight of a grandfather, she no longer monitored and forbade the boy as strictly as before. On the contrary, since last year, she had freed him from humiliation. For Amaranta Úrsula, who had now lost her baby teeth, the grandson was like a toy that could run and jump, providing her with amusement amid the dreary rain. At this moment, Aureliano Segundo remembered the English encyclopedia in Meme's bedroom. First, he showed the kids pictures, especially those of animals, then he showed them maps and pictures of distant and ancient countries, and great figures. Since he did not know English and was familiar only with the most well-known cities and frequently mentioned figures, he made up names and mythical stories to satisfy the children's curiosity.",19.02,18.921,"The rain lasted exactly four years, eleven months, and two days. At times it would lighten, turning into a drizzle, and then everyone would dress up, preparing to celebrate the improvement in the weather. But it was soon learned that these drizzly pauses were harbingers of a rain a thousand times worse than before. The air was filling and darkening with storms that destroyed everything they touched, and the face of the sky was wrinkling. The hurricane coming from the north was blowing off roofs, tearing down walls, and uprooting and toppling all the banana trees in the orchards without leaving a single one standing. Ursula remembered the insomnia epidemic. Because during the rain, just like during the insomnia epidemic, the disaster forced people to resist boredom. One of those who worked the hardest to avoid idleness was Aureliano Segundo. On the night Mister Brown started the storm, Aureliano Segundo had stopped by the house for something trivial. When the rain started, Fernanda took out an umbrella with half of its wires broken, which she found at the bottom of a cupboard, and brought it to her husband, who said, ""I don't need it."" ""I'll stay until the weather clears up,"" he said. Undoubtedly, it was not a binding promise, but even so, Aureliano Segundo felt the need to keep his word. Since his clothes were at Petra Cotes' house, every three days he would take off what he was wearing and wait in his underwear until they were washed and dried. To keep himself from getting bored, he got involved in a bunch of repair jobs around the house. He fixed the hinges, oiled the locks, tightened the loose doorknobs, and planed the swollen doors. The toolbox from the time of Jose Arcadio Buendia, acquired from the gypsies, did not leave Aureliano Segundo's hands for several months. Whether it was from moving around a lot to fix this and that, from the boredom brought by winter, or from the mandatory diet, it is unknown, but his belly started to shrink little by little, the purpleness of his face, which resembled a turtle's back, began to fade, his double chin started to melt away, and he stopped resembling an elephant and reached the point where he could tie his own shoes. As Fernanda watched him install latches on doors and repair clocks, she wondered if her husband would enter into a similar cycle of endless tinkering with home repairs, just like Colonel Aureliano Buendia with his fish that he melted and remade, Amaranta with her never-ending shroud and the buttons she endlessly sewed and resewed, Jose Arcadio with the manuscripts he tried to decipher, and Ursula with her memories. The worst part is that the rain damages everything and made this repair necessary. If it wasn't oiled every three days, it seemed like buds would sprout between the gears of the driest machines, rust stains would form on embroidery threads, and wet clothes would quickly develop saffron-colored mold. The air was so humid that fish would almost swim in through the doors, float in the room's air, and exit through the windows. One morning, when Ursula woke up, she felt that her end had come, that she would faint quietly and never wake up again, and she told them to take her to Father Antonio Isabel even if she had to be carried on a stretcher. When Santa Sofia de la Piedad propped her up slightly, she saw that leeches had covered her back from top to bottom. She removed the leeches one by one so they wouldn't drain the woman's blood, crushed them with tongs, and killed them. To drain the water, it was necessary to dig channels, dry the boards, remove the bricks from under the beds, and to be able to walk around in shoes again, it was also necessary to get the snails and frogs out. Aureliano Segundo, who had plunged into a heap of trivial tasks he needed to do, did not realize he had aged until one evening while watching the sunset, he thought of Petra Cotes without his heart and flesh stirring. Returning to the broad love of Fernanda, whose beauty had faded as she aged, was not difficult. However, the rain had dried Aureliano Segundo to the bone, detached him from passion, and dragged him into a solemnity born of indifference. He was thinking about the rain that had been falling for a year now, and at other times he would have enjoyed imagining the things he could do with this rain. Long before the Banana Company came and zinc roofs became widespread, Aureliano Segundo was one of the first to bring zinc sheets to Macondo. And he had them brought solely to lay on the roof of Petra Cotes' bedroom and to hold his mistress more tightly while listening to the rain hitting the zinc. However, now even the memory of those wild youthful days no longer excited him. In the midst of the last revelry he embarked on, he had exhausted his reservoir of lust and was left breathless halfway through. Fortunately, he possessed the virtue of being able to recall all these without feeling a pang in his heart or any regret. Those who saw him in this state might think that he was taking advantage of the opportunity created by the storm to reflect deeply or that he longed for a multitude of useful tasks he could have done throughout his life but never did, while fiddling with pliers and an oil can. However, the domesticity that began to envelop Aureliano Segundo had nothing to do with regret or a sudden onset of wisdom. This feeling was from much further back, from the days when he read stories about flying carpets in Melquiades' room, and whales that swallowed entire ships with their crews, and the rain had stirred up this feeling, bringing it to the surface. It was in those days that little Aureliano, taking advantage of a moment of Fernanda's inattention, dashed out to the veranda and his grandfather realized who he was. He cut the child's hair, dressed him, taught him not to fear people, and soon it became clear that the child, with his prominent cheekbones, timid gaze, and introverted nature, was a true Aureliano Buendia. Thus, Fernanda was relieved of a heavy burden. Fernanda had struggled with herself for a while, unable to bring herself to reveal the situation to her husband. She didn't know what to say, and every solution she found seemed irrational. If he had known that Aureliano Segundo would react this way and start enjoying the pleasures of being a grandfather, he wouldn't have gone through so much trouble and would have gotten rid of this burden a year ago. Amaranta Ursula, who had just cut her second tooth, looked at her nephew as a toy to relieve her boredom. While Aureliano Segundo was thinking about how to entertain the children, he remembered the English encyclopedia that had been left untouched in Meme's old room. He started showing the children the pictures in the encyclopedia. He was especially showing them pictures of animals. Then he showed maps of distant lands and photographs of famous people. Since he did not know English and could only distinguish pictures of very well-known cities and people, he invented various names and stories to satisfy the insatiable curiosity of the children.",16.921,16.826,"It rained for four years, eleven months, and two days. There were periods of drizzle when everyone put on their Sunday best and wore a convalescent face to celebrate the clearing, but soon they got used to interpreting the pauses as announcements of a resurgence. The sky was unpaved in storms of destruction, and the north sent hurricanes that chipped roofs and knocked down walls, and uprooted the last vines of the plantations. As happened during the insomnia plague, which Úrsula remembered during those days, the calamity itself inspired defenses against boredom. Aureliano Segundo was one of those who did the most to not succumb to idleness. He had gone to the house for some casual matter the night Mr. Brown summoned the storm, and Fernanda tried to help him with a half-broken umbrella she found in a closet. “No need,” he said. “I’ll stay here until it clears up.” It was not, of course, an unavoidable commitment, but he almost fulfilled it to the letter. Since his clothes were at Petra Cotes's house, he took off the ones he was wearing every three days and waited in his underwear while they were washed. To avoid getting bored, he devoted himself to fixing the numerous defects in the house. He adjusted hinges, oiled locks, screwed bolts, and leveled latches. For several months he was seen wandering with a toolbox that the gypsies must have forgotten in the times of José Arcadio Buendía, and no one knew if it was due to the involuntary exercise, the winter boredom, or the enforced abstinence, but his belly gradually deflated like a wineskin, and his beatific turtle face became less sanguine and his double chin less protuberant, until he ended up being less pachydermic and could tie his shoelaces again. Seeing him install doorknobs and disconnect clocks, Fernanda wondered if he was also falling into the vice of doing to undo, like Colonel Aureliano Buendía with his goldfish, Amaranta with the buttons and the shroud, José Arcadio Segundo with the parchments, and Úrsula with her memories. But it wasn’t true. The problem was that the rain disrupted everything, and the driest machines sprouted flowers among the gears if they weren’t oiled every three days, and the threads of the brocades rusted and saffron algae grew on the wet clothes. The atmosphere was so humid that fish could have entered through the doors and exited through the windows, navigating through the air of the rooms. One morning Úrsula woke up feeling she was ending in a swoon of placidity, and she had already asked for Father Antonio Isabel to be brought to her, even if on a stretcher, when Santa Sofía de la Piedad discovered that her back was paved with leeches. They removed them one by one, burning them with embers, before they finished draining her blood. It was necessary to dig channels to drain the house, and to clear it of toads and snails, so that the floors could dry, the bricks could be removed from the bed legs, and they could walk with shoes again. Busy with the numerous minutiae that demanded his attention, Aureliano Segundo didn’t realize he was getting old until one afternoon when he found himself contemplating the early sunset from a rocking chair, and thinking of Petra Cotes without shuddering. He would have had no problem returning to the insipid love of Fernanda, whose beauty had settled with maturity, but the rain had saved him from any passionate emergency, and had infused him with the spongy serenity of lack of appetite. He amused himself thinking about the things he could have done in another time with that rain that was already going on for a year. He had been one of the first to bring zinc sheets to Macondo, long before the banana company made them fashionable, just to roof Petra Cotes's bedroom with them and enjoy the deep intimacy that the rain’s crepitation produced in him at that time. But even those crazy memories of his extravagant youth left him impassive, as if in the last party he had exhausted his quotas of salaciousness, and only the wonderful prize of being able to recall them without bitterness or regrets remained. One might have thought that the deluge had given him the opportunity to sit and reflect, and that the hustle of pliers and oil cans had awakened in him a late longing for so many useful trades he could have done and didn’t do in life, but neither was true, because the temptation of sedentariness and domesticity that was haunting him was not the result of reflection or lesson learned.

It was during those days that, in a moment of Fernanda’s carelessness, little Aureliano appeared in the corridor, and his grandfather discovered the secret of his identity. He cut his hair, dressed him, taught him to lose his fear of people, and very soon it was clear that he was a legitimate Aureliano Buendía, with his high cheekbones, his look of astonishment, and his solitary air. For Fernanda, it was a relief. She had long measured the magnitude of her pride, but couldn’t find a way to remedy it, because the more she thought about solutions, the less rational they seemed. If she had known that Aureliano Segundo would take things as he did, with a good grandfatherly complacency, she wouldn’t have gone around in circles or given so many deadlines, but would have freed herself from the mortification the previous year. For Amaranta Úrsula, who had already lost her baby teeth, the nephew was like a slippery toy that consoled her from the boredom of the rain. Aureliano Segundo then remembered the English encyclopedia that no one had touched again in Meme’s old bedroom. He started by showing the children the plates, especially those of animals, and later the maps and photographs of remote countries and famous people.

694,"Fernanda really believed that her husband was waiting for it to clear to return to his concubine. During the first months of the rain she was afraid that he would try to slip into her bedroom and that she would have to undergo the shame of revealing to him that she was incapable of reconciliation since the birth of Amaranta Úrsula. That was the reason for her anxious correspondence with the invisible doctors, interrupted by frequent disasters of the mail. During the first months when it was learned that the trains were jumping their tracks in the rain, a letter from the invisible doctors told her that hers were not arriving. Later on, when contact with the unknown correspondents was broken, she had seriously thought of putting on the tiger mask that her husband had worn in the bloody carnival and having herself examined under a fictitious name by the banana company doctors. But one of the many people who regularly brought unpleasant news of the deluge had told her that the company was dismantling its dispensaries to move them to where it was not raining. Then she gave up hope. She resigned herself to waiting until the rain stopped and the mail service was back to normal, and in the meantime she sought relief from her secret ailments with recourse to her imagination, because she would rather have died than put herself in the hands of the only doctor left in Macondo, the extravagant Frenchman who ate grass like a donkey. She drew close to Úrsula, trusting that she would know of some palliative for her attacks. But her twisted habit of not calling things by their names made her put first things last and use “expelled” for “gave birth” and “burning” for “flow” so that it would all be less shameful, with the result that Úrsula reached the reasonable conclusion that her trouble was intestinal rather than uterine, and she advised her to take a dose of calomel on an empty stomach. If it had not been for that suffering, which would have had nothing shameful about it for someone who did not suffer as well from shamefulness, and if it had not been for the loss of the letters, the rain would not have bothered Fernanda, because, after all, her whole life had been spent as if it had been raining. She did not change her schedule or modify her ritual. When the table was still raised up on bricks and the chairs put on planks so that those at the table would not get their feet wet, she still served with linen tablecloths and fine chinaware and with lighted candles, because she felt that the calamities should not be used as a pretext for any relaxation in customs. No one went out into the street any more. If it had depended on Fernanda, they would never have done so, not only since it started raining but since long before that, because she felt that doors had been invented to stay closed and that curiosity for what was going on in the street was a matter for harlots. Yet she was the first one to look out when they were told that the funeral procession for Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was passing by and even though she only watched it through the half-opened window it left her in such a state of affliction that for a long time she repented in her weakness.","Fernanda truly believed that her husband was waiting for the rain to stop so he could return to his lover's house. During the first months of rain, she feared that he would sneak into her bedroom and that she would die of shame having to let him know that she was completely incapable of satisfying his desires ever since giving birth to Amaranta Úrsula. That was the reason for her fervent correspondence with unseen doctors, a relationship that was frequently interrupted by the unreliable postal service. In the early months, upon learning that the train had derailed due to storms, a letter from the unseen doctors informed her that all her letters had been lost and never reached them. Later, when all correspondence with the distant recipients was completely cut off, she seriously considered wearing the tiger mask that her husband had worn at the bloody Carnival ball, using a pseudonym to seek medical help from the banana company doctors. But one of the people who regularly brought news of misfortunes from the flood informed her that the banana company had ceased all its welfare operations in Macondo to move to a drier region. Thus, she lost all hope. She resolved to wait until the weather cleared and the mail service resumed normally, and in the meantime, to console herself, she soothed her silent pains, for she had vowed that she would rather die than fall into the hands of the only practicing doctor in Macondo, a bizarre Frenchman who lived on herbs typically used to feed donkeys. She approached Úrsula, believing that the hundred-year-old woman might know of some remedy to alleviate her debilitating pains. But her habit of not calling things by their proper names led her to use mixed concepts to avoid embarrassment; instead of saying ""in front,"" she said ""behind""; instead of talking about childbirth, she talked about excretion; instead of mentioning dizziness, she spoke of a burning sensation. Thus, the conceptual confusion in describing her clinical symptoms led Úrsula to the plausible conclusion that the pains were not uterine but intestinal, and she advised her to fast and take a laxative. If it weren't for the shameful nature of her condition and the loss of her letters, the rain would have meant nothing to Fernanda, for ultimately, life for her was as dreary as the incessant downpour. She did not change her schedule nor neglect her prayer sessions. Even when the dining table had to be propped up on stacked bricks, and the chairs placed on planks to keep the diners' feet dry, she still laid out linen cloths and set the table with the Chinese porcelain dinnerware, and at dinner, she still lit the candles, for she believed that calamity was no excuse for abandoning customs. No one dared to look out onto the street. If it had been up to Fernanda, they would never have looked out onto the street, not just since the rain began but long before, as she believed that doors were made to keep the house closed, and curiosity about street happenings was a vice of the lowly. However, she was the first in the family to peek out when the funeral procession of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was announced, though what she saw through the slightly open window brought her to a state of shame, regretting her weakness for a long time.",23.255,23.094,"Fernanda truly believed that her husband was waiting for the rain to stop so he could return to his mistress. During the early months of the rain, Fernanda was worried that her husband might enter the bedroom and she would have to explain the calamity that befell her after the birth of Amaranta Ursula, fearing the shame of revealing that she was no longer able to engage in relations. In fact, it was for this reason that she frequently sought out invisible doctors through correspondence, which was often interrupted due to the poor postal service. In the first months when news of trains derailing in the rain reached them, a letter from the invisible doctors arrived. They were writing that the letters Fernanda sent to them did not reach their hands. Later, when communication with the doctors was cut off, Fernanda even considered putting on the tiger mask her husband wore at the carnival and showing herself to the doctors of the Banana company. But when one of the messengers who constantly brought news said that the company was going to move the dispensary to a place where it didn't rain, Fernanda's hopes were shattered. He had no choice but to wait until the rain stopped and the mail was back in order. In the meantime, he was trying to heal himself as best as he could. He would rather die than go to that Frenchman in Macondo who ate grass like a donkey. He approached Ursula in the hope that she might find a temporary cure for his illness. However, due to his habit of not being able to name certain things, he left what needed to be said first until the end, and used terms like 'bring out' instead of 'give birth' and 'burning' instead of 'discharge' to avoid embarrassment. He confused things so much that Ursula concluded his problem was not in his womb but in his intestines and advised him to drink sweet sublimed mercury on an empty stomach. If he didn't have that shameful illness, which in itself was a disease, and if the letters hadn't been lost, Fernanda wouldn't have been bothered by the rain at all; because her whole life had been as if it were raining. She made no changes to her daily routine or the order of her prayers. Even on days when the table was placed on bricks so that the feet of those eating wouldn't get wet, and boards were placed under the chairs, Fernanda never neglected the linen covers, porcelain sets, and candlesticks. He found it unreasonable to use disasters as an excuse to break away from habits. No one was going out on the streets anymore. Whether to go out or not depended on Fernanda's views; even before the rains started, no one should have gone out. Because Fernanda believed that doors were invented to be kept closed and that only street women would be interested in what happened on the streets. Still, when they said that Colonel Gerineldo Marquez's funeral procession was passing by, he was the first to look out the window. Even though he took a quick glance from the half-open window and then pulled back, he regretted showing such a weakness for a long time.",16.883,16.678,"Fernanda truly believed that her husband was waiting for the rain to stop to return to his concubine. In the first months of the rain, she feared that he would try to slip into her bedroom, and that she would have to endure the shame of revealing to him that she had been incapacitated for reconciliation since the birth of Amaranta Úrsula. That was the reason for her anxious correspondence with the invisible doctors, interrupted by the frequent disasters of the mail. During the first months, when it was known that the trains were derailing in the storm, a letter from the invisible doctors indicated to her that her letters were being lost. Later, when contact with her unknown correspondents was interrupted, she seriously considered putting on the tiger mask her husband had used in the bloody carnival, to be examined under a fictitious name by the doctors of the banana company. But one of the many people who often passed by the house bringing the unpleasant news of the deluge had told her that the company was dismantling its dispensaries to take them to lands where the rain had stopped. Then she lost hope. She resigned herself to wait for the rain to pass and the mail to normalize, and in the meantime, she alleviated her secret ailments with inspired resources, because she would have preferred to die rather than put herself in the hands of the only doctor left in Macondo, the extravagant Frenchman who fed on donkey grass. She had approached Úrsula, hoping that she knew some remedy for her ailments. But the tortuous habit of not calling things by their name led her to put the former in the latter, and to substitute the birthed for the expelled, and to change flows for burns so that everything would be less shameful, so Úrsula reasonably concluded that the disorders were not uterine, but intestinal, and advised her to take a dose of calomel on an empty stomach. If it hadn't been for that ailment, which would have been nothing shameful for someone who wasn't also sick with prudishness, and if it hadn't been for the loss of the letters, Fernanda wouldn't have minded the rain, because after all, her whole life had been as if it were raining. She did not change the schedules nor forgave the rituals. When the table was still raised on bricks and the chairs placed on planks so that the diners wouldn't get their feet wet, she continued serving with linen tablecloths and Chinese dishes, and lighting the candelabras at dinner, because she considered that calamities could not be used as an excuse for the relaxation of customs. No one had looked out onto the street again. If it had been up to Fernanda, they would never have done so again, not only since it started raining, but long before, since she considered that doors were invented to be closed, and that curiosity about what happened in the street was a thing for harlots.

695,"She could not have conceived of a more desolate cortege. They had put the coffin in an oxcart over which they built a canopy of banana leaves, but the pressure of the rain was so intense and the streets so muddy that with every step the wheels got stuck and the covering was on the verge of falling apart. The streams of sad water that fell on the coffin were soaking the flag that had been placed on top which was actually the flag stained with blood and gunpowder that had been rejected by more honorable veterans. On the coffin they had also placed the saber with tassels of silver and copper, the same one that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez used to hang on the coat rack in order to go into Amaranta’s sewing room unarmed. Behind the cart, some barefoot and all of them with their pants rolled up, splashing in the mud were the last survivors of the surrender at Neerlandia carrying a drover’s staff in one hand and in the other a wreath of paper flowers that had become discolored in the rain. They appeared like an unreal vision along the street which still bore the name of Colonel Aureliano Buendía and they all looked at the house as they passed and turned the corner at the square, where they had to ask for help to move the cart, which was stuck. Úrsula had herself carried to the door by Santa Sofía de la Piedad. She followed the difficulties of the procession with such attention that no one doubted that she was seeing it, especially because her raised hand of an archangelic messenger was moving with the swaying of the cart.","Never had there been a funeral more sorrowful than this one. The coffin was placed in a banana leaf hut set on a bullock cart, but because of the heavy rain and muddy roads, with each step the wheels got stuck and the hut wobbled, almost collapsing. The mournful raindrops fell on the coffin, gradually soaking the flag draped over it, a flag stained with blood and dust from the long march, which had been rejected by the most honorable veterans. On the lid of the coffin lay a sword with silk tassels, the very sword that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez had hung on the coat rack in the living room before stepping into Amaranta's sewing room. Behind the bullock cart were the last survivors of the signing of the Treaty of Neclandia, some barefoot, all with their pants rolled up to their knees, wading through the mud, one hand holding a cane, the other carrying paper wreaths faded by the rain. They appeared like unreal images on the road still named after Colonel Aureliano Buendía, all looking at the Buendía house as they passed, then turning at the square where they had to ask for help because the cart got stuck. Úrsula had been escorted to the door by Santa Sofía de la Piedad. She attentively followed every detail of the funeral procession, so much so that no one doubted she was watching, especially since her holy arm kept pointing at the procession.",26.322,26.035,"Fernanda could not imagine a more desolate, more sorrowful funeral procession than this. They had placed the coffin on an ox cart and made a canopy of banana leaves over it. However, the weather was so rainy, and the streets were so muddy that the wheels got stuck in the mud with each turn, shaking, and the heavy canopy seemed like it would fall apart with each jolt. The rainwater trickling down fell onto the coffin wrapped in a flag, soaking the flag stained with blood and gunpowder that the honorable veterans had once refused to accept. They had also placed the sword with silver and copper buckles, which Colonel Gerineldo Marquez had left on the coat rack to enter Amaranta's sewing room unarmed, on top of the coffin. Behind the ox cart walked the survivors of the surrender negotiations at Neerlandia. They were barefoot. They had rolled up their trousers and were trudging through the mud. In one hand, they held sticks to prod the animals pulling the cart, and in the other, paper wreaths faded by the rain. They looked surreal on the street still bearing the name of Colonel Aureliano Buendia. As they passed in front of the house, they all turned their heads to look at the windows. Then they rounded the corner leading to the square and had to help move the cart stuck in the mud. Ursula, having Santa Sofia de la Piedad carry her, went out to the door. He examined the hardships of the funeral procession so carefully that no one doubted what his eyes saw.

699,"The condition of the streets alarmed Aureliano Segundo. He finally became worried about the state of his animals and he threw an oilcloth over his head and sent to Petra Cotes’s house. He found her in the courtyard, in the water up to her waist, trying to float the corpse of a horse. Aureliano Segundo helped her with a lever, and the enormous swollen body gave a turn like a bell and was dragged away by the torrent of liquid mud. Since the rain began, all that Petra Cotes had done was to clear her courtyard of dead animals. During the first weeks she sent messages to Aureliano Segundo for him to take urgent measures and he had answered that there was no rush, that the situation was not alarming, that there would be plenty of time to think about something when it cleared. She sent him word that the horse pastures were being flooded, that the cattle were fleeing to high ground, where there was nothing to eat and where they were at the mercy of jaguars and sickness. “There’s nothing to be done,” Aureliano Segundo answered her. “Others will be born when it clears.” Petra Cates had seen them die in dusters and the was able to butcher only those stuck in the mud. She saw with quiet impotence how the deluge was pitilessly exterminating a fortune that at one time was considered the largest and most solid in Macondo, and of which nothing remained but pestilence. When Aureliano Segundo decided to go see what was going on, he found only the corpse of the horse and a squalid mule in the ruins of the stable. Petra Cotes watched him arrive without surprise, joy, or resentment, and she only allowed herself an ironic smile.","The scene on the streets made Aureliano Segundo come to his senses. Worried too late about the fate of the livestock, he donned a raincoat and hurried to Petra Cotes' house. He found her in the yard, waist-deep in water, trying to push a dead horse away. Aureliano Segundo grabbed a ladder to help her push the carcass, and the enormous bloated body spun around before being swept away by the muddy current. Since the rain began, Petra Cotes had done nothing but drive the dead animals away from her yard with the water. In the first weeks, she sent messages to Aureliano Segundo urging him to return, but he replied that there was no hurry, that the situation was not yet serious, and that he would think of another solution when the rain stopped. She informed him that the pastures for the horses were flooded, that the livestock had fled to higher ground where they were starving and falling prey to tigers and diseases. ""There's no need to do anything,"" Aureliano Segundo replied to her: ""When the rain stops, they'll reproduce in abundance, don't worry."" Petra Cotes had seen the livestock die in droves and could barely manage to dispose of the stranded carcasses. With a sense of helplessness, she bitterly watched the flood mercilessly destroy an entire fortune, a fortune that was once considered the largest and most secure in Macondo, now reduced to a foul stench. When Aureliano Segundo decided to return to see what had happened, he found only the carcass of a stallion and a skinny mare still alive, trapped in the ruined stable.

Petra Cotes reported that the horse pastures were underwater, the sheep were swimming, there was no food left, and the animals had fallen prey to jaguars and disease. Aureliano Segundo responded, -There's nothing to be done, -when the weather improves, new ones will be born to replace the dead. Petra Cotes saw the animals dying in droves and could do nothing. He was only cutting those stuck in the mud. He watched in silent despair as the wealth, once considered the greatest and most powerful in Macondo, vanished in the ruthlessness of the deluge, leaving behind nothing but disease and destitution.

Aureliano Segundo stayed at her house more than three months, not because he felt better there than in that of his family, but because he needed all that time to make the decision to throw the piece of oilcloth back over his head. “There’s no rush,” he said, as he had said in the other home. “Let’s hope that it clears in the next few hours.” During the course of the first week he became accustomed to the inroads that time and the rain had made in the health of his concubine, and little by little he was seeing her as she had been before, remembering her jubilant excesses and the delirious fertility that her love provoked in the animals, and partly through love, partly through interest, one night during the second week he awoke her with urgent caresses. Petra Cotes did not react. “Go back to sleep,” she murmured. “These aren’t times for things like that.” Aureliano Segundo saw himself in the mirrors on the ceiling, saw Petra Cotes’s spinal column like a row of spools strung together along a cluster of withered nerves, and he saw that she was right, not because of the times but because of themselves, who were no longer up to those things.","She had grown old and frail, her bones protruding, her eyes green like a cat's, becoming more melancholic and gentle from watching the rain.

""There's no need to hurry,"" he said as he used to say at home, ""we'll wait for the rain to stop in the next few hours."" During the first week, he gradually got used to the deterioration that time and the incessant rain had caused to his lover's health, and gradually he began to see her as she once was, recalling her carefree joys and the wild fertility that her love had stimulated in the livestock. Then one evening in the second week, partly out of love and partly out of pleasure, he bargained to wake her up. Petra Cotes remained indifferent, unenthusiastic. ""Go back to sleep,"" she whispered, ""These days are not the time for us to frolic.""

702,"Aureliano Segundo returned home with his trunks, convinced that not only Úrsula but all the inhabitants of Macondo were waiting for it to dear in order to die. He had seen them as he passed by, sitting in their parlors with an absorbed look and folded arms, feeling unbroken time pass, relentless times, because it was useless to divide it into months and years, and the days into hours, when one could do nothing but contemplate the rain. The children greeted Aureliano Segundo with excitement because he was playing the asthmatic accordion for them again. But the concerts did not attract their attention as much as the sessions with the encyclopedia, and once more they got together in Meme’s room, where Aureliano Segundo’s imagination changed a dirigible into a flying elephant who was looking for a place to sleep among the clouds. On one occasion he came across a man on horseback who in spite of his strange outfit had a familiar look, and after examining him closely he came to the conclusion that it was a picture of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. He showed it to Fernanda and she also admitted the resemblance of the horseman not only to the colonel but to everybody in the family, although he was actually a Tartar warrior. Time passed in that way with the Colossus of Rhodes and snake charmers until his wife told him that there were only three pounds of dried meat and a sack of rice left in the pantry.","Aureliano Segundo carried his belongings back home, firmly believing that not only Úrsula but all the inhabitants of Macondo were waiting for the rain to stop so they could die. As he passed by, he saw them sitting in their living rooms with vacant eyes, holding their heads in their hands, listening to the passage of time—a complete, unspent time, for it was pointless to divide it into years, months, and days when all they could do was watch the rain fall. The children cheered Aureliano Segundo because he would play the worn-out accordion for them. But the concert did not captivate the children as much as the encyclopedia sessions, so the father, children, and grandchildren gathered in Meme’s bedroom, where Aureliano Segundo’s imagination turned the hot air balloon into a flying elephant looking for a place to sleep among the clouds. Once, he came across an image of a man on horseback, and despite the strange clothes the man wore, he recognized the familiar figure. After careful examination, he concluded it was a portrait of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. He showed it to Fernanda, and she also noticed that the rider not only resembled the Colonel but all the members of their family, even though it was actually a portrait of a Tartar warrior. And so he let time pass while looking at the statue of Rhodes and the fascinating pictures of snakes, until his wife informed him that there were only six kilos of salted meat and a sack of rice left in the pantry.",31.223,30.939,"Concluding that not only Ursula but all the residents of Macondo were waiting for the rain to stop in order to die, Aureliano Segundo gathered his belongings and returned home. As he passed through the streets, he saw the residents of Macondo sitting with their arms crossed in front of their windows, their eyes lost in thought, watching the relentless and merciless passage of time. Since nothing could be done beyond watching the rain, there was no need to divide time into months and years. The children welcomed Aureliano Segundo with joy because he played his hoarse accordion and entertained them. But what they really enjoyed more than these concerts was looking at the encyclopedia. They gathered again in Meme's room and began to listen to Aureliano's stories, which turned his flying balloon into a flying elephant searching for a place to sleep among the clouds. While Aureliano Segundo was flipping through the encyclopedia, he came across a picture of a man on horseback. Despite his strange attire, the man did not seem unfamiliar at all. After carefully examining it, Aureliano Segundo concluded that it was a portrait of Colonel Aureliano Buendia. He showed the portrait to Fernanda. She also agreed that the man on the horse resembled not only the colonel but the entire family. Yet in fact, it was a Tatar warrior in the picture. Time was passing by looking at the pictures of the Rhodes statue and the snake charmers. One day, his wife came into the room and informed Aureliano Segundo that there was only one and a half kilos of dried meat and a sack of rice left in the granary.",20.635,20.273,"Aureliano Segundo returned to the house with his trunks, convinced that not only Úrsula, but all the inhabitants of Macondo, were waiting for the rain to stop so they could die. He had seen them as he passed by, sitting in the living rooms with their gaze absorbed and their arms crossed, feeling an entire time pass, an untamed time, because it was useless to divide it into months and years, and the days into hours, when nothing could be done but watch the rain. The children received Aureliano Segundo with joy, who once again played the asthmatic accordion for them. But the concert did not capture their attention as much as the encyclopedic sessions, so once again they gathered in Meme's bedroom, where Aureliano Segundo's imagination turned the airship into a flying elephant looking for a place to sleep among the clouds. On one occasion, he found a man on horseback who, despite his exotic attire, retained a familiar air, and after much examination, he concluded that it was a portrait of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. He showed it to Fernanda, and she also admitted the resemblance of the rider not only to the colonel but to all the members of the family, although in truth he was a Tartar warrior. Thus, time passed for him, between the Colossus of Rhodes and the snake charmers, until his wife announced that there were no more than six kilos of salted meat and a sack of rice left in the granary.",46.755,46.557

706,"He was more interested in the encyclopedia than In the domestic problem, even when he had to content himself with a scrap of meat and a little rice for lunch. “It’s impossible to do anything now,” he would say. “It can’t rain for the rest of our lives.” And while the urgencies of the pantry grew greater, Fernanda’s indignation also grew, until her eventual protests, her infrequent outbursts came forth in an uncontained, unchained torrent that begin one morning like the monotonous drone of a guitar and as the day advanced rose in pitch, richer and more splendid. Aureliano Segundo was not aware of the singsong until the following day after breakfast when he felt himself being bothered by a buzzing that was by then more fluid and louder than the sound of the rain, and it was Fernanda, who was walking throughout the house complaining that they had raised her to be a queen only to have her end up as a servant in a madhouse, with a lazy, idolatrous, libertine husband who lay on his back waiting for bread to rain down from heaven while she was straining her kidneys trying to keep afloat a home held together with pins where there was so much to do, so much to bear up under and repair from the time God gave his morning sunlight until it was time to go to bed that when she got there her eyes were full of ground glass, and yet no one ever said to her, “Good morning, Fernanda, did you sleep well?” Nor had they asked her, even out of courtesy, why she was so pale or why she awoke with purple rings under her eyes in spite of the fact that she expected it, of course, from a family that had always considered her a nuisance, an old rag, a booby painted on the wall, and who were always going around saying things against her behind her back, calling her church mouse, calling her Pharisee, calling her crafty, and even Amaranta, may she rest in peace, had said aloud that she was one of those people who could not tell their rectums from their ashes, God have mercy, such words, and she had tolerated everything with resignation because of the Holy Father, but she had not been able to tolerate it any more when that evil José Arcadio Segundo said that the damnation of the family had come when it opened its doors to a stuck-up highlander, just imagine, a bossy highlander, Lord save us, a highlander daughter of evil spit of the same stripe as the highlanders the government sent to kill workers, you tell me, and he was referring to no one but her, the godchild of the Duke of Alba, a lady of such lineage that she made the liver of presidents’ wives quiver, a noble dame of fine blood like her, who had the right to sign eleven peninsular names and who was the only mortal creature in that town full of bastards who did not feel all confused at the sight of sixteen pieces of silverware, so that her adulterous husband could die of laughter afterward and say that so many knives and forks and spoons were not meant for a human being but for a centipede, and the only one who could tell with her eyes closed when the white wine was served and on what side and in which glass and when the red wine and on what side and in which glass, and not like that peasant of an Amaranta, may she rest in peace, who thought that white wine was served in the daytime and red wine at night, and the only one on the whole coast who could take pride in the fact that she took care of her bodily needs only in golden chamberpots, so that Colonel Aureliano Buendía, may he rest in peace, could have the effrontery to ask her with his Masonic Ill humor where she had received that privilege and whether she did not shit shit but shat sweet basil, just imagine, with those very words, and so that Renata, her own daughter, who through an oversight had seen her stool in the bedroom, had answered that even if the pot was all gold and with a coat of arms, what was inside was pure shit, physical shit, and worse even than any other kind because it was stuck-up highland shit, just imagine, her own daughter, so that she never had any illusions about the rest of the family, but in any case she had the right to expect a little more consideration from her husband because, for better or for worse, he was her consecrated spouse her helpmate, her legal despoiler, who took upon himself of his own free and sovereign will the grave responsibility of taking her away from her paternal home, where she never wanted for or suffered from anything, where she wove funeral wreaths as a pastime, since her godfather had sent a letter with his signature and the stamp of his ring on the sealing wax simply to say that the hands of his goddaughter were not meant for tasks of this world except to play the clavichord, and, nevertheless, her insane husband had taken her from her home with all manner of admonitions and warnings and had brought her to that frying pan of hell where a person could not breathe because of the heat, and before she had completed her Pentecostal fast he had gone off with his wandering trunks and his wastrel’s accordion to loaf in adultery with a wretch of whom it was only enough to see her behind, well, that’s been said, to see her wiggle her mare’s behind in order to guess that she was a, that she was a, just the opposite of her, who was a lady in a palace or a pigsty, at the table or in bed, a lady of breeding, God-fearing, obeying His laws and submissive to His wishes, and with whom he could not perform, naturally, the acrobatics and trampish antics that he did with the other one, who, of course, was ready for anything like the French matrons, and even worse, if one considers well, because they at least had the honesty to put a red light at their door, swinishness like that, just imagine, and that was all that was needed by the only and beloved daughter of Doña Renata Argote and Don Fernando del Carpio, and especially the latter, an upright man, a fine Christian, a Knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulcher, those who receive direct from God the privilege of remaining intact in their graves with their skin smooth like the cheeks of a bride and their eyes alive and clear like emeralds.","He was more engrossed in reading the encyclopedia than worrying about daily meals, even when he had to be content with eating dog meat and a little rice for lunch. ""Indeed, there's nothing that can be done right now,"" he said. ""But it can't rain all the time. "" And while he delayed worrying about the urgent need for food, Fernanda's outbursts grew more intense, including rare curses and profanities that flowed in an unstoppable torrent, starting early in the morning like the monotonous prelude of a guitar, and escalating in volume and melody as the day progressed, becoming more harmonious and captivating. Aureliano Segundo did not fully grasp the melodious curses until the next day, after breakfast, when he was irritated by a buzzing sound that now drowned out the rain, and it was Fernanda, who was pacing around the house lamenting that her parents had raised her like a queen only for her to end up as a servant in a house full of mad people, with a lazy, promiscuous husband who always lay on his back waiting for things to fall into his mouth while she had to work herself to the bone to maintain a nearly bankrupt family, a place that required much work, endurance, and reorganization from dawn till bedtime, leaving her eyes sore and aching, yet no one ever asked her if she slept well, not even out of courtesy, nor did anyone ask why she looked so pale or why her eyes were so dark-circled, even though she did not expect, of course, that such words would come from anyone in a family that always saw her as an obstacle, a nuisance, a monkey painted on the wall, and that the whole family spoke ill of her everywhere, calling her a hypocrite, a liar, a gecko, and even Amaranta, now resting in peace, harshly called her a dung beetle, God forgive, what terrible words, and she had endured it all with patience for the sake of the Holy Father's intentions, but she could no longer bear it when José Arcadio Segundo maliciously said that the family's ruin was due to letting a spy in, imagine that, oh Lord, a tyrannical spy, oh Lord, a spy with lowly blood, akin to the government agents sent to shoot workers, tell her, and who else could that refer to but her, the adopted daughter of the Duchess of Alba, a noble lady who bore presidents' wives, a true aristocrat who could sign with eleven illustrious surnames from Spain, and she was the only one in the village of bastards who felt proud of the sixteen place settings on the table, only for her niece to laugh and say that such an array of cutlery was not for God's children but for serpents, and she was the only one who could close her eyes and know when to serve colored wine, from which side, into which glass, unlike the rustic Amaranta, now resting, who thought white wine was for daytime and colored wine for night, and she was the only one in the coastal region who used a golden chamber pot instead of squatting like others, so much so that later Colonel Aureliano Buendía, now resting, with his Freemason's bile, dared to ask her where her arrogance came from, as if she shat flowers instead of shit, imagine that, he said such words, and Renata, her own daughter, who accidentally saw her feces in the bedroom, replied that indeed the pot was golden with a crest but the contents were real shit, but worse than other shit, it was spy shit, imagine that, her own daughter, so she could never expect anything from this family, but she still had the right to expect some respect from her husband, because no matter how bad he was, he was her husband, her creator, her legal judge, the one who voluntarily took on the responsibility of taking her out of her parents' house, where she wove mourning hats from palm leaves, because her godfather sent Aureliano Segundo a handwritten letter with a ring seal, just to tell him that her foster daughter's hands were not made for mundane tasks but for playing the harpsichord, yet the foolish husband dragged her out with those instructions but exiled her to a hellish place where it was unbearably hot, and before she finished her purification rites, he packed his suitcase and the harpsichord and went to live with a wretched woman, who people said just by looking at her buttocks, yes, just by watching her sway her young mare's hips, one could tell she was a completely different kind of woman - a lady, - whether in a mansion or a stable, at the table or in bed, always a national lady, who revered God and was His slave and obeyed Him, and who could not be compared, of course, to tightrope dancers and wandering women who offered themselves to others, of course, who offered themselves to all men, like French-style prostitutes, or even worse, imagine that, because even French-style prostitutes had the decency to light a red lamp at the door to welcome guests, at least that, those women lacked no vice, imagine that, and they could not be compared to her, the only and cherished daughter of Doña RenataArgote and Don Fernando del Carpio, first of all because he was a saint, a sheep among great sheep, a gentleman awarded the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, belonging to the class of people who received the divine privilege from God that their bodies would remain intact in the grave with smooth skin like a young girl in love and eyes bright and green as emeralds.",17.385,17.289,"Even if he had to eat a bite of meat with a spoonful of rice, the encyclopedia interested him more than the problems of the house. ""I can't do anything right now,"" he was saying, ""this rain won't last until the end of our lives."" As the sacks in the pantry reached their bottoms, Fernanda's anger was reaching its peak. When her complaints and grumblings proved useless, one morning, all her anger broke loose and her speech, which started in a monotone like the monotonous strumming of a guitar, rose and rose as the hours passed. Aureliano Segundo only became aware of the situation the next morning after breakfast, when he was disturbed by the buzzing that drowned out the sound of the rain and was more fluid than it. The irritating buzzing was coming from Fernanda. She was wandering around the house, saying that she had been raised to be a queen, but in the end, she had become a servant in this madhouse, and while she was exhausting herself to keep this crumbling house standing, her lazy, debauched, immoral husband was lying on his back waiting for bread to rain down from the sky. There was a heap of work to be done, she had reached her limit, she couldn't bear it anymore, from dawn to nightfall there were a myriad of things to repair and do, and when she went to bed at night, her eyes would sting from exhaustion, yet not a single soul would come up to her and ask -Good morning Fernanda, how are you, did you sleep well? No one even asked out of courtesy why she was so pale and wan, or why there were dark circles around her eyes when she got up in the morning. What more could be expected from this family who always saw her as a nuisance, a fool, and whispered behind her back? They mocked her, called her a church mouse, a prude, a know-it-all, a fraud. God forgive her sins, even Amaranta had said she was someone who stirred up her own mess, God forbid, she had uttered those words. Fernanda, because she had the fear of God in her heart, endured all this, but when that scoundrel Jose Arcadio Segundo said that the family had been doomed ever since this constipated woman, this conceited highlander, set foot in their house, she couldn't take it anymore. God help us, what kind of words were these, she had said that she was a girl born from the seed of the highlanders sent by the government to kill workers, and she had said these words to her, to herself, who was the godchild of the Duke of Alba. She was the daughter of such a noble family that the wives of the presidents were terrified when they heard of her lineage. They were going to insult a lady like her, a lady who carried noble blood in her veins, who had the right to line up eleven names in a row when signing her name, and who was the only one in this town full of ruffians who didn't lose her composure when she saw sixteen pieces of silver cutlery together! Her husband, that filthy womanizer, would make fun of her, saying that so many forks and knives would be of no use to people, and that at most, centipedes would use them, and he would have a good laugh! There was no one else who knew, with eyes closed, when and from which side and with which glass white wine should be served, and when and from which side and with which glass red wine should be served. That peasant who thought white wine should be drunk during the day and red wine at night -may God forgive his sins- was he like Amaranta? Who else in the whole coastal region had pissed in a golden chamber pot? Yet, -may God forgive his sins- Colonel Aureliano Buendia, with his Masonic head, had confronted him, mocking him by asking where he got that right, or if he shat basil instead of shit -yes, with those exact words. Upon this, Renata, his own daughter, who had secretly seen the chamber pot in his room, said that even if the pot was solid gold and had a crest on it, what was inside was the same old shit, and the worst kind because it was the shit of constipated highlanders. Think about it, if a man's own daughter spoke like that, what could be expected from the other members of the family? But no matter what, it was her right to expect her husband to be a bit more considerate, a bit more respectful. After all, by God's command, he was her husband, her spouse, the man who legally claimed her property. He had come to her father's house to take her, so he should have willingly taken on this responsibility. In her father's house, she lacked nothing; she had everything she could eat in front of her, and what she didn't eat was behind her. She never had to lift a finger; her godfather had only sent a letter in a sealed envelope with his signet ring pressed into the wax, asking that his dear goddaughter's delicate hands not be injured by any work other than playing the piano. To kill time, she would weave funeral wreaths. However, that lunatic who was to be her husband had brought her from her home by making countless promises and assurances, bringing her to this hellish place where one could hardly breathe from the heat. Before she could even complete her fast, her husband had packed his trunk, taken his accordion, and gone to the arms of a despicable woman. According to what people said, to understand what kind of woman she was, it was enough to look at her from behind and see how she swayed her hips like a wild mare. That woman was a... she was something else entirely, the complete opposite of herself. Whether in a palace or a pigsty, she never lost her ladylike demeanor, remaining a lady both at the table and in bed. She was well-bred, knew what the fear of God was, and submitted to God's laws—everything that she herself was not. Of course, her husband couldn't perform the acrobatics and reckless antics he did with the other woman with her. The other woman, like French courtesans, was ready for anything. She was even worse than them. At least they had the decency to hang a red lantern on their doors. This was the behavior that Dona Renata Argote and Don Fernando del Carpio deemed worthy of their one and only beloved daughter. Yet her father was such a respectable man. He was a devout Christian, a knight who had received the holy tomb insignia. Those who received this insignia, by the grace of God, would lie in their graves uncorrupted, their cheeks as fresh as a bride's, and their eyes as clear as emeralds.",16.08,15.972,"He remained more interested in the encyclopedia than in the domestic problem, even when he had to settle for scraps and a bit of rice for lunch. ""Now it's impossible to do anything,"" he said. ""It can't rain forever."" And the more he delayed addressing the barn's urgencies, the more intense Fernanda's indignation grew, until her occasional protests, her infrequent outbursts, overflowed into an uncontrollable, unleashed torrent that began one morning like the monotonous drone of a guitar, and as the day progressed, it rose in pitch, becoming richer and more splendid. Aureliano Segundo didn't become aware of the nagging until the next day, after breakfast, when he felt overwhelmed by a buzzing that was then more fluid and louder than the sound of the rain, and it was Fernanda, pacing around the house, lamenting that she had been educated like a queen only to end up as a servant in a house of lunatics, with a lazy, idolatrous, libertine husband who lay on his back waiting for bread to rain from the sky, while she broke her back trying to keep afloat a home propped up with pins, where there was so much to do, so much to endure and correct from dawn until bedtime, that she reached the bed with her eyes full of glass dust, and yet no one had ever said good morning, Fernanda, how did you sleep, Fernanda, nor had they asked her, even out of courtesy, why she was so pale or why she woke up with those violet circles under her eyes, even though she didn't expect, of course, that such words would come from the rest of a family that had always seen her as a nuisance, like the rag used to lower the pot, like a painted puppet on the wall, and who always gossiped about her in the corners, calling her sanctimonious, calling her a Pharisee, calling her a lizard, and even Amaranta, rest in peace, had said out loud that she was one of those who confused the rectum with the temples, blessed be God, what words, and she had endured everything with resignation for the Holy Father's intentions, but she couldn't take it anymore when the wicked José Arcadio Segundo said that the family's downfall had been opening the doors to a cachaca, imagine, a bossy cachaca, good heavens, a cachaca daughter of bad saliva, of the same ilk as the cachacos the government sent to kill workers, can you believe it, and he was referring to none other than her, the goddaughter of the Duke of Alba, a lady of such lineage that she made the wives of presidents' stomachs churn, a noblewoman of such blood that she had the right to sign with eleven peninsular surnames, and who was the only mortal in that town of bastards who didn't feel flustered in front of sixteen place settings, only for her adulterous husband to laugh and say that so many spoons and forks, and so many knives and little spoons were not a Christian thing, but a centipede's, and the only one who could determine with her eyes closed when to serve white wine, and from which side and in which glass, and when to serve red wine, and from which side and in which glass, unlike the rustic Amaranta, rest in peace, who thought white wine was served during the day and red wine at night, and the only one on the entire coast who could boast of never having relieved herself except in golden chamber pots, only for Colonel Aureliano Buendía, rest in peace, to have the audacity to ask with his bad Masonic bile where she had earned that privilege, if it was that she didn't shit crap, but astromelias, imagine, with those words, and for Renata, her own daughter, who had indiscreetly seen her major waters in the bedroom, to reply that indeed the chamber pot was very golden and very heraldic, but what it contained was pure crap, physical crap, and worse than others because it was cachaca crap, imagine, her own daughter, so she had never had illusions about the rest of the family, but she still had the right to expect a bit more consideration from her husband, since for better or worse he was her sacramental spouse, her author, her legitimate wrongdoer, who had taken upon himself by his own free and sovereign will the grave responsibility of taking her from her paternal home, where she never lacked or suffered for anything, where she wove funeral palms for entertainment, since her godfather had sent a letter with his signature and the seal of his ring imprinted in wax, just to say that his goddaughter's hands were not made for worldly tasks, except to play the clavichord, and yet her foolish husband had taken her from her home with all the warnings and admonitions and had brought her to that hellish cauldron where one couldn't breathe from the heat, and before she finished putting away her Pentecost diets, he had already left with his wandering trunks and his rogue accordion to indulge in adultery with an unfortunate woman whose buttocks alone, well, it was said, whose swaying buttocks alone were enough to guess that she was one, that she was one, the complete opposite of her, who was a lady in the palace or the pigsty, at the table or in bed, a lady by birth, God-fearing, obedient to His laws and submissive to His designs, and with whom, of course, he couldn't do the acrobatics and vagrancies he did with the other, who of course was up for anything, like French madams, and worse still, thinking about it, because at least they had the honesty to put a red light at the door, such filth, imagine, no more was needed, with the only and beloved daughter of Doña Renata Argote and Don Fernando del Carpio, and especially of him, of course, a holy man, a great Christian, Knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, one of those who receive directly from God the privilege of remaining intact in the tomb, with skin as smooth as bridal satin and eyes as alive and clear as emeralds.",40.224,40.174

708,"He had the patience to listen to her for a whole day until he caught her in a slip. Fernanda did not pay him any mind, but she lowered her voice. That night at dinner the exasperating buzzing of the singsong had conquered the sound of the rain. Aureliano, Segundo ate very little, with his head down, and he went to his room early. At breakfast on the following day Fernanda was trembling, with a look of not having slept well, and she seemed completely exhausted by her rancor. Nevertheless, when her husband asked if it was not possible to have a soft-boiled egg, she did not answer simply that they had run out of eggs the week before, but she worked up a violent diatribe against men who spent their time contemplating their navels and then had the gall to ask for larks’ livers at the table. Aureliano Segundo took the children to look at the encyclopedia, as always, and Fernanda pretended to straighten out Meme’s room just so that he could listen to her muttering, of course, that it certainly took cheek for him to tell the poor innocents that there was a picture of Colonel Aureliano Buendía in the encyclopedia. During the afternoon, while the children were having their nap, Aureliano Segundo sat on the porch and Fernanda pursued him even there, provoking him, tormenting him, hovering about him with her implacable horsefly buzzing, saying that, of course, while there was nothing to eat except stones, her husband was sitting there like a sultan of Persia, watching it rain, because that was all he was, a slob, a sponge, a good-for-nothing, softer than cotton batting, used to living off women and convinced that he had married Jonah’s wife, who was so content with the story of the whale. Aureliano Segundo listened to her for more than two hours, impassive, as if he were deaf. He did not interrupt her until late in the afternoon, when he could no longer bear the echo of the bass drum that was tormenting his head.","He had enough patience to listen to her scolding for an entire day until he caught a mistake that startled her. Fernanda did not heed him, but she had to lower her voice. That night, during dinner, Fernanda's ear-piercing scolding was drowned out by the sound of the falling rain. Aureliano Segundo ate very little, kept his head down, and got up to retire to his room quite early. At breakfast the next day, Fernanda was trembling with a tired appearance from a sleepless night and seemed completely shameless due to her anger. However, when her husband asked if he could have some hot eggs, she did not simply reply that they had run out of eggs since last week, but instead said she had written a vehement eulogy criticizing men who only care about their bellies and yet dare to demand to eat lark's liver. As usual, Aureliano Segundo took the children to look at the encyclopedia, and Fernanda pretended to tidy up Meme's room just to whisper to him alone: how shameless to tell the children that Colonel Aureliano Buendía's picture was in the encyclopedia. That afternoon, while the children were napping, Aureliano Segundo sat on the veranda, and Fernanda followed him out there, muttering insults like the buzzing of green flies to provoke him, to revile him, telling him that while the house had nothing left, not even stones to eat, her husband sat like a Persian king watching the rain fall, living off women and willing to marry the wife of Saint Jonah, who sat silently listening to the whale's tale. Aureliano Segundo did not move, like a deaf man, he listened to her scolding for two hours straight. He did not interrupt her, letting her scold until dusk, when he could no longer endure the incessant ringing that pained his head.",25.449,25.224,"Watching for the moment when the woman would be off guard; he had listened to her patiently for a whole day. Although Fernanda did not pay attention to what he said, she lowered her voice. That evening at dinner, Fernanda's constant nagging drowned out the sound of the rain. Aureliano Segundo, without lifting his head from his plate, took a few bites and retired to his room early. The next morning at breakfast, Fernanda was exhausted. He seemed not to have slept and appeared to be worn out from his own anger. Nevertheless, when her husband asked for a soft-boiled egg, instead of saying that the eggs had run out a week ago, Fernanda opened her mouth and closed her eyes, berating men whose minds were in their stomachs, complaining that they sat idly by and then demanded the moon when they came to the table. Aureliano Segundo, as usual, took the children and withdrew to the room to look at the encyclopedia. So that Fernanda could continue to nag him, she pretended to tidy up Meme's room. While she was grumbling there, it took courage for Aureliano Segundo to open the encyclopedia for the children and say that they had printed a picture of Colonel Aureliano Buendia. In the afternoon, after the children went to sleep, Aureliano Segundo went out to the veranda. Fernanda did not give up, stepping on his branch, clinging to him with her nagging that resembled the buzz of a horsefly. Even though there was nothing left to eat at home but stones, she kept saying that her husband was lounging around like a Persian shah, watching the rain, and that he was useless anyway. He was a wretch, only knew how to exploit like a sponge, was useless, had a softer disposition than cotton, was accustomed to living off women, did he think he was married to the wife of the Prophet Jonah who amused himself by listening to whale stories?

710,"Fernanda, quite the contrary, raised her pitch. “I don’t have any reason to shut up,” she said. “Anyone who doesn’t want to listen to me can go someplace else.” Then Aureliano Segundo lost control. He stood up unhurriedly, as if he only intended to stretch, and with a perfectly regulated and methodical fury he grabbed the pots with the begonias one after the other, those with the ferns, the oregano, and one after the other he smashed them onto the floor. Fernanda was frightened because until then she had really not had a clear indication of the tremendous inner force of her singsong, but it was too late for any attempt at rectification. Intoxicated by the uncontained torrent of relief, Aureliano Segundo broke the glass on the china closet and piece by piece, without hurrying, he took out the chinaware and shattered it on the floor. Systematically, serenely, in the same parsimonious way in which he had papered the house with banknotes, he then set about smashing the Bohemian crystal ware against the walls, the hand-painted vases, the pictures of maidens in flower-laden boats, the mirrors in their gilded frames, everything that was breakable, from parlor to pantry, and he finished with the large earthen jar in the kitchen, which exploded in the middle of the courtyard with a hollow boom. Then he washed his hands, threw the oilcloth over himself, and before midnight he returned with a few strings of dried meat, several bags of rice, corn with weevils, and some emaciated bunches of bananas. From then on there was no more lack of food.","On the contrary, Fernanda raised her voice even more. ""I have no reason to keep my mouth shut,"" she said. ""Anyone who doesn't want to listen to me can just get out."" At that moment, Aureliano Segundo could no longer control himself. He slowly stood up, as if just to stretch his muscles, and then, with a calm yet methodical fury, he began to pick up one pot after another—from begonias to ferns, from basil to other herbs—and threw each one onto the floor. Fernanda was terrified; because, in fact, she had not yet realized the inner strength of those curses, but when she did, it was too late, the situation could no longer be changed. Driven mad by the incessant cursing, Aureliano Segundo smashed the mirror of the glass cabinet, then calmly dismantled each part of the cabinet and smashed them. Following this order, with the same calm and harmony he had when pasting paper money on the walls, he shattered the Bohemian glassware, the fake flowers, the paintings of virgins standing on boats filled with roses, the mirrors framed in gold leaf, and everything else that could be broken from the house to the pantry. Finally, he ended by smashing the water jar with a deep, resonant crash. After that, he wiped his hands, wrapped himself in an oilcloth, and left. Before midnight, he returned with several vats of salted meat, sacks of rice and corn, and bunches of bananas. From that moment on, the house never lacked food.",13.735,13.213,"Fernanda, on the contrary, raised her voice. ""Why should I cut it?"" she said. Those who don't want to listen to me can leave and go somewhere else. Then Aureliano Segundo lost control of himself. He slowly stood up. He had an indifference as if he was getting up to stretch. Then, with an extremely methodical and orderly rage, he grabbed the begonia pots, the fern barrels, and the hydrangea pots one by one and smashed them on the ground. Fernanda was scared. Because she hadn't really understood the tension caused by the nagging she had maintained until that moment. Now it was far too late to calm things down and fix the situation. In the drunkenness brought on by this release, Aureliano Segundo, still not hurrying at all, broke the glass of the cabinet where the porcelain sets were kept, took out the porcelains one by one, and smashed them on the floor. Just as he had once covered the house from top to bottom with banknotes, with the same calmness and systematic work, he now began to throw the Bohemian crystals against the wall. Then he shattered everything that could be broken, from hand-painted vases, pictures of young girls in flowered boats, gilded framed mirrors, in short, everything from the living room to the pantry; finally, he threw the large jar in the kitchen into the garden. The jar shattered in the middle of the garden with a hollow explosion. Then Aureliano Segundo washed his hands, pulled the oilcloth over his head, and left. Before midnight, he returned with a few bundles of dried meat, a few bags of rice, worm-eaten corn, and a couple of bunches of rotten bananas. After that, there was never a shortage of food in the house.",18.101,17.708,"Fernanda, on the contrary, raised her voice. “I have no reason to keep quiet,” she said. “Anyone who doesn’t want to hear me can leave.” Then Aureliano Segundo lost control. He stood up without haste, as if he only intended to stretch his bones, and with a perfectly regulated and methodical fury, he began grabbing the pots of begonias, the fern pots, the oregano jars, and one by one he smashed them against the floor. Fernanda was frightened, for she had not until then had a clear awareness of the tremendous inner strength of the tirade, but it was already too late for any attempt at rectification. Drunk on the unstoppable torrent of release, Aureliano Segundo broke the glass of the window, and one by one, without hurrying, he took out the pieces of the dinnerware and shattered them against the floor. Systematic, serene, with the same slowness with which he had papered the house with bills, he then began breaking against the walls the Bohemian glassware, the hand-painted vases, the paintings of maidens in boats loaded with roses, the mirrors with golden frames, and everything that was breakable from the living room to the granary, and he finished with the kitchen jar that burst in the center of the patio with a deep explosion. Then he washed his hands, threw the waxed canvas over himself, and before midnight returned with some stiff strips of salted meat, several sacks of rice and weevily corn, and some withered bunches of bananas. From then on, food was never lacking again.",41.11,40.897
711,"Amaranta Úrsula and little Aureliano would remember the rains as a happy time. In spite of Fernanda’s strictness, they would splash in the puddles in the courtyard, catch lizards and dissect them, and pretend that they were poisoning the soup with dust from butterfly wings when Santa Sofía de la Piedad was not looking Úrsula was their most amusing plaything. They looked upon her as a big,. broken-down doll that they carried back and forth from one corner to another wrapped in colored cloth and with her face painted with soot and annatto, and once they were on the point of plucking out her eyes with the pruning shears as they had done with the frogs. Nothing gave them as much excitement as the wanderings of her mind. Something, indeed, must have happened to her mind during the third year of the rain, for she was gradually losing her sense of reality and confusing present time with remote periods of her life to the point where, on one occasion, she spent three days weeping deeply over the death of Petronila Iguarán, her great-grandmother, buried for over a century. She sank into such an insane state of confusion that she thought little Aureliano was her son the colonel during the time he was taken to see ice, and that the José Arcadio who was at that time in the seminary was her firstborn who had gone off with the gypsies. She spoke so much about the family that the children learned to make up imaginary visits with beings who had not only been dead for a long time, but who had existed at different times. Sitting on the bed, her hair covered with ashes and her face wrapped in a red kerchief, Úrsula was happy in the midst of the unreal relatives whom the children described in all detail, as if they had really known them. Úrsula would converse with her forebears about events that took place before her own existence, enjoying the news they gave her, and she would weep with them over deaths that were much more recent than the guests themselves. The children did not take long to notice that in the course of those ghostly visits Úrsula would always ask a question destined to establish the one who had brought a life-size plaster Saint Joseph to the house to be kept until the rains stopped. It was in that way that Aureliano Segundo remembered the fortune buried in some place that only Úrsula knew, but the questions and astute maneuvering that occurred to him were of no use because in the labyrinth of her madness she seemed to preserve enough of a margin of lucidity to keep the secret which she would reveal only to the one who could prove that he was the real owner of the buried gold. She was so skillful and strict that when Aureliano Segundo instructed one of his carousing companions to pass himself off as the owner of the fortune, she got him all caught up in a minute interrogation sown with subtle traps.","Perhaps Amaranta Úrsula and little Aureliano would remember this flood as a time of great happiness. Despite Fernanda's constant strictness, the children still splashed around in the yard, hunting lizards to cut them open and playing a game of poisoning the soup by adding butterfly dust if Santa Sofía de la Piedad wasn't watching carefully. Úrsula was the most interesting toy for the children. They treated her like an old doll to be decorated: smearing her face with soot and red dye, tying colorful fabric scraps on her, and carrying her around the corners of the room, almost using garden shears to gouge out her eyes as they had done with toads. Nothing delighted them more than her rambling words. Indeed, since the third year of the flood, something unusual had happened in her mind, as she gradually lost her sense of current reality, confusing the present with distant periods of her life, until she wept bitterly for three days over the death of Petronila Iguarán, her great-grandmother, who had been buried nearly a century ago. She sank into such a bizarre state of confusion that she believed this little Aureliano was her son, the colonel, at the time when he was taken by his father to see ice, and that José Arcadio, who was studying to become a Pope, was her firstborn son, who had left home to follow the gypsies. She talked so much about her family that the children memorized the names to organize imaginary outings for her with people who were not only long dead but also from different periods. Sitting on the bed with hair as gray as ash and a red scarf covering her face, Úrsula was truly happy living among the family members imagined and described by the children in such detail, as if they really knew them. Ursula talked with her elders about events that had occurred before she was born, she rejoiced at the news they gave her, and then she wept with them for those who had recently died more than for those who were already dead and talking to her. It wasn't long before the children learned that during those imaginary outings, Ursula always asked a question to determine who, during the war, had brought a life-sized plaster statue of Saint Joseph to the house for the family to take care of through the stormy season. Thanks to this, Aureliano Segundo remembered the treasure buried somewhere that only Úrsula knew, but all his questions and every cunning trick he could think of to probe Úrsula proved useless, because while wandering through the mysterious corners of her delirium, Úrsula always maintained a spark of intellect to protect the secret she intended to reveal only to someone who could prove themselves the true owner of the carefully hidden gold. She was so astute and clever that when Aureliano Segundo orchestrated one of his drinking buddies to pose as the owner of the buried treasure and brought him to meet his great-grandmother, he failed before a series of meticulous, trap-laden questions from her.",22.648,22.464,"Amaranta Ursula and little Aureliano would always remember their rainy days as a happy period. Despite all of Fernanda's strictness, the children would dive into and out of the puddles in the garden, catch lizards and cut them, and when Santa Sofia de la Piedad turned her back, they would play a game of supposedly poisoning the soup by adding the dust from butterfly wings. Their main entertainment was Ursula. The children saw her as a big, unbreakable doll, wrapping her in colorful blankets, painting her face with soot and coal, and carrying her from place to place. Once, just like they did with the frogs, they almost gouged out Ursula's eyes with the gardener's shears. Nothing amused them as much as Ursula's ramblings. In the third year of the rain, Ursula's brain really started to soften. She was gradually losing her grasp on reality, mixing up today and yesterday. She saw events from her distant past as if they had just happened. Once, she even cried non-stop for three days because she thought her great-grandmother Petronila Iguaran, who had been dead for over a century, had just died. His mind became so confused that he began to think of little Aureliano as his own son, the colonel, and to see him as if he were at the age when he went to see ice with his father. At that time, he also thought of Jose Arcadio, who was studying at the seminary, as his eldest son who had run away with the gypsies. He constantly talked about the family, listing all the relatives. Eventually, the children learned to dream of being together not only with relatives who had died long ago but also with people who had lived at different times. Ursula, with ashes sprinkled in her hair and a red scarf tied around her face, would sit on her bed and listen with pleasure as the children vividly described these unreal relatives as if they had seen them with their own eyes. Ursula would talk about events that had happened long before she was born, rejoice in the good news they brought, and weep with them over the deaths of people who had lived long after the times of these imaginary guests. Not long after, a situation that caught the children's attention occurred. Ursula had a question that she directed to each of the people she imagined, one by one. She was investigating who had brought the life-sized statue of Saint Joseph into the house to keep it there until the rains stopped. Thus, the buried treasure, known only to Ursula, came to Aureliano Segundo's mind. However, no matter how roundabout his questions were, no matter how much he tried to coax her, he couldn't make the woman talk. Despite all her confusion, Ursula still retained the awareness to not reveal the secret of the buried gold to anyone other than its true owner. She was so strict and cunning on this matter that when Aureliano Segundo tried to pass off one of his friends as the owner of the gold, Ursula bewildered the man with her questions, making him look ridiculous.",16.478,16.244,"Amaranta Úrsula and little Aureliano would remember the deluge as a happy time. Despite Fernanda's strictness, they splashed in the backyard swamps, hunted lizards to dismember them, and played at poisoning the soup by adding butterfly wing dust when Santa Sofía de la Piedad wasn't looking. Úrsula was their most entertaining toy. They treated her like a large decrepit doll, carrying her around the corners, dressed in colorful rags with her face painted with soot and annatto, and once they were about to gouge out her eyes as they did to toads with pruning shears. Nothing caused them as much joy as her ravings. Indeed, something must have happened in her brain in the third year of the rain, because little by little she lost her sense of reality, confusing the present time with remote periods of her life, to the point that on one occasion she spent three days crying inconsolably over the death of Petronila Iguarán, her great-grandmother, who had been buried for over a century.

The children soon noticed that during these ghostly visits, Úrsula always posed a question aimed at establishing who had brought a life-sized plaster Saint Joseph to the house during the war to keep it safe until the rain passed. It was thus that Aureliano Segundo remembered the fortune buried somewhere only Úrsula knew, but the questions and cunning maneuvers he devised were useless, because in the labyrinths of her delirium, she seemed to retain a margin of lucidity to defend that secret, which she would only reveal to the one who proved to be the true owner of the buried gold.

712,"Convinced that Úrsula would carry the secret to her grave, Aureliano Segundo hired a crew of diggers under the pretext that they were making some drainage canals in the courtyard and the backyard, and he himself took soundings in the earth with iron bars and all manner of metal-detectors without finding anything that resembled gold in three months of exhaustive exploration. Later on he went to Pilar Ternera with the hope that the cards would we more than the diggers, but she began by explaining that any attempt would be useless unless Úrsula cut the cards. On the other hand, she confirmed the existence of the treasure with the precision of its consisting of seven thousand two hundred fourteen coins buried in three canvas sacks reinforced with copper wire within a circle with a radius of three hundred eighty-eight feet with Úrsula’s bed as the center, but she warned that it would not be found until it stopped raining and the suns of three consecutive Junes had changed the piles of mud into dust. The profusion and meticulous vagueness of the information seemed to Aureliano Segundo so similar to the tales of spiritualists that he kept on with his enterprise in spite of the fact that they were in August and they would have to wait at least three years in order to satisfy the conditions of the prediction. The first thing that startled him, even though it increased his confusion at the same time, was the fact that it was precisely three hundred eighty-eight feet from Úrsula’s bed to the backyard wall. Fernanda feared that he was as crazy as his twin brother when she saw him taking the measurements, and even more when he told the digging crew to make the ditches three feet deeper. Overcome by an exploratory delirium comparable only to that of his great-grandfather when he was searching for the route of inventions, Aureliano Segundo lost the last layers of fat that he had left and the old resemblance to his twin brother was becoming accentuated again, not only because of his slim figure, but also because of the distant air and the withdrawn attitude. He no longer bothered with the children. He ate at odd hours, muddled from head to toe, and he did so in a corner in the kitchen, barely answering the occasional questions asked by Santa Sofía de la Piedad. Seeing him work that way, as she had never dreamed him capable of doing, Fernanda thought that his stubbornness was diligence, his greed abnegation, and his thick-headedness perseverance, and her insides tightened with remorse over the virulence with which she had attacked his idleness. But Aureliano Segundo was in no mood for merciful reconciliations at that time. Sunk up to his neck in a morass of dead brandies and rotting flowers, he flung the dirt of the garden all about after having finished with the courtyard and the backyard, and he excavated so deeply under the foundations of the east wing of the house that one night they woke up in terror at what seemed to be an earthquake, as much because of the trembling as the fearful underground creaking. Three of the rooms were collapsing and a frightening crack had opened up from the porch to Fernanda’s room. Aureliano Segundo did not give up the search because of that. Even when his last hopes had been extinguished and the only thing that seemed to make any sense was what the cards had predicted, he reinforced the jagged foundation, repaired the crack with mortar, and continued on the side to the west. He was still there on the second week of the following June when the rain began to abate and the clouds began to lift and it was obvious from one moment to the next that it was going to clear. That was what happened. On Friday at two in the afternoon the world lighted up with a crazy crimson sun as harsh as brick dust and almost as cool as water, and it did not rain again for ten years.","Because he believed that Úrsula would take this secret to her grave, Aureliano Segundo hired a team of workers under the pretext of digging drainage ditches for the front and back yards, and he himself used a pickaxe and metal detectors to dig everywhere but found no evidence of gold in three months of fruitless excavation. Then, believing that the cards saw more clearly than the workers' eyes, he hurried to see Pilar Ternera; but the old woman also warned him that he would not find it until after three years of continuous rain and drought had turned the mud into dust. The seemingly profound and unsubstantiated figures of that prediction made Aureliano Segundo feel that it was like an intelligent fable meant to make him stop his work and wait at least three more years to satisfy the prophecy's conditions. The first thing that surprised him and confused him even more was this fact: from Úrsula's bed to the fence in the backyard was exactly one hundred and twenty meters, just as Pilar Ternera had predicted. Fernanda feared that her husband was going mad like his twin brother when she saw him calculating intently, and even worse, when he ordered the workers to dig another meter deeper in the already dug ditches. Driven by a passion for the exciting excavations—a passion that could be compared to his great-great-grandfather's when he sought the path to great inventions—Aureliano Segundo grew thin, and thus his resemblance to his twin brother became even more pronounced, not only because of his emaciated appearance but also because of his distant demeanor and contemplative attitude. He did not care about the children. He ate at any time, even when he was covered in mud from head to toe, sitting in the corner of the kitchen and barely responding to Santa Sofía de la Piedad's casual questions. Seeing him work in such a grueling manner, something she had never dreamed he would do so fervently, Fernanda believed that his timidity was actually caution, that his greed was actually sacrifice, that his stubbornness was actually perseverance, and from the bottom of her heart, she regretted that the third-generation Arab still sat in the same place with the attitude of his ancestors, meaning contemplative, dignified, and unbothered by time and misfortune, living and dying as they had through the insomnia plague and the thirty-two civil wars of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Their healthy and steadfast spirits amidst the decay of chessboards, eateries, shooting galleries, and the alley where people went to have their fortunes read and dreams interpreted were so astonishing that Aureliano Segundo, with his usual flippant attitude, had to ask by what mystical means they had not drowned in the recent flood, as if some devilish hand had helped them stay afloat, and one after another, from house to house, they all answered him with dreamy looks and sly smiles, saying the same thing:",13.003,12.851,"After concluding that Aureliano Segundo would definitely take Ursula's secret to the grave, he hired a bunch of workers under the pretext of digging water channels in the front and back yards and started having the garden excavated. He himself took iron rods and various types of metal detectors in hand and examined the soil. Despite their exhaustive efforts for three months, they found nothing resembling gold. Upon this, Aureliano Segundo, thinking that playing cards might be more useful than the workers, went to Pilar Ternera. However, Pilar said that unless Ursula cut the cards, they would not reach a conclusion. At the same time, not hesitating to specify the treasure down to the last penny, she stated that there were exactly seven thousand two hundred and fourteen gold coins in three sacks tied with copper wire; and that the sacks were buried within a circle with a radius of one hundred meters, centered on Ursula's bed. For this treasure to be found, the rains had to stop and the sun of three consecutive Junes had to dry the piles of mud and turn them into dust. Aureliano Segundo, who compared the roundness and ambiguity of the fortune teller's words to those of the spirit summoners, preferred to continue the excavations despite being in August and needing to wait at least three years for the fortune to come true. The first thing that surprised and confused him was that the distance between Ursula's bed and the back garden wall was exactly three hundred meters. When Fernanda saw her husband meticulously measuring the garden and heard him telling the workers to dig the channels one meter deeper, she believed that he, like his twin brother, was also a madman. However, Aureliano Segundo, who was caught up in a passion for research comparable to the effort his great-grandfather showed while searching for a path, melted the last of the fat layers he had accumulated in this endeavor. He began to resemble his twin brother again as before. This resemblance came not only from his thinning but also from adopting a pensive and introverted demeanor like his brother. He no longer dealt with the children. He wandered around covered in mud from head to toe, snacking in the kitchen corner whenever he felt like it, and only answered Santa Sofia de la Piedad's questions once in a blue moon. Seeing her husband working so hard, Fernanda, who thought he was incapable of doing any work, attributed his sullenness to deprivation and fatigue, his silence to asceticism, and his stubbornness to a resilient faith, feeling regret for having scolded him as a loafer all this time. However, Aureliano was in no mood to compromise at that time. He was burying himself in the decayed branches and flowers up to his neck, and after finishing the front and back gardens, he started cleaning the flower beds. He had dug so deeply under the eastern wing of the house, reaching the foundation, that one night the household, awakened by the shaking of the house and the sounds coming from underground, thought there was an earthquake. Three of the rooms were collapsing. A deep crack opened between Fernanda's room and the veranda. Even though the house was collapsing, Aureliano Segundo did not pause his investigation. Even when their last hopes were extinguished and the wisest thing seemed to be to wait for what the fortune would say, Aureliano Segundo did not give up. He repaired the collapsing foundation, filled the crack with mortar, and continued digging along the side of the house towards the west. In the second week of June the following year, when the rain had lightened, the clouds began to disperse, and the weather was about to clear up, Aureliano Segundo was still digging along the side of the house. Indeed, the weather cleared up. On a Friday at two o'clock, the world was illuminated by a sun as red as brick dust and as cool as water. After that, it didn't rain for ten years.",18.577,18.412,"Convinced that Úrsula would take the secret to her grave, Aureliano Segundo hired a team of diggers under the pretext of building drainage channels in the yard and backyard, and he himself probed the ground with iron bars and all kinds of metal detectors, without finding anything resembling gold in three months of exhaustive explorations. Later, he turned to Pilar Ternera, hoping that the cards would see more than the diggers, but she began by explaining that any attempt was useless unless Úrsula was the one to cut the deck. However, she confirmed the existence of the treasure, specifying that it consisted of seven thousand two hundred and fourteen coins buried in three canvas sacks with copper wire drawstrings, within a circle with a radius of one hundred and twenty-two meters, taking Úrsula's bed as the center, but warned that it would not be found until the rain stopped and the suns of three consecutive Junes turned the mud into dust. The profusion and meticulous vagueness of the data seemed to Aureliano Segundo so similar to spiritualist fables that he insisted on his endeavor despite it being August and it would have been necessary to wait at least three years to satisfy the conditions of the prediction. The first thing that astonished him, although it also increased his confusion, was finding that there were exactly one hundred and twenty-two meters from Úrsula's bed to the backyard fence. Fernanda feared he was as crazy as his twin brother when she saw him taking measurements, and even more so when he ordered the digging teams to deepen the trenches by another meter. Gripped by an exploratory delirium comparable only to that of his great-grandfather when he was searching for the route of inventions, Aureliano Segundo lost the last pockets of fat he had left, and the old resemblance to his twin brother became accentuated again, not only because of his thinning figure but also because of his distant air and introspective attitude.

He ate at any hour, covered in mud from head to toe, and did so in a corner of the kitchen, barely responding to the occasional questions from Santa Sofía de la Piedad.

But Aureliano Segundo was not then in the mood for merciful reconciliations. Buried up to his neck in a swamp of dead branches and rotten flowers, he turned the garden soil inside out after finishing with the yard and backyard, and drilled so deeply into the foundations of the house's eastern gallery that one night they were awakened in terror by what seemed to be a cataclysm, both from the tremors and the dreadful underground creaking, and it turned out that three rooms were collapsing and a chilling crack had opened from the corridor to Fernanda's bedroom. Aureliano Segundo did not give up the exploration because of this. Even when the last hopes had faded and the only thing that seemed to make any sense were the predictions of the cards, he reinforced the damaged foundations, filled the crack with mortar, and continued digging on the western side. He was still there in the second week of the following June when the rain began to subside and the clouds started to lift, and it was clear that it was about to stop raining at any moment. And so it did.

713,"Macondo was in ruins. In the swampy streets there were the remains of furniture, animal skeletons covered with red lilies, the last memories of the hordes of newcomers who had fled Macondo as wildly as they had arrived. The houses that had been built with such haste during the banana fever had been abandoned. The banana company tore down its installations. All that remained of the former wired-in city were the ruins. The wooden houses, the cool terraces for breezy card-playing afternoons, seemed to have been blown away in an anticipation of the prophetic wind that years later would wipe Macondo off the face of the earth. The only human trace left by that voracious blast was a glove belonging to Patricia Brown in an automobile smothered in wild pansies. The enchanted region explored by José Arcadio Buendía in the days of the founding, where later on the banana plantations flourished, was a bog of rotting roots, on the horizon of which one could manage to see the silent foam of the sea. Aureliano Segundo went through a crisis of affliction on the first Sunday that he put on dry clothes and went out to renew his acquaintance with the town. The survivors of the catastrophe, the same ones who had been living in Macondo before it had been struck by the banana company hurricane, were sitting in the middle of the street enjoying their first sunshine. They still had the green of the algae on their skin and the musty smell of a corner that had been stamped on them by the rain, but in their hearts they seemed happy to have recovered the town in which they had been born. The Street of the Turks was again what it had been earlier, in the days when the Arabs with slippers and rings in their ears were going about the world swapping knickknacks for macaws and had found in Macondo a good bend in the road where they could find respite from their age-old lot as wanderers. Having crossed through to the other side of the rain. the merchandise in the booths was falling apart, the cloths spread over the doors were splotched with mold, the counters undermined by termites, the walls eaten away by dampness, but the Arabs of the third generation were sitting in the same place and in the same position as their fathers and grandfathers, taciturn, dauntless, invulnerable to time and disaster, as alive or as dead as they had been after the insomnia plague and Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s thirty-two wars. Their strength of spirit in the face of ruins of the gaming tables, the fritter stands, the shooting galleries, and the alley where they interpreted dreams and predicted the future made Aureliano Segundo ask them with his usual informality what mysterious resources they had relied upon so as not to have gone awash in the storm, what the devil they had done so as not to drown, and one after the other, from door to door, they returned a crafty smile and a dreamy look, and without any previous consultation they all gave the answer:","Their healthy and steadfast spirits amidst the decay of chessboards, eateries, shooting galleries, and the alley where people went to have their fortunes read and dreams interpreted were so astonishing that Aureliano Segundo, with his usual flippant attitude, had to ask by what mystical means they had not drowned in the recent flood, as if some devilish hand had helped them stay afloat, and one after another, from house to house, they all answered him with dreamy looks and sly smiles, saying the same thing:",0.131,0.121,"Macondo had turned into ruins. In the mud-swamped streets, broken furniture and animal skeletons covered with red lilies stood as the last memories of those who left Macondo as crazily as they had come. The houses hastily built during the banana plague were abandoned. The Banana Company dismantled its facilities. All that remained of the old wire-fenced site was a heap of ruins. Wooden houses, breezy cool terraces thought for afternoon card parties, had scattered and flown away as if they were the harbinger of the divine hurricane that would erase Macondo from the earth years later. The only human trace left from that relentless wind was Patricia Brown's glove, found in a car crushed among wild violets. The magical area discovered by Jose Arcadio Buendia during the town's founding days, and later used for banana plantations, became a swamp covered with decaying roots. Even the silent foam of the sea could now be seen on the horizon. Aureliano Segunda put on his dry clothes and went out into the street on the first Sunday to rediscover the town, feeling great sorrow. Those who survived the disaster, that is, the Macondolans from before the Banana Company storm, were sitting in the middle of the street, enjoying the first sunny weather. The moss green that the rain hit on their faces and the bitter smell of being cornered were still on them, yet the joy of reclaiming the town they were born in warmed their hearts. The Turkish Street had regained its old appearance. In the days when Arabs with sandaled feet and ringed ears traveled the world bartering trinkets with parrots and saw Macondo as a place to pause their age-old wanderings, the Turkish Street was in the same condition as it is now. The goods that had survived the rain were scattered on the stalls, the fabrics hanging over the doors were moldy in places, the stalls had been gnawed by worms, and the walls were eroded by dampness. Yet, the Arabs of the third generation, just like their fathers and grandfathers, sat in the same places and in the same manner as their ancestors, indifferent, carefree, and immune to time and disasters. Even after the insomnia plague and after Colonel Aureliano Buendía's thirty-two wars, they continued to sit like this, whether alive or dead. Aureliano Segundo, amazed at their resilience in the face of the collapse and disintegration of the gambling tables, the pita stands, the shooting galleries, and the passage where they interpreted dreams and told fortunes, approached the Arabs with his usual boldness and went door to door asking which mysterious sources they relied on to avoid being swept away by the storm and which devilish inventions they used to avoid drowning.",20.833,20.648,"Macondo was in ruins. In the swamps of the streets, there were shattered furniture, skeletons of animals covered with red lilies, last memories of the hordes of newcomers who fled from Macondo as hastily as they had arrived. The houses hastily erected during the banana fever had been abandoned. The banana company dismantled its facilities. Only the rubble remained of the old fenced city. The wooden houses, the cool terraces where serene afternoons of card games took place, seemed ravaged by a premonition of the prophetic wind that years later would erase Macondo from the face of the earth. The only human trace left by that voracious breath was a glove of Patricia Brown in the car smothered by bougainvilleas. The enchanted region that José Arcadio Buendía explored in the times of the foundation, and where later the banana plantations prospered, was a swamp of rotting stumps, on whose distant horizon the silent foam of the sea could be seen for several years. Aureliano Segundo suffered a crisis of affliction the first Sunday he wore dry clothes and went out to recognize the town. The survivors of the catastrophe, the same ones who already lived in Macondo before it was shaken by the hurricane of the banana company, were sitting in the middle of the street enjoying the first suns. They still retained on their skin the green of algae and the smell of corners imprinted by the rain, but deep in their hearts, they seemed satisfied to have recovered the town where they were born. The Street of the Turks was once again as it was before, in the times when the Arabs with slippers and earrings who roamed the world exchanging macaws for trinkets found in Macondo a good place to rest from their millenary condition of nomadic people. On the other side of the rain, the merchandise of the bazaars was falling to pieces, the fabrics displayed at the door were streaked with moss, the counters undermined by termites, and the walls gnawed by humidity, but the Arabs of the third generation were sitting in the same place and in the same attitude as their fathers and grandfathers, taciturn, impassive, invulnerable to time and disaster, as alive or as dead as they were after the insomnia plague and the thirty-two wars of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Their strength of spirit in the face of the rubble of the gaming tables, the fried food stalls, the shooting galleries, and the alley where dreams were interpreted and the future was foretold was so astonishing that Aureliano Segundo asked them with his usual informality what mysterious resources they had used to avoid sinking in the storm, how the hell they had managed not to drown, and one by one, from door to door, they returned a sly smile and a dreamy look, and all gave him, without prior agreement, the same answer:",44.705,44.607

She had seen the final destruction of her stables, her barns dragged off by the storm. but she had managed to keep her house standing. During the second year she had sent pressing messages to Aureliano Segundo and he had answered that he did not know when he would go back to her house, but that in any case he would bring along a box of gold coins to pave the bedroom floor with. At that time she had dug deep into her heart, searching for the strength that would allow her to survive the misfortune, and she had discovered a reflective and just rage with which she had sworn to restore the fortune squandered by her lover and then wiped out by the deluge. It was such an unbreakable decision that Aureliano Segundo went back to her house eight months after the last message and found her green disheveled, with sunken eyelids and skin spangled with mange, but she was writing out numbers on small pieces of paper to make a raffle.

She witnessed the last pieces of her livestock pens being swept away by the flood, but she kept her house standing against the storms. In the final year of the flood, she reminded Aureliano Segundo to return quickly, and he replied that he would not return to her house, that she should forget about asking when he would come back, but that he would bring a chest of gold to pave her bedroom floor. So she tossed and turned, digging deep within herself to find the strength to survive this difficult period, and she found a carefully nurtured sense of resentment, both genuine and well-thought-out, with which she vowed to reclaim the wealth squandered by her lover and ruined by the flood. It was an unbreakable determination, so much so that eight months after her last message, Aureliano Segundo returned home to find her pale, disheveled, with sunken eyes and blotchy red skin from itching, yet still diligently writing numbers on small slips of paper for the lottery. Aureliano Segundo stood frozen, and because he was now also thin and solemn, Petra Cotes could not believe that the person who had come back to her was her lifelong lover and instead thought he was his twin brother.",16.466,15.775,"Perhaps the only person among the locals who had an Arab heart was Petra Cotes. He had watched his barns being razed to the ground, seen his granary collapse in the storm, but he had managed to keep his house standing.

Her decision was so resolute that, eight months after Aureliano Segundo received the last message, he went to her house and found her with disheveled hair, a greenish complexion, and skin covered with scabies marks, working feverishly at the table preparing raffle tickets for household items. Aureliano Segundo was taken aback when he saw the situation.

719,"ÚRSULA HAD to make a great effort to fulfill her promise to die when it cleared. The waves of lucidity that were so scarce during the rains became more frequent after August, when an and wind began to blow and suffocated the rose bushes and petrified the piles of mud, and ended up scattering over Macondo the burning dust that covered the rusted zinc roofs and the age-old almond trees forever. Úrsula cried in lamentation when she discovered that for more than three years she had been a plaything for the children. She washed her painted face, took off the strips of brightly colored cloth, the dried lizards and frogs, and the rosaries and old Arab necklaces that they had hung all over her body, and for the first time since the death of Amaranta she got up out of bed without anybody’s help to join in the family life once more. The spirit of her invincible heart guided her through the shadows. Those who noticed her stumbling and who bumped into the archangelic arm she kept raised at head level thought that she was having trouble with her body, but they still did not think she was blind. She did not need to see to realize that the flower beds, cultivated with such care since the first rebuilding, had been destroyed by the rain and ruined by Aureliano Segundo’s excavations, and that the walls and the cement of the floors were cracked, the furniture mushy and discolored, the doors off their hinges, and the family menaced by a spirit of resignation and despair that was inconceivable in her time. Feeling her way along through the empty bedrooms she perceived the continuous rumble of the termites as they carved the wood, the snipping of the moths in the clothes closets, and the devastating noise of the enormous red ants that had prospered during the deluge and were undermining the foundations of the house. One day she opened the trunk with the saints and had to ask Santa Sofía de la Piedad to get off her body the cockroaches that jumped out and that had already turned the clothing to dust. “A person can’t live in neglect like this,” she said. “If we go on like this we’ll be devoured by animals.” From then on she did not have a moment of repose. Up before dawn, she would use anybody available, even the children. She put the few articles of clothing that were still usable out into the sun, she drove the cockroaches off with powerful insecticide attacks, she scratched out the veins that the termites had made on doors and windows and asphyxiated the ants in their anthills with quicklime. The fever of restoration finally brought her to the forgotten rooms. She cleared out the rubble and cobwebs in the room where José Arcadio Buendía had lost his wits looking for the Philosopher’s stone, she put the silver shop which had been upset by the soldiers in order, and lastly she asked for the keys to Melquíades’ room to see what state it was in. Faithful to the wishes of José Arcadio Segundo, who had forbidden anyone to come in unless there was a clear indication that he had died, Santa Sofía de la Piedad tried all kinds of subterfuges to throw Úrsula off the track. But so inflexible was her determination not to surrender even the most remote corner of the house to the insects that she knocked down every obstacle in her path, and after three days of insistence she succeeded in getting them to open the door for her. She had to hold on to the doorjamb so that the stench would not knock her over, but she needed only two seconds to remember that the schoolgirls’ seventy-two chamberpots were in there and that on one of the rainy nights a patrol of soldiers had searched the house looking for José Arcadio Segundo and had been unable to find him.","Ursula had to make a great effort to fulfill her vow to die when the weather cleared up. The rare flashes of clarity that she experienced during the rainy days, which began in August, started to appear more frequently as dry winds blew in, suffocating the rose bushes and hardening the mud, scattering hot dust over Macondo, covering the rusty tin roofs and the century-old almond trees. Ursula was saddened to realize that for more than three years she had been nothing but a plaything for the children. She washed off the smeared makeup, discarded the colorful strings, the dried lizard and toad carcasses, and the fake and ancient Arab necklaces that had been draped around her; and for the first time since Amaranta's death, she got out of bed without assistance, to once again integrate herself into family life. The indomitable will of her heart guided Ursula through the darkness. Those who paused to let her stumble past and touched her arm, which felt like a saint's arm raised to head height, thought that she could hardly bear the weight of her body, but still did not believe that she was blind. Without needing to see, Ursula knew that the carefully planted flower beds from the first reconstruction of the house had been ruined by rain and Aureliano Segundo's gold-digging, that the walls and cement floors were cracked, the furniture was faded and mossy, the doors were loose, and the family was threatened by a spirit of weakness and boredom that had never existed in the days when she was strong and steady: Groping through the empty bedrooms, Ursula recognized the continuous creaking of termites gnawing at the wood, the rustling of termites invading the wardrobes, and the terrifying rumble of the giant red ants that had multiplied rapidly during the flood, digging into the house's foundations. One day, Ursula opened the chest containing the holy relics and had to ask SantaSofia de la Piedad to chase away the cockroaches that jumped out and covered her, having chewed up the clothes inside the chest. ""We can't live in such neglect,"" Ursula said. ""At this rate, those creatures will eat us alive. "" From that time on, Ursula had no moment of peaceful rest. She got up at dawn, demanding help from anyone, even the children. She took out the few usable clothes to sun-dry, used insecticide to repel the cockroaches, sealed the termite holes in the doors and windows, and used quicklime to suffocate the ants in their nests. The urge to repair the house led Ursula to the rooms where Jose Arcadio Buendia had strained his mind to create alchemical stones, reorganizing the jewelry workshop that had been disrupted by the soldiers, and finally, she demanded the key to Melquiades' room to see what condition it was in. Faithful to Jose Arcadio Segundo's wish that no one enter the room until there was a sign of his death, SantaSofia de la Piedad used every trick to deceive Ursula. But Ursula's determination to eradicate the pests even in the hidden and useless parts of the house was unyielding, overcoming all obstacles. After three days of persistent demands, Ursula forced everyone to open the room for her. Ursula had to hold onto the doorframe to avoid falling from the stench, but within two seconds she remembered that seventy-two chamber pots of the female students were kept there, and recalled that on one of the first rainy nights, a patrol of soldiers had searched the house looking for Jose Arcadio Segundo but found nothing.",21.446,21.3,"Ursula had to make a great effort to fulfill the promise she made when the weather improved. In August, with the dry wind that began to blow, wilting the rose bushes, hardening the mud piles like stone, and raising angry dust clouds that would never lift from the rusty zinc roofs and century-old almond trees, Ursula's waves of consciousness, which had thinned during the rains, increased, and she began to gather her wits. When Ursula realized that she had been the children's toy for more than three years, she raised hell, started cursing and swearing. She washed her face, threw off the colorful pieces of fabric on her back, discarded the dried lizards, frogs, amulets, and Arab necklaces that the children had attached here and there, and for the first time since Amaranta's death, she got out of bed without asking for anyone's help and joined the household. His heart never faltered, it guided him in the dark. Those who saw him stumble or those who bumped into his arm, which he always kept at head level, thought there was something wrong with Ursula's body, never considering that he might be blind. After the first repair of the house, it wasn't necessary for Ursula to see to understand that the carefully tended flower beds had been ruined by the rain, then overturned by Aureliano Segundo's excavations; that the walls and floor cements had cracked, the furniture had aged and faded, the doors had come off their hinges, and that the whole family had, with a despair unimaginable in her youth, let everything go to ruin. While wandering through the empty bedrooms with her cane, she could hear the constant ticking of the wood-eating worms, the rustling of the moths in the wardrobes, and the nerve-wracking noise of the huge red ants that had emerged during the flood and were gnawing at the house's foundations. One day, she opened the chest where the saint statues were kept, then called Santa Sofia de la Piedad and told her to clean out the cockroaches that had shredded the clothes in the chest and swarmed over her as soon as the lid was opened. ""A person cannot live in such neglect,"" she said. ""If this continues, we will become food for the animals."" From that moment on, Ursula did not stop for a moment. She would wake up before dawn and put anyone she could catch, whether child or adult, to work. She laid out the few usable clothes in the sun and eradicated the cockroaches with various insecticides. He plugged the wormholes in the doors and windows and the ant nests with quicklime. This repair frenzy eventually brought Ursula to the forgotten rooms. She removed the cobwebs from the room where Jose Arcadio Buendia lost his mind over alchemy, cleaned its filth; she straightened the silver workshop that the soldiers had ransacked, and finally, to understand the state of the room, she asked for the keys to Melquiades' room. Santa Sofia de la Piedad, trying to comply with Jose Arcadio Segundo's wish that no one enter the room until it was certain he was dead, went to great lengths to deceive Ursula. However, since Ursula was determined not to surrender even the farthest corners of the house to an invasion of insects, she overcame all the obstacles put in her way. After insisting for three days, she finally managed to get the door opened. When the door opened, she had to hold onto it to avoid fainting from the stench that hit her face. It took her only two seconds to remember that the seventy-two chairs bought for the girls coming from school were there and that the soldiers who raided the house on a rainy night did not find Jose Arcadio Segundo.",18.392,18.211,"Úrsula had to make a great effort to fulfill her promise to die when the rain stopped.

724,"When she said it she realized that she was giving the same reply that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had given in his death cell, and once again she shuddered with the evidence that time was not passing, as she had just admitted, but that it was turning in a circle. But even then she did not give resignation a chance. She scolded José Arcadio Segundo as if he were a child and insisted that he take a bath and shave and lend a hand in fixing up the house. The simple idea of abandoning the room that had given him peace terrified José Arcadio Segundo. He shouted that there was no human power capable of making him go out because he did not want to see the train with two hundred cars loaded with dead people which left Macondo every day at dusk on its way to the sea. “They were all of those who were at the station,” he shouted. “Three thousand four hundred eight.” Only then did Úrsula realize that he was in a world of shadows more impenetrable than hers, as unreachable and solitary as that of his great-grandfather. She left him in the room, but she succeeded in getting them to leave the padlock off, clean it every day, throw the chamberpots away except for one, and to keep José Arcadio Segundo as clean and presentable as his great-grandfather had been during his long captivity under the chestnut tree. At first Fernanda interpreted that bustle as an attack of senile madness and it was difficult for her to suppress her exasperation. But about that time José Arcadio told her that he planned to come to Macondo from Rome before taking his final vows, and the good news filled her with such enthusiasm that from morning to night she would be seen watering the flowers four times a day so that her son would not have a bad impression of the house. It was that same incentive which induced her to speed up her correspondence with the invisible doctors and to replace the pots of ferns and oregano and the begonias on the porch even before Úrsula found out that they had been destroyed by Aureliano Segundo’s exterminating fury. Later on she sold the silver service and bought ceramic dishes, pewter bowls and soup spoons, and alpaca tablecloths, and with them brought poverty to the cupboards that had been accustomed to India Company chinaware and Bohemian crystal. Úrsula always tried to go a step beyond. “Open the windows and the doors,” she shouted. “Cook some meat and fish, buy the largest turtles around, let strangers come and spread their mats in the corners and urinate in the rose bushes and sit down to eat as many times as they want and belch and rant and muddy everything with their boots, and let them do whatever they want to us, because that’s the only way to drive off rain.” But it was a vain illusion. She was too old then and living on borrowed time to repeat the miracle of the little candy animals, and none of her descendants had inherited her strength. The house stayed closed on Fernanda’s orders.","When she said that, Úrsula realized that she was repeating the words of Colonel Aureliano Buendía in the death row cell, and once again she shivered with the feeling that time did not pass but rather it circled back. But at that moment, she also did not concede. Úrsula scolded José Arcadio Segundo like a child and insisted that he bathe, shave, and contribute to the housework. José Arcadio Segundo was tormented. The simple thought of having to leave the room that had brought him peace terrified José Arcadio Segundo. He screamed that no one could make him leave this room because he did not want to see the two hundred-car train carrying the dead that every evening ran from Macondo to the sea. ""Those are all the people outside the station,"" José Arcadio Segundo screamed, ""three thousand four hundred and eight people."" It was then that Úrsula realized that José Arcadio Segundo lived in a world shrouded in an even more incomprehensible fog than her own, a world as solitary and impenetrable as that of José Arcadio Buendía, his great-great-grandfather. Ursula allowed Jose Arcadio Segundo to stay in that room, but she did not let others lock the door as before. She insisted on daily cleaning, throwing away the other chamber pots, leaving only one, and keeping Jose Arcadio Segundo always clean and presentable, just like his great-grandfather when he was tied under the chestnut tree. At first, Fernanda considered that state of excitement to be senility brought on by old age, and she struggled to control her irritation. But during that time, from Rome, Jose Arcadio informed her that he intended to return to Macondo before taking his vows for a lifetime of religious service, and that good news lifted Fernanda's spirits so much that she watered the flowers four times a day, from evening till morning, to ensure her son would not have a bad impression of the house. It was this excitement that led Fernanda to hastily write letters to the invisible doctors, rearrange the potted ferns, wild marjoram, and begonias in the hallway, before Ursula could find out that all those things had been smashed to pieces by Aureliano Segundo in a fit of terrible rage. After that, Fernanda sold the silver dinner sets and bought alloy cups and saucers; thus, with these items, she made the cabinets that once held Indian Company porcelain and Bohemian glassware grow poorer each day. Ursula always tried to go very far. ""Open all the doors!"" she shouted. ""Cook dishes with meat and fish, buy the largest turtles; oh strange guests, come and spread your luggage in every corner, and feel free to pee in the rose beds, sit at the table and eat as many meals as you like, vomit and talk endlessly, wear boots and dirty everything, do whatever you want with us, because that is the only way to avoid ruin.""

But even at that moment, he didn't let himself go, scolded Jose Segundo like a child, told him to wash up and shave, and to help with the house repairs. The idea of leaving the room that had brought him peace horrified Jose Arcadio Segundo. He shouted that no human being had the power to make him leave the room, that he did not want to see the two hundred-car train loaded with corpses departing from Macondo every evening. ""Everyone at the station was on the train,"" he shouted. ""There were exactly three thousand four hundred and eight of them."" It was only then that Ursula realized he was living in a more insurmountable world of shadows than her own, an unreachable and desolate realm like that of his great-grandfather. Ursula left Jose Arcadio Segundo in the room without bothering him. But she did not have a lock installed. She kept one of the chairs and had the others removed. She started having the room cleaned every day. She tried to keep Jose Arcadio Segundo as clean and presentable as during his great-grandfather's long captivity under the chestnut tree. At first, Fernanda interpreted this intense activity as a result of senility and struggled to hide her weariness and frustration. It was around that time that Jose Arcadio wrote that he would come to Macondo from Rome before taking his priestly vows. This time, Fernanda gathered her skirt around her waist. She was at a loss about what to do to prevent her son from seeing the house as gloomy, sometimes watering the flowers four times a day. With the same concerns, she sped up her correspondence with the invisible doctors and restored the ferns, begonias, and hydrangeas that Aureliano Segundo's destructive rage had scattered, even before Ursula noticed the pots were out of place. Then she sold the silverware and replaced it with ceramic plates, tin bowls, iron spoons, and cotton tablecloths. Thus, the sideboards, accustomed to the porcelain of the India company and Bohemian crystals, were left forlorn. Ursula was always looking to take things one step further. ""Open the windows and doors,"" she shouted, ""Cook some meat and fish, get the largest turtles you can find, let strangers come and sprawl in every corner they find, let them pee at the base of the rose bushes, let them eat as much as they want, let them stain and muddy everything with their boots, let them do whatever they want to us, only then can we stop the ruin,"" she said. It was an empty dream. Ursula was now excessively old and could no longer repeat the miracle of the animal-shaped candies. None of her children or grandchildren had inherited her strength. In the end, Fernanda's words came true and the house remained closed.",23.002,22.825,"In saying it, she became aware that she was giving the same reply that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had received in his condemned cell, and once again she shuddered at the realization that time did not pass, as she had just admitted, but rather went around in circles. But even then, she did not give resignation a chance. She scolded José Arcadio Segundo as if he were a child, and insisted that he bathe and shave and lend his strength to finish restoring the house. The mere idea of leaving the room that had provided him peace terrified José Arcadio Segundo. He shouted that no human power could make him leave, because he did not want to see the train of two hundred cars loaded with dead bodies that departed from Macondo to the sea every evening. “They are all the ones who were at the station,” he shouted. “Three thousand four hundred and eight. ”Only then did Úrsula understand that he was in a world of darkness more impenetrable than hers, as unbreakable and solitary as that of the great-grandfather. She left him in the room, but managed to ensure that they no longer locked the door, that they cleaned every day, that they threw the chamber pots in the trash and left only one, and that they kept José Arcadio Segundo as clean and presentable as the great-grandfather had been in his long captivity under the chestnut tree. At first, Fernanda interpreted that bustle as a fit of senile madness, and barely suppressed her exasperation. But around that time, José Arcadio announced from Rome that he planned to go to Macondo before taking his perpetual vows, and the good news filled her with such enthusiasm that overnight she found herself watering the flowers four times a day so that her son would not form a bad impression of the house. It was that same incentive that induced her to hasten her correspondence with the invisible doctors, and to replace the pots of ferns and oregano, and the begonias in the corridor, long before Úrsula found out that they had been destroyed by Aureliano Segundo’s exterminating fury. Later, she sold the silver service, and bought ceramic dishes, soup tureens, pewter ladles, and alpaca cutlery, impoverishing the cupboards accustomed to the Company of India’s crockery and Bohemian glassware. Úrsula always tried to go further. “Open doors and windows,” she shouted. “Cook meat and fish, buy the biggest turtles, let the strangers come to lay their mats in the corners and urinate on the rosebushes, let them sit at the table to eat as many times as they want, and let them belch and rant and smear everything with their boots, and let them do whatever they want with us, because that is the only way to ward off ruin. ”But it was a vain illusion. She was already too old and living too long to repeat the miracle of the little caramel animals, and none of her descendants had inherited her strength. The house remained closed by Fernanda’s order.",51.82,51.735
725,"Aureliano Segundo, who had taken his trunks back to the house of Petra Cotes, barely had enough means to see that the family did not starve to death. With the raffling of the mule, Petra Cotes and he bought some more animals with which they managed to set up a primitive lottery business. Aureliano Segundo would go from house to house selling the tickets that he himself painted with colored ink to make them more attractive and convincing, and perhaps he did not realize that many people bought them out of gratitude and most of them out of pity. Nevertheless, even the most pitying purchaser was getting a chance to win a pig for twenty cents or a calf for thirty-two, and they became so hopeful that on Tuesday nights Petra Cotes’s courtyard overflowed with people waiting for the moment when a child picked at random drew the winning number from a bag. It did not take long to become a weekly fair, for at dusk food and drink stands would be set up in the courtyard and many of those who were favored would slaughter the animals they had won right there on the condition that someone else supply the liquor and music, so that without having wanted to, Aureliano Segundo suddenly found himself playing the accordion again and participating in modest tourneys of voracity. Those humble replicas of the revelry of former times served to show Aureliano Segundo himself how much his spirits had declined and to what a degree his skill as a masterful carouser had dried up. He was a changed man. The two hundred forty pounds that he had attained during the days when he had been challenged by The Elephant had been reduced to one hundred fifty-six; the glowing and bloated tortoise face had turned into that of an iguana, and he was always on the verge of boredom and fatigue. For Petra Cotes, however, he had never been a better man than at that time, perhaps because the pity that he inspired was mixed with love, and because of the feeling of solidarity that misery aroused in both of them. The broken-down bed ceased to be the scene of wild activities and was changed into an intimate refuge. Freed of the repetitious mirrors, which had been auctioned off to buy animals for the lottery, and from the lewd damasks and velvets, which the mule had eaten, they would stay up very late with the innocence of two sleepless grandparents, taking advantage of the time to draw up accounts and put away pennies which they formerly wasted just for the sake of it. Sometimes the cock’s crow would find them piling and unpiling coins, taking a bit away from here to put there, to that this bunch would be enough to keep Fernanda happy and that would be for Amaranta Úrsula’s shoes, and that other one for Santa Sofía de la Piedad, who had not had a new dress since the time of all the noise, and this to order the coffin if Úrsula died, and this for the coffee which was going up a cent a pound in price every three months, and this for the sugar which sweetened less every day, and this for the lumber which was still wet from the rains, and this other one for the paper and the colored ink to make tickets with, and what was left over to pay off the winner of the April calf whose hide they had miraculously saved when it came down with a symptomatic carbuncle just when all of the numbers in the raffle had already been sold. Those rites of poverty were so pure that they nearly always set aside the largest share for Fernanda, and they did not do so out of remorse or charity, but because her well-being was more important to them than their own. What was really happening to them, although neither of them realized it, was that they both thought of Fernanda as the daughter that they would have liked to have and never did, to the point where on a certain occasion they resigned themselves to eating crumbs for three days, so that she could buy a Dutch tablecloth. Nevertheless, no matter how much they killed themselves with work, no matter how much money they eked out, and no matter how many schemes they thought of, their guardian angels were asleep with fatigue while they put in coins and took them out trying to get just enough to live with. During the waking hours when the accounts were bad. they wondered what had happened in the world for the animals not to breed with the same drive as before, why money slipped through their fingers, and why people who a short time before had burned rolls of bills in the carousing considered it highway robbery to charge twelve cents for a raffle of six hens. Aureliano Segundo thought without saying so that the evil was not in the world but in some hidden place in the mysterious heart of Petra Cotes, where something had happened during the deluge that had turned the animals sterile and made money scarce. Intrigued by that enigma, he dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found love, because by trying to make her love him he ended up falling in love with her. Petra Cotes, for her part, loved him more and more as she felt his love increasing, and that was how in the ripeness of autumn she began to believe once more in the youthful superstition that poverty was the servitude of love. Both looked back then on the wild revelry, the gaudy wealth, and the unbridled fornication as an annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to fund the paradise of shared solitude. Madly in love after so many years of sterile complicity, they enjoyed the miracle of loving each other as much at the table as in bed, and they grew to be so happy that even when they were two worn-out old people they kept on blooming like little children and playing together like dogs.","After moving his belongings to Petra Cotes' house, Aureliano Segundo immediately sought a way to save the family from starvation. With the proceeds from gambling with his mule, they bought some other animals and from there established a simple lottery. Aureliano Segundo went from house to house selling lottery tickets he had drawn himself with colored ink to make them attractive and persuasive, unaware that many people bought those tickets just to give them away, and most bought out of pity. But there were also those who bought tickets hoping for a chance: spending only twenty cents for a pig or thirty-two cents for a calf, these people were excited with hope, and on the third night, they crowded into Petra Cotes' yard, waiting for the moment when a randomly chosen child would draw the winning number from a bag. Soon, the lottery became a weekly fair, as from the afternoon, eating and drinking spots were set up in the yard, and many of the lucky winners lost their prize animals to listen to music and drink, so, although unwillingly, Aureliano Segundo once again played the accordion and participated in small drinking parties. These modest gatherings, compared to previous festivities, made Aureliano Segundo realize that his spirit had significantly declined and his exceptional singing and dancing skills had also deteriorated considerably. He was a completely changed man. When Aureliano Segundo was defeated by ""The She-Elephant,"" he weighed one hundred and twenty kilos, but now he was down to seventy-eight; his face, once full like a turtle's shell, now looked gaunt like a chameleon's, and he always seemed weary and despondent. But Petra Cotes had never seen Aureliano Segundo in better shape, perhaps confusing love with pity for him, and hardship had fostered a bond between them. Now, the bed without curtains was no longer a place for orgies but a place for discussions and confidences. The mirrors that once reflected their images had been sold to buy lottery prize animals, and the seductive silks had been eaten by the mule; they stayed up late with the clarity of two insomniac old people, calculating money, a time they previously wasted on exhausting themselves. Sometimes, the first crow of the rooster startled them as they shuffled small stacks of money, taking a bit from here and adding a bit there to make sure one amount pleased Fernanda, another bought shoes for Amaranta Úrsula, another for SantaSofía de la Piedad, who hadn't had a new dress since the bankruptcy, another to pay for Úrsula's coffin when she died, another to buy coffee whose price increased by a cent every three months, another to buy sugar that grew less sweet each day, another to buy firewood still soaked from the flood, another to buy paper and ink for lottery tickets, and another to cover the loss of a cow that died in April because it got sick after all the lottery tickets had been sold, but luckily, they still managed to salvage the hide. These ""prayer"" sessions were pure, always prioritizing Fernanda, not out of remorse or charity, but because Fernanda's assets were more important to them than their own. The truth was that both, unbeknownst to each other, thought of Fernanda as the daughter they had always wished for but never had, to the point that once they endured eating corn cakes for three days to buy Fernanda a Dutch tablecloth. But despite their hard work, cunning schemes, and many tricks, their guardian angels had fallen asleep from exhaustion, while they kept adding and subtracting the money, striving to at least have enough to live on. During sleepless nights due to painful calculations, they wondered what had happened in the world that made livestock less fertile than before, why money in hand kept dwindling, why not long ago people burned handfuls of money in folk dances, but now they consider buying a twelve-cent lottery ticket in hopes of winning six hens as a reckless act. Aureliano Segundo thought to himself that the misfortune was not anywhere else in the world but in a deep, hidden place in the mysterious heart of Petra Cotes, where something had happened during the rainy days that made livestock infertile and money gradually disappear. Worried about this mystery, Aureliano Segundo delved too deeply into Petra Cotes's emotions to the extent that in seeking profit, he found love, because while trying to make Petra Cotes love him, Aureliano Segundo himself fell in love with her. As for Petra Cotes, she loved Aureliano Segundo because she felt he was more affectionate towards her every day, and thus, in the autumn of her life, Petra Cotes believed in the superstition of her youth that poverty was the supporter of love. At that time, they regarded the wild festivities, the luxurious wealth, and the excessive indulgence as obstacles in life, and they regretted having wasted so much of their lives before finding the paradise of shared solitude. They loved each other madly after so many years of being together without having children, they enjoyed their love in a strange way: loving each other while eating as well as while sleeping, and they were truly happy, until old age and exhaustion, they still played like rabbits and teased each other like dogs.",18.5,18.403,"Aureliano Segundo, who had moved his trunks back to Petra Cotes' house, could only find time to take care of his family just enough to keep them from starving. With the money they obtained by putting the mule in the lottery, Petra Cotes and Aureliano Segundo bought a few more heads of cattle and established a primitive lottery system. Aureliano Segundo went door to door selling tickets that he had colored with ink to make them look more appealing and convincing, and he perhaps did not realize that many people bought tickets out of an old sense of gratitude or simply out of pity. Undoubtedly, even a buyer driven by a sense of pity did not forget that by spending twenty cents, they had a chance to win a pig, and by spending thirty-two cents, they could win a cow. They became so invested in this matter that Petra Cotes' garden started to be packed on Tuesday nights. Everyone eagerly awaited the moment when a child randomly selected from the crowd would draw the tickets from the bag. Soon, these Tuesday draws took on the appearance of a weekly fair. As night fell, food and drink stalls were set up in the garden. Most of the winners, on the condition that someone else would buy drinks and play music, would immediately slaughter and roast the animals they had won right there on the spot. Thus, without understanding how it happened, Aureliano Segundo found himself once again in the midst of festivities with an accordion in his hand. These gatherings, which were humble copies of the festivities of old days, proved to Aureliano Segundo how much he had lost his former cheerfulness and how his skill in organizing entertainment had become bland. He had become a completely different man. His one hundred and twenty-kilogram body from the days when he challenged the elephant had dropped to seventy-five kilograms, and his swollen, red face that resembled a turtle had wrinkled like iguana skin. He would quickly get bored and tired easily. However, in Petra Cotes' eyes, he had never been as unique a person as he was in those days. Perhaps the feeling of pity the woman felt was mixed with love, or perhaps the sense of loneliness and helplessness that poverty had made them both experience was bringing them closer. The broken bed had ceased to be a scene of wild lovemaking and had become a warm refuge. In the room stripped of the mirrors lined up for sale to buy lottery animals and the silks and velvets devoured by the mule, they sat up late like sleepless grandmothers and grandfathers, valuing their sleepless nights by keeping accounts and adding up the pennies they once squandered for pleasure. Sometimes the crowing of roosters caught them while they were stacking money. They would take a little from one of the money towers they had stacked and add it to another, calculating that this much would be enough to keep Fernanda's mouth shut, this much would buy shoes for Amaranta Ursula, with this they could buy clothes for Santa Sofia de la Piedad who hadn't worn anything new since all the commotion, this would be Ursula's coffin money if she died, this was the coffee money that increased by two cents per kilo every three months, this was the sugar share that tasted less every day, with this they could buy lumber that hadn't dried yet after the rain, and this would be the money for the paper and colored ink needed to make tickets. The rest, after all the tickets were sold, would be the consolation prize for the lottery winner because the week's prize calf turned out to be scrawny and they were left with nothing but the animal's hide. These modest accounts were so free from ulterior motives that they almost always allocated the largest share to Fernanda, not because they wanted to silence their consciences or because they pitied her, but because her comfort was more important to them than their own. In fact, without realizing it, both of them had started to see Fernanda as the daughter they had always wanted but could never have. Once, just so Fernanda could buy a Dutch tablecloth, Petra Cotes and Aureliano Segundo ate nothing but dry bread for three days. No matter what they did, no matter how hard they tried, no matter how many pennies they managed to save, they never heard the words ""Go ahead, my servant,"" and they could only barely stay afloat by spending their savings little by little. On the days when accounts reached an impasse, they were deeply pondering how the world had changed so much, why animals no longer reproduced as they used to, why money slipped through their fingers, and why those who recently lit bonfires with banknotes for fun now considered it robbery to ask for twelve cents for a lottery ticket worth six chickens. Aureliano Segundo thought that the evil was not in the world but in Petra Cotes' heart, that the animals became infertile and money lost its value because of a change in the woman's heart during the deluge, but he couldn't reveal this. Consumed by this suspicion, Aureliano Segundo began to scrutinize the woman's feelings; he delved so deep that, while seeking interest, he found love. Because while trying to make the woman love him, he ended up falling in love with her. As Petra Cotes saw Aureliano Segundo's love growing, she began to love him more and more, and in the autumn of her life, she started to believe once again that when two hearts unite, even a barn can become a paradise. Both of them began to view their past excesses, that vast fortune, and their unrestrained lovemaking as unnecessary and troublesome, and they regretted wasting so many years of their lives to find the paradise of shared solitude. After living for years in a barren chaos, they began to savor the miracle of being madly in love and being able to love each other as much at the table as in bed. They became so happy that even when they were like two worn-out ping-pong balls, they did not stop rejoicing like children and playing like puppy dogs.",21.457,21.362,"Aureliano Segundo, who had moved his trunks back to Petra Cotes' house, barely had the means to keep the family from starving. With the raffle of the mule, Petra Cotes and he had bought other animals, with which they managed to set up a rudimentary lottery business. Aureliano Segundo went from house to house, offering the little tickets that he himself painted with colored inks to make them more attractive and convincing, and perhaps he didn't realize that many bought them out of gratitude, and most out of compassion. However, even the most pious buyers acquired the chance to win a pig for twenty cents or a heifer for thirty-two, and they got so excited with hope that on Tuesday night they overflowed Petra Cotes' patio waiting for the moment when a randomly chosen child would draw the winning number from the bag. It didn't take long for it to turn into a weekly fair, as from dusk tables of fried foods and drink stands were set up in the patio, and many of the winners would sacrifice the animal they had won right there on the condition that others provide the music and the liquor, so that without having wished it, Aureliano Segundo suddenly found himself playing the accordion again and participating in modest gluttony tournaments. These humble replicas of the revelries of other days served for Aureliano Segundo himself to discover how much his spirits had declined and to what extent his ingenuity as a master cumbia player had dried up. He was a changed man. The one hundred and twenty kilos he had during the time he challenged La Elefanta had reduced to seventy-eight; his candid and bloated turtle face had turned into that of an iguana, and he was always close to boredom and fatigue. For Petra Cotes, however, he was never a better man than at that time, perhaps because she confused with love the compassion he inspired in her, and the feeling of solidarity that misery had awakened in both of them. The dismantled bed ceased to be a place of excesses and became a refuge for confidences. Freed from the repeating mirrors they had sold to buy raffle animals, and from the lustful damasks and velvets that the mule had eaten, they stayed awake until very late with the innocence of two sleepless grandparents, taking advantage of the time they used to waste on wasting themselves to do accounts and move cents around. Sometimes the first roosters would catch them making and unmaking little piles of coins, taking a bit from here to put it there, so that this would be enough to please Fernanda, and that for Amaranta Úrsula's shoes, and this other for Santa Sofía de la Piedad who hadn't had a new dress since the noisy times, and this for making the coffin if Úrsula died, and this for the coffee that went up a cent per pound every three months, and this for the sugar that sweetened less and less, and this for the firewood that was still wet from the deluge, and this other for the paper and colored ink for the tickets, and what was left to start paying off the value of the April calf, whose hide they miraculously saved because it got symptomatic anthrax when almost all the raffle numbers were sold.

726,"The raffles never got very far. At first Aureliano Segundo would spend three days of the week shut up in what had been his rancher’s office drawing ticket after ticket, Painting with a fair skill a red cow, a green pig, or a group of blue hens, according to the animal being raffled, and he would sketch out a good imitation of printed numbers and the name that Petra Cotes thought good to call the business: Divine Providence Raffles. But with time he felt so tired after drawing up to two thousand tickets a week that he had the animals, the name, and the numbers put on rubber stamps, and then the work was reduced to moistening them on pads of different colors. In his last years it occurred to him to substitute riddles for the numbers so that the prize could be shared by all of those who guessed it, but the system turned out to be so complicated and was open to so much suspicion that he gave it up after the second attempt.","The lotteries never made them any better off. At first, Aureliano Segundo spent three days a week locking himself in the room that used to be the cattle breeder's office to draw one ticket after another, carefully coloring a red cow, a green pig, or a blue chicken, which were the animals hung as prizes, and skillfully imitating the printed letters to make the template for the lottery ticket name, a name that Petra Cotes liked very much, ""The Lottery of the Divine Almighty""... But then Aureliano Segundo felt too tired after drawing two thousand lottery tickets in a week, so he made a rubber template to print the animals, the lottery ticket name, and the numbers, and from then on, he only had to color them.

At first, Aureliano Segundo would lock himself in the room that had once been the farm's office for three days a week, cut the tickets, and draw pictures on them that were not too amateurish: a red cow, a green pig, or a few blue chickens, according to the animal featured in that week's lottery. Then, with great care, he would put the numbers on the tickets with handwriting that he tried to make resemble printing press letters, and he would write ""Divine Providence Lottery,"" which was Petra Cotes' invention. But as he began to get very tired over time, he had rubber stamps made with pictures of animals, the ticket numbers, and the name of the lottery on them. Now, his only task was to press the stamps, in various colors, onto the papers. In the last years of his life, he thought of putting puzzles on the tickets instead of numbering them. Thus, the gift could be shared among those who correctly solved the puzzle.",15.856,15.251,"The raffles never yielded much. At the beginning, Aureliano Segundo spent three days a week locked in his old rancher's office, drawing ticket by ticket, painting with a certain finesse a little red cow, a green piglet, or a group of blue hens, depending on the animal being raffled, and he modeled with a good imitation of printed letters the name that Petra Cotes thought was good to baptize the business: Divine Providence Raffles. But over time he felt so tired after drawing up to two thousand tickets a week that he had the animals, the name, and the numbers made into rubber stamps, and then the work was reduced to moistening them on pads of different colors.

727,"Aureliano Segundo was so busy trying to maintain the prestige of his raffles that he barely had time to see the children. Fernanda put Amaranta Úrsula in a small private school where they admitted only six girls, but she refused to allow Aureliano to go to public school. She considered that she had already relented too much in letting him leave the room. Besides, the schools in those days accepted only the legitimate offspring of Catholic marriages and on the birth certificate that had been pinned to Aureliano’s clothing when they brought him to the house he was registered as a foundling. So he remained shut In at the mercy of Santa Sofía de la Piedad’s loving eyes and Úrsula’s mental quirks, learning in the narrow world of the house whatever his grandmothers explained to him.

While Amaranta Úrsula was in kindergarten, he would hunt earthworms and torture insects in the garden. But once when Fernanda caught him putting scorpions in a box to put in Úrsula’s bed, she locked him up in Meme’s old room, where he spent his solitary hours looking through the pictures in the encyclopedia. Úrsula found him there one afternoon when she was going about sprinkling the house with distilled water and a bunch of nettles, and in spite of the fact that she had been with him many times she asked him who he was.","Aureliano Segundo was busy reinforcing trust in his lottery, so he no longer had time to care for the children. Fernanda enrolled Amaranta Úrsula in a small private school that accepted no more than six students, but she did not allow Aureliano to attend public school. Fernanda believed that letting Aureliano out of his room was already a significant concession. Moreover, at that time, schools only accepted children who were the legitimate offspring of Christian couples, and the birth certificate pinned to Aureliano's shirt when the servant brought him home clearly stated that he was an illegitimate child. So the boy only lived confined to his room. Due to the compassionate care of SantaSofía de la Piedad and the mental imbalance of Úrsula, Aureliano perceived the narrow world of this house through the explanations of these elderly women. Aureliano was a slender, proud, curious boy, a kind of curiosity that easily angered adults, but his eyes sparkled absentmindedly, unlike the fierce and often blazing eyes of the colonel at his age. While Amaranta was at nursery school, Aureliano would catch worms and torment insects in the garden. But one time, when Fernanda caught him stuffing scorpions into a box to place under Úrsula's mat, she immediately sent him back to Meme's old bedroom. There, to shorten the lonely hours, he repeatedly looked through the illustrated pages of the encyclopedia.

While Amaranta Úrsula was in kindergarten, he hunted worms and tortured insects in the garden. But once when Fernanda caught him putting scorpions in a box to place them on Úrsula's mat, she confined him in Meme's old bedroom, where he distracted himself during his solitary hours by reviewing the encyclopedia plates. There Úrsula found him one afternoon while she was sprinkling the house with serenaded water and a bunch of nettles, and despite having been with him many times, she asked him who he was.",51.802,51.63

730,"She had confused him with her son again, because the hot wind that came after the deluge and had brought occasional waves of lucidity to Úrsula’s brain had passed. She never got her reason back. When she went into the bedroom she found Petronila Iguarán there with the bothersome crinolines and the beaded jacket that she put on for formal visits, and she found Tranquilina Maria Miniata Alacoque Buendía, her grandmother, fanning herself with a peacock feather in her invalid’s rocking chair, and her great-grandfather Aureliano Arcadio Buendía, with his imitation dolman of the viceregal guard, and Aureliano Iguarán, her father, who had invented a prayer to make the worms shrivel up and drop off cows, and her timid mother, and her cousin with the pig’s tail, and José Arcadio Buendía, and her dead sons, all sitting in chairs lined up against the wall as if it were a wake and not a visit. She was tying a colorful string of chatter together, commenting on things from many separate places and many different times, so that when Amaranta Úrsula returned from school and Aureliano grew tired of the encyclopedia, they would find her sitting on her bed, talking to herself and lost in a labyrinth of dead people. “Fire!” she shouted once in terror and for an instant panic spread through the house, but what she was telling about was the burning of a barn that she had witnessed when she was four years old. She finally mixed up the past with the present in such a way that in the two or three waves of lucidity that she had before she died, no one knew for certain whether she was speaking about what she felt or what she remembered. Little by little she was shrinking, turning into a fetus, becoming mummified in life to the point that in her last months she was a cherry raisin lost inside of her nightgown, and the arm that she always kept raised looked like the paw of a marimonda monkey. She was motionless for several days, and Santa Sofía de la Piedad had to shake her to convince herself that she was alive and sat her on her lap to feed her a few spoonfuls of sugar water. She looked like a newborn old woman. Amaranta Úrsula and Aureliano would take her in and out of the bedroom, they would lay her on the altar to see if she was any larger than the Christ child, and one afternoon they hid her in a closet in the Pantry where the rats could have eaten her. One Palm Sunday they went into the bedroom while Fernanda was in church and carried Úrsula out by the neck and ankles.","Ursula confused her uncle with her son because the hot winds that followed the days of flooding rains, which once brought her sudden flashes of clarity, had ceased to blow. Her lucidity did not recover. When entering the bedroom, Ursula encountered Petronila Iguaran wearing a cumbersome flared dress and carrying a small bag, waiting for guests to arrive as per the invitation, met her grandmother Tranquilina Maria Miniata Alacoque Buendia sitting on a chair for the paralyzed and fanning herself with a peacock feather, met her grandfather Aureliano Arcadio Buendia in a coat mimicking the style of the viceroy's guards, met her father Aureliano Iguaran, who had devised a spell to kill harmful cattle pests, met her timid mother, met her cousin with a pig's tail, met Jose Arcadio Buendia with his deceased children, all sitting on chairs lined up against the wall, as if they were at a wake rather than a social visit. Ursula, hastily sewing a colorful garment, discussed events occurring in different places and times; thus, when Amaranta Ursula returned from school and Aureliano was weary from the encyclopedia, they found her sitting on the bed talking to herself, immersed in a labyrinth of the dead. ""Fire!"", Ursula once screamed terrifyingly, causing the whole household to panic, but she was referring to a fire at a horse ranch forty years ago. In this manner, Ursula confused the past with the present, and until her death, although two or three times she had flashes of clarity, no one could be sure whether she was speaking of what she was experiencing or what she was remembering. Each day, Ursula became more emaciated, more gaunt, more withered, to the point that a few months before her death, she was like a plum lost in a loose dress, and the arms that once lifted high now resembled those of a monkey. Ursula did not move for several days. Santa Sofia de la Piedad had to come to see if she was still alive and placed her on her lap to give her a few small spoonfuls of sugar water. At that moment, Ursula looked like an old woman who had just been born. Amaranta Ursula and Aureliano carried her from place to place in the bedroom and placed her on the altar to see if she was bigger than the infant Jesus, and one afternoon they hid her in a grain chest where the rats could eat her. One Sunday, while Fernanda was praying, Amaranta Ursula and Aureliano went into the bedroom, grabbed Ursula by the nape and ankles, and carried her away.",20.889,20.67,"She was confusing him with her own son again. Because the warm wind that blew after the flood and occasionally illuminated Ursula's mind had ceased. Ursula had now completely lost her consciousness. Whenever she entered the bedroom, she found Petronila Iguaran with her beaded jacket and hoop skirt that she wore when going out for a walk; her grandmother Tranquilina Marina Miniata Alacoque Buendia sitting in the rocking cripple chair, fanning herself with a peacock feather fan; her great-grandfather Aureliano Arcadio Buendia with his make-believe Dolaman robe from his sensitive officer days; her father Aureliano Iguaran, who had found a prayer that dried up wolves and made cows fall; her cousin with a pig's tail; Jose Arcadio Buendia and her deceased sons sitting on chairs lined up along the wall. All these relatives seemed to have come not to see her, but to keep vigil over a dead person. Ursula tried to bring up cheerful topics, talking to them by recounting events from very different times and various places. When Amaranta Ursula returned from school and Aureliano grew tired of the encyclopedia, they would find Ursula sitting on her bed, lost in the maze of the dead, talking to herself. Once, in a fit of terror, she screamed -Fire! and chaos ensued. However, Ursula was talking about a barn fire she had seen when she was four years old. She mixed up the past and the present so much that, in the few moments of clarity before her death, no one could tell if she was recounting what she had heard or what she remembered. Ursula was slowly withering away, becoming like a child. In her final months, she turned into a cherry pit lost in her nightgown. The arm she always kept in the air resembled a monkey's paw. She lay still for several days. Santa Sofia de la Piedad had to shake her to see if she was still alive, then sat her on her lap and poured a few spoonfuls of sugary water into her mouth. Ursula looked like an old woman who had just been born. Amaranta, Ursula, and Aureliano would carry her around in their arms, lay her on the altar to measure her height, wondering if she was bigger than the statue of the child Jesus. One day, they put her in a cupboard in the pantry. The poor woman was almost eaten by the rats. On the Sunday before Easter, while Fernanda was at church, the children entered Ursula's bedroom, grabbed her by the neck and ankles, and carried her outside.",22.311,22.099,"She mistook him for her son again, because the warm wind that followed the flood and infused Ursula's brain with occasional bursts of lucidity had just passed.

737,"Then Úrsula gave in to the evidence. “My God,” she exclaimed in a low voice. “So this is what it’s like to be dead.” She started an endless, stumbling, deep prayer that lasted more than two days, and that by Tuesday had degenerated into a hodgepodge of requests to God and bits of practical advice to stop the red ants from bringing the house down, to keep the lamp burning by Remedios’ daguerreotype, and never to let any Buendía marry a person of the same blood because their children would be born with the tail of a pig. Aureliano Segundo tried to take advantage of her delirium to get her to ten him where the gold was buried, but his entreaties were useless once more “When the owner appears,” Úrsula said, “God will illuminate him so that he will find it.” Santa Sofía de la Piedad had the certainty that they would find her dead from one moment to the next, because she noticed during those days a certain confusion in nature: the roses smelled like goosefoot, a pod of chick peas fell down and the beans lay on the ground in a perfect geometrical pattern in the shape of a starfish and one night she saw a row of luminous orange disks pass across the sky.","At that moment, Úrsula had to give in. ""Oh my God!"", Úrsula cried silently: ""So this is death"". Úrsula began to recite prayers incessantly, hurriedly and deeply, the prayers lasting for more than two days, and on the third day they turned into a mix of prayers to God and practical instructions so that the red ants wouldn't destroy the house, so that the lamp in front of Remedios's picture would never go out, so that everyone would ensure that no one in the Buendía family would marry someone of the same bloodline, because such marriages would produce children with pig tails. Aureliano Segundo tried to take advantage of Úrsula's delirious state to get her to reveal the location of the buried gold, but once again those pleas were in vain. ""When the owner of that gold appears,"" Úrsula said, ""the sky will light up so that person can see it."" Santa Sofía de la Piedad was convinced that Úrsula would die any day now, because during those days she had seen ominous signs from the heavens: roses smelled like saltwort, a squash containing green beans fell on her head and the beans on the floor formed a perfect geometric pattern in the shape of a starfish, and one night she saw a row of bright orange disks flying across the sky.",20.863,20.459,"In the face of so much evidence, Ursula gave up resisting.

She got carried away and by Tuesday, the prayer was no longer a prayer. From time to time, she murmured her requests to God, sometimes offering practical solutions to prevent the red ants from destroying the house, asking not to extinguish the lamp illuminating Remedios' picture, babbling that the Buendias should not marry those of the same blood, otherwise their children would have pig tails. Aureliano Segundo took advantage of Ursula's babblings to learn the location of the gold, but once again came up empty-handed. Ursula said, ""When the rightful owner of the gold appears, God will reveal the location of the treasure to him.""

739,"At first they thought it was a plague. Housewives were exhausted from sweeping away so many dead birds, especially at siesta time, and the men dumped them into the river by the cartload. On Easter Sunday the hundred-year-old Father Antonio Isabel stated from the pulpit that the death of the birds was due to the evil influence of the Wandering Jew, whom he himself had seen the night before. He described him as a cross between a billy goat and a female heretic, an infernal beast whose breath scorched the air and whose look brought on the birth of monsters in newlywed women. There were not many who paid attention to his apocalyptic talk, for the town was convinced that the priest was rambling because of his age. But one woman woke everybody up at dawn on Wednesday because she found the tracks of a biped with a cloven hoof. They were so clear and unmistakable that those who went to look at them had no doubt about the existence of a fearsome creature similar to the one described by the parish priest and they got together to set traps in their courtyards. That was how they managed to capture it. Two weeks after Úrsula’s death, Petra Cotes and Aureliano Segundo woke up frightened by the especially loud bellowing of a calf that was coming from nearby. When they got there a group of men were already pulling the monster off the sharpened stakes they had set in the bottom of a pit covered with dry leaves, and it stopped lowing. It was as heavy as an ox in spite of the fact that it was no taller than a young steer, and a green and greasy liquid flowed from its wounds. Its body was covered with rough hair, plagued with small ticks, and the skin was hardened with the scales of a remora fish, but unlike the priest’s description, its human parts were more like those of a sickly angel than of a man, for its hands were tense and agile, its eyes large and gloomy, and on its shoulder blades it had the scarred-over and calloused stumps of powerful wings which must have been chopped off by a woodsman’s ax. They hung it to an almond tree in the square by its ankles so that everyone could see it, and when it began to rot they burned it in a bonfire, for they could not determine whether its bastard nature was that of an animal to be thrown into the river or a human being to be buried. It was never established whether it had really caused the death of the birds, but the newly married women did not bear the predicted monsters, nor did the intensity of the heat decrease.","At first, people believed it was a plague. Housewives were exhausted from sweeping up bird corpses, especially at noon, while the men carted those bird corpses away and dumped them into the river. On Easter Sunday, from the pulpit, the hundred-year-old Father Antonio Isaben asserted that the birds had died due to the evil influence of the demon Giudio Erante, whom he had seen the night before. The father described it as a hybrid between a male goat and a heretical woman, a demon whose breath scorched the air, and wherever it went, newlywed women would lose their ability to conceive. Few paid attention to the father's apocalyptic sermon, believing that his old age had made him speak nonsense. But early Wednesday morning, a woman woke everyone up, claiming she had seen the tracks of a two-legged hoofed creature. The tracks were so clear and unmistakable that those who came to see them had no doubt about the existence of a fearsome creature exactly as the father had described, and they set traps in their gardens. And then they caught it. Two weeks after Ursula's death, Petra Cotes and Aureliano Segundo were startled awake by the sound of a calf crying nearby. When they woke up, they saw a group of people removing the monster from the sharp stakes planted at the bottom of a pit covered with dry leaves on top. The creature could no longer make any sound. Although it was not taller than a child, it was as heavy as a cow, and from its wounds, a slimy green blood oozed out. Its body was covered with a thick layer of coarse fur, its skin hardened by a layer of compressed fish scales; but unlike the priest's description, the parts of its body resembled those of a frail god more than a human, for its hands were smooth and dexterous, its eyes wide open and hazy, and on its shoulders were calloused scars, the remnants of a pair of strong wings that had been chopped off with an axe. They tied its legs to an almond tree in the open field so everyone could see it, and when it began to rot, they burned it on a pyre because they couldn't determine whether its nature was that of an animal or a Christian, to decide the appropriate way to handle it: throw its body into the river or bury it. It was never certain whether it was truly responsible for killing those birds, but the number of newlywed women who did not conceive increased, and the heat did not subside.",30.559,30.396,"At first, everyone thought there was an epidemic. Housewives, especially during nap times, got tired of sweeping up dead birds and collecting them in dustpans, and men got tired of loading the dead birds into wheelbarrows and dumping them into the river. On Easter day, while giving a sermon, the hundred-year-old Father Antonio Isabel said that the death of the birds was caused by the evil spirit of the Wandering Jew, and that he had seen the Wandering Jew the night before. He described the rogue Jew as a creature between a heretic woman and a goat, resembling a hellish beast that burns the air with its breath, and causing new brides to give birth to monsters with his gaze. All the townspeople did not take his words seriously because they believed the priest had become senile and was talking nonsense. However, at dawn on Wednesday, a woman raised the town to its feet with her screams. She claimed to have seen the footprints of a cloven-hoofed and bipedal creature. The tracks were so distinct that those who saw them believed in the existence of the terrifying creature described by the priest and began working together to set traps in their gardens. And that’s how they caught it. Two weeks after Ursula's death, Petra Cotes and Aureliano Segundo were startled awake by the bellowing of a cow coming from nearby. When they went to the source of the sound, they found a few people prodding the trapped creature, which was covered with dry leaves, out with sharp sticks. The monster, though as big as a young bull, was as heavy as an ox. A greasy, green liquid was oozing from its wounds. Its body was covered with coarse hair and clusters of ticks here and there. Its skin had thickened with an armor resembling fish scales. Contrary to what the priest said, his body parts that resembled a human were more akin to a delicate angel than a man. His hands were trembling and small. His eyes were large and sorrowful. He had strong wing bases at his shoulders, which had fallen victim to a woodcutter's axe. To make sure everyone could see, they tied the monster by its ankles and hung it from one of the almond trees in the field: When it started to decay, unable to decide whether to throw it into the river like an animal carcass or bury it in the ground like a human corpse, they set a huge bundle of brushwood on fire and burned the monster.

They hung it by the ankles from an almond tree in the square so no one would miss seeing it, and when it began to rot, they incinerated it in a bonfire, as it could not be determined whether its bastard nature was that of an animal to be thrown in the river or a Christian to be buried.

741,"That was how everything went after the deluge. The indolence of the people was in contrast to the voracity of oblivion, which little by little was undermining memories in a pitiless way, to such an extreme that at that time, on another anniversary of the Treaty of Neerlandia, some emissaries from the president of the republic arrived in Macondo to award at last the decoration rejected several times by Colonel Aureliano Buendía, and they spent a whole afternoon looking for someone who could tell them where they could find one of his descendants. Aureliano Segundo was tempted to accept it, thinking that it was a medal of solid gold, but Petra Cotes convinced him that it was not proper when the emissaries already had some proclamations and speeches ready for the ceremony. It was also around that time that the gypsies returned, the last heirs to Melquíades’ science, and they found the town so defeated and its inhabitants so removed from the rest of the world that once more they went through the houses dragging magnetized ingots as if that really were the Babylonian wise men’s latest discovery, and once again they concentrated the sun’s rays with the giant magnifying glass, and there was no lack of people standing open-mouthed watching kettles fall and pots roll and who paid fifty cents to be startled as a gypsy woman put in her false teeth and took them out again. A broken-down yellow train that neither brought anyone in nor took anyone out and that scarcely paused at the deserted station was the only thing that was left of the long train to which Mr. Brown would couple his glass-topped coach with the episcopal lounging chairs and of the fruit trains with one hundred twenty cars which took a whole afternoon to pass by. The ecclesiastical delegates who had come to investigate the report of the strange death of the birds and the sacrifice of the Wandering Jew found Father Antonio Isabel playing blind man’s buff with the children, and thinking that his report was the product of a hallucination, they took him off to an asylum. A short time later they sent Father Augusto Angel, a crusader of the new breed, intransigent, audacious, daring, who personally rang the bells several times a day so that the peoples spirits would not get drowsy, and who went from house to house waking up the sleepers to go to mass but before a year was out he too was conquered by the negligence that one breathed in with the air, by the hot dust that made everything old and clogged up, and by the drowsiness caused by lunchtime meatballs in the unbearable heat of siesta time.","All the bankruptcies have occurred like that since the rain returned. The laziness of everyone was evidenced by the merciless erosion of memories, to the highest degree during that time, on the occasion of the anniversary of the signing of the Neclandia agreement, when representatives of the President of the Republic came to Macondo to present the medal that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had repeatedly refused. They had to spend an entire afternoon looking for someone who could tell them where to find a descendant of the colonel. Aureliano Segundo eagerly accepted the medal, believing it to be made of gold, but while the President's representatives were preparing the orchestra and speeches for the ceremony, Petra Cotes convinced him that doing so was disgraceful. Around the same time, the gypsies returned, the last inheritors of Melquiades' science. They found the village too desolate and the villagers too isolated from the outside world, so they went house to house dragging magnetized iron bars, as if these bars were the latest discovery of the wise men of Babylon. They used giant magnifying glasses to focus sunlight; and there were people who gaped at the overturned pots and pans rolling around, and many who paid fifty cents to marvel at a gypsy girl removing and replacing her false teeth. A rickety yellow train that neither brought anyone nor took anyone away and hardly stopped at a deserted station was the only remaining image of a crowded train - where Mr. Brown kept a carriage with a glass roof and armchairs like those of a Cardinal - and of the fruit trains with one hundred and twenty cars that slowly passed through every afternoon. Representatives of the court, investigating the strange deaths of birds and the death of the demon Giulio Erante, found Father Antonio Isabel playing blind man's bluff with the children. They believed his report was a product of senile delusion and sent him to a nursing home. Not long after, Father Augusto Angel was sent. He was a newly trained crusader, determined, brave, and daring. Every day, he rang the bell several times himself to keep his spirit from stagnating, going from house to house to wake up those who slept too much for mass; but within a year, he too succumbed to the impurities in the air, the hot dust that aged him prematurely and made walking difficult, and the meatball lunches in the unbearable heat that caused him to suffer from drowsiness.",19.269,19.037,"So this is how things went after the flood. As forgetfulness weighed heavily with a speed completely opposite to the sluggishness of people, memories were being forgotten. In the end, forgetfulness reached such an extreme point that on the umpteenth anniversary of the Neerlandia Agreement, the representatives of the President, who came to give the medal that Colonel Aureliano Buendia had refused countless times, knocked on every door to find a descendant of the colonel. Although Aureliano Segundo, thinking the medal was pure gold, was eager to take it immediately, Petra Cotes convinced him that it would not be appropriate to jump at the medal as the envoys wanted to hold a ceremony and had prepared declarations and speeches. Around that time, the gypsies, the last heirs of Melquiades' science, came back again. Seeing the town so dilapidated and the townspeople so disconnected from the world, just like during their first visit, they went door to door showing magnetic ingots, claiming them to be the latest discovery of the Babylonian sages. They reflected the sun's rays onto a single point with large magnifying glasses. And once again, the crowd that gathered around, watching with open mouths as the teapots somersaulted and the dishes leaped, and pressing fifty cents to look in astonishment at the false teeth a gypsy woman put in and took out of her mouth, was not missing this time either. All that was left of the train to which Mister Brown had attached his private carriage, filled with throne-like chairs and a glass ceiling, and the one hundred and twenty-car banana train that took an entire afternoon to pass, was a shabby yellow train. This train no longer brought anyone to Macondo, nor did it take anyone away from Macondo. It stopped at the deserted station once in forty years. The religious authorities who came to investigate the mysterious death of the birds and the report on the sacrifice of the Wandering Jew found Father Antonio Isabel playing blind man's buff with the children and, concluding that the report he had written was fabricated, took him to the asylum. Very soon, they sent Father Augusto Angel in his place. Father Augusto Angel was a young, dynamic, and proactive man. To keep the townspeople's spirits from becoming dull, he rang the bells himself several times a day and went door to door to call the people to church. However, in less than a year, the priest too succumbed to the indifference that came with the air, the scorching dust that wore everything down, and the lethargy brought on by the unbearable heat during siesta hours and the meatballs eaten during that time.",17.201,16.946,"Everything had been this way since the flood. The apathy of the people contrasted with the voracity of oblivion, which little by little was mercilessly gnawing away at memories, to the extent that during those times, on a new anniversary of the Neerlandia treaty, some emissaries from the president of the republic arrived in Macondo to finally deliver the decoration several times rejected by Colonel Aureliano Buendía, and they spent an entire afternoon looking for someone who could tell them where to find any of his descendants. Aureliano Segundo was tempted to accept it, believing it to be a solid gold medal, but Petra Cotes persuaded him of the indignity when the emissaries were already preparing proclamations and speeches for the ceremony. Around that time, the gypsies returned, the last heirs of Melquíades' science, and they found the town so run-down and its inhabitants so isolated from the rest of the world that they went back into the houses dragging magnetized iron bars as if they were truly the latest discovery of Babylonian sages, and they once again concentrated the sun's rays with the giant magnifying glass, and there were those who stood with their mouths agape watching pots fall and kettles roll, and those who paid fifty cents to be amazed by a gypsy woman who took out and put in her false teeth. A dilapidated yellow train that neither brought nor took anyone, and that barely stopped at the deserted station, was all that remained of the crowded train on which Mr. Brown hooked his car with a glass roof and bishop's armchairs, and of the fruit trains with one hundred and twenty cars that took an entire afternoon to pass by. The curial delegates who had gone to investigate the report on the strange bird mortality and the sacrifice of the Wandering Jew found Father Antonio Isabel playing blind man's bluff with the children, and believing that his report was the product of a senile hallucination, they took him to an asylum. Shortly after, they sent Father Augusto Ángel, a crusader of the new batches, intransigent, bold, fearless, who personally rang the bells several times a day so that spirits would not become lethargic, and who went from house to house waking up the sleepyheads to go to mass, but before a year had passed, he too was defeated by the negligence that permeated the air, by the burning dust that aged and clogged everything, and by the drowsiness caused by the meatballs at lunch in the unbearable heat of the siesta.",44.886,44.766
742,"With Úrsula’s death the house again fell into a neglect from which it could not be rescued even by a will as resolute and vigorous as that of Amaranta Úrsula, who many years later, being a happy, modern woman without prejudices, with her feet on the ground, opened doors and windows in order to drive away the rain, restored the garden, exterminated the red ants who were already walking across the porch in broad daylight, and tried in vain to reawaken the forgotten spirit of hospitality. Fernanda’s cloistered passion built in impenetrable dike against Úrsula’s torrential hundred years. Not only did she refuse to open doors when the arid wind passed through, but she had the windows nailed shut with boards in the shape of a cross, obeying the paternal order of being buried alive. The expensive correspondence with the invisible doctors ended in failure. After numerous postponements, she shut herself up in her room on the date and hour agreed upon, covered only by a white sheet and with her head pointed north, and at one o’clock in the morning she felt that they were covering her head with a handkerchief soaked in a glacial liquid. When she woke up the sun was shining in the window and she had a barbarous stitch in the shape of an arc that began at her crotch and ended at her sternum. But before she could complete the prescribed rest she received a disturbed letter from the invisible doctors, who mid they had inspected her for six hours without finding anything that corresponded to the symptoms so many times and so scrupulously described by her. Actually, her pernicious habit of not calling things by their names had brought about a new confusion, for the only thing that the telepathic surgeons had found was a drop in the uterus which could be corrected by the use of a pessary. The disillusioned Fernanda tried to obtain more precise information, but the unknown correspondents did not answer her letters any more. She felt so defeated by the weight of an unknown word that she decided to put shame behind her and ask what a pessary was, and only then did she discover that the French doctor had hanged himself to a beam three months earlier and had been buried against the wishes of the townspeople by a former companion in arms of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Then she confided in her son José Arcadio and the latter sent her the pessaries from Rome along with a pamphlet explaining their use, which she flushed down the toilet after committing it to memory so that no one would learn the nature of her troubles. It was a useless precaution because the only people who lived in the house scarcely paid any attention to her. Santa Sofía de la Piedad was wandering about in her solitary old age, cooking the little that they ate and almost completely dedicated to the care of José Arcadio Segundo. Amaranta Úrsula, who had inherited certain attractions of Remedios the Beauty, spent the time that she had formerly wasted tormenting Úrsula at her schoolwork, and she began to show good judgment and a dedication to study that brought back to Aureliano Segundo the high hopes that Meme had inspired in him. He had promised her to send her to finish her studies in Brussels, in accord with a custom established during the time of the banana company, and that illusion had brought him to attempt to revive the lands devastated by the deluge. The few times that he appeared at the house were for Amaranta Úrsula, because with time he had become a stranger to Fernanda and little Aureliano was becoming withdrawn as he approached puberty. Aureliano Segundo had faith that Fernanda’s heart would soften with old age so that the child could join in the life of the town where no one certainly would make any effort to speculate suspiciously about his origins. But Aureliano himself seemed to prefer the cloister of solitude and he did not show the least desire to know the world that began at the street door of the house. When Úrsula had the door of Melquíades’ room opened he began to linger about it, peeping through the half-opened door, and no one knew at what moment he became close to José Arcadio Segundo in a link of mutual affection. Aureliano Segundo discovered that friendship a long time after it had begun, when he heard the child talking about the killing at the station. It happened once when someone at the table complained about the ruin into which the town had sunk when the banana company had abandoned it, and Aureliano contradicted him with maturity and with the vision of a grown person. His point of view, contrary to the general interpretation, was that Macondo had been a prosperous place and well on its way until it was disordered and corrupted and suppressed by the banana company, whose engineers brought on the deluge as a pretext to avoid promises made to the workers. Speaking with such good sense that to Fernanda he was like a sacrilegious parody of Jews among the wise men, the child described with precise and convincing details how the army had machine-gunned more than three thousand workers penned up by the station and how they loaded the bodies onto a two-hundred-car train and threw them into the sea. Convinced as most people were by the official version that nothing had happened, Fernanda was scandalized with the idea that the child had inherited the anarchist ideas of Colonel Aureliano Buendía and told him to be quiet. Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, recognized his twin brother’s version. Actually, in spite of the fact that everyone considered him mad, José Arcadio Segundo was at that time the most lucid inhabitant of the house. He taught little Aureliano how to read and write, initiated him in the study of the parchments, and he inculcated him with such a personal interpretation of what the banana company had meant to Macondo that many years later, when Aureliano became part of the world, one would have thought that he was telling a hallucinated version, because it was radically opposed to the false one that historians had created and consecrated in the schoolbooks. In the small isolated room where the arid air never penetrated, nor the dust, nor the heat, both had the atavistic vision of an old man, his back to the window, wearing a hat with a brim like the wings of a crow who spoke about the world many years before they had been born. Both described at the same time how it was always March there and always Monday, and then they understood that José Arcadio Buendía was not as crazy as the family said, but that he was the only one who had enough lucidity to sense the truth of the fact that time also stumbled and had accidents and could therefore splinter and leave an eternalized fragment in a room. José Arcadio Segundo had managed, furthermore, to classify the cryptic letters of the parchments. He was certain that they corresponded to an alphabet of forty-seven to fifty-three characters, which when separated looked like scratching and scribbling, and which in the fine hand of Melquíades looked like pieces of clothing put out to dry on a line. Aureliano remembered having seen a similar table in the English encyclopedia, so he brought it to the room to compare it with that of José Arcadio Segundo. They were indeed the same.","Since Ucsula's death, the house fell into a state of neglect that nothing could remedy, not even the very persistent and strong will of Amaranta Ucsula, who many years later, being an open, cheerful, and fashionable woman, connected with the outside society, opened the doors to prevent the decline, renovated the garden, exterminated the red ants that dared to crawl out to the hallway in broad daylight, and tried to revive the forgotten spirit of hospitality. The monastic-colored passion of Phecnanđa had erected a solid dam against the hundred-year turbulent life of Ucsula, which surged like a waterfall. Not only did Phecnanđa not open the doors when the hot wind had passed, but she also bolted the windows with wooden bars, following the instructions of the holy father, thus burying herself in life. The costly correspondence with the unseen doctors failed. After many delays, at a suitable time, Phecnanđa locked herself in the bedroom, covered only with a white cloth, turned her head north, and at one o'clock in the morning, she felt someone place a cold wet cloth over her face. When Phecnanđa woke up, the sun was shining through the window, and there was a seam running from her groin to her sternum. But before carrying out the planned rest, Phecnanđa received a confusing letter from the unseen doctors, stating that they had examined her for six hours but found none of the symptoms she had meticulously described many times. Indeed, Phecnanđa's habit of not calling things by their names was harmful; it was the source of a new misunderstanding because the surgeons only found that she had a prolapsed uterus, which could be treated with a pessary. Phecnanđa wanted a specific announcement, but the unknown letter writers did not write to her again. Worried about a strange word, Phecnanđa overcame her shyness and boldly asked what a uterine pessary was, but by then she learned that three months earlier, the French doctor had hanged himself from a beam and was buried by an old comrade of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, against the villagers' wishes. Phecnanđa had to rely on her son, José Arcadio, who sent her pessaries from Rome along with instructions, which she memorized and hid to keep her illness a secret. Such caution was futile because the people living in the house seemed unconcerned about it. Santa Sofía de la Piedad lived in lonely old age, cooking for the whole house, and seemed to devote all her energy to caring for José Arcadio Segundo. Amaranta Ucsula, who inherited the charms of Remedios the Beauty, devoted all her time to studying, which she previously wasted teasing Ucsula, began to show good sense and effort in her studies, reviving the good hopes that Meme had aroused in Aureliano Segundo. Aureliano Segundo had promised to send her to Brussels to continue her studies, following the custom of the banana company era, and that dream made him strive to reclaim the land devastated by floods. At that time, Aureliano Segundo was rarely seen at home. He worked for Amaranta Ucsula, so to Phecnanđa, he had become a stranger. Meanwhile, Aureliano, as he reached puberty, became more reclusive and contemplative. Aureliano Segundo believed that old age would soften Phecnanđa's heart so that Aureliano could integrate into the life of a village where no one would bother to investigate his origins. But Aureliano preferred to live in solitude and showed no interest in getting to know the world outside the door. When Ucsula opened Melquíades' room, Aureliano hovered around, curiously looking at the half-closed door, and no one knew when the intimate relationship between him and José Arcadio Segundo began. Much later, when he heard Aureliano talk about the massacre at the train station, Aureliano Segundo discovered that relationship. One day at dinner, someone lamented the village's decline and immersion after being abandoned by the banana company, and Aureliano refuted that opinion with the maturity and speech of an adult. According to his view, contrary to the general understanding, before being devastated, degraded, and then oppressed by the banana company, Macondo was a prosperous and rising region, and it was the banana company's engineers who caused the flood to find an excuse to cancel the workers' contracts. When describing with precise and convincing details how the army shot over three thousand people trapped at the station and then used a two-hundred-car train to dump their bodies into the sea, Aureliano spoke so clearly that Phecnanđa felt as if he was irreverently imitating Jesus when he spoke to his apostles. Like most others who believed in the official version that such an event did not happen, Phecnanđa became furious and forced Aureliano to stop speaking, thinking that he had inherited the anarchic vices of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. In contrast, Aureliano Segundo accepted the opinion of his twin brother José Arcadio Segundo. In fact, despite being considered insane, José Arcadio Segundo was the brightest in the house. José Arcadio Segundo taught young Aureliano to read and write, guided him to start studying the records on the parchment, and deeply instilled in him his unique interpretations of the banana company's significance to Macondo, which many years later, when integrated into communal life, Aureliano still thought José Arcadio Segundo had told legendary tales because they differed entirely from the deceptive explanations accepted by historians and included in school lessons. In the small room, where there was never dry wind, red dust, and heat, Aureliano and José Arcadio Segundo recalled the hereditary image of an old man wearing a crow's wing hat talking about the world behind the door many years before they were born. Both realized that it was always March and always Monday there, and at that moment, they understood that great-grandfather José Arcadio Buendía was not as insane as the family had recounted, but was the only one in the family, with a fairly clear mind, who vaguely saw a truth that time could stumble and have accidents, thus it could shatter itself, leaving a piece eternally preserved in the room. Moreover, José Arcadio Segundo also classified the codes written on the parchment. José Arcadio Segundo asserted that those codes belonged to a script with forty-seven to fifty-two characters, which, when separated, looked like spiders and insects, and with Melquíades' meticulous writing, they resembled clothes hanging on a line. Aureliano recalled seeing such a script in the British encyclopedia, so he brought his chart to the room to compare it with José Arcadio Segundo's chart. The two charts were identical.",20.227,20.146,"With Ursula's death, the house once again fell into disrepair. It turned into a ruin that not even someone as lively and determined as Amaranta Ursula could save. Years later, when Amaranta Ursula grew up to be a grounded, unprejudiced, happy, and modern woman, she opened the doors and windows to clean up this wreckage, rearranged the garden, eradicated the red ants that had begun to roam the veranda in broad daylight, and vainly tried to revive the long-forgotten atmosphere of hospitality. Fernanda's passion, buried deep in her heart as if she were locked away in a monastery, became an insurmountable obstacle against Ursula's flowing century. After the dry and angry wind had passed, Fernanda not only kept the doors shut but also closed the windows, following the ritual of being buried alive, and nailed them shut with crosswise boards. Correspondence with the invisible doctors yielded no results. After the surgery date was postponed for the umpteenth time, he withdrew to his room at the agreed-upon day and time. He covered himself with only a white sheet and lay down with his head turned north. Around one in the morning, he felt a cloth soaked in icy liquid being placed on his head. When he woke up, the sun was shining, and there was a rough stitch in the shape of an arc extending from between his legs to his breastbone. However, before completing the predetermined bed rest period, he received a concerned letter from the invisible doctors. The doctors wrote that despite examining him for six long hours, they could not see any of the symptoms of the illness he persistently mentioned. Fernanda's habit of not being able to describe events accurately had created this confusion. Doctors who operated through telepathy found nothing in Fernanda except a minor uterine prolapse that could be resolved with a pessary placed on the cervix. Although Fernanda, who did not find what she hoped for, wanted to obtain more detailed and precise information, the doctors no longer responded to her letters. Fernanda began to writhe under the weight of a word she did not know. In the end, she couldn't bear it anymore, put aside her embarrassment, and decided to ask what a pessary meant. It was only then that Fernanda learned that the French doctor had hanged himself with the rope he had dangled from the ceiling three months earlier and that, despite the townspeople's opposition, he had been buried by one of Colonel Aureliano Buendia's comrades. She then confided her problem to her son, Jose Arcadio. He sent his mother the rubber rings called pessaries and the instructions on how to use them from Rome. After Fernanda memorized how to use the rings, she threw the paper into the toilet because she didn't want anyone in the house to know what her problem was. In fact, such a precaution was unnecessary; the household was already not interested in her. Santa Sofia de la Piedad, despite her old age, was bustling around, cooking a few bites of food, and dedicating herself entirely to the care of Jose Arcadio Segundo. Amaranta Ursula, who had a charm somewhat reminiscent of Beautiful Remedios, devoted the time she used to spend tormenting Ursula to her studies. His mind was working well. He had developed a keen interest in learning. This attitude of his rekindled the great hopes that Aureliano Segundo once had for Meme. Following a custom that became fashionable and established during the Muz Company period, he promised to send his daughter to Brussels to complete her education. This dream led him to revive the lands devastated by floods. Aureliano Segundo's rare visits home, once every forty years, were solely to see Amaranta Ursula. Because over time, he had become completely estranged from Fernanda. Meanwhile, young Aureliano became more introverted as he reached adolescence. Aureliano Segundo hoped that as Fernanda aged, she would soften and not object to the child integrating into the town's life. None of the townspeople would bother to investigate the child's true identity anyway. However, it seemed that Aureliano also preferred solitude, showing no curiosity or interest in the world that began at the front door of the house. After Ursula had the room of Melquiades opened, Aureliano began to wander around the room. He was peeking inside through the slightly open door. Nobody understood when the mutual closeness between Jose Arcadio Segundo and them began. Aureliano Segundo only learned about their friendship much later, when the child spoke of the massacre at the station. One day at the dinner table, when someone complained that the town had not recovered since the Banana Company left, the child mentioned the massacre at the station and opposed with the mature views of an adult. Contrary to the general opinion, Aureliano argued that Macondo was a prosperous and abundant place before the Banana Company came, corrupted the town, disrupted its order, and imposed its dominance. He also claimed that the engineers of the company caused the flood to avoid fulfilling the promises made to the workers. He spoke so logically and beautifully that Fernanda, hearing him speak like that in the presence of intelligent people, compared him to false prophets trying to disrespect religion. The child described in detail how the soldiers mowed down more than three thousand workers trapped in front of the station with machine guns, and how they loaded the corpses onto a two hundred-car train and dumped them into the sea. Like most people who believed the official statements and thought nothing had happened, Fernanda, upon hearing this, told the child to be quiet, fearing that he had adopted Colonel Aureliano Buendia's anarchist views. However, Aureliano Segundo recognized his brother's views in the child's account. Despite everyone thinking he was crazy at the time, Jose Arcadio Segundo was actually the most sensible person in the house. He taught young Aureliano to read and write, then started having him decipher the manuscripts. At the same time, he explained what the Banana Company meant for Macondo and what the company did, according to his personal interpretations. When Aureliano, who grew up learning these things, joined the world years later, no one believed what he said. Because what he recounted was completely contrary to the fabrications that historians concocted and wrote in textbooks. In the room where the dry heat, dust, and wind did not enter, both Jose Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano reached the insights of an old man whose characteristics had been passed down through generations, an old man sitting by the window with a crow-wing hat. That man had determined his worldview long before they were born. The uncle and the nephew would arrive at the same conclusions at the same time, always realizing simultaneously what it meant for it to always be March and always be Monday. Then, they realized that, as it was said at home, Jose Arcadio Buendia was not crazy, and that time could occasionally stumble and sprain its ankle, leaving a slice of itself in a room that would remain forever unchanged as it got back up. Only Jose Arcadio Buendia had comprehended this truth. Jose Arcadio Segundo had also deciphered the letters of the manuscripts that resembled a code. He had deduced that this writing had an alphabet of forty-seven or fifty-three letters. When the letters were written individually, they looked like scribbles. Especially with Melquiades' fine handwriting, they resembled clothes hanging on a line. Aureliano remembered seeing pictures of similar letters in an English encyclopedia and brought it to the room to compare it with the code that Jose Arcadio Segundo had deciphered. Indeed, the two alphabets matched.",15.897,15.798,"Upon Úrsula's death, the house fell back into a state of neglect from which not even a will as resolute and vigorous as that of Amaranta Úrsula could rescue it. Many years later, as a woman without prejudices, cheerful and modern, with her feet firmly planted in the world, she opened doors and windows. To ward off ruin, she restored the garden, exterminated the red ants that were already roaming the corridor in broad daylight, and tried in vain to revive the forgotten spirit of hospitality. Fernanda's cloistered passion erected an insurmountable barrier to Úrsula's torrential hundred years. Not only did she refuse to open the doors when the arid wind passed by, but she also had the windows sealed with wooden crosses, obeying her father's command to bury herself alive. The costly correspondence with the invisible doctors ended in failure. After numerous postponements, she locked herself in her bedroom on the agreed date and time, covered only by a white sheet and with her head facing north. At one in the morning, she felt a cloth soaked in a glacial liquid cover her face. When she woke up, the sun was shining through the window, and she had a barbaric seam in the shape of an arc that started at her groin and ended at her sternum. But before she could complete the prescribed rest, she received a bewildered letter from the invisible doctors, who said they had examined her for six hours without finding anything corresponding to the symptoms she had so often and scrupulously described.

She felt so overwhelmed by the weight of an unknown word that she decided to stifle her shame and ask what a pessary was. Only then did she learn that the French doctor had hanged himself from a beam three months earlier and had been buried against the will of the people by an old comrade-in-arms of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Then she confided in her son José Arcadio, and he sent her the pessaries from Rome, along with a small explanatory booklet that she threw into the toilet after memorizing it, so that no one would know the nature of her ailments. It was a useless precaution because the only people living in the house barely paid attention to her. Santa Sofía de la Piedad wandered in solitary old age, cooking the little they ate, and almost entirely dedicated to the care of José Arcadio Segundo. Amaranta Úrsula, inheriting some of the charms of Remedios the Beauty, spent her time doing her schoolwork, which she previously wasted tormenting Úrsula, and began to show good judgment and dedication to her studies, which rekindled in Aureliano Segundo the good hope that Meme had inspired in him. He had promised to send her to finish her studies in Brussels, according to a custom established during the banana company era, and that illusion led him to try to revive the lands devastated by the deluge. The few times he was seen at the house then, it was for Amaranta Úrsula, as over time he had become a stranger to Fernanda, and young Aureliano grew more elusive and introspective as he approached puberty. Aureliano Segundo hoped that old age would soften Fernanda's heart so that the boy could join the life of a town where surely no one would have bothered to make suspicious speculations about his origin. But Aureliano himself seemed to prefer confinement and solitude, showing no malice in wanting to know the world that began at the street door. When Úrsula opened Melquíades' room, he began to hover around it, peeking through the ajar door, and no one knew when he developed a reciprocal affection for José Arcadio Segundo. Aureliano Segundo discovered this friendship long after it had begun, when he heard the boy talking about the massacre at the station. It happened one day when someone lamented at the table about the ruin that befell the town when the banana company left, and Aureliano contradicted them with the maturity and expertise of an older person. His point of view, contrary to the general interpretation, was that Macondo had been a prosperous and well-directed place until the banana company disordered, corrupted, and exploited it, with its engineers provoking the deluge as an excuse to evade commitments with the workers. Speaking with such good judgment that Fernanda thought it a sacrilegious parody of Jesus among the doctors, the boy described with precise and convincing details how the army machine-gunned more than three thousand workers cornered at the station and loaded the corpses onto a two-hundred-car train to dump them into the sea. Convinced, like most people, of the official truth that nothing had happened, Fernanda was scandalized by the idea that the boy had inherited the anarchist instincts of Colonel Aureliano Buendía and ordered him to be silent. Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, recognized his twin brother's version. In reality, despite everyone thinking him crazy, José Arcadio Segundo was at that time the most lucid inhabitant of the house. He taught young Aureliano to read and write, introduced him to the study of the parchments, and instilled in him such a personal interpretation of what the banana company meant for Macondo that many years later, when Aureliano joined the world, it would be thought that he was telling a hallucinatory version because it was radically contrary to the false one that historians had accepted and enshrined in school textbooks. In the secluded little room, where the arid wind, dust, and heat never reached, both recalled the atavistic vision of an old man with a crow-wing hat who spoke about the world behind the window many years before they were born. Both discovered at the same time that it was always March and always Monday there, and then they understood that José Arcadio Buendía was not as crazy as the family said, but was the only one lucid enough to glimpse the truth that time also suffered setbacks and accidents, and could therefore splinter and leave an eternalized fraction in a room. José Arcadio Segundo had also managed to classify the cryptic letters of the parchments. He was sure they corresponded to an alphabet of forty-seven to fifty-three characters, which when separated looked like little spiders and ticks, and in Melquíades' exquisite handwriting, they looked like pieces of clothing hung out to dry on a wire. Aureliano remembered seeing a similar table in the English encyclopedia, so he brought it to the room to compare it with José Arcadio Segundo's. They were indeed identical.",48.164,48.126
743,"Around the time of the riddle lottery, Aureliano Segundo began waking up with a knot in his throat, as if he were repressing a desire to weep. Petra Cotes interpreted it as one more of so many upsets brought on by the bad situation, and every morning for over a year she would touch his palate with a dash of honey and give him some radish syrup. When the knot in his throat became so oppressive that it was difficult for him to breathe, Aureliano Segundo visited Pilar Ternera to see if she knew of some herb that would give him relief. The dauntless grandmother, who had reached a hundred years of age managing a small, clandestine brothel, did not trust therapeutic superstitions, so she turned the matter over to her cards. She saw the queen of diamonds with her throat wounded by the steel of the jack of spades, and she deduced that Fernanda was trying to get her husband back home by means of the discredited method of sticking pins into his picture but that she had brought on an internal tumor because of her clumsy knowledge of the black arts. Since Aureliano Segundo had no other pictures except those of his wedding and the copies were all in the family album, he kept searching all through the house when his wife was not looking, and finally, in the bottom of the dresser, he came across a half-dozen pessaries in their original boxes. Thinking that the small red rubber rings were objects of witchcraft he put them in his pocket so that Pilar Ternera could have a look at them. She could not determine their nature, but they looked so suspicious to her that in any case she burned them in a bonfire she built in the courtyard. In order to conjure away Fernanda’s alleged curse, she told Aureliano Segundo that he should soak a broody hen and bury her alive under the chestnut tree, and he did it with such good faith that when he finished hiding the turned-up earth with dried leaves he already felt that he was breathing better. For her part, Fernanda interpreted the disappearance as a reprisal by the invisible doctors and she sewed a pocket of casing to the inside of her camisole where she kept the new pessaries that her son sent her.","During the lottery period with riddles, Aureliano Segundo often woke up with a tight throat as if he were trying to hold back tears. Petra Cotes considered it one of the adversities brought about by bad circumstances, and for more than a year, she would apply a bit of honey to Aureliano Segundo's throat every morning and give him radish water to drink. When his throat swelled to the point of causing difficulty in breathing, Aureliano Segundo sought out Pilar Ternera to see if the old woman knew of any herbs that could cure it. The tough-minded grandmother, who had lived to be a hundred right in front of a secret brothel, did not believe in medicine but treated ailments by reading tarot cards. The old woman saw a golden horse wounded in the throat by the sword of the ""J"" and divined that Fernanda was trying to bring her husband back home with an ineffective spell by pinning his picture, but due to her ignorant understanding of the evil art, she caused her husband to develop internal boils. Since there were no other portraits except for the wedding photos, all of which were still in the family album, Aureliano Segundo continued to search the house whenever his wife wasn't looking, and finally, he found half a dozen uterine rings at the bottom of a clothes chest, still in their box. Believing those rings to be charms, Aureliano Segundo put one in his pocket and took it to Pilar Ternera. Pilar Ternera couldn't determine its nature, but full of suspicion, she told Aureliano Segundo to bring all half a dozen rings, and she burned them in a fire lit in the yard. To break Fernanda's spell, the old woman instructed Aureliano Segundo to wet a brooding hen and bury it under a chestnut tree; Aureliano Segundo followed her instructions with full faith, and immediately after covering the freshly dug spot with dry leaves, he felt relieved. Fernanda considered the disappearance of the uterine rings as the revenge of invisible doctors, so she sewed a small pocket inside her coat to hold the new rings her son sent her.",15.894,15.578,"Aureliano Segundo, during the time he was organizing the lottery puzzle, started waking up with a knot in his throat. It was as if he wanted to cry but couldn't. Petra Cotes attributed this discomfort to the nervous breakdown caused by bad days. For over a year, every morning she would smear honey on the roof of Aureliano Segundo's mouth with the tip of a spoon and make him drink radish juice. When the condition in his throat made it difficult for him to breathe, Aureliano Segundo ran to Pilar Ternera and asked if she knew of an old folk remedy to cure him. His audacious grandmother, who had reached the age of a hundred by secretly running a small brothel, didn't believe in folk remedies and turned to the cards. Seeing that the leg of the spade had injured the queen of hearts by the neck, she said that Fernanda had cast a spell to bring her husband back home, resorting to an outdated method like sticking needles into her husband's picture, but since she couldn't manage the spell, it had caused a tumor in his throat. Aureliano Segundo had no other pictures except those taken at the wedding, and they were in the family album. Aureliano Segundo, without his wife noticing, started searching the house and found half a dozen pesos at the bottom of one of the drawers, still in their original box. Thinking the small, red rubber rings were related to magic, Aureliano Segundo put them in his pocket to show Pilar Ternera. Pilar Ternera couldn't understand what the rings were, but since she didn't trust them at all, she decided there was something fishy about them and lit a fire in the garden to burn the rings. To break Fernanda's spell, she told Aureliano Segundo to wet a broody hen and bury it alive under the chestnut tree. Aureliano Segundo had so much faith in her words that he felt his breathing ease even before he could cover the mound where he buried the hen with more dry leaves. Fernanda, on the other hand, interpreted the disappearance of the rings as a retaliation by the invisible doctors and placed the new rings sent by her son in a hidden pocket she sewed into her blouse.",20.633,20.374,"At the time when he came up with the riddle lottery, Aureliano Segundo would wake up with a lump in his throat, as if he were holding back the urge to cry. Petra Cotes interpreted it as one of the many disorders caused by the bad situation, and every morning, for more than a year, she would touch his palate with a swab of honey and give him radish syrup. When the lump in his throat became so oppressive that it was hard for him to breathe, Aureliano Segundo visited Pilar Ternera to see if she knew of any herb that could help. The unyielding grandmother, who had reached a hundred years old while running a small clandestine brothel, did not trust therapeutic superstitions, but consulted the matter with the cards. She saw the horse of gold with its throat wounded by the steel of the jack of swords, and deduced that Fernanda was trying to get her husband to return home using the discredited method of sticking pins in his portrait, but had caused an internal tumor due to her clumsy knowledge of dark arts. Since Aureliano Segundo had no other portraits than those from the wedding, and the copies were all intact in the family album, he kept searching the house during his wife's inattentive moments, and finally found half a dozen pessaries in their original boxes at the bottom of the wardrobe. Believing that the small red rubber rings were objects of witchcraft, he put one in his pocket to show Pilar Ternera. She couldn't determine their nature, but found them so suspicious that she had the entire half dozen brought to her and burned them in a bonfire she lit in the yard. To counteract Fernanda's supposed curse, she instructed Aureliano Segundo to wet a brooding hen and bury it alive under the chestnut tree, and he did it with such good faith that when he finished covering the disturbed earth with dry leaves, he already felt he could breathe better. For her part, Fernanda interpreted the disappearance as a reprisal from the invisible doctors, and she sewed a drawstring pocket inside her camisole, where she kept the new pessaries her son sent her.",48.206,48.082
744,"Six months after he had buried the hen, Aureliano Segundo woke up at midnight with an attack of coughing and the feeling that he was being strangled within by the claws of a crab. It was then that he understood that for all of the magical pessaries that he destroyed and all the conjuring hens that he soaked, the single and sad piece of truth was that he was dying. He did not tell anyone. Tormented by the fear of dying without having sent Amaranta Úrsula to Brussels, he worked as he had never done, and instead of one he made three weekly raffles. From very early in the morning he could be seen going through the town, even in the most outlying and miserable sections, trying to sell tickets with an anxiety that could only be conceivable in a dying man. “Here’s Divine Providence,” he hawked. “Don’t let it get away, because it only comes every hundred years.” He made pitiful efforts to appear gay, pleasant, talkative, but it was enough to see his sweat and paleness to know that his heart was not in it. Sometimes he would go to vacant lots, where no one could see him, and sit down to rest from the claws that were tearing him apart inside. Even at midnight he would be in the red-light district trying to console with predictions of good luck the lonely women who were weeping beside their phonographs. “This number hasn’t come up in four months,” he told them, showing them the tickets. “Don’t let it get away, life is shorter than you think.” They finally lost respect for him, made fun of him, and in his last months they no longer called him Don Aureliano, as they had always done, but they called him Mr. Divine Providence right to his face. His voice was becoming filled with wrong notes. It was getting out of tune, and it finally diminished into the growl of a dog, but he still had the drive to see that there should be no diminishing of the hope people brought to Petra Cates’s courtyard. As he lost his voice, however, and realized that in a short time he would be unable to bear the pain, he began to understand that it was not through raffled pigs and goats that his daughter would get to Brussels, so he conceived the idea of organizing the fabulous raffle of the lands destroyed by the deluge, which could easily be restored by a person with the money to do so. It was such a spectacular undertaking that the mayor himself lent his aid by announcing it in a proclamation, and associations were formed to buy tickets at one hundred pesos apiece and they were sold out in less than a week. The night of the raffle the winners held a huge celebration, comparable only to those of the good days of the banana company, and Aureliano Segundo, for the last time, played the forgotten songs of Francisco the Man on the accordion, but he could no longer sing them.","Six months after burying the chicken, one night in the middle of the night, Aureliano Segundo woke up because of a cough and felt as if crab claws were tearing inside him. At that moment, Aureliano Segundo understood that even if he had a lot of rubber bands and soaked many brooding hens to break the spell, he still could not avoid the painful final truth that he was slowly dying. Aureliano Segundo did not tell this to anyone. Tormented by the worry that he might die before sending Amaranta Úrsula to study in Brussels, Aureliano Segundo worked harder than ever, and if he used to hold a lottery once a week, now he held three. Early in the morning, Aureliano Segundo could be seen going everywhere in the village, even to the most remote and impoverished neighborhoods, trying to sell lottery tickets with a fervor that could only be seen in a dying man: ""Here are the Almighty's sacred lottery tickets!"" Aureliano Segundo proclaimed, ""Don't miss out on a once-in-a-century chance. ""Aureliano Segundo tried with touching effort, pretending to be cheerful, enthusiastic, and open, but just by looking at his sweat and pale face, one could tell he could not achieve his wish. Sometimes Aureliano Segundo would turn into deserted fields, where no one could see him, and rest for a moment to alleviate the clawing pain inside. At midnight, Aureliano Segundo was still in the brothel, trying to comfort the lonely women sobbing beside the hand-cranked phonographs with speeches about luck: ""This number hasn't come up for four months! ""Aureliano Segundo said, holding out the lottery tickets: ""Don't let luck slip away, because life is shorter than you think! ""Aureliano Segundo was no longer respected, people mocked him, and in his final months, they no longer called him Mr. Aureliano but directly to his face as ""the Almighty. ""Aureliano Segundo's voice became more and more hoarse, and finally, after a howl like a dog's, he lost his voice entirely, but Aureliano Segundo still hoped that his hope would not be extinguished in the lottery held in Petra Cotes's yard. But because he lost his voice, Aureliano Segundo knew that soon he would not be able to endure the pain, and he realized that by holding lotteries with pigs and goats, his daughter could not go to Brussels, so he came up with the idea of holding a lottery with the prize being the land devastated by floods, which would be restored by the person who invested the most. It was such an attractive initiative that the mayor himself, along with a band, went to advertise it, and people joined together to buy the lottery tickets at a price of one hundred pesos each, so the tickets were sold out in less than a week. On the night of the lottery, the winners organized a grand celebration comparable to the best times of the banana company, and that night was the last time Aureliano Segundo performed the forgotten songs of old Francisco the Man on the accordion, as he could no longer sing.",21.173,20.991,"Six months after burying the chicken, Aureliano Segundo woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible coughing fit. It felt as if a crab had wrapped around his throat and was squeezing it. At that moment, despite all the magical rings he had burned and the chickens he had buried, he realized there was only one truth and that he was about to die. He didn't tell anyone anything. Fearing he would die before sending Amaranta Ursula to Brussels, he threw himself into an unprecedented amount of work and started holding the lottery three times a week instead of once. He would go out early in the morning, touring the whole town to sell tickets with the urgency and excitement befitting someone nearing death, reaching even the most remote neighborhoods. ""Divine Providence Lottery,"" he would shout. ""Don't miss the chance, such an opportunity comes only once in a hundred years."" She was trying to appear cheerful, to chatter, and to show delicacy. But it was enough to see the pallor of his face and the beads of sweat to understand that he wasn't doing these things wholeheartedly. Sometimes he would retreat to a secluded corner or collapse where he stood just to catch his breath, escaping the claws tearing at his insides. Even at midnight, he would wander around, go to the red-light district, and try to comfort the lonely women crying over gramophones by inviting them to try their luck. He would take out the tickets and say, -Look, this number hasn't won the lottery for four months. -Don't miss this chance; life isn't as long as you think. In the end, he lost his respectability. They started to mock him. Especially in his final months, they stopped calling him Don Aureliano as they used to and started calling him 'Mr. Divine Providence' to his face. Aureliano Segundo's voice became increasingly hoarse and off-key. In the end, it turned into a dog's growl. Nevertheless, it did not extinguish the hope brought by those gathered in Petra Cotes' garden. When he lost his voice and foresaw that the pain would soon become unbearable, he realized that the lottery of pigs and goats would not be enough to send his daughter to Brussels. Thereupon, thinking of putting his land, which someone with money could easily restore to its former state, into a lottery, he organized a legendary lottery. This was such a comprehensive initiative that even the mayor did not hesitate to help by announcing the lottery with an official proclamation. He formed associations to buy the tickets, each costing a hundred pesos, and within a week, the tickets were sold out. On the night the lottery was drawn, the winners organized a grand celebration. It was a fanfare comparable only to the festivities during the Banana Company era. And Aureliano Segundo played the long-forgotten songs of Francisco the Devil-Teaser on the accordion for the last time, but this time he couldn't sing the songs.",13.229,12.937,"Six months after the burial of the hen, Aureliano Segundo woke up at midnight with a fit of coughing, feeling as if he were being strangled from the inside with crab pincers. It was then that he understood that no matter how many magical pessaries he destroyed and how many conjured hens he soaked, the only sad truth was that he was dying. He didn't tell anyone. Tormented by the fear of dying without sending Amaranta Úrsula to Brussels, he worked like he had never done before, and instead of one, he held three weekly raffles. From very early on, he was seen going around the town, even in the most remote and miserable neighborhoods, trying to sell the little tickets with an anxiety that was only conceivable in a dying man. ""Here is the Divine Providence,"" he proclaimed. "" Don't let it go, it only comes once every hundred years. "" He made touching efforts to appear cheerful, friendly, talkative, but just seeing his sweat and pallor was enough to know that he couldn't bear it. Sometimes he would stray into vacant lots, where no one would see him, and sit for a moment to rest from the pincers tearing him apart inside. Even at midnight, he was in the tolerance neighborhood, trying to console the lonely women who sobbed next to the victrolas with sermons of good luck. "" This number hasn't come up in four months,"" he would tell them, showing them the little tickets. "" Don't let it go, life is shorter than you think. "" They ended up losing respect for him, mocking him, and in his last months, they no longer called him Don Aureliano, as they had always done, but instead called him to his face Don Divine Providence. His voice filled with false notes, it became unsteady and ended up fading into a dog's growl, but he still had the will to keep the excitement for the prizes in Petra Cotes' yard from waning. However, as he lost his voice and realized that soon he would no longer be able to bear the pain, he understood that it was not with raffled pigs and goats that his daughter would get to Brussels, so he conceived the idea of holding the fabulous raffle of the lands destroyed by the flood, which could well be restored by someone with capital. It was such a spectacular initiative that the mayor himself announced it with a proclamation, and societies were formed to buy tickets at a hundred pesos each, which sold out in less than a week. On the night of the raffle, the winners threw a lavish party, comparable only to the good times of the banana company, and Aureliano Segundo played the forgotten songs of Francisco the Man on the accordion for the last time, but he could no longer sing them.",44.961,44.862
745,"Two months later Amaranta Úrsula went to Brussels. Aureliano Segundo gave her not only the money from the special raffle, but also what he had managed to put aside over the previous months and what little he had received from the sale of the pianola, the clavichord, and other junk that had fallen into disrepair. According to his calculations, that sum would be enough for her studies, so that all that was lacking was the price of her fare back home. Fernanda was against the trip until the last moment, scandalized by the idea that Brussels was so close to Paris and its perdition, but she calmed down with the letter that Father Angel gave her addressed to a boardinghouse run by nuns for Catholic young ladies where Amaranta Úrsula promised to stay until her studies were completed. Furthermore, the parish priest arranged for her to travel under the care of a group of Franciscan nuns who were going to Toledo, where they hoped to find dependable people to accompany her to Belgium. While the urgent correspondence that made the coordination possible went forward, Aureliano Segundo, aided by Petra Cates, prepared Amaranta Úrsula’s baggage. The night on which they were packing one of Fernanda’s bridal trunks, the things were so well organized that the schoolgirl knew by heart which were the suits and cloth slippers she could wear crossing the Atlantic and the blue cloth coat with copper buttons and the cordovan shoes she would wear when she landed. She also knew how to walk so as not to fall into the water as she went up the gangplank, that at no time was she to leave the company of the nuns or leave her cabin except to eat, and that for no reason was she to answer the questions asked by people of any sex while they were at sea. She carried a small bottle with drops for seasickness and a notebook written by Father Angel in his own hand containing six prayers to be used against storms. Fernanda made her a canvas belt to keep her money in, and she would not have to take it off even to sleep. She tried to give her the chamberpot, washed out with lye and disinfected with alcohol, but Amaranta Úrsula refused it for fear that her schoolmates would make fun of her. A few months later, at the hour of his death, Aureliano Segundo would remember her as he had seen her for the last time as she tried unsuccessfully to lower the window of the second-class coach to hear Fernanda’s last piece of advice. She was wearing a pink silk dress with a corsage of artificial pansies pinned to her left shoulder, her cordovan shoes with buckles and low heels, and sateen stockings held up at the thighs with elastic garters. Her body was slim, her hair loose and long, and she had the lively eyes that Úrsula had had at her age and the way in which she said good-bye, without crying but without smiling either, revealed the same strength of character. Walking beside the coach as it picked up speed and holding Fernanda by the arm so that she would not stumble, Aureliano scarcely had time to wave at his daughter as she threw him a kiss with the tips of her fingers. The couple stood motionless under the scorching sun, looking at the train as it merged with the black strip of the horizon, linking arms for the first time since the day of their wedding.","Two months later, Amaranta Úrsula went to Brussels. Aureliano Segundo not only gave his daughter the money he had won in a special lottery but also his savings from the previous months and some money from selling the automatic piano, the small organ, and a few old items. According to Aureliano Segundo's calculations, that capital was enough for Amaranta Úrsula to study, so only the money for the return ticket was missing. Fernanda opposed the trip, irritated by the thought that Brussels was too close to the depraved city of Paris, but she finally felt at ease after reading a letter from Father Ángel to a boarding house for young Christians, run by devout women, where Amaranta Úrsula promised to stay until she finished her studies. Moreover, the priest arranged for Amaranta Úrsula to travel with a group of Franciscan nuns who were going to Toledo, where they hoped to find a trustworthy person to take her to Belgium. While the arrangements were hurriedly made to coordinate everything, Aureliano Segundo, with the help of Petra Cotes, took care of packing Amaranta Úrsula's belongings. On the evening they packed one of Fernanda's wedding trunks, everything was so meticulously prepared that the student Amaranta Úrsula could remember exactly where to find her formal dress and velvet slippers for crossing the Atlantic, and where to find the thick blue wool coat with brass buttons and the goatskin shoes for when she landed. Amaranta Úrsula also knew how to walk without falling into the water when boarding, never to leave the nuns or her cabin on the ship except to eat, and not to answer any questions from anyone, whether men or women, while at sea. She carried a bottle of seasickness medicine and a notebook with six prayers to ward off storms, written by Father Ángel himself. Fernanda sewed her a canvas belt to hold money and instructed her on its use, telling her to always keep it on, even when sleeping. Fernanda also intended to give her a small gold chamber pot that had been alkalized and sterilized with alcohol, but Amaranta Úrsula refused it, fearing her schoolmates would mock her. Several months later, shortly before his death, Aureliano Segundo remembered the last time he saw Amaranta Úrsula, trying to lower the dusty windowpane of a second-class carriage to hear Fernanda's final instructions, but she couldn't lower it. On the day she left, Amaranta Úrsula wore a pink silk dress with a small bunch of artificial flowers pinned to her left shoulder, low-heeled goatskin shoes with laces, and stockings with prominent rubber garters on her calves. Amaranta Úrsula had a slender figure, long flowing hair, and lively eyes like Úrsula's when she was her age. When saying goodbye, Amaranta Úrsula neither cried nor laughed, showing the same firmness as Úrsula's character. Walking beside the carriage as the train started moving, holding Fernanda's arm to avoid tripping, Aureliano Segundo could still raise a hand in farewell when his daughter put her finger to her lips to send him a goodbye kiss. Aureliano Segundo and his wife sat quietly under the scorching sun, watching the train until it was just a small dot on the horizon, and at that moment, for the first time since their wedding, they held each other's arms.",22.323,22.165,"Two months later, Amaranta Ursula went to Brussels. Aureliano Segundo not only gave her the money collected from the big lottery, but also added the money he had been able to set aside in previous months and the money he gathered by selling the piano, accordion, and a heap of old knick-knacks. According to his calculations, this money would be enough for his daughter's education. Only the fare for the return trip was missing. Fernanda, who went mad at the thought of Brussels being too close to Paris and Paris's scandals, opposed her daughter's departure until the last moment. But when Father Angel wrote a letter to a dormitory run by nuns and established for Catholic young girls, and when Amaranta Ursula promised to stay there until she completed her education, Fernanda calmed down. Moreover, the priest entrusted the girl to a group of Franciscan nuns going to Toledo and got their promise to find someone reliable going to Belgium and to hand over Amaranta Ursula to them. While the correspondence for organizing these matters continued, Aureliano Segundo, with the help of Petra Cotes, was preparing Amaranta Ursula's belongings. The night they placed the clothes in one of Fernanda's dowry chests, everything was so well determined that Amaranta Ursula already knew by heart that she would wear her suits, fabric slippers while crossing the Atlantic, and the blue coat with copper buttons and fine leather shoes when she disembarked from the ship. She had also memorized how she should walk to avoid falling into the sea when disembarking, that she would never leave the nuns' side, that she would not step out of her cabin except during meal times, and that she would not answer any questions from anyone on the ship, whether man or woman. Next to Amaranta Ursula, there was a medicine to be dropped into water to prevent seasickness, and a notebook containing six prayers written by Father Angel himself to be read in case of a storm. Fernanda sewed her a belt made of canvas to keep her money in and advised her not to take it off even while sleeping. Although she wanted to give her a chamber pot washed with lye water and disinfected with alcohol, Amaranta Ursula did not take it because she feared her classmates would make fun of her. A few months later, as Aureliano Segundo was taking his last breath, he would remember his daughter as he last saw her, struggling to lower the window of the second-class compartment to hear what advice her mother was giving again. Amaranta Ursula was wearing a silk dress of pink color. She had pinned a bunch of artificial violets to her left shoulder. On her feet were low-heeled leather shoes with large buckles, and she wore silk stockings held up by garters. She was very slender. She had left her long hair loose. Her lively eyes resembled Ursula's appearance at that age, and the fact that she neither cried nor smiled when leaving also proved that she was as strong as Ursula. While walking alongside the accelerating carriage and holding Fernanda's arm to prevent her from falling, Aureliano Segundo could only manage to wave back to his daughter who was blowing kisses with her hand. The husband and wife stood motionless under the scorching sun, watching the train until it became a black line on the horizon. For the first time since their wedding, they had linked arms.",20.426,20.24,"Two months later, Amaranta Úrsula went to Brussels. Aureliano Segundo gave her not only the money from the extraordinary raffle, but also what he had managed to save in the previous months, and the very little he obtained from selling the pianola, the clavichord, and other items that had fallen out of favor. According to his calculations, that fund was enough for her studies, so only the cost of the return ticket remained pending. Fernanda opposed the trip until the last moment, scandalized by the idea that Brussels was so close to the perdition of Paris, but she was reassured by a letter Father Ángel gave her for a boarding house for young Catholic women run by nuns, where Amaranta Úrsula promised to live until the end of her studies. Additionally, the parish priest arranged for her to travel under the care of a group of Franciscan nuns who were going to Toledo, where they hoped to find trustworthy people to send her to Belgium. While the hurried correspondence that made this coordination possible was underway, Aureliano Segundo, helped by Petra Cotes, took care of Amaranta Úrsula's luggage.

She also knew how she should walk to avoid falling into the water when boarding via the platform, that she should never separate from the nuns or leave the cabin except to eat, and that under no circumstances should she answer questions from strangers of any gender on the high seas. She carried a small bottle with drops for seasickness and a notebook written in Father Ángel's own hand, with six prayers to ward off the storm. Fernanda made her a canvas belt to keep the money, and showed her how to wear it tight to her body so she wouldn't have to take it off even to sleep. She tried to give her the gold chamber pot washed with lye and disinfected with alcohol, but Amaranta Úrsula rejected it for fear that her schoolmates would make fun of her.

At that same instant, in Fernanda’s bed, his twin brother came to the end of the prolonged and terrible martyrdom of the steel crabs that were eating his throat away. One week previously he had returned home, without any voice, unable to breathe, and almost skin and bones, with his wandering trunks and his wastrel’s accordion, to fulfill the promise of dying beside his wife. Petra Cotes helped him pack his clothes and bade him farewell without shedding a tear, but she forgot to give him the patent leather shoes that he wanted to wear in his coffin. So when she heard that he had died, she dressed in black, wrapped the shoes up in a newspaper, and asked Fernanda for permission to see the body.

753,"AURELIANO DID NOT leave Melquíades’ room for a long time. He learned by heart the fantastic legends of the crumbling books, the synthesis of the studies of Hermann the Cripple, the notes on the science of demonology, the keys to the philosopher’s stone, the Centuries of Nostradamus and his research concerning the plague, so that he reached adolescence without knowing a thing about his own time but with the basic knowledge of a medieval man. Any time that Santa Sofía de la Piedad would go into his room she would find him absorbed in his reading. At dawn she would bring him a mug of coffee without sugar and at noon a plate of rice and slices of fried plantain, which were the only things eaten in the house since the death of Aureliano Segundo. She saw that his hair was cut, picked off the nits, took in to his size the old clothing that she found in forgotten trunks, and when his mustache began to appear the brought him Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s razor and the small gourd he had used as a shaving mug. None of the latter’s children had looked so much like him, not even Aureliano José, particularly in respect to the prominent cheekbones and the firm and rather pitiless line of the lips. As had happened to Úrsula with Aureliano Segundo when the latter was studying in the room, Santa Sofía de la Piedad thought that Aureliano was talking to himself. Actually, he was talking to Melquíades. One burning noon, a short time after the death of the twins, against the light of the window he saw the gloomy old man with his crow’s-wing hat like the materialization of a memory that had been in his head since long before he was born. Aureliano had finished classifying the alphabet of the parchments, so that when Melquíades asked him if he had discovered the language in which they had been written he did not hesitate to answer.","For a long time, Aureliano did not leave Melquiades' room. He memorized the mythical tales in the tattered book, the summaries of the works of Herman, a paralyzed man, the instructions on demonology, the essential points of alchemy, and the book of Nostradamus' prophecies and his studies on the plague, so when he reached adulthood, he knew nothing about his own era but had a basic knowledge of the Middle Ages. Whenever Santa Sofia de la Piedad entered that room, she always found him buried in books. She brought him a cup of unsweetened coffee in the morning and a plate of rice with a few slices of fried banana at noon, which was the only meal in the house since Aureliano Segundo's death.

Previously, Úrsula believed that Aureliano Segundo often talked to himself while studying in the room, and now Santa Sofia de la Piedad thought the same. In reality, Aureliano was talking to Melquiades. After the death of the twin brothers, on a sweltering afternoon, through the reflection of the window, Aureliano saw the mournful old man with the crow's wing hat, as if it were the concrete manifestation of a memory that had formed in his mind long before he was born.

Thus, by the time he reached adolescence, he knew nothing about his own era but had learned the basic knowledge of medieval people. Whenever Santa Sofia de la Piedad entered his room, she found the child engrossed in reading. At sunrise, she would bring him a cup of plain coffee, and at noon, a plate of rice with fried plantains. Since the death of Aureliano Segundo, nothing else was eaten in the house. Santa Sofia de la Piedad cut Aureliano's hair, picked out his lice, and altered the clothes she found in the trunks to fit him.

None of the Colonel's children, not even Aureliano Jose, resembled the Colonel as much as Aureliano did.

Just as Ursula had once been surprised to see Aureliano Segundo working in that room, now Santa Sofia de la Piedad was surprised, thinking Aureliano was talking to himself. But the child was talking to Melquiades. Shortly after the twins' death, during a scorching midday, Aureliano saw the old man with the crow-wing hat in front of the window.

For the first time in her long life Santa Sofía de la Piedad let a feeling show through, and it was a feeling of wonderment when Aureliano asked her to bring him the book that could be found between Jerusalem Delivered and Milton’s poems on the extreme right-hand side of the second shelf of the bookcases.

For the first time in many years of her life, Santa Sofía de la Piedad revealed an emotion, and it was one of astonishment, when Aureliano asked her to bring him the book lying between the Jerusalem Liberated and the poetry collection of Milton, on the far right of the second row of the bookshelf.

758,"For Santa Sofía de la Piedad the reduction in the number of inhabitants of the house should have meant the rest she deserved after more than half a century of work. Never a lament had been heard from that stealthy, impenetrable woman who had sown in the family the angelic seed of Remedios the Beauty and the mysterious solemnity of José Arcadio Segundo; who dedicated a whole life of solitude and diligence to the rearing of children although she could barely remember whether they were her children or grandchildren, and who took care of Aureliano as if he had come out of her womb, not knowing herself that she was his great-grandmother. Only in a house like that was it conceivable for her always to sleep on a mat she laid out on the pantry floor in the midst of the nocturnal noise of the rats, and without telling anyone that one night she had awakened with the frightened feeling that someone was looking at her in the darkness and that it was a poisonous snake crawling over her stomach. She knew that if she had told Úrsula, the latter would have made her sleep in her own bed, but those were times when no one was aware of anything unless it was shouted on the porch, because with the bustle of the bakery, the surprises of the war, the care of the children, there was not much room for thinking about other peoples happiness. Petra Cotes whom she had never seen, was the only one who remembered her. She saw to it that she had a good pair of shoes for street wear, that she always had clothing, even during the times when the raffles were working only through some miracle. When Fernanda arrived at the house she had good reason to think that she was an ageless servant, and even though she heard it said several times that she was her husband’s mother it was so incredible that it took her longer to discover it than to forget it. Santa Sofía de la Piedad never seemed bothered by that lowly position. On the contrary, one had the impression that she liked to stay in the corners, without a pause, without a complaint, keeping clean and in order the immense house that she had lived in ever since adolescence and that, especially during the time of the banana company, was more like a barracks than a home. But when Úrsula died the superhuman diligence of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, her tremendous capacity for work, began to fall apart. It was not only that she was old and exhausted, but overnight the house had plunged into a crisis of senility. A soft moss grew up the walls. When there was no longer a bare spot in the courtyard, the weeds broke through the cement of the porch, breaking it like glass, and out of the cracks grew the same yellow flowers that Úrsula had found in the glass with Melquíades’ false teeth a century before. With neither the time nor the resources to halt the challenge of nature, Santa Sofía de la Piedad spent the day in the bedrooms driving out the lizards who would return at night. One morning she saw that the red ants had left the undermined foundations, crossed the garden, climbed up the railing, where the begonias had taken on an earthen color, and had penetrated into the heart of the house. She first tried to kill them with a broom, then with insecticides, and finally with lye, but the next day they were back in the same place, still passing by, tenacious and invincible. Fernanda, writing letters to her children, was not aware of the unchecked destructive attack. Santa Sofía de la Piedad continued struggling alone, fighting the weeds to stop them from getting into the kitchen, pulling from the walls the tassels of spider webs which were rebuilt in a few hours, scraping off the termites. But when she saw that Melquíades’ room was also dusty and filled with cobwebs even though she swept and dusted three times a day, and that in spite of her furious cleaning it was threatened by the debris and the air of misery that had been foreseen only by Colonel Aureliano Buendía and the young officer, she realized that she was defeated. Then she put on her worn Sunday dress, some old shoes of Úrsula’s, and a pair of cotton stockings that Amaranta Úrsula had given her, and she made a bundle out of the two or three changes of clothing that she had left.","For Santa Sofía de la Piedad, the reduction in the number of people in the house perhaps gave her a rest that she was entitled to after more than half a century of work. No one ever heard a complaint from that discreet and enigmatic woman, who had sown in this family the divine seeds of Remedios the Beauty and the mysterious solemnity of José Arcadio Segundo, who had devoted her entire lonely and silent life to raising children who could not clearly remember whether they were her children or grandchildren. She cared for Aureliano as if he had been born from her own labor, and she herself did not know that she was his great-grandmother. One had to be in such a family to think that Santa Sofía de la Piedad often slept on a mat woven from palm leaves laid on the floor of the grain storage room, amidst the croaking of frogs at night, and she did not tell anyone that one night she woke up with a horrifying feeling that someone was watching her in the dark, only to find that it was a venomous snake slithering over her belly. Santa Sofía de la Piedad knew that if she had told Úrsula about it in the past, Úrsula would have made her sleep in her own bed, but in these times no one paid attention to anything unless she cried out in the hallway, because the manual labor in the bakery, the horrors of war, and the care of children and grandchildren left no time to think about the happiness of others. Only Petra Cotes, whom Santa Sofía de la Piedad had never met, remembered her. Buying her a pair of beautiful shoes and a ceremonial dress was a debt that Petra Cotes had not been able to repay even during the wonderful days with the money from the lotteries. When she first set foot in this house, Fernanda had many reasons to believe that Santa Sofía de la Piedad was a lifelong servant, and if she had heard a few times that she was her mother-in-law, it was very hard to believe, to the point that it took her a long time to realize that it was true, but soon she forgot again. Santa Sofía de la Piedad never felt uncomfortable with that lowly position. On the contrary, she enjoyed moving from one corner to another, never complaining, always busy arranging and cleaning the vast house where she had lived since she was young, and especially during the time of the banana company, the house resembled a barracks more than a residence. But when Úrsula died, the extreme meticulousness and extraordinary work capacity of Santa Sofía de la Piedad also began to decline. Not only because she was old and exhausted, but also because the house quickly fell into disrepair. A fresh green moss covered the walls. When there was no more empty ground in the garden, weeds broke through the cement floor of the hallway as if breaking through a glass pane, and from the cracks grew the same small yellow flowers that almost a century earlier Úrsula had seen in the cup holding Melquíades' false teeth. There was neither the time nor the means to prevent those brutal attacks of nature, and all day long Santa Sofía de la Piedad chased away the lizards that had crept into the rooms during the night. One morning, the old woman saw red ants leaving the holes in the cement, crawling through the garden, climbing up the edges of the stairs, where the begonias had turned the color of the earth, and reaching the innermost parts of the house. At first, she used a broom, then insecticide, and finally lime to kill the ants, but the next day they reappeared in the same place, constantly moving back and forth, persistent and invincible. At that time, because she was writing letters to her children, Fernanda was unaware of the unstoppable invasion of weeds and pests. Santa Sofía de la Piedad continued to fight alone, battling the weeds to keep them from invading the kitchen, chasing away the rapidly multiplying cobwebs on the walls, and scrubbing the termites. But when she saw that Melquíades' room was also covered in cobwebs and dust, Santa Sofía de la Piedad began to clean it three times a day, and when she realized that despite her diligent cleaning, the room was still threatened by piles of broken tiles and the foul atmosphere that only Colonel Aureliano Buendía and the young officer had once predicted, she understood that she had failed. At that moment, Santa Sofía de la Piedad put on her worn Sunday best, Ursula's old shoes, and a pair of cotton socks that Amaranta Ursula had given her, then wrapped her remaining two or three sets of clothes into a bundle.",29.588,29.492,"For Santa Sofia de la Piedad, the reduction in the household crowd meant finding the opportunity for the rest she deserved after working like a slave for half a century. The woman, who had added the angelic seed of Beautiful Remedios and the mysterious stillness of Jose Arcadio Segundo to the family, had never uttered a single complaint. She had spent her entire life in seclusion, dedicating herself to raising children she was confused about whether they were her children or grandchildren. She had cared for little Aureliano as if he were her own child, embracing him without ever knowing she was his great-grandmother. Santa Sofia de la Piedad laying a bed in the pantry where mice ran rampant was something that could only be comprehended within the atmosphere of that house. The poor woman had woken up in fear one night, sensing that someone was watching her in the dark, and had seen a huge, poisonous snake coiled on her stomach. She had not mentioned this incident to anyone. He knew that if he told Ursula, she would take him into her embrace. But they were going through such days that unless someone stepped out onto the veranda and shouted at the top of their lungs, no one knew anything about anyone else. The frantic work in the oven, then the bewilderment of the war, then the care of the children, no one had found the opportunity to think about the happiness of others. The only person who did not forget him was Petra Cotes, whom he had never even seen. Petra Cotes made sure that Santa Sofia de la Piedad lacked nothing, always thinking of a new pair of shoes she could wear when going out, and clothes to put on her back. Even in the days when lotteries were run only through miraculous efforts, Petra did not forget her. When Fernanda came as a bride, she thought Santa Sofia de la Piedad was a servant of indeterminate age, and although she had heard several times that she was her husband's mother, she found it so unbelievable that she preferred to immediately forget that she was her mother-in-law. Santa Sofia de la Piedad, on the other hand, never minded being treated as a servant. On the contrary, she seemed to enjoy staying in the background: She worked tirelessly and without complaint to keep this house, where she had lived since her youth and which had especially turned into a barracks during the Banana Company period, tidy and clean. When Ama Ursula died, the superhuman efforts and inexhaustible energy of Santa Sofia de la Piedad began to wane. The reason for this decline was not just because she had aged and grown tired. When Ursula died, the house collapsed overnight. A soft layer of moss appeared on the walls. The weeds that covered the garden, having left no space as small as the eye of a needle, began to press against the cement of the veranda, breaking through the cement flooring like glass and sprouting shoots. In the split cracks, buds of yellow flowers identical to those Ursula had found in Melquiades' false teeth a century ago burst open. Santa Sofia de la Piedad, who had neither the time nor the means to stop nature's defiance, spent her entire day chasing away the lizards that had invaded the bedrooms. As for the lizards, they would come back once it was night again. Santa Sofia de la Piedad saw one morning that red ants were emerging from the foundations they had hollowed out, crossing the garden, climbing the veranda railings where the begonias had turned the color of earth, and then entering the house. She first tried to kill the ants with a broom. Then she tried insecticides. When they didn't work either, she poured soapy water. But the next day, the ants came again, walking inside without any hindrance. Fernanda, who was engrossed in writing a letter to her children, was unaware of this unstoppable destructive invasion. Santa Sofia de la Piedad was struggling alone, trying to prevent the weeds from taking over the kitchen, cleaning the spider webs that would be woven again in a few hours, and digging out the nests of bedbugs. However, when she saw that Melquiades' room was also getting dusty, that she couldn't cope with the spider webs despite sweeping three times a day, and realized that the room had now taken on the same ruinous appearance that only Colonel Aureliano Buendia and the young officer had seen before, Santa Sofia de la Piedad understood that she had been defeated by nature. Then he put on his bargaining clothes, Ursula's old shoes, the muslin socks given by Amaranta Ursula, and packed the remaining few layers of laundry.",17.507,17.356,"For Santa Sofía de la Piedad, the reduction of the household inhabitants should have been the rest she deserved after more than half a century of work. No one had ever heard a complaint from that stealthy, impenetrable woman, who sowed in the family the angelic seeds of Remedios, the beautiful, and the mysterious solemnity of José Arcadio Segundo; who dedicated an entire life of solitude and silence to raising children who barely remembered they were her children and grandchildren, and who took care of Aureliano as if he had come from her own womb, without knowing herself that she was his great-grandmother. Only in a house like that was it conceivable that she had always slept on a mat she laid on the floor of the granary, amidst the nocturnal racket of the rats, without ever telling anyone that one night she was awakened by the terrifying sensation that someone was watching her in the dark, and it was a snake slithering over her belly. She knew that if she had told Úrsula, she would have put her to sleep in her own bed, but those were the times when no one noticed anything unless it was shouted in the corridor, because the bakery chores, the war's upheavals, and the care of the children left no time to think about others' happiness. Petra Cotes, whom she never saw, was the only one who remembered her. She made sure she had a good pair of shoes to go out, that she never lacked a dress, even in times when she performed miracles with the raffle money. When Fernanda arrived at the house, she had reasons to believe she was an eternal servant, and although she heard several times that she was her husband's mother, it seemed so incredible to her that she took longer to learn it than to forget it. Santa Sofía de la Piedad never seemed bothered by that subordinate condition. On the contrary, it seemed she liked to wander through the corners, without a break, without a complaint, keeping the immense house where she had lived since adolescence orderly and clean, and which particularly in the times of the banana company seemed more like a barracks than a home. But when Úrsula died, the inhuman diligence of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, her tremendous capacity for work, began to falter. It wasn't just that she was old and exhausted, but the house plunged overnight into a crisis of senility. A tender moss climbed up the walls. When there was no longer a bare spot in the patios, the weeds broke through the cement of the corridor from below, cracking it like glass, and the same little yellow flowers that Úrsula had found almost a century earlier in the glass where Melquíades' dentures were, emerged from the cracks. Without time or resources to prevent nature's excesses, Santa Sofía de la Piedad spent the day in the bedrooms, scaring away the lizards that would come back in at night. One morning she saw the red ants abandon the undermined foundations, cross the garden, climb up the handrail where the begonias had acquired a soil color, and enter the house's depths. She first tried to kill them with a broom, then with insecticide, and finally with lime, but the next day they were back in the same place, always passing, tenacious and invincible. Fernanda, writing letters to her children, did not notice the unstoppable onslaught of destruction. Santa Sofía de la Piedad continued fighting alone, battling the weeds to keep them out of the kitchen, pulling the tassels of cobwebs off the walls that reproduced in a few hours, scraping off the termites. But when she saw that even Melquíades' room was cobwebbed and dusty, despite sweeping and dusting it three times a day, and that despite her furious cleaning it was threatened by debris and the air of misery that only Colonel Aureliano Buendía and the young soldier had foreseen, she understood that she was defeated. Then she put on the worn Sunday dress, some old shoes of Úrsula's, and a pair of cotton stockings that Amaranta Úrsula had given her, and made a little bundle with the two or three changes of clothes she had left.",49.705,49.645
759,"“I give up,” she said to Aureliano. “This is too much house for my poor bones.”","- I give up, - the old man told Aureliano, - this house is just too big, and this frail body of mine can't handle keeping it tidy.",8.426,5.518,"Aureliano, ""I have given up,"" he said. ""This housework is not something my bones can handle.""",8.865,4.583,—I give up —he said to Aureliano—. This house is too much for my poor bones.,32.393,28.133
760,"Aureliano asked her where she was going and she made a vague sign, as if she did not have the slightest idea of her destination. She tried to be more precise, however, saying that she was going to spend her last years with a first cousin who lived in Riohacha. It was not a likely explanation. Since the death of her parents she had not had contact with anyone in town or received letters or messages, nor had she been heard to speak of any relatives. Aureliano gave her fourteen little gold fishes because she was determined to leave with only what she had: one peso and twenty-five cents. From the window of the room he saw her cross the courtyard with her bundle of clothing, dragging her feet and bent over by her years, and he saw her reach her hand through an opening in the main door and replace the bar after she had gone out. Nothing was ever heard of her again.","Aureliano asked Santa Sofía de la Piedad where she was planning to go, and she replied with an ambiguous gesture as if she had no awareness of her own fate. However, she did try to assert that she would spend her final days with a cousin in Riohacha. That, too, was uncertain. Since the death of Santa Sofía de la Piedad's parents, she had no contact with anyone in the village, no letters or messages, and no one had ever heard her speak of any relatives. Aureliano gave Santa Sofía de la Piedad fourteen gold fish, because she had decided to leave when she only had one peso and twenty-five cents left in her pocket. Through the window, Aureliano saw Santa Sofía de la Piedad, with her body bent by age, shuffling through the garden carrying a small bundle of clothes, and saw her reach through the door hole to latch it after she had left the house. From that moment on, no one knew anything about her.",17.97,17.317,"Aureliano asked where she was going. The woman made an ambiguous gesture as if she didn't know where she was going. Still trying to offer an explanation, she said she would spend her final years with her niece in Riohacha. This was not a very plausible explanation, because after her parents died, Santa Sofia de la Piedad had neither interacted with anyone in town, received any letters, nor mentioned any relatives. When Santa Sofia de la Piedad attempted to set off with one peso and twenty-five cents in her pocket, Aureliano forcibly gave her seventeen gold fish. Then he watched from the room's window as the woman, with her laundry bundle on her shoulder, bent over with age, dragging her feet through the garden, opened the garden gate, and after passing through, bolted it again. There has been no news from Santa Sofia de la Piedad since.",12.948,12.127,"Aureliano asked her where she was going, and she made a vague gesture, as if she had no idea of her destination. She tried to specify, however, that she was going to spend her last years with a first cousin who lived in Riohacha. It was not a plausible explanation. Since the death of her parents, she had not had contact with anyone in the town, nor received letters or messages, nor was she heard to speak of any relatives. Aureliano gave her fourteen little gold fishes, because she was ready to leave with the only thing she had: one peso and twenty-five cents. From the window of the room, he saw her cross the patio with her bundle of clothes, dragging her feet and bent by the years, and he saw her put her hand through a hole in the gate to place the latch after she had gone out. She was never heard from again.",61.195,60.983
761,"When she heard about the flight, Fernanda ranted for a whole day as she checked trunks, dressers, and closets, item by item, to make sure that Santa Sofía de la Piedad had not made off with anything. She burned her fingers trying to light a fire for the first time in her life and she had to ask Aureliano to do her the favor of showing her how to make coffee. Fernanda would find her breakfast ready when she arose and she would leave her room again only to get the meal that Aureliano had left covered on the embers for her, which she would carry to the table to eat on linen tablecloths and between candelabra, sitting at the solitary head of the table facing fifteen empty chairs. Even under those circumstances Aureliano and Fernanda did not share their solitude, but both continued living on their own, cleaning their respective rooms while the cobwebs fell like snow on the rose bushes, carpeted the beams, cushioned the walls. It was around that time that Fernanda got the impression that the house was filling up with elves. It was as if things, especially those for everyday use, had developed a faculty for changing location on their own. Fernanda would waste time looking for the shears that she was sure she had put on the bed and after turning everything upside down she would find them on a shelf in the kitchen, where she thought she had not been for four days. Suddenly there was no fork in the silver chest and she would find six on the altar and three in the washroom. That wandering about of things was even more exasperating when she sat down to write. The inkwell that she had placed at her right would be on the left, the blotter would be lost and she would find it two days later under her pillow, and the pages written to José Arcadio would get mixed up with those written to Amaranta Úrsula, and she always had the feeling of mortification that she had put the letters in opposite envelopes, as in fact happened several times. On one occasion she lost her fountain pen. Two weeks later the mailman, who had found it in his bag, returned it. He had been going from house to house looking for its owner. At first she thought it was some business of the invisible doctors, like the disappearance of the pessaries, and she even started a letter to them begging them to leave her alone, but she had to interrupt it to do something and when she went back to her room she not only did not find the letter she had started but she had forgotten the reason for writing it. For a time she thought it was Aureliano. She began to spy on him, to put things in his path trying to catch him when he changed their location, but she was soon convinced that Aureliano never left Melquíades’ room except to go to the kitchen or the toilet, and that he was not a man to play tricks. So in the end she believed that it was the mischief of elves and she decided to secure everything in the place where she would use it. She tied the shears to the head of her bed with a long string. She tied the pen and the blotter to the leg of the table, and the glued the inkwell to the top of it to the right of the place where she normally wrote. The problems were not solved overnight, because a few hours after she had tied the string to the shears it was not long enough for her to cut with, as if the elves had shortened it. The same thing happened to her with the string to the pen and even with her own arm which after a short time of writing could not reach the inkwell. Neither Amaranta Úrsula in Brussels nor José Arcadio in Rome ever heard about those insignificant misfortunes. Fernanda told them that she was happy and in reality she was, precisely because she felt free from any compromise, as if life were pulling her once more toward the world of her parents, where one did not suffer with day-to-day problems because they were solved beforehand in one’s imagination. That endless correspondence made her lose her sense of time, especially after Santa Sofía de la Piedad had left. She had been accustomed to keep track of the days, months, and years, using as points of reference the dates set for the return of her children. But when they changed their plans time and time again, the dates became confused, the periods were mislaid, and one day seemed so much like another that one could not feel them pass. Instead of becoming impatient, she felt a deep pleasure in the delay. It did not worry her that many years after announcing the eve of his final vows, José Arcadio was still saying that he was waiting to finish his studies in advanced theology in order to undertake those in diplomacy, because she understood how steep and paved with obstacles was the spiral stairway that led to the throne of Saint Peter. On the other hand, her spirits rose with news that would have been insignificant for other people, such as the fact that her son had seen the Pope. She felt a similar pleasure when Amaranta Úrsula wrote to tell her that her studies would last longer than the time foreseen because her excellent grades had earned her privileges that her father had not taken into account in his calculations.","After learning that Santa Sofía de la Piedad had run away, Fernanda mumbled to herself for an entire day while checking each trunk and each cabinet to ensure that she hadn't taken anything with her. For the first time in her life, Fernanda lit the stove and burned her hand, then had to ask Aureliano to show her how to make coffee. From then on, it was Aureliano who did the cooking. When Fernanda woke up, the food was already prepared by Aureliano and kept warm in the hot ashes; she only needed to leave her bedroom to fetch it and eat at a table covered with a linen cloth, with candles placed on top; when eating, she sat on the innermost chair of fifteen empty chairs. In that setting, Aureliano and Fernanda did not share their loneliness with each other, but each minded their own business. They cleaned their own rooms while cobwebs spread over the rose bushes, covered the rafters, and wove across the walls. It was during this period that Fernanda had the impression that the house was full of ghosts. It was no wonder that objects, especially those used daily, always seemed to change places on their own. Fernanda spent time searching for the scissors she was sure she had left on the bed, only to find them in the kitchen cabinet after rummaging everywhere, a place she believed she hadn't set foot in for four days. Suddenly, there were no plates left in the cupboard, only to find six on the altar and three in the sink. When Fernanda sat down to write, she found the objects moved even more unexpectedly. The inkwell placed on the right would later be found on the left, the blotter disappeared and reappeared two days later under her pillow, the pages written for José Arcadio mixed with those for Amaranta Úrsula, and she always worried that she had put the wrong letter in the wrong envelope, as had happened many times before. Once, she lost her pen. Fifteen days later, the mailman returned it. He had found it in his pocket and had gone around asking whose pen it was. At first, Fernanda believed these incidents were caused by invisible doctors, similar to the disappearance of the uterine rings earlier, and she began writing a letter asking them to leave her alone, but then she had to stop to do something else, and when she returned to her room, not only was the letter gone, but she had also forgotten why she was writing it in the first place. For a while, she thought it was Aureliano. She watched Aureliano, placing objects in his path with the intention of catching him moving them from one place to another, but soon she was convinced that Aureliano never left Melquíades' room unless he needed to go to the kitchen or the bathroom, and he wasn't the type to play pranks. Finally, Fernanda believed it was the work of ghosts and decided to deal with it by securing everything in its proper place. She tied the scissors to the headboard with a long string, tied the pen and blotter to the table leg, and glued the inkwell to the table on the right side where she usually sat to write. But things didn't go smoothly, because just as she was sewing for a while, she couldn't pull the scissors to where she needed to cut, as if the string had been shortened by ghosts. The string tied to the pen was the same, and even Fernanda's arm seemed to shorten, because after writing for a while, she couldn't reach the inkwell anymore. Neither Amaranta Úrsula in Brussels nor José Arcadio in Rome ever knew about these misfortunes. Fernanda wrote to her children that she was living happily, and indeed she was, because she felt free from all constraints, as if life was pulling her back to her parents' world, where she wouldn't have to suffer daily troubles because they were resolved in her imagination. The correspondence with her children made Fernanda lose track of time, especially since Santa Sofía de la Piedad had left. Previously, she had the habit of counting days, months, and years to see how long it would be before her children returned as planned. But when they repeatedly informed her of changed plans, she lost track of the days, and time seemed to stand still. Instead of being anxious, she was pleased with the delay. Fernanda was not impatient when, many years later, José Arcadio informed her that he was about to take lifelong vows, and then later said he was waiting to finish his advanced theology studies to study diplomacy, because she thought of the many obstacles on the long spiral staircase leading to the chair of Saint Peter. On the contrary, she was thrilled by news that meant nothing to others, such as her son seeing the Pope. She was equally delighted when Amaranta Úrsula informed her that her studies would be extended because she was an honor student and received special privileges, something her father hadn't considered in his calculations.",26.168,26.076,"When Fernanda heard that Santa Sofia de la Piedad had run away, she spent the whole day searching the house to see if anything was stolen, emptying trunks and baskets, and rummaging through cupboards and drawers. Then, when she tried to light the fire for the first time in her life, she burned her fingers and asked Aureliano to teach her how to make coffee. Over time, Aureliano took over the kitchen duties. When Fernanda woke up as she used to, she found her breakfast ready and only left her room to get her meals. She would take the food that Aureliano had left on the embers to keep warm, spread the linen cloths, light the candlesticks, sit at the head of the table facing fifteen empty chairs, and eat her meal. Even under these conditions, Aureliano and Fernanda did not share their loneliness. Each lived on their own, trying to clean their own rooms, and destroy the spider webs that fell like snow on the rose bushes, covered the ceiling beams, and plastered the walls. It was during this time that Fernanda got the feeling that the house was infested with spirits. The furniture in the house, especially the items used daily, had started to move on their own. Fernanda was searching for the scissors she was certain she had left on the bed, and then found them on the kitchen shelf, a place she thought she hadn't visited in four days. She saw that there were no forks in the drawer where the silverware was kept, and found six of them on the altar and three in the bathroom. Especially when she sat down to write, the constant movement of objects became even more exasperating. The inkwell she had placed on the right side of the table had moved to the left, and Fernanda only found the missing blotting paper under her pillow two days later. The pages of the letter he wrote to Jose Arcadio were getting mixed up with the letter he wrote to Amaranta Ursula. Fernanda always had the feeling that she put one person's letter in the other's envelope. Indeed, it happened a few times. Once, she lost her fountain pen. Two weeks later, the postman, who found the fountain pen in his own bag, returned it. He had gone door to door looking for the owner of the pen. At first, Fernanda thought that these things were the work of invisible doctors, and that they had risen up like ghosts. She even started to write a letter to the doctors, begging them to leave her alone. But while writing the letter, she got up to do something, and when she returned to the room, she couldn't find the letter and had forgotten why she was writing it. For a while, she thought it was Aureliano who was doing these things. He started to watch Aureliano. He left some things in the open to see if he would move them or not. But very soon, he definitely understood that Aureliano did not leave Melquiades' room except to go to the kitchen or the bathroom and that he was not someone who would play such games. In the end, he believed it was the work of spirits or fairies and decided to tie everything to its place of use. She hung the scissors by a long string at the head of her bed. With the fountain pen, she tied the blotting paper to the leg of the table. She stuck the ink bottle to the right side of the table, where she always used it. However, the problems were not something that could be solved immediately. A few hours after Fernanda tied the scissors, she saw that the string was short and didn't reach. It was as if goblins had cut the string. The same thing happened to the string she tied to the fountain pen. It even seemed as if her own arm had shortened, because soon she couldn't reach the ink bottle. Neither Amaranta Ursula in Brussels nor Jose Arcadio in Rome had any idea about these minor troubles. Fernanda was writing to them that she was fine and in good spirits. It really was like that. Because he wasn't seeking a compromise in any matter, he wasn't making any concessions. It was as if life was dragging him back into the world of his own family, a realm where people didn't deal with daily problems but found solutions to these problems in their minds beforehand. First with the doctors, then with her children, her endless correspondence, especially after Santa Sofia de la Piedad left, distanced Fernanda even further from the concept of time. She began to mark the dates of her children's visits to the house and track the days, months, and years. But as her children kept changing their arrival dates, the days started to blend together, the durations became uncertain, in short, the passage of time became incomprehensible. Instead of becoming impatient as her children's visits were delayed, Fernanda was pleased with these postponements. Even though years had passed since the night Jose Arcadio announced he would take his priestly vows, her son kept writing that he would first complete his studies in high theology and then pursue a career in diplomacy. Fernanda was not saddened by this news. Because she knew how steep and challenging the winding staircase leading to Saint Peter's throne was. Especially when she received news from her son, such as seeing His Holiness the Pope, which others might not find significant, Fernanda's spirits were greatly lifted. Fernanda felt the same joy when Amaranta Ursula wrote that her education would take longer than expected because she had earned certain rights that her father had not accounted for due to her diligence.",23.169,23.069,"When she learned of the escape, Fernanda ranted for an entire day, while she checked trunks, dressers, and wardrobes, item by item, to convince herself that Santa Sofía de la Piedad had not taken anything. She burned her fingers trying to light a stove for the first time in her life, and had to ask Aureliano to do her the favor of teaching her how to make coffee. Over time, it was he who took over the kitchen chores. Upon waking up, Fernanda would find breakfast served, and she would only leave the bedroom to fetch the food that Aureliano left covered in the embers, which she would take to the table to eat on linen tablecloths and among candelabras, sitting at a solitary head of the table at the end of fifteen empty chairs. Even in those circumstances, Aureliano and Fernanda did not share their solitude, but continued living each in their own, cleaning their respective rooms, while the cobwebs snowed over the rose bushes, covered the beams, and cushioned the walls.

At first, she thought it was the work of the invisible doctors, like the disappearance of the pessaries, and even started writing them a letter to beg them to leave her in peace, but she had to interrupt it to do something, and when she returned to the room not only did she not find the started letter, but she also forgot the purpose of writing it. For a while, she thought it was Aureliano. She began to watch him, placing objects in his path trying to catch him in the act of moving them, but very soon she was convinced that Aureliano never left Melquíades' room except to go to the kitchen or the bathroom, and that he was not a man for pranks. So she ended up believing that it was the mischief of goblins, and decided to secure each thing in the place where she had to use it. She tied the scissors with a long string to the headboard of the bed. She tied the duster and the blotting paper pad to the leg of the table, and glued the inkwell to the board, to the right of the place where she usually wrote. The problems were not solved overnight, because after a few hours of sewing the string of the scissors was already too short to cut, as if the goblins were shortening it. The same thing happened with the string of the pen, and even with her own arm, which after a short time of writing could not reach the inkwell. Neither Amaranta Úrsula, in Brussels, nor José Arcadio, in Rome, ever learned of these insignificant misfortunes. Fernanda told them that she was happy, and in reality, she was, precisely because she felt freed from all commitments, as if life had dragged her back to her parents' world, where daily problems were not suffered because they were solved in advance in the imagination. That endless correspondence made her lose track of time, especially after Santa Sofía de la Piedad left. She had gotten used to keeping track of the days, months, and years, taking as reference points the dates scheduled for the return of her children. But when they changed the deadlines over and over again, the dates got confused, the terms got mixed up, and the days became so similar to each other that they were not felt to pass. Instead of becoming impatient, she experienced a deep satisfaction with the delay. She was not troubled that many years after announcing the eve of his perpetual vows, José Arcadio kept saying that he hoped to finish his studies in high theology to begin those in diplomacy, because she understood that the spiral staircase leading to the chair of Saint Peter was very high and paved with obstacles. On the other hand, her spirit was exalted by news that for others would have been insignificant, such as that her son had seen the Pope. She experienced similar joy when Amaranta Úrsula sent word that her studies were taking longer than expected because her excellent grades had earned her privileges that her father had not considered when making the calculations.",47.793,47.739
762,"More than three years had passed since Santa Sofía de la Piedad had brought him the grammar when Aureliano succeeded in translating the first sheet. It was not a useless chore. but it was only a first step along a road whose length it was impossible to predict, because the text in Spanish did not mean anything: the lines were in code. Aureliano lacked the means to establish the keys that would permit him to dig them out, but since Melquíades had told him that the books he needed to get to the bottom of the parchments were in the wise Catalonian’s store, he decided to speak to Fernanda so that she would let him get them. In the room devoured by rubble, whose unchecked proliferation had finally defeated it, he thought about the best way to frame the request, but when he found Fernanda taking her meal from the embers, which was his only chance to speak to her, the laboriously formulated request stuck in his throat and he lost his voice. That was the only time that he watched her. He listened to her steps in the bedroom. He heard her on her way to the door to await the letters from her children and to give hers to the mailman, and he listened until late at night to the harsh, impassioned scratching of her pen on the paper before hearing the sound of the light switch and the murmur of her prayers in the darkness. Only then did he go to sleep, trusting that on the following day the awaited opportunity would come. He became so inspired with the idea that permission would be granted that one morning he cut his hair, which at that time reached down to his shoulders, shaved off his tangled beard, put on some tight-fitting pants and a shirt with an artificial collar that he had inherited from he did not know whom, and waited in the kitchen for Fernanda to get her breakfast. The woman of every day, the one with her head held high and with a stony gait, did not arrive, but an old woman of supernatural beauty with a yellowed ermine cape, a crown of gilded cardboard, and the languid look of a person who wept in secret. Actually, ever since she had found it in Aureliano Segundo’s trunks, Fernanda had put on the moth-eaten queen’s dress many times. Anyone who could have seen her in front of the mirror, in ecstasy over her own regal gestures, would have had reason to think that she was mad. But she was not. She had simply turned the royal regalia into a device for her memory. The first time that she put it on she could not help a knot from forming in her heart and her eyes filling with tears because at that moment she smelled once more the odor of shoe polish on the boots of the officer who came to get her at her house to make her a queen, and her soul brightened with the nostalgia of her lost dreams. She felt so old, so worn out, so far away from the best moments of her life that she even yearned for those that she remembered as the worst, and only then did she discover how much she missed the whiff of oregano on the porch and the smell of the roses at dusk, and even the bestial nature of the parvenus. Her heart of compressed ash, which had resisted the most telling blows of daily reality without strain, fell apart with the first waves of nostalgia. The need to feel sad was becoming a vice as the years eroded her. She became human in her solitude. Nevertheless, the morning on which she entered the kitchen and found a cup of coffee offered her by a pale and bony adolescent with a hallucinated glow in his eyes, the claws of ridicule tore at her. Not only did she refuse him permission, but from then on she carried the keys to the house in the pocket where she kept the unused pessaries. It was a useless precaution because if he had wanted to, Aureliano could have escaped and even returned to the house without being seen. But the prolonged captivity, the uncertainty of the world, the habit of obedience had dried up the seeds of rebellion in his heart. So that he went back to his enclosure, reading and rereading the parchments and listening until very late at night to Fernanda sobbing in her bedroom. One morning he went to light the fire as usual and on the extinguished ashes he found the food that he had left for her the day before. Then he looked into her bedroom and saw her lying on the bed covered with the ermine cape, more beautiful than ever and with her skin turned into an ivory casing. Four months later, when José Arcadio arrived, he found her intact.","Three years had passed since Santa Sophia de la Piedad brought Aureliano the grammar book until he translated the first page. His work was not in vain, but it was only the first step on a long and unpredictable road, because the text in Spanish made no sense: it was just encoded poems, and Aureliano lacked the means to delve deeper into those poems. However, since Melquiades had told him that the wise Catalonian's bookstore had books that would help him understand the parchments, he decided to ask Fernanda for permission to get those books. In the room full of broken tiles - the increasing number of which would eventually cause the room to collapse - Aureliano pondered how to appropriately present his request, anticipating the right moment and opportunity, but when he saw Fernanda taking food stored in hot ashes - the only chance to speak to her - the carefully prepared words stuck in his throat, unable to be spoken. That was the only time Aureliano followed Fernanda. He listened to the sound of Fernanda's footsteps in the bedroom. He heard her stepping out to receive letters from her children and send the letters she wrote to them; late at night, he still heard the sound of the pen pressing hard on the paper before hearing the light being turned off and the murmured prayers in the dark. Only then did Aureliano fall asleep, believing that the opportunity he longed for would come the next day. Aureliano was under the illusion that his request would not be denied, so one morning he cut his shoulder-length hair, shaved his stubbly beard, put on tight pants and a shirt with a false collar, not knowing whom he had inherited them from, and then went to the kitchen to wait for Fernanda to eat. But it was not the woman who lived there daily, the woman with her head held high, the woman who walked firmly, but an exquisitely beautiful old lady wearing a yellow mink coat, a gold-plated cardboard crown, and the fragile demeanor of someone who often cried silently. In fact, since seeing the beauty queen outfit moth-eaten in Aureliano Segundo's trunk, Fernanda had worn it many times. If anyone had seen her standing before the mirror with regal gestures, they would surely have thought she was mad. But that was not the case. Fernanda merely turned the beauty queen outfit into a memory machine. The first time she wore it, she could not avoid the feeling of a lump in her heart and her eyes filled with tears, because at that moment, Fernanda felt the smell of polish on the boots of a soldier who had come to her house to make her a beauty queen, and her soul became transparent with the regret of past dreams. She felt old and withered, so different from the Fernanda of the most beautiful moments of her life, to the point that she even missed the moments she considered the worst, and only then did Fernanda realize how necessary the clusters of marjoram in the hallway and the steam rising from the rose bushes in the evening were to her, even the fierce nature of those who came from distant places. Her cold heart, which had firmly withstood the precise blows of daily life, was now shattered by the first attack of nostalgia. The feeling of sadness had become a need for her, growing over the years and gradually becoming a vice. She made herself a kind person in her loneliness. But that morning, when she entered the kitchen and saw the cup of coffee that the thin, pale young man with dreamy eyes had made for her, she felt as if something very strange had struck her. Not only did Fernanda not allow Aureliano to go, but from then on, she kept the house key carefully in the pouch where she stored unused uterine rings. That caution was futile, because if Aureliano wanted, he could leave and return without her seeing him. But the long confinement, the vagueness about the outside world, and the habit of obedience had withered the seeds of stubbornness in Aureliano. So he returned to his room, repeatedly examining the parchments, and late into the night, he still heard Fernanda's sobbing in her bedroom. One morning, as usual, Aureliano went to light the stove and found in the cold ashes the food left for Fernanda from the previous day. Aureliano hurriedly looked into the room and saw Fernanda lying on the bed, covered with the mink coat, more beautiful than ever, and her skin as white as ivory. Four months later, when José Arcadio returned, he found her motionless.",24.366,24.254,"Three years after Santa Sofia de la Piedad brought the grammar book, Aureliano managed to turn the first page of the manuscripts. This was not a futile endeavor. However, it was the first step on a path whose length could not be determined. Because the text translated into Spanish made no sense; it was written in code. Aureliano did not have the key to decipher this code: Then he remembered that Melquiades had said that the books to help him read the manuscripts were in the wise Catalonian's shop, and he decided to ask Fernanda for permission to go get the books. Pacing in the wretched room succumbing to relentless decay, Aureliano thought about the best way to convey his request. Then, at the only place where he had the opportunity to talk to Fernanda, that is, while the woman was taking her food off the fire, he confronted her. But the words he had thought about and prepared for a long time got stuck in his throat, and he couldn't speak. The only time Aureliano showed interest in and looked after Fernanda was on this day when he asked for permission. He was listening to Fernanda's footsteps wandering around her room. He heard her come down to the door to receive letters from her children and to give her own writings to the postman. He listened to the scratching of her pen on the papers until late at night. Then he heard the light being turned off and Fernanda praying in the dark. Only then would Aureliano fall asleep, thinking that the opportunity he had been waiting for would come the next day. He was so convinced that he could get the permission he had been waiting for one of these days that one morning he cut his hair that fell on his shoulders, shaved his scraggly beard, put on a tight pair of pants whose origin he did not know, and a shirt with a detachable collar, and waited in the kitchen for Fernanda to come and get her breakfast. The woman who walked every day with her head held high and with firm steps did not appear that day. Instead, an extraordinarily beautiful old woman, wearing a yellowed ermine cloak and a crown made of gilded paper, who looked as if she had been secretly crying, came into the kitchen. In fact, Fernanda had worn the clothes many times since she found the moth-eaten queen's garments while rummaging through Aureliano Segundo's trunks. If anyone had seen her dressed like that, standing in front of the mirror and losing herself while watching her queenly movements, they would have thought Fernanda was crazy. But she was not crazy. She had dressed as the Queen to refresh her memories. When she first wore the cloak, her heart ached, and her eyes filled with tears. Because at that moment, she had smelled the polish of the officer's boots who had taken her from home to make her a queen, and her soul was illuminated with the longing for her unfulfilled dreams. Now he felt so old, so exhausted, so far removed from the good days He was feeling so lost that he even began to long for the days filled with the worst memories. It was then that he realized how much he missed the hydrangeas on the veranda, the scent of the roses at sunset, and even the boorish behavior of the nouveau riche crowd. His heart, which had easily withstood even the most shocking of daily realities, shattered into pieces at the first surge of this longing. The need to feel sorrow was turning into a passion over the years. He became humane in his loneliness. However, on the morning he entered the kitchen and saw a pale, bony young man with misty eyes handing him a coffee cup, he was seized by the feeling of being ridiculous. In his anger, he not only refused to let the young man stay, but also stopped taking out the keys he kept in a secret pocket where he stored unused items. This was an unnecessary precaution, because Aureliano could very well come and go without Fernanda noticing if he wanted to. However, being confined for years, not knowing the world, and getting used to obeying had dried up the seeds of rebellion in his heart. That's why he locked himself in the room again. He began to read the manuscripts over and over again. Meanwhile, he listened to the sobs of Fernanda crying in the bedroom. One morning, as usual, when he entered the kitchen to light the fire, he saw that the food he had left the day before for Fernanda to take was still untouched on the ashes. Then he looked into Fernanda's bedroom and saw that the woman had covered herself with her ermine cloak and that her face, more beautiful than ever, had turned an ivory color. When Jose Arcadio arrived four months later, he found Fernanda lying in the same way.",21.856,21.737,"More than three years had passed since Santa Sofía de la Piedad brought him the grammar book, when Aureliano managed to translate the first sheet. It was not a useless task, but it was merely a first step on a path whose length was impossible to foresee, because the text in Spanish meant nothing: they were encrypted verses. Aureliano lacked the elements to establish the keys that would allow him to decipher them, but since Melquíades had told him that the books he needed to get to the bottom of the parchments were in the wise Catalan's shop, he decided to speak with Fernanda to ask her to let him go fetch them. In the room devoured by debris, whose uncontrollable proliferation had ultimately defeated him, he thought about the most suitable way to make the request, anticipated the circumstances, calculated the most appropriate occasion, but when he found Fernanda removing the food from the embers, which was the only opportunity to talk to her, the laboriously premeditated request got stuck in his throat, and he lost his voice. That was the only time he spied on her. He was attentive to her steps in the bedroom. He heard her go to the door to receive letters from her children and hand hers to the postman, and he listened until very late at night to the hard and passionate stroke of the pen on the paper, before hearing the switch click and the murmur of prayers in the darkness. Only then did he fall asleep, trusting that the next day would give him the awaited opportunity. He was so hopeful that the permission would not be denied that one morning he cut his hair, which was already reaching his shoulders, shaved his tangled beard, put on tight pants and a detachable-collar shirt that he didn't know from whom he had inherited, and waited in the kitchen for Fernanda to come for breakfast. The woman who came was not the one of every day, with her head held high and her stony gait, but an old woman of supernatural beauty, with a yellowed ermine cape, a golden cardboard crown, and the languid demeanor of someone who has cried in secret. In fact, since she found it in Aureliano Segundo's trunks, Fernanda had often worn the moth-eaten queen's dress. Anyone who had seen her in front of the mirror, entranced by her own monarchical gestures, might have thought she was crazy. But she wasn't. She had simply turned the royal outfits into a memory machine. The first time she put them on, she couldn't help but feel a lump in her heart and her eyes fill with tears, because at that moment she again perceived the smell of the boot polish of the soldier who came to her house to make her queen, and her soul crystallized with the nostalgia of lost dreams. She felt so old, so finished, so distant from the best hours of her life, that she even longed for those she remembered as the worst, and only then did she discover how much she missed the wafts of oregano in the corridor, the steam of the rose bushes at dusk, and even the bestial nature of the upstarts. Her heart of compacted ash, which had withstood the most accurate blows of daily reality without breaking, crumbled at the first onslaughts of nostalgia. The need to feel sad was becoming a vice as the years devastated her. She humanized in solitude. However, the morning she entered the kitchen and found a cup of coffee offered by a bony and pale adolescent, with a hallucinatory glow in his eyes, she was torn by the sting of ridicule. Not only did she deny him permission, but from then on she carried the house keys in the bag where she kept her unused pessaries. It was a useless precaution, because if Aureliano had wanted to, he could have escaped and even returned home without being seen. But the prolonged captivity, the uncertainty of the world, the habit of obedience, had dried up the seeds of rebellion in his heart. So he returned to his seclusion, going over and over the parchments, and listening until very late at night to Fernanda's sobs in the bedroom. One morning, as usual, he went to light the stove and found in the extinguished ashes the food he had left for her the previous day. Then he peeked into the bedroom and saw her lying on the bed, covered with the ermine cape, more beautiful than ever, and with her skin turned into an ivory shell. Four months later, when José Arcadio arrived, he found her intact.",49.334,49.276
763,"It was impossible to conceive of a man more like his mother. He was wearing a somber taffeta suit, a shirt with a round and hard collar, and a thin silk ribbon tied in a bow in place of a necktie. He was ruddy and languid with a startled look and weak lips. His black hair, shiny and smooth, parted in the middle of his head by a straight and tired line, had the same artificial appearance as the hair on the saints. The shadow of a well-uprooted beard on his paraffin face looked like a question of conscience. His hands were pale, with green veins and fingers that were like parasites, and he wore a solid gold ring with a round sunflower opal on his left index finger. When he opened the street door Aureliano did not have to be told who he was to realize that he came from far away. With his steps the house filled up with the fragrance of the toilet water that Úrsula used to splash on him when he was a child in order to find him in the shadows, in some way impossible to ascertain, after so many years of absence. José Arcadio was still an autumnal child, terribly sad and solitary. He went directly to his mother’s bedroom, where Aureliano had boiled mercury for four months in his grandfather’s grandfather’s water pipe to conserve the body according to Melquíades’ formula. José Arcadio did not ask him any questions. He kissed the corpse on the forehead and withdrew from under her skirt the pocket of casing which contained three as yet unused pessaries and the key to her cabinet. He did everything with direct and decisive movements, in contrast to his languid look. From the cabinet he took a small damascene chest with the family crest and found on the inside, which was perfumed with sandalwood, the long letter in which Fernanda unburdened her heart of the numerous truths that she had hidden from him. He read it standing up, avidly but without anxiety, and at the third page he stopped and examined Aureliano with a look of second recognition.","There was no one who resembled their mother more than José Arcadio. He wore a black silk ceremonial suit, a stiff round-collared shirt, and a soft silk ribbon instead of a tie. He was a pale, debilitated young man, with tired eyes and a weak mouth. His black, shiny, and smooth hair was parted by a straight, pale line running down the middle, resembling the hair of saints often seen in paintings and statues. The shadow of a beard that had been shaved on his wax-like face was a sign of his maturity. His pallid hands with blue veins, fingers like worms, and a large gold ring with a gemstone on the index finger of his left hand. When opening the gate for José Arcadio, Aureliano didn't need to guess who it was; he knew this was someone from afar. When José Arcadio entered, the house was filled with the scent of the perfume that Úrsula had sprinkled on his head when he was a child so that the old woman, in her blindness, could recognize her grandson. It was incomprehensible why, after so many years away, José Arcadio was still an old-before-his-time boy, profoundly sad and lonely. José Arcadio went straight to his mother's room, where Aureliano had followed Melquíades' method: evaporating mercury for four months in the tube of their six-generation ancestor to preserve the body. José Arcadio did not ask a single question. He kissed the forehead of the corpse, then took a small bag from under his robe containing three unused uterine rings and a wardrobe lock. He did all these things decisively, in stark contrast to his usual weakness. José Arcadio took a small box adorned with a coat of arms from the wardrobe, and in that box, fragrant with cedarwood, he found a very long letter in which Fernanda had poured out countless truths she had kept hidden. He stood reading the letter with great eagerness but without any anxiety, stopping at the third page to look at Aureliano with a slightly indifferent expression.",17.357,17.026,"It was inconceivable that any man could resemble his mother as much as Jose Arcadio did. Jose Arcadio was wearing a taffeta suit, a shirt with a round and stiff collar, and instead of a tie, he had tied a thin silk ribbon. He had pink cheeks, timid eyes, and thin lips. His shiny, straight, black hair, parted in the middle with a weary line, gave him an artificial look, like the wigs of saint statues. The shadow of the well-polished beard on his waxy face spread like a pang of conscience. He had white hands with green-veined, leech-like fingers, and he wore a gold ring with a round, yellow opal stone on the index finger of his left hand. When Aureliano opened the street door, he didn't need to know who the man in front of him was to understand that he had come from very far away. As Jose Arcadio stepped over the threshold, the scent of the cologne that Ursula had sprinkled on him in his childhood to distinguish him filled the house. After so many years of separation, Jose Arcadio was still inexplicably like a withered child. He was as melancholic and as introverted as could be. He went straight to his mother's bedroom, the room where Aureliano had been boiling mercury in his great-grandfather's still for four months to preserve the corpse, following Melquiades' formula. Jose Arcadio did not ask Aureliano any questions. He kissed the corpse on the forehead, then took out three unused pesetas and the keys to the cupboard from under his mother's skirt. Contrary to his absent-minded appearance, his movements were precise and determined. He took out a steel box with the family crest engraved on it from the cupboard. In the sandalwood-scented box, there was a long letter in which Fernanda had listed a heap of truths she had kept hidden from him. Jose Arcadio was reading the letter standing up, quickly but without excitement. When he got to the third page, he stopped and scrutinized Aureliano from head to toe as if seeing him for the first time.",22.241,21.956,"It was impossible to conceive of a man more like his mother. He wore a mournful taffeta suit, a shirt with a round and stiff collar, and a thin silk ribbon with a bow, instead of a tie. He was pale, languid, with a bewildered look and weak lips.

The shadow of the well-trimmed beard on his paraffin face seemed a matter of conscience. He had pale hands, with green veins and parasitic fingers, and a solid gold ring with a round sunflower opal on his left index finger. When he opened the street door for him, Aureliano wouldn't have needed to guess who he was to realize he came from far away. The house was imbued with the fragrance of Florida water as he passed, which Úrsula used to pour on his head when he was a child, so she could find him in the dark. In some impossible-to-define way, after so many years of absence, José Arcadio was still an autumnal child, terribly sad and lonely.

767,"Aureliano went and did not come out again even from curiosity when he heard the sound of the solitary funeral ceremonies. Sometimes, from the kitchen, he would see José Arcadio strolling through the house, smothered by his anxious breathing, and he continued hearing his steps in the ruined bedrooms after midnight. He did not hear his voice for many months, not only because José Arcadio never addressed him, but also because he had no desire for it to happen or time to think about anything else but the parchments. On Fernanda’s death he had taken out the next-to-the-last little fish and gone to the wise Catalonian’s bookstore in search of the books he needed. Nothing he saw along the way interested him, perhaps because he lacked any memories for comparison and the deserted streets and desolate houses were the same as he had imagined them at a time when he would have given his soul to know them. He had given himself the permission denied by Fernanda and only once and for the minimum time necessary, so without pausing he went along the eleven blocks that separated the house from the narrow street where dreams had been interpreted in other days and he went panting into the confused and gloomy place where there was barely room to move. More than a bookstore, it looked like a dump for used books, which were placed in disorder on the shelves chewed by termites, in the corners sticky with cobwebs, and even in the spaces that were supposed to serve as passageways. On a long table, also heaped with old books and papers, the proprietor was writing tireless prose in purple letters, somewhat outlandish, and on the loose pages of a school notebook. He had a handsome head of silver hair which fell down over his forehead like the plume of a cockatoo, and his blue eyes, lively and close-set, revealed the gentleness of a man who had read all of the books. He was wearing short pants and soaking in perspiration, and he did not stop his writing to see who had come in. Aureliano had no difficulty in rescuing the five books that he was looking for from that fabulous disorder, because they were exactly where Melquíades had told him they would be. Without saying a word he handed them, along with the little gold fish, to the wise Catalonian and the latter examined them, his eyelids contracting like two clams. “You must be mad,” he said in his own language, shrugging his shoulders, and he handed back to Aureliano the five books and the little fish.","Aureliano went to his room and did not leave it again, even when he heard the noise of the lonely funeral, he did not step out out of curiosity. Occasionally, from the kitchen, Aureliano saw José Arcadio pacing around the house, succumbing to his breath full of lustful desire, and until well past midnight, he still followed the sound of José Arcadio's footsteps in the dilapidated bedrooms. For many months, Aureliano did not hear José Arcadio's voice, not only because he did not speak to him, but also because he did not want anything to happen and did not want to waste time thinking about anything other than those leather hides. When Fernanda died, Aureliano took what was almost the last golden fish and went to the bookstore of the wise man from Catalonia to buy the books he needed. On the way, Aureliano paid no attention to what his eyes saw, perhaps because he had no memories of them to compare, and the deserted streets and dull houses were no different from the streets and houses he had imagined before, when he still longed to get to know them. Aureliano allowed himself to do what Fernanda had forbidden, for the first and only time, and for a very short period, he walked straight through the eleven blocks separating his house from the street where people used to tell fortunes, and with great difficulty, he entered a grimy, dark, and cramped place where it seemed impossible to turn around. The house did not resemble a bookstore but rather a junkyard with old books scattered on worm-eaten shelves, in cobweb-filled corners, and even in what should have been walkways. On a long table also piled with books, the owner was writing a lengthy essay with elaborate and somewhat convoluted letters on loose sheets torn from a school notebook. He had beautiful silver hair that jutted out over his forehead, resembling the crest of a jay; his blue, lively, and narrow eyes exuded the kindness of someone who had read all sorts of books. He wore sweat-soaked shorts and did not stop writing to see who had come in. Aureliano easily found the five books he needed among the chaotic pile because they were exactly where Melquíades had told him they would be. Without saying a word, Aureliano handed the wise old man from Catalonia the five books and the golden fish; the old man examined them, his eyebrows furrowing like two caterpillars. ""Maybe you're crazy,"" the old man said in his local language, shrugging his shoulders, then handed back to Aureliano five books and the golden fish.",24.892,24.693,"Aureliano went to his room and didn't even bother to look out when he heard the preparations for the funeral. Sometimes, while he was in the kitchen, he would hear Jose Arcadio wandering around the house, breathing heavily, and after midnight, the sound of footsteps coming from the now dilapidated bedrooms. Aureliano didn't hear his voice for months. Just as Jose Arcadio didn't speak to him, Aureliano, who had devoted all his attention to the manuscripts, wasn't inclined to talk either. When Fernanda died, he had taken the penultimate fish and had gone to the Catalonian's shop in the hope of finding the books he was looking for. Perhaps because he lacked memories to make a comparison, nothing he saw on the road interested him. The deserted streets and empty houses were exactly as Aureliano had imagined them when he once longed to see the world. Aureliano had granted himself the permission he couldn't get from Fernanda, on the condition that it was a one-time exception and that he wouldn't exceed the necessary time for his task. That's why he quickly passed through the eleven street corners between the narrow street where dreams were interpreted in the old days and the house without pausing, and breathlessly reached the cluttered and dim shop that seemed to have no room to move. This place looked more like a warehouse where old books were piled up than a bookstore. Books were stacked even on the worm-eaten shelves, the sticky cobwebbed corners, and the so-called spaces left for passage. The shop owner was once again sitting at a long table piled with old books and papers, writing incomprehensible notes with purple ink on sheets torn from a school notebook. He was a handsome man with silver-colored hair falling over his forehead like a parrot's crest. In his close-set, lively eyes, there was an expression as if he had read all the books. He was wearing shorts. Sweat was trickling down from every part of him. He didn't even stop writing to see who had entered. Aureliano found the five books he was looking for in this dizzying confusion as if he had placed them there himself, because the books were exactly where Melquiades had said they would be. Without saying a word, Aureliano handed the books and the small goldfish to the wise Catalonian. The man, squinting his eyes like two seashells, looked at the books and the fish, then shrugged his shoulders saying in his own language, ""You must have lost your mind,"" and handed the five books and the fish back to Aureliano.",20.565,20.319,"Aureliano left, and did not go out again even out of curiosity when he heard the rumor of the solitary funerals. Sometimes, from the kitchen, he saw José Arcadio wandering around the house, suffocating in his longing breath, and he continued to hear his steps through the ruined bedrooms after midnight. He did not hear his voice for many months, not only because José Arcadio did not speak to him, but because he had no desire for it to happen, nor time to think about anything other than the parchments.

More than a bookstore, it seemed like a dump of used books, placed in disorder on the shelves gnawed by termites, in the corners webbed with cobwebs, and even in the spaces that should have been intended for the passageways. On a long table, also burdened with tomes, the owner wrote an inexhaustible prose, with a purple, somewhat delirious handwriting, on loose sheets of school notebook paper. He had a beautiful silver mane that fell forward on his forehead like the crest of a cockatoo, and his blue, lively, narrow eyes revealed the meekness of a man who has read all the books. He was in his underwear, drenched in sweat, and did not stop writing to see who had arrived. Aureliano had no difficulty rescuing from that fabled disorder the five books he was looking for, as they were in the exact place Melquíades had indicated. Without saying a word, he handed them along with the little gold fish to the wise Catalonian, and he examined them, and his eyelids contracted like two clams. “You must be crazy,” he said in his language, shrugging, and returned the five books and the little fish to Aureliano.",48.113,47.997

769,"José Arcadio restored Meme’s bedroom and had the velvet curtains cleaned and mended along with the damask on the canopy of the viceregal bed, and he put to use once more the abandoned bathroom where the cement pool was blackened by a fibrous and rough coating. He restricted his vest-pocket empire of worn, exotic clothing, false perfumes, and cheap jewelry to those places. The only thing that seemed to worry him in the rest of the house were the saints on the family altar, which he burned down to ashes one afternoon in a bonfire he lighted in the courtyard. He would sleep until past eleven o’clock. He would go to the bathroom in a shabby robe with golden dragons on it and a pair of slippers with yellow tassels, and there he would officiate at a rite which for its care and length recalled Remedios the Beauty. Before bathing he would perfume the pool with the salts that he carried in three alabaster flacons. He did not bathe himself with the gourd but would plunge into the fragrant waters and remain there for two hours floating on his back, lulled by the coolness and by the memory of Amaranta. A few days after arriving he put aside his taffeta suit, which in addition to being too hot for the town was the only one that he had, and he exchanged it for some tight-fitting pants very similar to those worn by Pietro Crespi during his dance lessons and a silk shirt woven with thread from living caterpillars and with his initials embroidered over the heart. Twice a week he would wash the complete change in the tub and would wear his robe until it dried because he had nothing else to put on. He never ate at home. He would go out when the heat of siesta time had eased and would not return until well into the night. Then he would continue his anxious pacing, breathing like a cat and thinking about Amaranta. She and the frightful look of the saints in the glow of the nocturnal lamp were the two memories he retained of the house. Many times during the hallucinating Roman August he had opened his eyes in the middle of his sleep and had seen Amaranta rising out of a marble-edged pool with her lace petticoats and the bandage on her hand, idealized by the anxiety of exile. Unlike Aureliano José who tried to drown that image in the bloody bog of war, he tried to keep it alive in the sink of concupiscence while he entertained his mother with the endless fable of his pontifical vocation. It never occurred either to him or to Fernanda to think that their correspondence was an exchange of fantasies. José Arcadio, who left the seminary as soon as he reached Rome, continued nourishing the legend of theology and canon law so as not to jeopardize the fabulous inheritance of which his mother’s delirious letters spoke and which would rescue him from the misery and sordidness he shared with two friends in a Trastevere garret. When he received Fernanda’s last letter, dictated by the foreboding of imminent death, he put the leftovers of his false splendor into a suitcase and crossed the ocean in the hold of a ship where immigrants were crammed together like cattle in a slaughterhouse, eating cold macaroni and wormy cheese. Before he read Fernanda’s will, which was nothing but a detailed and tardy recapitulation of her misfortunes, the broken-down furniture and the weeds on the porch had indicated that he had fallen into a trap from which he would never escape, exiled forever from the diamond light and timeless air of the Roman spring. During the crushing insomnia brought on by his asthma he would measure and remeasure the depth of his misfortune as he went through the shadowy house where the senile fussing of Úrsula had instilled a fear of the world in him. In order to be sure that she would not lose him in the shadows, she had assigned him a corner of the bedroom, the only one where he would be safe from the dead people who wandered through the house after sundown. “If you do anything bad,” Úrsula would tell him, “the saints will let me know.” The terror-filled nights of his childhood were reduced to that corner where he would remain motionless until it was time to go to bed, perspiring with fear on a stool under the watchful and glacial eyes of the tattletale saints. It was useless torture because even at that time he already had a terror of everything around him and he was prepared to be frightened at anything he met in life: women on the street, who would ruin his blood; the women in the house, who bore children with the tail of a pig; fighting cocks, who brought on the death of men and remorse for the rest of one’s life; firearms, which with the mere touch would bring down twenty years of war; uncertain ventures, which led only to disillusionment and madness—everything, in short, everything that God had created in His infinite goodness and that the devil had perverted. When he awakened, pressed in the vise of his nightmares, the light in the window and the caresses of Amaranta in the bath and the pleasure of being powdered between the legs with a silk puff would release him from the terror. Even Úrsula was different under the radiant light in the garden because there she did not talk about fearful things but would brush his teeth with charcoal powder so that he would have the radiant smile of a Pope, and she would cut and polish his nails so that the pilgrims who came to Rome from all over the world would be startled at the beauty of the Pope’s hands as he blessed them, and she would comb his hair like that of a Pope, and she would sprinkle his body and his clothing with toilet water so that his body and his clothes would have the fragrance of a Pope. In the courtyard of Castel Gandolfo he had seen the Pope on a balcony making the same speech in seven languages for a crowd of pilgrims and the only thing, indeed, that had drawn his attention was the whiteness of his hands, which seemed to have been soaked in lye, the dazzling shine of his summer clothing, and the hidden breath of cologne.","Hose Accadio repaired Meme's bedroom, ordering it to be cleaned, fixing the velvet curtains and the brocade canopy in front of the viceroy's bed, and reusing the abandoned bathroom where the cement water tank had turned black from thick and dirty water scum. In those two rooms, the arrogance of the furnishings, the foreign goods, the fake perfumes, and the cheap jewelry had significantly diminished. The only thing in the rest of the house that bothered Hose Accadio was the holy statues on the altar, so one afternoon he burned them to ashes in a fire he lit in the yard. Hose Accadio slept past eleven o'clock. He entered the bathroom wearing a loose house robe adorned with red dragon embroidery and yellow-trimmed slippers; there, while slowly and lengthily praying, he thought of Remedios the Beauty. Before bathing, Hose Accadio used salts stored in three marbled stone jars to scent the water. Instead of using a gourd ladle to pour water over himself, he immersed himself in the fragrant water, lying on his back for two hours, daydreaming in the coolness and reminiscing about Amaranta. A few days after returning, Hose Accadio abandoned his black silk suit, not only because of the heat but also because he was the only one who had such a suit here. Instead, he wore breeches similar to those Pietro Crespi wore during dance lessons and a silk shirt embroidered with his initials on the chest. Twice a week, he washed all his clothes, and while waiting for them to dry, he wore a loose house outfit because he had no other clothes. Hose Accadio never ate at home. He left the house when the midday heat began to wane and returned late at night. Then he would continue to pace around sadly, breathing like a cat, and thinking of Amaranta. She and the terrified gaze of the saint in the night lamp's light were the only memories he had of this house. Many times, during the strange August in Rome, Hose Accadio would wake up in the middle of a dream and see Amaranta emerging from the marble water tank, wearing a thin dress and a black band on her arm, idealized by the sorrow of an exile. While Aureliano Jose tried to drown that image in the bloody mud of war, Hose Accadio, on the contrary, tried to keep it alive in the mire of desire, while pleasing his mother with the deceit of wanting to become a Pope. Neither Hose Accadio nor Fernanda ever thought that their letters to each other were exchanges of fantastical fabrications. Having dropped out of specialized classes shortly after arriving in Rome, Hose Accadio continued to read books on theology and monastic law to avoid jeopardizing the large inheritance his mother often mentioned in her tempting letters, which could free him from the poor and filthy life he shared with two friends in an attic in Trastevere. When Hose Accadio received Fernanda's last letter, written with a premonition of impending death, he gathered the last pieces of his fake jewelry, packed them in a suitcase, and boarded a ship to cross the ocean, where immigrants were packed like cattle in a slaughterhouse, eating maggot-infested pasta and cheese. Before reading Fernanda's will—a fragmented and belated summary of misfortunes—the dilapidated furniture and the weeds in the corridor had already shown Hose Accadio that he had fallen into a trap from which he could never escape, pushed out of the diamond glow and the ancient spring atmosphere of Rome. During sleepless nights, exhausted by asthma, Hose Accadio measured the depth of his misfortune and rummaged through the dark house, where Ursula's old screams had once made him fear the outside world. To ensure little Hose Accadio didn't get lost in the fog, Ursula had once made him stay fixed in a corner of the bedroom, his only place, while the dead would roam the house from dusk. ""Any bad deed you do, the saints will tell me,"" Ursula had told him. The terrifying childhood nights of Hose Accadio had condensed in that corner, where he had to sit motionless on a chair until bedtime, sweating with fear under the vigilant and cold gaze of the tattling saints. That punishment was futile because, back then, Hose Accadio was already afraid of everything around him and was prepared to be startled by anything he would encounter in life: women in society who disobeyed their parents would hemorrhage; women in this family who weren't careful would give birth to pig-tailed children; fighting cocks would bring death to men and torment to others' consciences; guns that merely touching would condemn one to twenty years of war; misguided endeavors that only led to disappointment and madness; all, all things that God had created with infinite charity had been corrupted by the devil. The light from the window, the sound of Amaranta scrubbing in the bath, and the pleasurable sensation of the ""silk potato"" on his legs all freed Hose Accadio from the terror that had once left him dazed with fear upon waking. Even Ursula seemed different under the radiant garden light because there, she didn't tell him terrifying stories but instead polished his teeth with charcoal powder so he would have the radiant smile of a Pope, cut and smoothed his nails so that pilgrims coming to Rome from all over the world would marvel at the purity of the Pope's hands when he blessed them, styled his hair like a Pope, and sprayed him with perfume so his body and clothes would exude the fragrance of a Pope. In the courtyard of Castel Gandolfo, Hose Accadio had seen the Pope on the balcony, delivering a speech in seven languages to a crowd of pilgrims, and indeed, Hose Accadio only paid attention to the immaculate whiteness of the Pope's powder-dipped hands, the brilliance of his summer attire, and the mysterious fragrance of his perfume.",21.909,21.821,"Jose Arcadio fixed up Meme's room, having the silk canopy of the bed fit for kings cleaned and repaired, and the velvet curtains adjusted. He reopened the unused bathroom where the cement tub had become encrusted with lime. He got rid of his old exotic clothes, fake perfumes, and cheap jewelry, spending all his money solely on the repairs. The only thing that concerned him in the other parts of the house were the statues of saints lined up in the altar. He threw them into a fire he lit in the garden one day and burned them to ashes. He slept until eleven in the morning. Then, putting on an old robe embroidered with golden dragons and slippers with yellow pompoms, he would go to the bathroom and stay there long enough to remind one of the Beautiful Remedios, bathing with great care. Before entering the bathroom, he would pour the scented powders he carried in three jars made of marble into the bathtub, which was the size of a pool. He didn't pour water with a gourd, but instead, he would dive into the scented waters of the pool-like bathtub, lie on his back for two hours, and enjoy the coolness while thinking about Amaranta. A few days after her arrival, she took off the taffeta dress, her only garment, which was unsuitable for the town's heat. Instead, she started wearing a tight pair of pants very similar to those worn by Pietro Crespi during his dance lessons, and a silk shirt made from vibrant cocoon silk, with her initials embroidered over her heart. Twice a week, she would take off her clothes, press them into a basin and wash them, and since she had nothing else to wear, she would wait in her bathrobe until they dried. He wasn't eating his meals at home. When the midday heat subsided, he would go out and return late at night. Then, like a cat, he would start prowling around the room, hissing and panting, and circling Amaranta. The memory that remained from home was only the memory of Amaranta and the statues of saints with their terrifying appearance in the light of the night lamp. In the August heat of Rome that drove people to dreams, he had woken up countless times in the middle of his sleep, and in a glorification stemming from being far away, he had seemed to see Amaranta, with her lace petticoats and the bandage on her wrist, emerging from a marble-edged pool. Unlike Aureliano Jose, who tried to drown the image of Amaranta in the bloody mire of war, Jose Arcadio, while distracting his mother with tales of divine service, also tried to keep this image alive in the pit of lust. Neither he nor Fernanda knew that the letters they wrote to each other were filled with mutual lies. As soon as he arrived in Rome, Jose Arcadio, who had abandoned the faculty of theology, continued the tale of theology and canon law to avoid jeopardizing the legendary inheritance that would rescue him from the poverty mentioned in his mother's letters, which he shared with two friends in an attic in Trastevere. Upon receiving Fernanda's last letter, written as she was dying, he packed whatever remained of his ostentatious luxury into a suitcase and crossed the ocean in the hold of a ship filled with immigrants crammed together like sheep in a slaughterhouse, eating cold pasta and worm-infested cheese. Even before reading Fernanda's will, which was nothing more than a pretentious account of her sufferings and misfortunes, Jose Arcadio realized, upon seeing the broken furniture and the weeds covering the veranda, how he had been swindled, how he had fallen into a trap from which he would never escape, and that he would never again see the time-forgetting air and the brilliant sunshine of a Roman spring. During the sleepless nights caused by his asthma, he wandered around the dark house, filled with fears by Ursula's senile words, constantly pondering the nature of the misfortune that had befallen him. To prevent losing Jose Arcadio in the darkness, Ursula had designated a specific corner of the bedroom for him and had not allowed him to leave this corner, the only place where he could stay away from the dead that filled the house after sunset. Ursula used to say, ""If you do something bad, the saints will inform me."" Jose Arcadio's fear-filled nights were spent in that corner, where he would curl up on a stool, sweating and trembling with fear under the glassy gaze of the saints until bedtime. This was an unnecessary torture. Because Jose Arcadio was already a child who was afraid of everything around him and ready to be frightened by everything he would encounter in life. His head was filled with a heap of horrors. They had taught him to fear everything created by God's infinite goodness and twisted by the devil's malice: the women on the street who would suck his blood, the women at home who bore children with pig tails, the cockfights that brought death to men and left the survivors in lifelong agony, the weapons that could start twenty-year wars with a single touch, the unknown adventures that led to disappointment and madness. On the mornings after nights when the devil entered his nightmares, the daylight and Amaranta's caresses in the bath, the comfort of the powder sprinkled between his legs, would dispel the fear he had felt at night. Even Ursula would become completely different under the bright sun in the garden. Because when she was in the garden, she wouldn't talk about terrible things; she would take Jose Arcadio in front of her and rub his teeth with coal dust so that when he grew up and smiled, he would have bright teeth worthy of the Pope. She would cut and file his nails so that pilgrims flocking to Rome from all corners of the world would admire the beauty of the Pope's hands that blessed them. She would comb his hair in a manner befitting the Pope and sprinkle cologne on him so that his body and clothes would smell like the Pope's. When Jose Arcadio was in Rome, he had gone to the garden of Castel Gandolfo, and the only thing that caught the Pope's attention, who was making the same speech in seven different languages from the balcony to the crowd of pilgrims gathered there, was indeed the whiteness of his hands that looked as if they had been soaked in ash water, the dazzling brightness of his summer clothes, and his breath that absolutely smelled of cologne.",22.502,22.415,"José Arcadio restored Meme's bedroom, had the velvet curtains and the damask of the viceroyal bed canopy cleaned and mended, and put the abandoned bathroom back into service, whose cement pool was blackened by a fibrous and rough scum. His empire of trinkets, worn exotic fabrics, fake perfumes, and cheap jewelry was reduced to those two places. The only thing that seemed to bother him in the rest of the house were the saints of the home altar, which he burned to ashes one afternoon in a bonfire he lit in the patio. He slept until after eleven. He went to the bathroom in a frayed tunic with golden dragons and slippers with yellow tassels, and there he performed a ritual that, due to its slowness and duration, reminded one of Remedios the Beautiful. Before bathing, he scented the pool with salts he carried in three alabaster jars. He did not perform ablutions with the totuma but instead immersed himself in the fragrant waters, staying for up to two hours floating on his back, lulled by the coolness and the memory of Amaranta. A few days after arriving, he abandoned the taffeta dress, which besides being too hot for the town was the only one he had, and changed into tight pants, very similar to those Pietro Crespi wore in dance classes, and a silk shirt woven with live silk, with his initials embroidered over the heart. Twice a week he washed the entire outfit in the pool and stayed in the tunic until it dried, as he had nothing else to wear. He never ate at home. He went out into the street when the heat of the siesta subsided, and did not return until late at night. Then he continued his anguished wandering, breathing like a cat, and thinking of Amaranta. She, and the dreadful gaze of the saints in the glow of the night lamp, were the two memories he kept of the house. Many times, in the hallucinatory Roman August, he had opened his eyes in the middle of a dream and seen Amaranta emerging from a brocatelle marble pond, with her lace petticoats and her bandage in hand, idealized by the anxiety of exile. Unlike Aureliano José, who tried to stifle that image in the bloody swamp of war, he tried to keep it alive in a mire of lust, while entertaining his mother with the endless tale of his pontifical vocation. Neither he nor Fernanda ever thought that their correspondence was an exchange of fantasies. José Arcadio, who left the seminary as soon as he arrived in Rome, continued to feed the legend of theology and canon law, so as not to jeopardize the fabulous inheritance his mother's delirious letters spoke of, which was to rescue him from the misery and squalor he shared with two friends in an attic in Trastevere. When he received Fernanda's last letter, dictated by the premonition of imminent death, he packed the last remnants of his false splendor into a suitcase and crossed the ocean in a hold where emigrants were packed like slaughterhouse cattle, eating cold macaroni and wormy cheese. Before reading Fernanda's will, which was nothing more than a meticulous and belated recapitulation of misfortunes, the dilapidated furniture and the weeds in the corridor had already indicated to him that he was trapped in a snare from which he would never escape, forever exiled from the diamond light and the timeless air of the Roman spring. In the exhausting insomnias of asthma, he measured and remeasured the depth of his misfortune, while he reviewed the gloomy house where Úrsula's senile outbursts instilled in him the fear of the world. To be sure not to lose him in the darkness, she had assigned him a corner of the bedroom, the only place where he could be safe from the dead who wandered the house from dusk. ""Any bad thing you do,"" Úrsula told him, ""the saints will tell me. "" The fearful nights of his childhood were reduced to that corner, where he remained motionless until bedtime, sweating with fear on a stool, under the watchful and icy gaze of the tattling saints. It was a useless torture because by that time he was already terrified of everything around him and was prepared to be frightened by everything he encountered in life: the women of the street, who spoiled the blood; the women of the house, who bore children with pig tails; the fighting cocks, which caused men's deaths and lifelong remorse; the firearms, which condemned one to twenty years of war just by touching them; the ill-fated ventures, which only led to disappointment and madness, and everything, in short, everything that God had created with his infinite goodness, and that the devil had perverted. Upon waking, worn out by the mill of nightmares, the clarity of the window and Amaranta's caresses in the pool, and the delight with which she powdered him between the legs with a silk acorn, freed him from terror. Even Úrsula was different under the radiant light of the garden, because there she did not speak to him of fearful things, but rubbed his teeth with charcoal powder so that he would have the radiant smile of a Pope, and cut and polished his nails so that the pilgrims who came to Rome from all over the world would be amazed at the cleanliness of the Pope's hands when he blessed them, and combed him like a Pope, and soaked him with Florida water so that his body and clothes would have the fragrance of a Pope. In the courtyard of Castelgandolfo, he had seen the Pope on a balcony, delivering the same speech in seven languages to a crowd of pilgrims, and the only thing that had indeed caught his attention was the whiteness of his hands, which seemed macerated in lye, the dazzling brightness of his summer clothes, and his hidden breath of cologne.",44.668,44.619
770,"Almost a year after his return home, having sold the silver candlesticks and the heraldic chamberpot—which at the moment of truth turned out to have only a little gold plating on the crest—in order to eat, the only distraction of José Arcadio was to pick up children in town so that they could play in the house. He would appear with them at siesta time and have them skip rope in the garden, sing on the porch, and do acrobatics on the furniture in the living room while he would go among the groups giving lessons in good manners. At that time he had finished with the tight pants and the silk shirts and was wearing an ordinary suit of clothing that he had bought in the Arab stores, but he still maintained his languid dignity and his papal air. The children took over the house just as Meme’s schoolmates had done in the past. Until well into the night they could be heard chattering and singing and tap-dancing, so that the house resembled a boarding school where there was no discipline. Aureliano did not worry about the invasion as long as they did not bother him in Melquíades’ room. One morning two children pushed open the door and were startled at the sight of a filthy and hairy man who was still deciphering the parchments on the worktable. They did not dare go in, but they kept on watching the room. They would peep in through the cracks, whispering, they threw live animals in through the transom, and on one occasion they nailed up the door and the window and it took Aureliano half a day to force them open. Amused at their unpunished mischief, four of the children went into the room one morning while Aureliano was in the kitchen, preparing to destroy the parchments. But as soon as they laid hands on the yellowed sheets an angelic force lifted them off the ground and held them suspended in the air until Aureliano returned and took the parchments away from them. From then on they did not bother him.","About a year after returning home, in order to have money for food, José Arcadio sold all the silver candlesticks and the gold chamber pot inlaid with the family crest, which he only discovered at the last moment that only the inlays were actually gold. His only entertainment was gathering the village children to play at his house. He played with them from noon, making them jump rope in the garden, sing in the hallway, and tumble on the chairs in the living room, while he went from group to group teaching them lessons in good manners. By then, the tight pants and silk shirts were gone; José Arcadio wore old, shabby clothes bought from an Arab's store, but he still maintained his weak dignity and papal demeanor. The children invaded the house just as Meme's friends had done before. Late into the night, their shouts and dances made the house resemble an undisciplined daycare. Aureliano did not mind this invasion as long as the children did not disturb him in Melquíades' room. One morning, two children pushed open the door and were astonished to see a dirty, disheveled man translating parchments at the desk. They did not dare enter but continued to hover around the room, peeking and whispering through the cracks, throwing bugs at the round windows, and once they even nailed shut the doors and windows, causing Aureliano to spend half a day opening them. Delighted that their mischief went unpunished, one morning four children entered the room while Aureliano was in the kitchen and decided to destroy the yellowing parchments. But as soon as they grabbed the yellowed parchments, a divine force lifted them off the ground, holding them suspended in the air until Aureliano returned and reclaimed the parchments. From then on, the children no longer disturbed Aureliano.",24.674,24.436,"After a year had passed since his return home, Jose Arcadio's only solace, who had sold the silver candlesticks and the famous chamber pot - which was discovered to be thinly gold-plated at the time of sale - and squandered the money, was to gather the children from the street and let them play in the garden of the house. When nap time came, he would appear with a bunch of children, make them jump rope in the garden, sing songs on the veranda, perform acrobatics on the furniture in the living room, and he himself would move from one group to another teaching the children manners and etiquette. He had given up tight pants and silk shirts; he wore an ordinary outfit bought from the Arabs' shop, but he maintained his distant dignity and papal aura. The children invaded the house, just as Meme's classmates once did. They chatted, sang, and danced until late at night. The house took on the appearance of an undisciplined boarding school. Aureliano did not mind the children crowding into the house as long as they did not disturb him in Melquiades' room. One morning, two children opened the door of the room and were surprised to see a man with disheveled hair and beard, covered in dirt and grime, trying to tear apart manuscripts at the table. Although they did not dare to enter, they began to constantly watch the room. They were peeking through the cracks, whispering to each other, and throwing live animals inside through the window bars. Once, they even nailed the door and window shut. Aureliano had to struggle for half a day to open them. Encouraged by the lack of punishment for their mischief, four of the children burst into the room one morning while Aureliano was in the kitchen and prepared to tear the manuscripts. However, the moment they reached out their hands to the yellowed papers, a divine force lifted the children off the ground and held them in the air until Aureliano came and took the papers. From that day on, the children never bothered Aureliano again.",23.749,23.501,"Almost a year after returning home, having sold the silver candlesticks and the heraldic chamber pot to eat, which in the end only had gold in the shield's inlays, José Arcadio's only distraction was gathering children from the town to play in the house.

771,"The four oldest children, who wore short pants in spite of the fact that they were on the threshold of adolescence, busied themselves with José Arcadio’s personal appearance. They would arrive earlier than the others and spend the morning shaving him, giving him massages with hot towels, cutting and polishing the nails on his hands and feet, and perfuming him with toilet water. On several occasions they would get into the pool to soap him from head to toe as he floated on his back thinking about Amaranta. Then they would dry him, powder his body, and dress him. One of the children, who had curly blond hair and eyes of pink glass like a rabbit, was accustomed to sleeping in the house. The bonds that linked him to José Arcadio were so strong that he would accompany him in his asthmatic insomnia, without speaking, strolling through the house with him in the darkness. One night in the room where Úrsula had slept they saw a yellow glow coming through the crumbling cement as if an underground sun had changed the floor of the room into a pane of glass. They did not have to turn on the light. It was sufficient to lift the broken slabs in the corner where Úrsula’s bed had always stood and where the glow was most intense to find the secret crypt that Aureliano Segundo had worn himself out searching for during the delirium of his excavations.

Several times they bathed him, scrubbing José Arcadio from head to toe with soap, while he lay back in the water thinking about Amaranta. Afterwards, they dried him, powdered him all over, and dressed him. Among those children was one with brown curly hair and eyes like pinkish-brown glass, resembling the eyes of the sleeping figurine in the house. This child was very closely attached to José Arcadio, often staying by his side during sleepless nights caused by asthma, silently following him as he paced back and forth in the dim house. One night, through the clear cement, José Arcadio and the child saw a yellow light in Úrsula's bedroom, as if the sun had just risen from the ground, casting a glow that turned the floor into a frosted glass pane. They didn't need to search for the source of that light. Simply lifting the broken glass panels in the corner of the room, where Úrsula's bed was usually placed and where the light was most concentrated, revealed the secret vault that Aureliano Segundo had desperately searched for in his feverish excavations but never found. Inside the vault were three sacks tied with copper wire, containing seven thousand two hundred and fourteen doubloons, each worth four dollars, and these gold coins continued to glow like embers.",16.116,15.649,"The four oldest children, who were almost reaching puberty but still wore short pants, made it their task to emulate Jose Arcadio's appearance.

772,"The discovery of the treasure was like a deflagration. Instead of returning to Rome with the sudden fortune, which had been his dream maturing in misery, José Arcadio converted the house into a decadent paradise. He replaced the curtains and the canopy of the bed with new velvet, and he had the bathroom floor covered with paving stones and the walls with tiles. The cupboard in the dining room was filled with fruit preserves, hams, and pickles, and the unused pantry was opened again for the storage of wines and liqueurs which José Arcadio himself brought from the railroad station in crates marked with his name. One night he and the four oldest children had a party that lasted until dawn. At six in the morning they came out naked from the bedroom, drained the pool, and filled it with champagne. They jumped in en masse, swimming like birds flying through a sky gilded with fragrant bubbles, while José Arcadio, floated on his back on the edge of the festivities, remembering Amaranta with his eyes open. He remained that way, wrapped up in himself, thinking about the bitterness of his equivocal pleasures until after the children had become tired and gone in a troop to the bedroom. where they tore down the curtains to dry themselves, and in the disorder they broke the rock crystal mirror into four pieces and destroyed the canopy of the bed in the tumult of lying down. When José Arcadio came back from the bathroom, he found them sleeping in a naked heap in the shipwrecked bedroom. Inflamed, not so much because of the damage as because of the disgust and pity that he felt for himself in the emptiness of the saturnalia, he armed himself with an ecclesiastical cat-o-nine-tails that he kept in the bottom of his trunk along with a hair-shirt and other instruments of mortification and penance, and drove the children out of the house, howling like a madman and whipping them without mercy as a person would not even have done to a pack of coyotes. He was done in, with an attack of asthma that lasted for several days and that gave him the look of a man on his deathbed. On the third night of torture, overcome by asphyxiation, he went to Aureliano’s room to ask him the favor of buying some powders to inhale at a nearby drugstore. So it was that Aureliano, went out for a second time. He had to go only two blocks to reach the small pharmacy with dusty windows and ceramic bottles with labels in Latin where a girl with the stealthy beauty of a serpent of the Nile gave him the medicine the name of which José Arcadio had written down on a piece of paper. The second view of the deserted town, barely illuminated by the yellowish bulbs of the street lights, did not awaken in Aureliano any more curiosity than the first. José Arcadio, had come to think that he had run away, when he reappeared, panting a little because of his haste, dragging legs that enclosure and lack of mobility had made weak and heavy. His indifference toward the world was so certain that a few days later José Arcadio violated the promise he had made to his mother and left him free to go out whenever he wanted to.","Finding the treasure was like a burst of flame. Instead of returning to Rome with an off-season fortune - a long-cherished dream in the midst of poverty - José Arcadio turned the house into a paradise on earth. He replaced the window curtains and the bedroom canopy with new velvet, had the bathroom floor tiled, and the walls covered with colored tiles. The cupboard in the dining room was filled with sweet fruits, ham, and fruit preserved in wine; the grain storage, long unused, was now opened to store the wines that José Arcadio himself fetched from the train station, packed in boxes bearing his name. One night, José Arcadio and the four eldest children held a party that lasted until dawn. At six in the morning, they came out of the bedroom naked, emptied the bathtub, and filled it with champagne. They frolicked, diving and swimming in it like birds flying in a golden sky full of fragrant bubbles, while José Arcadio did not join in their fun but lay floating on his back, eyes wide open, reminiscing about Amaranta. José Arcadio lay there, pondering and reliving the bitterness of past pleasures, until the children, exhausted, rushed into the bedroom, where they tore down the velvet curtains to dry themselves, breaking a mirror into four pieces in the chaos, and ripped the bed sheets as they crowded in to sleep. When José Arcadio returned from the bathroom, he found them lying naked, sleeping huddled together in the stifling room. He was annoyed, less by their destruction and more by his own disgust and pity for himself in the empty, dull aftermath of debauchery. He grabbed the priest's dog-chasing stick, which was kept at the bottom of a chest with other church punishment tools, and drove them out of the house, shouting like a madman and beating them mercilessly. José Arcadio collapsed from an asthma attack that lasted several days, looking like a dying man. On the third night, unable to bear the suffocation, José Arcadio went to Aureliano's room to ask him to buy some powder medicine from a nearby pharmacy to clear his airways. Thus, Aureliano left the house for the second time. He only needed to walk two blocks to reach a pharmacy with dusty glass cabinets containing jars labeled in Latin; there, a girl with the mysterious beauty of a Nile River snake sold him the medicine José Arcadio had written on paper. Seeing the deserted streets for the second time, now bathed in the yellow light of street lamps, Aureliano was no more curious than before. When José Arcadio thought Aureliano had run away, he saw him return, slightly out of breath from hurrying, dragging his weak and slow legs due to confinement and lack of activity. Aureliano's indifference to the outside world was so evident that a few days later, when José Arcadio did not keep his promise to his mother and allowed Aureliano to go wherever he wanted, Aureliano replied:",24.862,24.709,"The discovery of the treasure exploded like a fire breaking out unexpectedly. When Jose Arcadio suddenly came into wealth, instead of returning to Rome as he had dreamed during his days of poverty, he turned his house into a paradise for the destitute. She bought new velvets for the curtains and the canopy of the bed, laid mosaic on the bathroom floors, and tiled the walls. The buffet in the dining room overflowed with fruit preserves, hams, and pickles. The long-unused pantry was reopened, and it was stocked with various wines and liquors that Jose Arcadio had carried from the station in crates bearing his name. One night, Jose Arcadio and the four eldest children had a party that lasted until dawn. At six in the morning, they emerged from the room completely naked, emptied the pool of its water, and filled it with champagne. Then they all jumped into the pool together and began swimming like birds flying in the sky, covered in fragrant bubbles. Jose Arcadio did not partake in this exuberance; he lay on his back in the water, dreaming of Amaranta. Until the children got tired and all went to the room together, Jose Arcadio remained withdrawn like this, pondering over indistinct pleasures. In the meantime, the children pulled down the curtains to dry themselves, and while running around, they broke the large crystal mirror into four pieces; while saying they were going to bed, they tore the canopy of the bed. When Jose Arcadio came out of the bathroom, he found the children, completely naked, sleeping in a heap in the room that had turned into a disaster area. More than the breaking and shattering of things, he was overcome with anger due to the pity and disgust he felt for himself in the emptiness of this revelry. He took out the hair shirt, the nine-knotted whip, and other instruments of remorse and punishment that he had hidden at the bottom of the chest. Then, shouting like a madman and with a ruthless ferocity that one wouldn't even show while chasing a pack of jackals, he whipped the children and drove them out of the house. Then he had an asthma attack. The attack, which lasted a few days, gave Jose Arcadio the appearance of someone on their deathbed. On the third night of this torment, unable to bear the coughing and breathlessness, he went to Aureliano's room and asked him to get a powder from the nearby pharmacy that would open his breath. Thus, Aureliano went out into the street for the second time. After crossing two streets, he entered the small pharmacy with dusty windows lined with bottles labeled in Latin and got the medicine, whose name Jose Arcadio had written on a piece of paper, from the salesgirl who had the beauty of a Nile serpent. Seeing the deserted town, barely illuminated by the yellow bulbs of the street lamps, for the second time did not arouse more interest in Aureliano than the first. When Aureliano arrived, dragging his weakened and sluggish legs from being constantly confined and inactive, out of breath, Jose Arcadio had already lost hope of his return and had begun to think he had escaped. Aureliano was so indifferent to the world that a few days later, Jose Arcadio broke the promise he had made to his mother and gave Aureliano permission to go out whenever he wanted.",27.152,27.012,"The discovery of the treasure was like a deflagration. Instead of returning to Rome with the sudden fortune, which was the dream matured in misery, José Arcadio turned the house into a decadent paradise. He replaced the curtains and the canopy of the bedroom with new velvet, and had the bathroom floor tiled and the walls covered with tiles. The dining room cupboard was filled with candied fruits, hams, and pickles, and the disused granary was reopened to store wines and liquors that José Arcadio himself retrieved from the railway station in boxes marked with his name. One night, he and the four older children threw a party that lasted until dawn. At six in the morning, they came out of the bedroom naked, emptied the pool, and filled it with champagne. They dove in flocks, swimming like birds flying in a golden sky of fragrant bubbles, while José Arcadio floated on his back, on the fringe of the party, evoking Amaranta with his eyes open. He remained like that, absorbed, ruminating the bitterness of his equivocal pleasures, until after the children got tired and went in a rush to the bedroom, where they tore down the velvet curtains to dry themselves, shattered the rock crystal moon in the chaos, and dismantled the bed canopy trying to lie down in a tumult. When José Arcadio returned from the bathroom, he found them sleeping huddled together, naked, in a wrecked bedroom. Enraged not so much by the damage as by the disgust and pity he felt for himself in the desolate emptiness of the saturnalia, he armed himself with some ecclesiastical dog-whipping disciplines that he kept at the bottom of the trunk, along with a cilice and other instruments of mortification and penance, and expelled the children from the house, howling like a madman, and whipping them mercilessly, as he would not have done with a pack of coyotes. He was left demolished, with an asthma attack that lasted for several days, giving him the appearance of a dying man. On the third night of torture, overcome by suffocation, he went to Aureliano's room to ask him the favor of buying him some inhaling powders from a nearby pharmacy. Thus, Aureliano made his second outing to the street. He only had to walk two blocks to reach the narrow pharmacy with dusty glass cases and earthenware jars labeled in Latin, where a girl with the stealthy beauty of a Nile serpent dispensed the medication that José Arcadio had written on a piece of paper. The second vision of the deserted town, barely lit by the yellowish street bulbs, did not awaken in Aureliano any more curiosity than the first time. José Arcadio had thought he had fled, when he saw him reappear, a little breathless from the haste, dragging the legs that confinement and lack of mobility had made weak and clumsy. His indifference to the world was so certain that a few days later José Arcadio broke the promise he had made to his mother and allowed him to go out whenever he wanted.",47.049,46.96
773,"“I have nothing to do outside,” Aureliano answered him.",- I have nothing to do out on the street. Aureliano continued to lock himself in his room and bury his head in the parchments.,13.203,9.615,"Aureliano said, ""I have no business outside.""",13.366,5.117,—I have nothing to do in the street —Aureliano replied to him.,29.971,22.998
774,"He remained shut up, absorbed in the parchments, which he was slowly unraveling and whose meaning, nevertheless, he was unable to interpret. José Arcadio would bring slices of ham to him in his room, sugared flowers which left a spring-like aftertaste in his mouth, and on two occasions a glass of fine wine. He was not interested in the parchments, which he thought of more as an esoteric pastime, but his attention was attracted by the rare wisdom and the inexplicable knowledge of the world that his desolate kinsman had. He discovered then that he could understand written English and that between parchments he had gone from the first page to the last of the six volumes of the encyclopedia as if it were a novel. At first he attributed to that the fact that Aureliano could speak about Rome as if he had lived there many years, but he soon became aware that he knew things that were not in the encyclopedia, such as the price of items. “Everything is known,” was the only reply he received from Aureliano when he asked him where he had got that information from. Aureliano, for his part, was surprised that José Arcadio when seen from close by was so different from the image that he had formed of him when he saw him wandering through the house. He was capable of laughing, of allowing himself from time to time a feeling of nostalgia for the past of the house, and of showing concern for the state of misery present in Melquíades’ room. That drawing closer together of two solitary people of the same blood was far from friendship, but it did allow them both to bear up better under the unfathomable solitude that separated and united them at the same time. José Arcadio could then turn to Aureliano to untangle certain domestic problems that exasperated him. Aureliano, in turn, could sit and read on the porch, waiting for the letters from Amaranta Úrsula, which still arrived with the usual punctuality, and could use the bathroom, from which José Arcadio had banished him when he arrived.","Gradually, he could read what was written on them but still couldn't interpret their content. José Arcadio brought Aureliano slices of ham and sweet fruits that left a lingering taste of spring in the mouth, and twice he even brought fine wine. José Arcadio didn't care about the parchments, which he considered a mysterious pastime, but he was intrigued by the strange wisdom and worldly knowledge that his melancholic nephew possessed. He knew that Aureliano could read English and, while studying the parchments, Aureliano had read all six volumes of the encyclopedia from cover to cover as if they were novels. At first, he thought so because Aureliano could talk about Rome as if he had lived there for many years, but soon he realized that Aureliano knew many things not found in the encyclopedia, such as market prices. ""People know everything,"" was Aureliano's only answer when José Arcadio asked him how he had acquired such knowledge. For his part, Aureliano was surprised to see that, up close, José Arcadio was very different from the image he had of him when he saw him walking around the house: José Arcadio was someone who could laugh, occasionally allow himself to reminisce about the family's past, and worry about the poverty of Melquíades' room. Their growing closeness, between two lonely people of the same bloodline, was far from achieving friendship, but it allowed them to endure the profound, immeasurable solitude that both separated and united them. At that time, José Arcadio could ask Aureliano to help solve certain difficulties in the increasingly burdensome household chores. Aureliano, in turn, could sit and read on the porch, receive Amaranta Úrsula's letters regularly and on time, and use the bathroom that José Arcadio had initially forbidden him to enter.",21.344,21.092,"Then he shut himself in his room again, buried in the manuscripts he slowly turned but could not yet comprehend: Jose Arcadio would bring him slices of ham and sugary flowers that left a taste of spring in the mouth after being eaten. Jose Arcadio was not interested in the manuscripts, which he described as an introspective way to kill time, but he admired his reclusive relative's rare intelligence and knowledge about the world. He was surprised to learn that Aureliano could read English and had read the six-volume encyclopedia from cover to cover like a novel while trying to decipher the manuscripts. At first, he attributed Aureliano's detailed descriptions of Aoma, as if he had lived there for years, to the knowledge he had gained from the encyclopedia. But soon he realized that he also knew things that were not in the encyclopedia, like the prices of goods in the market. When he asked where he got this information, Aureliano simply replied, ""Everything is known."" Aureliano was also surprised at how different Jose Arcadio looked up close compared to the image he had formed of him while walking around the house. So Jose Arcadio knew how to laugh, and sometimes he could miss the old state of the house, feeling a pang of sorrow for the poverty of Melquiades' room. The relationship between these two people of the same blood could not be called friendship, yet this companionship made it easier for them to endure the boundless loneliness that both brought them closer and pushed them apart. Jose Arcadio handed over the household problems he couldn't manage to Aureliano. Aureliano would occasionally come out of his room to read books on the veranda, waiting for the letters Amaranta Ursula wrote without fail, and he could now use the bathroom that Jose Arcadio had initially forbidden him to enter when he first arrived.",15.544,15.22,"He remained locked up, absorbed in the scrolls that he was gradually unraveling, but whose meaning, however, he could not interpret. José Arcadio brought him slices of ham, sugar-coated flowers that left a spring-like aftertaste in his mouth, and on two occasions a glass of good wine. He was not interested in the scrolls, which he considered more of an esoteric pastime, but he was struck by the rare wisdom and the inexplicable knowledge of the world that his desolate relative possessed. He then learned that he was capable of understanding written English, and that between scrolls he had read from the first page to the last, as if it were a novel, the six volumes of the encyclopedia.

Aureliano, for his part, was surprised that José Arcadio, seen up close, was so different from the image he had formed of him when he saw him wandering around the house. He was capable of laughing, of occasionally indulging in nostalgia for the house's past, and of being concerned about the atmosphere of misery in which Melquíades' room was found. That rapprochement between two solitary individuals of the same blood was far from friendship, but it allowed both of them to better endure the unfathomable solitude that at the same time separated and united them. José Arcadio could then turn to Aureliano to untangle certain domestic problems that exasperated him. Aureliano, in turn, could sit and read in the corridor, receive the letters from Amaranta Úrsula that continued to arrive with the same punctuality as always, and use the bathroom from which José Arcadio had banished him since his arrival.",49.765,49.635
775,"One hot dawn they both woke up in alarm at an urgent knocking on the street door. It was a dark old man with large green eyes that gave his face a ghostly phosphorescence and with a cross of ashes on his forehead. His clothing in tatters, his shoes cracked, the old knapsack on his shoulder his only luggage, he looked like a beggar, but his bearing had a dignity that was in frank contradiction to his appearance. It was only necessary to look at him once, even in the shadows of the parlor, to realize that the secret strength that allowed him to live was not the instinct of self-preservation but the habit of fear. It was Aureliano Amador, the only survivor of Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s seventeen sons, searching for a respite in his long and hazardous existence as a fugitive. He identified himself, begged them to give him refuge in that house which during his nights as a pariah he had remembered as the last redoubt of safety left for him in life. But José Arcadio and Aureliano did not remember him. Thinking that he was a tramp, they pushed him into the street. They both saw from the doorway the end of a drama that had began before José Arcadio had reached the age of reason. Two policemen who had been chasing Aureliano Amador for years, who had tracked him like bloodhounds across half the world, came out from among the almond trees on the opposite sidewalk and took two shots with their Mausers which neatly penetrated the cross of ashes.","One hot morning, both were awakened by urgent knocks at the gate. The visitor was an old, dark-skinned man with large, blue eyes that gave his face a ghostly phosphorescence, and a cross of holy ash imprinted on his forehead. His shabby clothes, torn shoes, and an old backpack slung over his shoulder were his only belongings, making him look like a beggar, but his demeanor was dignified, contrasting sharply with his appearance. Just one look at him, even in the dimly lit living room, was enough to realize that some mysterious force had allowed him to survive, not through the instinct of survival but through the habit of fear. He was Aureliano Buendía Amador, the only surviving one of Colonel Aureliano Buendía's seventeen sons, seeking a bit of rest in his long and perilous life on the run. He introduced himself and begged for permission to take refuge in this house, which he had thought of during his miserable nights as the last safe haven left in his life. But José Arcadio and Aureliano did not recognize him. They thought he was a vagabond and pushed him back onto the street. At that moment, from the gate, they witnessed the final scene of a tragedy that had begun before José Arcadio could remember. Two policemen, who had been hunting Aureliano Amador for many years and had followed him like dogs across half the world, suddenly emerged from the almond trees across the fence and shot him twice, the bullets piercing straight through the cross of holy ash.",24.075,23.706,"On a warm dawn hour, they both jumped out of bed as the front door was pounded loudly. At the door stood a dark-skinned, elderly man with large green eyes that seemed to glow as if his face were phosphorescent, resembling a ghost. There was an ash cross mark on the man's forehead. His clothes were tattered. His shoes were torn. He had no belongings other than a backpack. He looked like a beggar. Yet he possessed a dignity that was completely contrary to his appearance. To understand that the mysterious force keeping him alive was not the instinct to perpetuate his lineage but sheer fear, it was enough to just take a look at his face even in the emptiness of the living room. This was Aureliano Amador, the only one of Colonel Aureliano Buendia's seventeen sons to survive the massacre, seeking a place to rest after years of weary fugitive life. He introduced himself. He asked to be taken into this house, which he had thought of as his last refuge in life during the years he had worked like a slave. Jose Arcadio and Aureliano did not recognize him. They threw him out into the street, thinking he was a vagabond. Then, they witnessed the end of a drama that had begun before Jose Arcadio was even old enough to understand. Two policemen, who had been chasing Aureliano Amador for years, emerged from among the almond trees on the opposite sidewalk and fired two shots.

He had told Aureliano and had even made plans to set him up in a business that would bring him a living, because the baskets of food had stopped coming since Fernanda’s burial. But that last dream would not be fulfilled either. One September morning, after having coffee in the kitchen with Aureliano, José Arcadio was finishing his daily bath when through the openings in the tiles the four children he had expelled from the house burst in. Without giving him time to defend himself, they jumped into the pool fully clothed, grabbed him by the hair, and held his head under the water until the bubbling of his death throes ceased on the surface and his silent and pale dolphin body dipped down to the bottom of the fragrant water.

She did not even take a day of rest after the long trip. She put on some worn denim overalls that her husband had brought along with other automotive items and set about on a new restoration of the house. She scattered the red ants, who had already taken possession of the porch, brought the rose bushes back to life, uprooted the weeds, and planted ferns, oregano, and begonias again in the pots along the railing. She took charge of a crew of carpenters, locksmiths, and masons, who filled in the cracks in the floor, put doors and windows back on their hinges, repaired the furniture, and white-washed the walls inside and out, so that three months after her arrival one breathed once more the atmosphere of youth and festivity that had existed during the days of the pianola.

She drove away the red ants that had taken over the hallway, tended to the rose bushes, uprooted the weeds, and replanted the pots of ferns, basil, and begonias by the stairs. Amaranta Úrsula supervised a team of carpenters, locksmiths, and masons to plaster the cracks in the floor, repair the doors, fix the furniture, and whitewash the walls both inside and out, so that just three months after her return, the youthful and festive atmosphere of the time when the automatic piano was still there had returned to the house. No one in this house had ever been as consistently cheerful, at any time and under any circumstances, as Amaranta Úrsula. No one had ever been as ready to dance, sing, and discard all dry objects and customs into the trash as she was. With a single sweep of her broom, Amaranta Úrsula cleared away all the mournful mementos, useless items, and superstitious offerings piled in the corners, keeping only - out of gratitude to Úrsula - the picture of Remedios in the front room: ""How beautiful,"" she exclaimed, laughing heartily, ""An old lady of fourteen!"" When a mason mentioned that the house was full of ghosts and that they could only be driven away by finding the treasures buried there, Amaranta Úrsula laughed heartily and said she didn't believe in such superstitions. Amaranta Úrsula was so natural, relaxed, and had such a fresh and liberal spirit that seeing her made Aureliano feel awkward. ""Wonderful,"" Amaranta Úrsula exclaimed joyfully, with open arms. ""My esteemed cannibal has grown up so much!"" Before Aureliano could react, Amaranta Úrsula had placed a record in the portable phonograph she had brought and taught him the latest dances. She made Aureliano discard the filthy pants inherited from Colonel Aureliano Buendía, gifted him youthful-style shirts and two-tone shoes, and made him go out whenever he stayed too long in Melquíades' room.",19.691,19.493,"The items did not fit on the veranda. Besides the old trunk of Fernanda that she took with her when going to school, there were two trunks, four large suitcases, a suitcase where she put her umbrellas, eight hat boxes, a huge cage filled with fifty canaries, and her husband's bicycle piled up. Since the bicycle was folded and placed in a special box, her husband carried it around like a cello. Amaranta Ursula did not rest for even a day after that long journey. As soon as she pulled on the old overalls her husband had brought along with his automatic tools, she set about putting the house in order. She repelled the army of red ants that had taken over the veranda, revived the rose bushes, cleared the weeds, and replanted ferns, begonias, and hydrangeas in the pots on the veranda railings. By supervising the carpenters, locksmiths, and masons she had gathered at the house, she had the cracks in the floors filled, the doors and windows re-hinged, the furniture repaired, and the interior and exterior of the house plastered and whitewashed. Three months after her arrival, she had restored the youthful and exuberant atmosphere of the days when the hurdy-gurdy played in the house. No one in the house had ever felt such constant happiness, enjoyed life so much regardless of the circumstances, or been so ready to dance, sing, and discard established habits as they did then. As soon as Amaranta Ursula waved her broom, she swept away all the funeral remnants, piles of trash, and whatever charms, amulets, and prayers had accumulated in the corners. The only thing she didn't throw away out of respect for Ursula was the portrait of Remedios in the living room. While cleaning, she burst into laughter and screamed, ""Oh my God! What luxury!"" ""A grandmother at fourteen!"" When one of the masons said that the house was full of ghosts and the only solution to drive them away was to search for the buried treasures, Amaranta Ursula laughed and replied that it was unbecoming for men to be mired in superstition. Amaranta Ursula was such an independent and modern-spirited woman, so spontaneous and rule-breaking, that when Aureliano saw her coming, he didn't know how to hide his body exposed by his tattered clothes. Amaranta, ""Oh my dear little cannibal, how you've grown!"" she said, and without giving him a chance to respond, she put a record on the portable gramophone and began to teach Aureliano how to dance. She took off the dirty pants that had belonged to Colonel Aureliano Buendia from Aureliano's back, gave him shirts suitable for young people, and two-tone shoes. Whenever Aureliano would lock himself in Melquiades' room for a long time, Amaranta Ursula would come and get him, pushing and shoving him out onto the street.",19.107,18.889,"The luggage didn't fit in the corridor. In addition to Fernanda's old trunk that she was sent to school with, she brought two vertical wardrobes, four large suitcases, a bag for umbrellas, eight hat boxes, a gigantic cage with half a hundred canaries, and her husband's velocipede, disassembled inside a special case that allowed it to be carried like a cello. She didn't even allow herself a day of rest at the end of the long journey. She put on a worn canvas overall that her husband had brought along with other motorist clothes, and embarked on a new restoration of the house. She drove away the red ants that had already taken over the corridor, revived the rose bushes, uprooted the weeds, and replanted ferns, oregano, and begonias in the railing pots. She led a crew of carpenters, locksmiths, and masons who patched up the cracks in the floors, rehung doors and windows, renewed the furniture, and whitewashed the walls inside and out, so that three months after her arrival, the air of youth and festivity that existed in the days of the pianola was once again breathed. No one had ever been seen in the house with better humor at all times and in any circumstance, nor anyone more willing to sing and dance, and to throw away the stale things and customs. With a sweep of the broom, she got rid of the funeral memories and the piles of useless trinkets and superstitious devices that were piled up in the corners, and the only thing she kept, out of gratitude to Úrsula, was the daguerreotype of Remedios in the living room. ""Look at this luxury,"" she shouted, laughing her head off. ""A fourteen-year-old great-grandmother!"" When one of the masons told her that the house was populated by ghosts, and that the only way to scare them away was to look for the treasures they had left buried, she replied with laughter that she didn't believe in men's superstitions. She was so spontaneous, so emancipated, with such a modern and free spirit, that Aureliano didn't know what to do with himself when he saw her arrive. ""How amazing!"" she shouted happily, with open arms. ""Look how my beloved cannibal has grown!"" Before he had time to react, she had already put a record on the portable gramophone she had brought with her, and was trying to teach him the latest dances. She made him change out of the scrawny pants he had inherited from Colonel Aureliano Buendía, gave him youthful shirts and two-tone shoes, and pushed him out into the street when he spent too much time in Melquíades' room.",43.672,43.561
781,"Active, small, and indomitable like Úrsula, and almost as pretty and provocative as Remedios the Beauty, she was endowed with a rare instinct for anticipating fashion. When she received pictures of the most recent fashions in the mail, they only proved that she had not been wrong about the models that she designed herself and sewed on Amaranta’s primitive pedal machine. She subscribed to every fashion magazine, art publication. and popular music review published in Europe, and she had only to glance at them to realize that things in the world were going just as she imagined they were. It was incomprehensible why a woman with that spirit would have returned to a dead town burdened by dust and heat, and much less with a husband who had more than enough money to live anywhere in the world and who loved her so much that he let himself be led around by her on a silk leash. As time passed, however, her intention to stay was more obvious, because she did not make any plans that were not a long way off, nor did she do anything that did not have as an aim the search for a comfortable life and a peaceful old age in Macondo. The canary cage showed that those aims were made up on the spur of the moment. Remembering that her mother had told her in a letter about the extermination of the birds, she had delayed her trip several months until she found a ship that stopped at the Fortunate Isles and there she chose the finest twenty-five pairs of canaries so that she could repopulate the skies of Macondo. That was the most lamentable of her numerous frustrated undertakings. As the birds reproduced Amaranta Úrsula would release them in pairs, and no sooner did they feel themselves free than they fled the town. She tried in vain to awaken love in them by means of the bird cage that Úrsula had built during the first reconstruction of the house. Also in vain were the artificial nests built of esparto grass in the almond trees and the birdseed strewn about the roofs, and arousing the captives so that their songs would dissuade the deserters, because they would take flights on their first attempts and make a turn in the sky, just the time needed to find the direction to the Fortunate Isles.","Amaranta Úrsula was lively, slender, and stubborn like Úrsula, beautiful and seductive like Remedios the Beauty, and she had a very strange innate instinct for being ahead of fashion trends. When she received drawings of the latest fashions through the mail, Amaranta Úrsula immediately knew that she had not been wrong in coming up with those designs, and those were exactly the patterns she had sewn on Amaranta's crude hand-crank sewing machine. She had subscribed to many fashion magazines and newsletters about folk art and music published in Europe, and with just a glance, Amaranta Úrsula knew that everything was happening exactly as she had envisioned. It was incomprehensible why a woman with such a rich spiritual life would return to a town as dead and engulfed in dust and heat as this one, especially with a husband who had enough money to live anywhere else in the world and loved his wife so much that he would let her lead him around by a silk rope. However, it became increasingly clear that Amaranta Úrsula intended to stay here for good because she only accepted long-term plans and did only what served to prepare for a convenient life and a peaceful old age in Macondo. The canary cage showed that these intentions were not accidental. When Amaranta Úrsula remembered that her mother had written in a letter about the destruction of birds, she immediately postponed her plans for a few months until a ship that had passed through the Fortunate Isles arrived, and on that ship, she selected the twenty-five most beautiful pairs of canaries to bring back and repopulate the skies of Macondo. Among the many unrealized initiatives of Amaranta Úrsula, this was the most regrettable. She released each pair of canaries with the intention that they would multiply, but they flew away from Macondo before realizing they were free. She tried in vain to keep them with the cage that Úrsula had built during the first house renovations. She made fake nests from reeds in the almond trees, scattered millet seeds on the roof tiles, and used the songs of the caged birds to call the others back, but all in vain, as they only intended to leave, flying in circles in the sky to find their way back to the Fortunate Isles.",24.973,24.758,"Amaranta Ursula, who was as industrious, petite, and indomitable as Ursula, and almost as enchanting as Beautiful Remedios, also had the ability to foresee future fashion trends. When the latest fashion magazines arrived by mail, she would see that the clothes she had previously designed and sewn on Amaranta's old pedal machine did not contradict the latest fashion innovations. She subscribed to all the fashion magazines, art publications, and popular music magazines published in Europe. When she glanced through these, she saw that the happenings in the world were exactly as she had envisioned them. It was hard to understand why a woman with her temperament, especially one who had enough money to live as she pleased anywhere in the world and a husband who loved her enough to endure her putting a silk leash around his neck and pulling him along, would return to this lifeless town mired in dust and heat. As time passed, it became increasingly clear that Amaranta Ursula intended to stay there. Because none of her plans were short-term; whatever she did was always in preparation for a peaceful and serene old age in Macondo. The canary cage proved that these preparations were carried out with spontaneous impulses. Amaranta Ursula remembered her mother mentioning in a letter that the birds had died, postponed their journey for a few months until she found a ship heading to the Canary Islands, and then bought twenty-five pairs of canaries to revive the skies of Macondo. Among Amaranta Ursula's futile efforts, this was the one she put the most effort into. As the birds multiplied, Amaranta Ursula released them in pairs. However, the moment the birds gained their freedom, they would escape from Macondo and fly to other places. Amaranta Ursula tried in vain to evoke a sense of love in the birds by using a cage that Ursula had made during the first renovation of the house. The nests woven from alpha grass that she placed in the almond trees did not work, nor did scattering birdseed on the nests, nor did making the caged birds sing to lure back the ones that had escaped. Those that left the cage would immediately escape after drawing a large circle over Macondo to determine the direction of the Canary Islands.",18.56,18.279,"Active, petite, indomitable like Úrsula, and almost as beautiful and provocative as Remedios the Beautiful, she was endowed with a rare instinct for anticipating fashion. When she received the latest fashion magazines by mail, they merely served to confirm that she had not made a mistake in the designs she invented and sewed on Amaranta's rudimentary hand-crank machine. She subscribed to every fashion, artistic information, and popular music magazine published in Europe, and she barely glanced at them to realize that things in the world were as she imagined them. It was not understandable that a woman with such a spirit had returned to a dead town, depressed by dust and heat, and even less with a husband who had more than enough money to live well anywhere in the world, and who loved her so much that he had submitted to being led around by her with a silk leash. However, as time passed, her intention to stay became more evident, as she did not conceive plans that were not long-term, nor did she make decisions that were not aimed at securing a comfortable life and a peaceful old age in Macondo. The canary cage demonstrated that these purposes were not improvised. Remembering that her mother had told her in a letter about the extermination of the birds, she delayed the trip several months until she found a ship that made a stopover in the Canary Islands, and there she selected the twenty-five finest pairs of canaries to repopulate the skies of Macondo.

In vain did she try to endear them to the aviary that Úrsula had built in the first restoration. In vain did she make fake nests out of esparto grass in the almond trees, scatter birdseed on the roofs, and agitate the captives so that their songs would dissuade the deserters, because they soared at the first attempt and circled the sky, just long enough to find the way back to the Canary Islands.",45.79,45.666
782,"A year after her return, although she had not succeeded in making any friends or giving any parties, Amaranta Úrsula still believed that it was possible to rescue the community which had been singled out by misfortune. Gaston, her husband, took care not to antagonize her, although since that fatal noon when he got off the train he realized that his wife’s determination had been provoked by a nostalgic mirage. Certain that she would be defeated by the realities, he did not even take the trouble to put his velocipede together, but he set about hunting for the largest eggs among the spider webs that the masons had knocked down, and he would open them with his fingernails and spend hours looking through a magnifying glass at the tiny spiders that emerged. Later on, thinking that Amaranta Úrsula was continuing with her repairs so that her hands would not be idle, he decided to assemble the handsome bicycle, on which the front wheel was much larger than the rear one, and he dedicated himself to the capture and curing of every native insect he could find in the region, which he sent in jam jars to his former professor of natural history at the University of Liège where he had done advanced work in entomology, although his main vocation was that of aviator. When he rode the bicycle he would wear acrobat’s tights, gaudy socks, and a Sherlock Holmes cap, but when he was on foot he would dress in a spotless natural linen suit, white shoes, a silk bow tie, a straw boater, and he would carry a willow stick in his hand. His pale eyes accentuated his look of a sailor and his small mustache looked like the fur of a squirrel. Although he was at least fifteen years older than his wife, his alert determination to make her happy and his qualities as a good lover compensated for the difference. Actually, those who saw that man in his forties with careful habits, with the leash around his neck and his circus bicycle, would not have thought that he had made a pact of unbridled love with his wife and that they both gave in to the reciprocal drive in the least adequate of places and wherever the spirit moved them, as they had done since they had began to keep company, and with a passion that the passage of time and the more and more unusual circumstances deepened and enriched. Gaston was not only a fierce lover, with endless wisdom and imagination, but he was also, perhaps, the first man in the history of the species who had made an emergency landing and had come close to killing himself and his sweetheart simply to make love in a field of violets.","One year after returning, although she had not yet formed any close friendships and had not organized any gatherings, Amaranta Úrsula still believed that she could restore the community that was in such a state of misfortune. Her husband, Gastón, always took care not to clash with his wife, even though from that unforgettable afternoon when he stepped off the train, he had thought that his wife's decision was driven by a nostalgic illusion of her homeland. Convinced that reality would change that decision, he didn't even bother to reassemble his bicycle but instead went looking for the most beautiful spider eggs in the webs that the masons knocked down, tearing them apart with his fingernails and spending hours watching the tiny spiders emerge through a magnifying glass. Later, believing that Amaranta Úrsula continued her renovation work to keep her hands from becoming clumsy and deformed, Gastón reassembled his bicycle, which had a front wheel much larger than the rear, and then caught and dissected strange insects he found around the house, placing them in jam jars and sending them to his old natural history professor at the University of Liège, where he had excelled in biology despite always wanting to become a pilot. When riding his bicycle, Gastón wore circus performer pants, colorful socks, and a detective-style hat, but when walking, he wore an impeccable suit made of coarse linen, white shoes, a small silk tie, a flat-brimmed straw hat, and carried a cane. Gastón had light gray eyes that accentuated his sailor-like demeanor and a reddish-brown mustache like squirrel fur. Although Gastón was at least fifteen years older than his wife, he had very youthful tastes, always wanting to make his wife happy and possessing the qualities of a good lover, all of which compensated for the age difference between them. In fact, anyone who saw the cautious habits of this man in his forties, always obedient to his wife, and his push bicycle - a circus-style bike - could not imagine that he and his young wife shared a harmonious and passionate love, that in the most inconvenient and unexpected places, they always satisfied each other as they did when they first met, with a love that grew deeper and richer each day. Gastón was not only an intense lover with endless knowledge and imagination, but perhaps the first in the history of love to make an emergency landing, nearly losing his life along with his lover, just because he wanted to make love in a field of violets.",19.184,18.957,"Although a year had passed since Amaranta Ursula's return, she had not yet made any friends or organized any gatherings, but she had not lost hope of bringing together the community that misfortunes had driven into solitude. Her husband Gaston, even though he understood that his wife's decision to settle here was the result of a mirage created by longing from the very moment they got off the train at that deadly noon hour, was still doing his best not to oppose her. Since he had no doubt that his wife would become disheartened as she faced reality, he did not feel the need to take his velocipede out of its box and spent his time searching for the largest eggs among the spider webs that the masons had torn down. He would separate the eggs he found with his fingernail, then take a magnifying glass in his hand and examine the tiny spiders inside the eggs for hours. Later on, when he concluded that Amaranta Ursula was continuing the repair work just to keep herself busy, he decided to take his flashy bicycle, with a front wheel larger than the rear wheel, out of its box. Then, driven by the passion to send all the local insects he could find in the area to his natural history professor at the University of Liege, where he studied entomology in addition to his main profession of aviation, he started catching them and putting them in jam jars. When he went out riding his bicycle, he wore tight acrobat pants, fancy socks, and a Sherlock Holmes cap on his head. When he went for a walk, he wore light linen clothes, white shoes, a straw hat, a silk scarf, and carried a cane. His light-colored eyes emphasized his sailor appearance, and his small mustache resembled a squirrel's tail. Despite being at least fifteen years older than his wife, his meticulous determination to make her happy and his skill in lovemaking made the age difference disappear. In fact, those who saw this man in his forties, who had meticulous habits, with a circus-worthy bicycle and a leash tied around his neck, would never imagine that he was in an unconditional love agreement with his wife, that they followed their lovemaking instincts whenever and wherever they felt like it, and that they made love with a passion that had been deepening and enriching since the beginning of their relationship, through time and extraordinary circumstances. Gaston was not only a lover with boundless intellect and imagination, but perhaps the first man to make an emergency landing with his plane to make love in a field of violets, bringing himself and his lover to the brink of death.",23.958,23.758,"A year after their return, even though she had not managed to make a friend or organize a party, Amaranta Úrsula still believed it was possible to rescue that community chosen by misfortune.

Sure that she would be defeated by reality, he didn't even bother to assemble the velocipede, but instead pursued the most lucid eggs among the cobwebs that the builders dislodged, and he would open them with his nails and spend hours contemplating the tiny spiders that emerged from inside with a magnifying glass. Later, believing that Amaranta Úrsula continued with the renovations just to save face, he resolved to assemble the cumbersome velocipede whose front wheel was much larger than the rear one, and he dedicated himself to capturing and dissecting every native insect he found in the surroundings, which he sent in jam jars to his former natural history professor at the University of Liège, where he had done advanced studies in entomology, although his dominant vocation was that of an aeronaut.

783,"They had met two years before they were married, when the sports biplane in which he was making rolls over the school where Amaranta Úrsula was studying made an intrepid maneuver to avoid the flagpole and the primitive framework of canvas and aluminum foil was caught by the tail on some electric wires. From then on, paying no attention to his leg in splints, on weekends he would pick up Amaranta Úrsula at the nun’s boardinghouse where she lived, where the rules were not as severe as Fernanda had wanted, and he would take her to his country club. They began to love each other at an altitude of fifteen hundred feet in the Sunday air of the moors, and they felt all the closer together as the beings on earth grew more and more minute. She spoke to him of Macondo as the brightest and most peaceful town on earth, and of an enormous house, scented with oregano, where she wanted to live until old age with a loyal husband and two strong sons who would be named Rodrigo and Gonzalo, never Aureliano and José Arcadio, and a daughter who would be named Virginia and never Remedios. She had evoked the town idealized by nostalgia with such strong tenacity that Gaston understood that she would not get married unless he took her to live in Macondo. He agreed to it, as he agreed later on to the leash, because he thought it was a passing fancy that could be overcome in time. But when two years in Macondo had passed and Amaranta Úrsula was as happy as on the first day, he began to show signs of alarm. By that time he had dissected every dissectible insect in the region, he spoke Spanish like a native, and he had solved all of the crossword puzzles in the magazines that he received in the mail. He did not have the pretext of climate to hasten their return because nature had endowed him with a colonial liver which resisted the drowsiness of siesta time and water that had vinegar worms in it. He liked the native cooking so much that once he ate eighty-two iguana eggs at one sitting. Amaranta Úrsula, on the other hand, had brought in by train fish and shellfish in boxes of ice, canned meats and preserved fruits, which were the only things she could eat, and she still dressed in European style and received designs by mail in spite of the fact that she had no place to go and no one to visit and by that time her husband was not in a mood to appreciate her short skirts, her tilted felt hat, and her seven-strand necklaces. Her secret seemed to lie in the fact that she always found a way to keep busy, resolving domestic problems that she herself had created, and doing a poor job on a thousand things which she would fix on the following day with a pernicious diligence that made one think of Fernanda and the hereditary vice of making something just to unmake it. Her festive genius was still so alive then that when she received new records she would invite Gaston to stay in the parlor until very late to practice the dance steps that her schoolmates described to her in sketches and they would generally end up making love on the Viennese rocking chairs or on the bare floor. The only thing that she needed to be completely happy was the birth of her children, but she respected the pact she had made with her husband not to have any until they had been married for five years.","Gastón and Amaranta Úrsula met three years before their wedding day, when Gastón's biplane, made of thick fabric and thin aluminum, made a daring flight to avoid hitting a flagpole, and its tail got caught in the electric wires, forcing Gastón to jump into Amaranta Úrsula's schoolyard. From that day on, despite having a splint on his leg, Gastón would visit the boarding house for women of faith, where Amaranta resided regularly—where the rules were not as strict as Fernanda would have wanted—every weekend to take her to his sports club. They began to fall in love at an altitude of five hundred meters, on a Sunday while flying over the barren fields, and they felt even more connected when they realized how small they were on Earth. Amaranta Úrsula spoke of Macondo as if it were the most radiant and peaceful village in the world, of the large house always filled with the scent of marjoram, where she wanted to live until old age with her faithful husband and two stubborn sons who would be named Rodrigo and Gonzalo, never Aureliano or José Arcadio, and a daughter named Virginia, definitely not Remedios. Amaranta Úrsula frequently reminisced about the idealized village of her memories, making Gastón understand that she would not marry him unless she could live in Macondo. Gastón agreed, as he would later agree to all his wife's whims, believing that it was just a fleeting desire that time would erase. But after two years of living in Macondo and seeing Amaranta Úrsula still as joyful as the day they arrived, Gastón began to see warning signs. By then, he had dissected countless insects in the area, spoke Spanish like a local, and had filled in all the crossword puzzles in the magazines they received by mail. Gastón could not use the climate as an excuse to return early, as nature had endowed him with a liver that could easily adapt to foreign lands, endure the stifling midday heat, and drink water with larvae in it. He enjoyed the local delicacies, once eating eighty-two lizard eggs. In contrast, Amaranta Úrsula brought fish and seafood preserved in ice boxes, canned meat, and fruit jams, as she could only eat those; she still dressed in European fashion and received fashion illustrations by mail even though she went nowhere and visited no one, and despite her husband's dwindling enthusiasm for praising her short dresses, tilted wool hats, and jewelry that required seven loops to wrap around her. Perhaps Amaranta Úrsula's mystery lay in her constant search for ways to stay busy, doing household chores she invented, hastily doing some tasks only to fix them the next day, with a dangerous urgency that made Fernanda think of the hereditary flaw in this house of doing things only to undo them. Amaranta Úrsula remained cheerful, so when she received a new record, she would ask Gastón to stay in the outer room for a long time while she practiced the dances her school friends had illustrated, and they often ended with lovemaking on the Viennese rocking chairs or the bare floor. All she needed to be completely happy was a child, but she respected the agreement with her husband not to have children until they had lived together for five years.",20.156,19.995,"Two years before their marriage, Gaston and Amaranta Ursula met when Gaston was performing loops in his biplane over her, and in an attempt to avoid hitting the flag, he made an impossible maneuver, causing the plane's primitive fabric wings and aluminum tail to get caught in the electric wires. From that day on, Gaston, undeterred by his leg being in a cast, began taking Amaranta Ursula from the convent where she stayed, which was not as strict as Fernanda had hoped, to his countryside cabin on weekends. They fell in love with each other in the market air of the fields and five hundred meters above the ground. As the creatures on the earth below them grew smaller, they grew closer. Amaranta Ursula described Macondo to Gaston as the sunniest, most peaceful town in the world. She spoke of a large house filled with the scent of geraniums, where she wanted to live happily for the rest of her life with her devoted husband and two sons, whom she would name Rodrigo and Gonzalo—not Aureliano and Jose Arcadio—and a daughter, whom she would name Verginia—not Remedios. She was idealizing the town with such longing that Gaston sensed that if he did not let her live in Macondo, she would not marry him. He agreed to settle in Macondo, thinking it was a temporary whim that would eventually be forgotten. However, after two years in Macondo, when Amaranta Ursula did not lose her initial happiness and cheerfulness, Gaston began to worry. During that time, he had cut all the insects in the vicinity that could be cut, learned Spanish as if it were his native language, and solved all the puzzles in the magazines that came by mail. He couldn't even use the climate as an excuse to hasten their return. Because nature had given him the sluggishness of siesta hours and a colonial-type liver that could withstand worm-infested water. He loved the local food so much that he sometimes ate eighty-two iguana eggs in one sitting. Amaranta Ursula, on the other hand, could only eat fish and shellfish brought in ice boxes by train, and canned meat and fruit. She still dressed like Europeans, ordering clothing models by mail even though there was nowhere to go and no friends to see. Her husband no longer had any interest in her short skirts, upturned hats, and seven-strand necklaces. It was necessary to attribute Amaranta Ursula's perseverance, her tirelessness, her constant busyness, and her efforts to solve the household problems she created herself. She was doing a heap of tasks superficially or ruining them and then persistently tackling the same tasks again the next day. Seeing her in this state, it was impossible not to recall Fernanda's opinion that in this family, turning tasks into a game of trial and error was an ailment passed down from generation to generation. Her enthusiasm was so vibrant that as soon as a new record arrived, she would immediately call Gaston and practice the dances her friends had drawn and sent to her. After dancing until late hours, they would finish the night by making love either on Viennese rocking chairs or on the floor. The only thing Amaranta Ursula was waiting for to complete her happiness was to have children. However, she was waiting out of respect for the agreement she had made with her husband not to have children before the fifth year of their marriage.",15.55,15.339,"They had met three years before getting married, when the sports biplane in which he performed stunts over the school where Amaranta Úrsula studied attempted a daring maneuver to avoid the flagpole, and the primitive framework of canvas and aluminum foil got caught by the tail in the electric power cables. Since then, ignoring his splinted leg, he would go on weekends to pick up Amaranta Úrsula at the convent boarding house where she always lived, whose rules were not as strict as Fernanda would have liked, and he would take her to his sports club. They began to love each other at 500 meters above ground, in the Sunday air of the moors, and they felt more connected the smaller the people on the ground became. She spoke to him of Macondo as the brightest and most peaceful town in the world, and of a huge house, scented with oregano, where she wanted to live until old age with a loyal husband and two unruly sons named Rodrigo and Gonzalo, and in no case Aureliano and José Arcadio, and a daughter named Virginia, and in no case Remedios. She had evoked with such longing tenacity the town idealized by nostalgia, that Gastón understood that she wouldn't want to marry unless he took her to live in Macondo. He agreed, as he later did with the fishing line, because he thought it was a temporary whim that was better to disappoint in time. But when two years had passed in Macondo and Amaranta Úrsula was still as happy as the first day, he began to show signs of alarm. By then he had dissected every insect that could be dissected in the region, spoke Spanish like a native, and had solved all the crossword puzzles in the magazines they received by mail. He didn't have the excuse of the climate to hasten their return, because nature had endowed him with a colonial liver, which withstood the afternoon heat and the water with larvae without any trouble. He liked the local food so much that once he ate a string of eighty-two iguana eggs. Amaranta Úrsula, on the other hand, had fish and seafood brought to her by train in ice boxes, canned meats, and candied fruits, which were the only things she could eat, and she continued to dress in European fashion and receive fashion magazines by mail, despite having nowhere to go and no one to visit, and despite the fact that by then her husband lacked the humor to appreciate her short dresses, tilted felt hats, and seven-strand necklaces. Her secret seemed to be that she always found a way to stay busy, solving domestic problems she herself created and doing certain things poorly only to correct them the next day, with a pernicious diligence that would have made Fernanda think of the hereditary vice of doing to undo. Her festive spirit remained so lively that when she received new records, she would invite Gastón to stay in the living room until very late to practice the dances her schoolmates described to her with drawings, and they usually ended up making love on the Viennese rocking chairs or on the bare floor. The only thing missing for her to be completely happy was the birth of children, but she respected the pact she had made with her husband not to have them before being married for five years.",48.01,47.93

785,"It was not a new project. Actually, he had it fairly well advanced when he met Amaranta Úrsula, except that it was not for Macondo, but for the Belgian Congo, where his family had investments in palm oil. The marriage and the decision to spend a few months in Macondo to please his wife had obliged him to postpone it. But when he saw that Amaranta Úrsula was determined to organize a commission for public improvement and even laughed at him when he hinted at the possibility of returning, he understood that things were going to take a long time and he reestablished contact with his forgotten partners in Brussels, thinking that it was just as well to be a pioneer in the Caribbean as in Africa. While his steps were progressing he prepared a landing field in the old enchanted region which at that time looked like a plain of crushed flintstone, and he studied the wind direction, the geography of the coastal region, and the best routes for aerial navigation, without knowing that his diligence, so similar to that of Mr. Herbert, was filling the town with the dangerous suspicion that his plan was not to set up routes but to plant banana trees. Enthusiastic over the idea that, after all, might justify his permanent establishment in Macondo, he took several trips to the capital of the province, met with authorities, obtained licenses, and drew up contracts for exclusive rights. In the meantime he maintained a correspondence with his partners in Brussels which resembled that of Fernanda with the invisible doctors, and he finally convinced them to ship the first airplane under the care of an expert mechanic, who would assemble it in the nearest port and fly it to Macondo.

In fact, Gastón had that intention ever since he met Amaranta Úrsula, but back then, he did not plan to establish it in Macondo but in the Belgian Congo, where his family had investments in palm oil production. After marrying Amaranta Úrsula, he decided to live in Macondo for a few months to please his wife, so he had to abandon the previous plan. But when Gastón saw Amaranta Úrsula persistently organizing public reforms and even laughing when he hinted at the possibility of returning to his homeland, he realized that things had gone too far. Thus, Gastón reconnected with his close friends in Brussels, whom he had long neglected, and he thought that becoming a scout in the Caribbean or Africa would be the same. While everything was progressing, Gastón prepared a landing strip on a vast, barren land that resembled a cracked, dry field. He studied the wind direction, the geography of the coastal region, and the appropriate flight paths, unaware that his careful work—very similar to that of Mr. Herbert—had aroused dangerous suspicions among the villagers, who thought his goal was not to pave the way but to plant bananas. Excited by the sudden realization that ultimately confirmed his reason for staying in Macondo, Gastón went to the provincial capital several times, met with authorities, obtained permits, and signed exclusive contracts. Meanwhile, he continued to correspond with his close friends in Brussels, similar to the correspondence between Fernanda and the invisible doctors, persuading them to send the first airplane along with a team of skilled mechanics to assemble it at the nearest port and then fly it to Macondo.

But when Amaranta Ursula firmly decided to revitalize Macondo and mocked her husband about returning, Gaston realized that their stay here would last longer than he had thought.

786,"Although she had not noticed it, the return of Amaranta Úrsula had brought on a radical change in Aureliano’s life. After the death of José Arcadio he had become a regular customer at the wise Catalonian’s bookstore. Also, the freedom that he enjoyed then and the time at his disposal awoke in him a certain curiosity about the town, which he came to know without any surprise. He went through the dusty and solitary streets, examining with scientific interest the inside of houses in ruin, the metal screens on the windows broken by rust and the dying birds, and the inhabitants bowed down by memories. He tried to reconstruct in his imagination the annihilated splendor of the old banana-company town, whose dry swimming pool was filled to the brim with rotting men’s and women’s shoes, and in the houses of which, destroyed by rye grass, he found the skeleton of a German shepherd dog still tied to a ring by a steel chain and a telephone that was ringing, ringing, ringing until he picked it up and an anguished and distant woman spoke in English, and he said yes, that the strike was over, that three thousand dead people had been thrown into the sea, that the banana company had left, and that Macondo finally had peace after many years. Those wanderings led him to the prostrate red-light district, where in other times bundles of banknotes had been burned to liven up the revels, and which at that time was a maze of streets more afflicted and miserable than the others, with a few red lights still burning and with deserted dance halls adorned with the remnants of wreaths, where the pale, fat widows of no one, the French great-grandmothers and the Babylonian matriarchs, were still waiting beside their photographs. Aureliano could not find anyone who remembered his family, not even Colonel Aureliano Buendía, except for the oldest of the West Indian Negroes, an old man whose cottony hair gave him the look of a photographic negative and who was still singing the mournful sunset psalms in the door of his house. Aureliano would talk to him in the tortured Papiamento that he had learned in a few weeks and sometimes he would share his chicken-head soup, prepared by the great-granddaughter, with him. She was a large black woman with solid bones, the hips of a mare, teats like live melons, and a round and perfect head armored with a hard surface of wiry hair which looked like a medieval warrior’s mail headdress. Her name was Nigromanta. In those days Aureliano lived off the sale of silverware, candlesticks, and other bric-a-brac from the house. When he was penniless, which was most of the time, he got people in the back of the market to give him the chicken heads that they were going to throw away and he would take them to Nigromanta to make her soups, fortified with purslane and seasoned with mint. When the great-grandfather died Aureliano stopped going by the house, but he would run into Nigromanta under the dark almond trees on the square, using her wild-animal whistles to lure the few night owls. Many times he stayed with her, speaking in Papiamento about chicken-head soup and other dainties of misery, and he would have kept right on if she had not let him know that his presence frightened off customers. Although he sometimes felt the temptation and although Nigromanta herself might have seemed to him as the natural culmination of a shared nostalgia, he did not go to bed with her. So Aureliano was still a virgin when Amaranta Úrsula returned to Macondo and gave him a sisterly embrace that left him breathless. Every time he saw her, and worse yet when she showed him the latest dances, he felt the same spongy release in his bones that had disturbed his great-great-grandfather when Pilar Ternera made her pretexts about the cards in the granary. Trying to squelch the torment, he sank deeper into the parchments and eluded the innocent flattery of that aunt who was poisoning his nights with a flow of tribulation, but the more he avoided her the more the anxiety with which he waited for her stony laughter, her howls of a happy cat, and her songs of gratitude, agonizing in love at all hours and in the most unlikely parts of the house. One night thirty feet from his bed, on the silver workbench, the couple with unhinged bellies broke the bottles and ended up making love in a pool of muriatic acid. Aureliano not only could not sleep for a single second, but he spent the next day with a fever, sobbing with rage. The first night that he waited for Nigromanta to come to the shadows of the almond trees it seemed like an eternity, pricked as he was by the needles of uncertainty and clutching in his fist the peso and fifty cents that he had asked Amaranta Úrsula for, not so much because he needed it as to involve her, debase her, prostitute her in his adventure in some way. Nigromanta took him to her room, which was lighted with false candlesticks, to her folding cot with the bedding stained from bad loves, and to her body of a wild dog, hardened and without soul, which prepared itself to dismiss him as if he were a frightened child, and suddenly it found a man whose tremendous power demanded a movement of seismic readjustment from her insides.","The return of Amaranta Úrsula brought about a fundamental change in the life of Aureliano, although she did not notice it. After José Arcadio's death, Aureliano became a regular customer of the wise old man from Catalonia. Moreover, at this time, Aureliano was free and had time. These factors aroused in him a certain curiosity about the town that he was not unfamiliar with. On the deserted and dusty streets, with a scientific rather than humanitarian interest, Aureliano examined the insides of the dilapidated houses, the rusted iron grilles on the windows, and the flocks of dying birds along with the people weakened by the softening of time. With his imagination, he aimed to restore the destroyed splendor of the city from the banana company era, where now the swimming pool was dry and filled with men's shoes and women's sandals. In the ruined houses, Aureliano found the skeleton of a German shepherd still tied to an iron chain collar, and a telephone that kept ringing. When Aureliano picked up the receiver, he understood what an ancient and sorrowful woman was asking in English through the phone. He replied that yes, the strike had ended, three thousand dead bodies had been thrown into the sea, the banana company had left, and for many years Macondo had returned to peace. These walks led Aureliano to the dilapidated brothel district, where people once burned bundles of money for fun during the dances. Now it was the most mournful area, with a few red lights still lit, empty dance halls decorated with discarded crowns, where widows belonging to no one, pale and obese, old French women, and Babylonian madams continued to wait beside hand-cranked phonographs. Aureliano did not find anyone who remembered his family; even Colonel Aureliano Buendía was no longer remembered, except by the oldest man among the black people from Antilles, an old man with hair as white as cotton, resembling a figure in a negative film, who continued to sing under the porch the mournful songs of the twilight. Aureliano spoke with the old man in the dialect of Curaçao that he had learned in a few weeks, and occasionally ate with him the chicken head soup cooked by the girl who called him grandfather. She was a large black girl, with sturdy bones, hips like a horse's, breasts like two fresh melons, a round and beautiful head covered with a copper wire hairnet resembling a medieval warrior's helmet. Her name was Nigromanta. At that time, Aureliano sold dinner sets, candle holders, and other old household items to get money for food. When he had no money, which was often, Aureliano went to the market eateries, where they gave him chicken heads that would otherwise be thrown into the trash. Aureliano brought them back for Nigromanta to make soup, and she added herbs to make it tastier. After the old man died, Aureliano did not visit Nigromanta's house as often as before, but he still met her under the almond trees in the square when she was soliciting the rare night customers with a whistle like a wild animal's call. Many times, Aureliano accompanied Nigromanta and talked to her in the Curaçao dialect about chicken head soup and other delightful things of poverty. He would have continued if Nigromanta had not told him that his presence with her would make her lose customers. Although there were times when Aureliano felt desire and Nigromanta also sympathized and wanted to share with him, they had not yet slept together. Therefore, until Amaranta Úrsula returned to Macondo and hugged and kissed him affectionately, leaving him speechless, Aureliano was still a young man inexperienced in love. Every time Aureliano saw Amaranta Úrsula, and worst of all when she taught him new dances, he felt a thrilling sensation in his bones, the same feeling that had once made his great-great-grandfather numb when Pilar Ternera used the pretext of reading his fortune with cards in the corn shed. Suppressing his inner torment, Aureliano buried himself in the writings on the parchment and avoided the innocent seduction of the woman who had caused him many sleepless nights due to unfulfilled desire. But the more he avoided Amaranta Úrsula, the more he longed to hear her laughter, her cat-like purring during sexual satisfaction at any time and in the most unexpected places in the house. One night, on the large table in the jewelry workshop, just ten meters from Aureliano's bed, Amaranta Úrsula and her husband engaged in passionate lovemaking, oblivious to the world. That night, not only could Aureliano not sleep, but the next day he was still feverish and frustrated to the point of tears. For Aureliano, the memory of the first night he waited for Nigromanta under the almond trees, trying to overcome his anxiety and hesitation, clutching a peso and a half that he had asked from Amaranta Úrsula, would never fade. He did not ask for the money out of necessity but to humiliate Amaranta Úrsula by using it to buy sex from another woman. Nigromanta led Aureliano into a room dimly lit by cheap candles, to a bed made of planks on trestles and covered with a dirty sheet from previous orgies. She welcomed Aureliano with a hardened, shameless body, showing no emotion. She prepared to milk Aureliano like a shy boy, but immediately Nigromanta realized he was a fierce man, making her writhe all over.",18.296,18.168,"Amaranta Ursula's return home had completely changed Aureliano's life. Amaranta Ursula was not even aware of this change. After Jose Arcadio's death, Aureliano had become a regular customer of the wise Catalonian. The sense of freedom and the ability to spend his time as he pleased had sparked a certain interest in the town, and he had come to know and understand it without being surprised by anything he saw. He wandered through the desolate, dusty streets, examined the interiors of ruined houses with scientific curiosity, and carefully observed the rusted window bars, dead birds, and townspeople bent under the weight of memories. He tried to imagine the former glory days of the old Banana Company site, now filled to the brim with decayed men's and women's shoes, and a dry swimming pool. During these explorations, he found the skeleton of a shepherd dog chained to a ring with a steel chain. He came across a constantly ringing telephone. The phone rang and rang, and finally, Aureliano answered it; a woman's voice speaking English came from deep within. Aureliano told the woman that the strike was over, three thousand corpses had been thrown into the sea, the Banana Company had left, and Macondo had found peace after many years. These strolls brought him to the red-light district, once a place where bundles of banknotes were burned to fuel the revelry, now filled with streets more wretched and miserable than the others. In a few of the lanterns, red lights were still glowing. In the empty dance halls where dried wreaths dragged on the ground, pale-faced, plump French grandmothers and Babylonian madams, who had never been widowed by anyone, were still waiting by the gramophones. Aureliano did not encounter anyone who knew his lineage, not even Colonel Aureliano Buendia, except for the oldest of the West Indian natives. An elderly native with hair like cotton, giving his face the appearance of a photo negative, continued to sit at his door and sing evening hymns. Aureliano was speaking in the broken local language he had learned in a few weeks with the man, and sometimes he would join the man in eating chicken head soup made by the man's great-grandchild. The local's great-grandchild was a broad-shouldered, wide-hipped, melon-breasted black woman with a round head surrounded by curly hair that resembled the chainmail coifs of medieval warriors. Her name was Nigromanta. In those days, Aureliano was getting by by selling the silverware, candlesticks, and other small items in the house. When he was mostly penniless, he would sweet-talk the scavengers at the back of the market to get the chicken heads they were going to throw away and take them to Nigromanta to make soup with purslane and mint. After the great-grandfather died, Aureliano stopped visiting their house. He would encounter Nigromanta under the dark-shaded almond trees, whistling like wild animals to chase away the owls. Often, he would stand beside her, talking in the native language about chicken head soup and other aspects of poverty, and he would stay until the woman told him that his presence was scaring away her customers. Although Aureliano sometimes felt a desire within him and Nigromanta seemed to him like the accumulation of a shared sense of nostalgia, he never slept with her. That's why when Amaranta Ursula came to Macondo and embraced Aureliano in a sisterly manner, taking his breath away, Aureliano's hand had never touched a woman's hand before. Whenever Aureliano saw Amaranta Ursula, especially when she tried to teach him the latest dances, his bones would collapse as if they were a sponge being squeezed, just like his great-grandfather's knees buckled in front of Pilar Ternera, who used the excuse of playing cards in the granary. Aureliano buried himself a bit more in the manuscripts to escape this torment and began to avoid the pure interest of this aunt who poisoned his nights. But the more he avoided the woman, the more he eagerly awaited her muffled laughter rising at the most unexpected hours and from the most unlikely places in the house, her purring with satisfaction like a cat in the climax of her lovemaking, and her cheerful songs. One night, while the couple was frolicking on the workbench in the silver workshop, ten meters away from Aureliano's bed, they knocked over and broke the bottles on the bench with the shaking of their unhinged bodies, and they completed their lovemaking in the pool of spilled hydrochloric acid. Aureliano couldn't sleep all night, and moreover, he spent the next day crying with rage and burning with fever. The first night Aureliano waited for Nigromanta in the shade of the almond trees seemed to drag on endlessly. Aureliano felt a tingling all over his body with excitement and doubt, clutching the fifty cents he had from the peso he asked from Amaranta Ursula. He had taken the money not because he needed it, but to involve Amaranta Ursula in this matter, to humiliate her, to, in a way, turn her into a prostitute in this adventure. Nigromanta took Aureliano to her room, illuminated by pretentious candelabras and stained with the marks of sordid loves, and gave him her hardened, soulless body. This body, which was preparing to dismiss Aureliano like a timid child, suddenly encountered a strong man seeking harmony with the vibrations emanating from within.",21.48,21.369,"Although she had not noticed it, the return of Amaranta Úrsula brought about a radical change in Aureliano's life. After the death of José Arcadio, he had become a regular customer of the wise Catalan's bookstore. Moreover, the freedom he then enjoyed and the time he had at his disposal awakened a certain curiosity about the town, which he got to know without amazement. He wandered through the dusty and lonely streets, examining with a more scientific than human interest the interiors of the ruined houses, the metal meshes of the windows broken by rust and dying birds, and the inhabitants weighed down by memories. He tried to reconstruct with his imagination the ravaged splendor of the old banana company town, whose dry pool was filled to the brim with rotting men's shoes and women's slippers, and in whose houses, dismantled by weeds, he found the skeleton of a German shepherd still tied to a ring with a steel chain, and a telephone that kept ringing, ringing, ringing, until he picked it up, understood what a distressed and distant woman was asking in English, and answered that yes, the strike was over, the three thousand dead had been thrown into the sea, the banana company had left, and Macondo had finally been at peace for many years. Those wanderings led him to the prostrate tolerance district, where in other times bundles of bills were burned to liven up the cumbiamba, and which was then a maze of streets more afflicted and miserable than the others, with some red lights still on, and barren dance halls adorned with scraps of garlands, where the wan and fat widows of no one, the French great-grandmothers, and the Babylonian matriarchs continued to wait beside the victrolas. Aureliano found no one who remembered his family, not even Colonel Aureliano Buendía, except for the oldest of the Antillean blacks, an old man whose cottony head gave him the appearance of a photographic negative, who kept singing the gloomy psalms of the evening on the porch of the house. Aureliano conversed with him in the convoluted Papiamento he learned in a few weeks, and sometimes shared the rooster head broth prepared by the great-granddaughter, a large black woman with solid bones, mare-like hips, and melon-like breasts, and a round, perfect head, armored by a hard cap of wiry hair that looked like a medieval warrior's coif. Her name was Nigromanta. At that time, Aureliano lived by selling cutlery, candlesticks, and other trinkets from the house. When he was penniless, which was most of the time, he managed to get the market stalls to give him the rooster heads they were going to throw in the trash, and he took them to Nigromanta to make soups enhanced with purslane and scented with mint. When the great-grandfather died, Aureliano stopped frequenting the house, but he met Nigromanta under the dark almond trees in the square, captivating the few night owls with her wild animal whistles. Many times he accompanied her, talking in Papiamento about rooster head soups and other delicacies of misery, and would have continued doing so if she had not made him realize that his company was driving away her clientele. Although he sometimes felt tempted, and although Nigromanta herself would have considered it a natural culmination of their shared nostalgia, he did not sleep with her. Thus, Aureliano was still a virgin when Amaranta Úrsula returned to Macondo and gave him a brotherly hug that left him breathless. Every time he saw her, and even worse when she taught him the latest dances, he felt the same helplessness of sponges in his bones that troubled his great-great-grandfather when Pilar Ternera made excuses with cards in the granary. Trying to quell the torment, he immersed himself more deeply in the parchments and avoided the innocent flattery of that aunt who poisoned his nights with effluvia of tribulation, but the more he avoided her, the more anxiously he awaited her gravelly laughter, her happy cat howls, and her songs of gratitude, agonizing with love at any hour and in the least expected places in the house. One night, ten meters from his bed, in the silversmith's shop, the disordered-bellied spouses shattered the glass case and ended up making love in a pool of muriatic acid. Aureliano not only couldn't sleep a minute, but he spent the next day feverish, sobbing with rage. The arrival of the first night he waited for Nigromanta under the shadow of the almond trees seemed eternal, pierced by the icy needles of uncertainty, and clutching in his fist the peso with fifty cents he had asked from Amaranta Úrsula, not so much because he needed it, but to complicate her, debase her, and prostitute her in some way with his adventure. Nigromanta took him to her room lit with superstitious candles, to her scissor bed with the canvas stained by bad loves, and to her body of a fierce, hardened, soulless bitch, who prepared to dispatch him as if he were a frightened child, and suddenly found herself with a man whose tremendous power demanded a seismic readjustment of her insides.",46.691,46.635
787,"They became lovers. Aureliano would spend his mornings deciphering parchments and at siesta time he would go to the bedroom where Nigromanta was waiting for him, to teach him first how to do it like earthworms, then like snails, and finally like crabs, until she had to leave him and lie in wait for vagabond loves. Several weeks passed before Aureliano discovered that around her waist she wore a small belt that seemed to be made out of a cello string, but which was hard as steel and had no end, as if it had been born and grown with her. Almost always, between loves, they would eat naked in the bed, in the hallucinating heat and under the daytime stars that the rust had caused to shine on the zinc ceiling. It was the first time that Nigromanta had had a steady man, a bone crusher from head to toe, as she herself said, dying with laughter, and she had even begun to get romantic illusions when Aureliano confided in her about his repressed passion for Amaranta Úrsula, which he had not been able to cure with the substitution but which was twisting him inside all the more as experience broadened the horizons of love. After that Nigromanta continued to receive him with the same warmth as ever but she made him pay for her services so strictly that when Aureliano had no money she would make an addition to his bill, which was not figured in numbers but by marks that she made with her thumbnail behind the door. At sundown, while she was drifting through the shadows in the square, Aureliano, was going along the porch like a stranger, scarcely greeting Amaranta Úrsula and Gaston, who usually dined at that time, and shutting herself up in his room again, unable to read or write or even think because of the anxiety brought on by the laughter, the whispering, the preliminary frolics, and then the explosions of agonizing happiness that capped the nights in the house. That was his life two years before Gaston began to wait for the airplane, and it went on the same way on the afternoon that he went to the bookstore of the wise Catalonian and found four ranting boys in a heated argument about the methods used to kill cockroaches in the Middle Ages. The old bookseller, knowing about Aureliano’s love for books that had been read only by the Venerable Bede, urged him with a certain fatherly malice to get into the discussion, and without even taking a breath, he explained that the cockroach, the oldest winged insect on the face of the earth, had already been the victim of slippers in the Old Testament, but that since the species was definitely resistant to any and all methods of extermination, from tomato dices with borax to flour and sugar, and with its one thousand six hundred three varieties had resisted the most ancient, tenacious, and pitiless persecution that mankind had unleashed against any living thing since the beginnings, including man himself, to such an extent that just as an instinct for reproduction was attributed to humankind, so there must have been another one more definite and pressing, which was the instinct to kill cockroaches, and if the latter had succeeded in escaping human ferocity it was because they had taken refuge in the shadows, where they became invulnerable because of man’s congenital fear of the dark, but on the other hand they became susceptible to the glow of noon, so that by the Middle Ages already, and in present times, and per omnia secula seculorum, the only effective method for killing cockroaches was the glare of the sun.","Aureliano and Nigromanta had an affair. Aureliano spent his mornings reading symbols on pieces of parchment, and in the afternoons he would go to the stimulating bedroom where Nigromanta awaited to teach him one trick after another until she had to leave Aureliano to go hunt for other ""stray cattle. "" It was only after a few weeks that Aureliano discovered that Nigromanta had a small string around her waist, as if made from violin strings but as tough as steel, with no visible seam because it had grown with her. Almost always, between their bouts of lovemaking, they would eat naked on the bed, in the terrible heat and under the stars visible through the rusted holes in the tin roof. For the first time, Nigromanta had a steady man, a ""stake"" as she laughingly called it, which led her to start having illusions about love. These illusions only ended when Aureliano confessed his unfulfilled longing for Amaranta Úrsula, a longing that Nigromanta could not quell. On the contrary, his torment grew as his experiences broadened his horizons of love. Thus, although she continued to receive Aureliano passionately, Nigromanta began to demand payment fiercely. When Aureliano had no money, she kept a tally, not with numbers but with scratches on the back of the door. In the evenings, while Nigromanta wandered in the dark around the square, Aureliano paced the hallway like a stranger in the house. He would briefly greet Amaranta Úrsula and Gastón—who dined at that hour every day—then return to his room, close the door, and find himself unable to read, write, or even think, restless from the sounds of playful laughter and the subsequent bursts of pleasure from the couple throughout the night. That was Aureliano's life for two years before Gastón began waiting for the airplane to arrive, and it continued until one afternoon when Aureliano went to the bookstore of the wise old Catalonian and encountered four talkative young men fiercely debating medieval cockroach extermination methods. The bookstore owner, knowing Aureliano's interest in places previously read only by Saint Bede the Venerable, cleverly invited him to join the discussion. Aureliano then launched into a monologue, explaining that cockroaches, according to the Old Testament, were the earliest winged creatures on earth and had died the most from being crushed by slippers. However, they were completely resistant to any extermination method, from borax-mixed tomatoes to flour mixed with sugar. Since ancient times, one thousand six hundred and three types of cockroaches had withstood humanity's relentless and merciless pursuit, a pursuit as persistent as humanity's own self-destructive tendencies. Along with the instinct to procreate, humans also had an instinct to kill cockroaches. If cockroaches had survived humanity's wrath, it was because they hid in the dark, where they were safe, as humans have an innate fear of darkness. Conversely, cockroaches feared the midday sun, so the only effective method to exterminate them in medieval times, now, and forever, was sunlight.",16.019,15.84,"They began to make love. Aureliano spent his mornings deciphering manuscripts, and when it was time for a nap, he would go to the room where Nigromanta was waiting for him. The woman first taught him to make love like worms, then like snails, then like crabs, and finally, she would leave him to wait to be loved like bandits. A week after they started making love, Aureliano noticed that the woman had a thin belt around her waist, as hard as steel, resembling a cello string. The belt had no end; it was as if it had been wrapped around her waist at birth, growing and expanding with her. Almost always, in between their lovemaking, they ate, lying naked in bed, snacking under the zinc roof that shone like daytime stars amidst the drug-like heat and rust stains. For the first time, Nigromanta had a steady lover, a man who, as she laughingly put it, loved her from head to toe with bone-cracking intensity. Nigromanta was gradually succumbing to romantic fantasies. Meanwhile, Aureliano confessed his secret passion for Amaranta Ursula to her. His lovemaking with Nigromanta had not made him forget this passion; on the contrary, as his experiences broadened his horizons of love, his passion began to twist and knot inside him. Even after Aureliano revealed his secret love, Nigromanta continued to treat him with the same closeness and warmth, but she never missed a penny of the money she received for her services. When Aureliano had no money, Nigromanta would add another mark to the tally she kept behind the door, rather than writing it down in a ledger. As the sun set, Nigromanta would go out to wander in the shadows of the field, while Aureliano, usually at that hour, would slip into the veranda like a stranger without even greeting Amaranta Ursula and Gaston, who were typically having dinner. Then he would lock himself in his room, unable to read, write, or even think due to the excitement he felt from the sounds of laughter, whispers, flirtations, coquetry, and ultimately the bursts of happiness that filled the house at night. Two years before Gaston started waiting for the airplane, Aureliano's life was already like this, and it was the same on the day he went to the wise Catalonian's bookstore. That day, when Aureliano entered the store, there were four talkative children inside engaged in a discussion about medieval methods of killing cockroaches. The old bookseller, knowing Aureliano's interest in old books, mischievously drew him into the discussion with a fatherly cunning. Aureliano immediately began to recount what he knew on the subject. He explained that the cockroach is the oldest species of winged insect on earth, that even in the Old Testament there is mention of these insects being crushed by sandals, but that these creatures are very resilient and that all the killing methods tried, from tomatoes mixed with borax to sugary flour, have failed, that there are exactly one thousand six hundred and three different species of these animals that have resisted the oldest and most relentless war humans have waged against all kinds of living creatures since the world began, that if the primary fundamental instinct of humans is the urge to reproduce, the second should be considered the urge to kill cockroaches, that cockroaches save themselves by hiding in dark places, taking advantage of the human natural fear of darkness, but in doing so, they have also become unable to withstand the midday sun, and that since the Middle Ages, the most effective way to kill cockroaches, per omnia secula seculorum, has been sunlight, he rattled off in one breath.",17.522,17.324,"They became lovers. Aureliano spent the morning deciphering parchments, and at siesta time he would go to the soporific bedroom where Nigromanta awaited him to teach him first to move like worms, then like snails, and finally like crabs, until he had to leave her to seek out lost loves. Several weeks passed before Aureliano discovered that she had around her waist a band that seemed to be made of cello string, but was as hard as steel and had no end, because it had been born and grown with her. Almost always, between love-making sessions, they ate naked in bed, in the hallucinating heat and under the daytime stars that the rust was making appear on the zinc roof. It was the first time Nigromanta had a steady man, a full-time lover, as she herself said laughing to death, and she even began to have heart illusions when Aureliano confided to her his repressed passion for Amaranta Úrsula, which he had not managed to remedy with substitution, but which was increasingly twisting his insides as experience broadened the horizon of love. Then Nigromanta continued to receive him with the same warmth as always, but she made him pay for the services with such rigor that when Aureliano had no money, she would charge it to an account she kept not with numbers but with little lines she traced with her thumbnail behind the door. At dusk, while she stayed loitering in the shadows of the square, Aureliano would pass through the corridor like a stranger, barely greeting Amaranta Úrsula and Gastón who usually dined at that hour, and would lock himself in his room, unable to read or write, or even think, due to the anxiety caused by the laughter, the whispers, the preliminary frolicking, and then the explosions of agonizing happiness that filled the nights of the house. That was his life two years before Gastón began to wait for the airplane, and it remained the same the afternoon he went to the wise Catalan's bookstore and found four young men ranting, engrossed in a discussion about methods of killing cockroaches in the Middle Ages. The old bookseller, knowing Aureliano's fondness for books that only Bede the Venerable had read, urged him with a certain paternal malice to join the controversy, and he didn't even take a breath to explain that cockroaches, the oldest winged insect on earth, had already been the favorite victim of sandal strikes in the Old Testament, but as a species, they were definitively refractory to any method of extermination, from tomato slices with borax to flour with sugar, as their one thousand six hundred and three varieties had resisted the most remote, tenacious, and ruthless persecution that man had unleashed since his origins against any living being, including man himself, to the extent that just as the human race was attributed an instinct for reproduction, it should be attributed another more defined and pressing one, which was the instinct to kill cockroaches, and that if they had managed to escape human ferocity, it was because they had taken refuge in the darkness, where they became invulnerable due to man's congenital fear of the dark, but in turn became susceptible to the splendor of midday, so that already in the Middle Ages, currently, and for centuries to come, the only effective method to kill cockroaches was solar dazzling.",43.585,43.499
788,"That encyclopedic coincidence was the beginning of a great friendship. Aureliano continued getting together in the afternoon with the four arguers, whose names were Álvaro, Germán, Alfonso, and Gabriel, the first and last friends that he ever had in his life. For a man like him, holed up in written reality, those stormy sessions that began in the bookstore and ended at dawn in the brothels were a revelation. It had never occurred to him until then to think that literature was the best plaything that had ever been invented to make fun of people, as Álvaro demonstrated during one night of revels. Some time would have to pass before Aureliano realized that such arbitrary attitudes had their origins in the example of the wise Catalonian, for whom wisdom was worth nothing if it could not be used to invent a way of preparing chick peas.","That encyclopedic fatalistic theory was the basis for a deep friendship among these young people. Since then, every afternoon Auréliano would meet the four argumentative young men, namely Anvaro, Hecman, Anphonso, and Gabriel, his first and also his last friends in life. For a man who had confined himself to books like Auréliano, the stormy study sessions, starting at the bookstore at six in the evening and ending at the brothels in the early morning, were a revelation. Until then, Auréliano had not thought that literature was a game devised to mock others, as Anvaro had shown him during a night of revelry. It took some time for Auréliano to realize that many oddities stemmed from the example of the wise old man from Catalonia. To him, knowledge had no value unless it was used to invent a method for making soy milk.",15.421,14.61,"This encyclopedic information marked the beginning of a great friendship. Aureliano began meeting in the afternoons with these children named Alvaro, German, Alfonso, and Gabriel, who were the first and last friends he made in his life. For someone like Aureliano, buried in written truths, these noisy, argumentative revelries that started in the bookstore and ended in brothels at dawn were an unprecedented novelty. As Alvaro mentioned during one of these night revelries, the idea that literature was the best amusement invented to mock people had never occurred to Aureliano until that day. After a while, Aureliano realized that the wise Catalan was the one who exemplified this carefree behavior. The Catalan was a person who believed that a mind incapable of finding a new way to cook chickpeas was worthless.",22.813,22.251,"That encyclopedic fatalism was the beginning of a great friendship. Aureliano continued meeting every afternoon with the four debaters, who were named Álvaro, Germán, Alfonso, and Gabriel, the first and last friends he had in his life.

789,"The afternoon on which Aureliano gave his lecture on cockroaches, the argument ended up in the house of the girls who went to bed because of hunger, a brothel of lies on the outskirts of Macondo. The proprietress was a smiling mamasanta, tormented by a mania for opening and closing doors. Her eternal smile seemed to have been brought on by the credulity of her customers, who accepted as something certain an establishment that did not exist except in the imagination, because even the tangible things there were unreal: the furniture that fell apart when one sat on it, the disemboweled phonograph with a nesting hen inside, the garden of paper flowers, the calendars going back to the years before the arrival of the banana company, the frames with prints cut out of magazines that had never been published. Even the timid little whores who came from the neighborhood: when the proprietress informed them that customers had arrived they were nothing but an invention. They would appear without any greeting in their little flowered dresses left over from days when they were five years younger, and they took them off with the same innocence with which they had put them on, and in the paroxysms of love they would exclaim good heavens, look how that roof is falling in, and as soon as they got their peso and fifty cents they would spend it on a roll with cheese that the proprietress sold them, smiling more than ever, because only she knew that that meal was not true either. Aureliano, whose world at that time began with Melquíades’ parchments and ended in Nigromanta’s bed, found a stupid cure for timidity in the small imaginary brothel. At first he could get nowhere, in rooms where the proprietress would enter during the best moments of love and make all sorts of comments about the intimate charms of the protagonists. But with time he began to get so familiar with those misfortunes of the world that on one night that was more unbalanced than the others he got undressed in the small reception room and ran through the house balancing a bottle of beer on his inconceivable maleness. He was the one who made fashionable the extravagances that the proprietress celebrated with her eternal smile, without protesting, without believing in them just as when Germán tried to burn the house down to show that it did not exist, and as when Alfonso wrung the neck of the parrot and threw it into the pot where the chicken stew was beginning to boil.","The afternoon when Aureliano explained about cockroaches, the debate ended at the house of the girls who sold their bodies to make a living, which was a ghostly brothel on the outskirts of Macondo. The owner of the house was a smiling woman, always worried about opening and closing the doors. Her perpetual smile seemed to be created by the gullibility of the patrons, who firmly believed that this brothel was real and solid, even though it actually only existed in their imagination, because even the tangible objects there were not real: the chairs would fall apart when someone sat on them, the turntable had a hen sitting on eggs, the garden consisted of paper flowers, the calendar was from years long past, from the time when the banana company first arrived, and the pictures were cut from magazines that had never been printed. Even the shy prostitutes who ran over from the neighboring houses when she announced there were customers were not real people. These girls appeared without greeting anyone, wearing floral dresses from when they were five years old or younger, which they took off with the same innocent gestures as when they put them on, and at the height of passion, they would exclaim in surprise about the intensity, saying to look at the ceiling collapsing, and the next day, after receiving one and a half pesos, they would spend all the money on a cake and a piece of cheese that the owner sold them, at which point she was happier than ever because only she knew that even those things were not real food. Aureliano, whose world at that time began with the leather-bound books full of letters and ended at Nigromanta's bed, found in that ghostly brothel a foolish remedy for his shyness. At first, Aureliano did not dare enter a room where the owner would often walk in at the best moments of lovemaking, commenting on all sorts of pleasures of the participants. But gradually he became accustomed to those earthly delights, to the point that on one of the wildest nights, he stripped off his clothes in the reception room, walking around the house while balancing a beer bottle on his unusually large male parts. It was Aureliano who invented the bizarre games that the owner participated in with an unending smile, neither opposing nor believing those games were real, just as her attitude when Herman tried to burn the house down to prove it didn't exist, or when Alfonso twisted the parrot's neck and threw it into the boiling pot to start cooking the chicken.",20.708,20.478,"The night of the day Aureliano gave a speech to the cockroaches ended among the girls who sold their bodies to fill their stomachs in a brothel on the outskirts of Macondo. The madam who ran the house was a cheerful woman, eager to open and close doors. Looking at her ever-present smile, one might think she was laughing at the customers' naivety, mocking them for believing this place, which existed beyond dreams, was real. Because even the tangible objects in the house were far from being real; when you sat on the couches, they would fall apart, a chicken had made a nest inside the broken gramophone, the flowers in the garden were made of paper, the calendars on the walls showed years from before the arrival of the Banana Company, pictures cut out from never-published magazines were framed and hung up. When Mama announced the arrival of customers, even the timid little whores from the surrounding houses would come out. They would enter without greeting, wearing their shrunken, floral dresses from five years ago, and take them off as innocently as they had put them on. In the heat of passion, they would cry out, 'Oh my God, the ceiling is about to collapse,' and as soon as they received their one and a half pesos, they would run straight to Mama to spend the money on the cheese pastries she sold. Mama would grin again, knowing that even the pastries weren't real. During that time, Aureliano, whose world began with Melquiades' manuscripts and ended in Nigromanta's bed, overcame his shyness in this small, dreamlike brothel. At first, in the rooms where the mother would burst in at the most beautiful moment of lovemaking and enumerate her daughters' hidden charms, Aureliano could not achieve anything. But over time, he got so used to these inevitable troubles of the world that one night, more unbalanced and more reckless compared to other nights, he stripped completely naked in the small sitting room and walked around the entire house balancing a beer bottle on his astonishingly large male organ. It was Aureliano who made these wild entertainments, which the mother participated in with that constant smile, without ever resisting and without ever believing, a fashionable trend. Even when German, claiming that the house didn't actually exist, tried to set it on fire to prove his point, and when Alfonso tore off the parrot's neck and threw it into the boiling chicken stew, mama's smile never changed.",15.369,15.086,"The afternoon when Aureliano lectured about cockroaches, the discussion ended at the house of the young girls who slept with men out of hunger, a sham brothel in the outskirts of Macondo. The owner was a smiling madam, tormented by the mania of opening and closing doors. Her eternal smile seemed provoked by the gullibility of the clients, who accepted as real an establishment that existed only in imagination, because there even tangible things were unreal: the furniture that fell apart when sat upon, the gutted victrola inside which a hen was incubating, the garden of paper flowers, the calendars from years before the arrival of the banana company, the pictures with lithographs cut out from magazines that were never published. Even the timid little prostitutes who came from the neighborhood when the owner informed them that clients had arrived were pure invention. They appeared without greeting, wearing the little flowered dresses from five years earlier, and took them off with the same innocence with which they had put them on, and in the paroxysm of love they exclaimed in astonishment what a shame, look how that roof is falling, and as soon as they received their fifty cents they spent it on a piece of bread and cheese sold to them by the owner, more smiling than ever, because only she knew that even that food was not real. Aureliano, whose world at that time began with Melquíades' parchments and ended in Nigromanta's bed, found in the imaginary little brothel a donkey's cure for shyness. At first, he couldn't get anywhere, in rooms where the owner would enter at the best moments of love and make all kinds of comments about the intimate charms of the protagonists. But over time he became so familiar with those mishaps of the world that one night more unhinged than the others he undressed in the reception room and walked through the house balancing a bottle of beer on his inconceivable manhood. It was he who set the trend for the extravagances that the owner celebrated with her eternal smile, without protesting, without believing in them, just like when Germán tried to burn down the house to prove it didn't exist, or when Alfonso twisted the parrot's neck and threw it into the pot where the chicken stew was beginning to boil.",43.57,43.445
790,"Although Aureliano felt himself linked to the four friends by a common affection and a common solidarity, even to the point where he thought of them as if they were one person, he was closer to Gabriel than to the others. The link was born on the night when he casually mentioned Colonel Aureliano Buendía and Gabriel was the only one who did not think that he was making fun of somebody. Even the proprietress, who normally did not take part in the conversation argued with a madam’s wrathful passion that Colonel Aureliano Buendía, of whom she had indeed heard speak at some time, was a figure invented by the government as a pretext for killing Liberals. Gabriel, on the other hand, did not doubt the reality of Colonel Aureliano Buendía because he had been a companion in arms and inseparable friend of his great-great-grandfather Colonel Gerineldo Márquez. Those fickle tricks of memory were even more critical when the killing of the workers was brought up. Every time that Aureliano mentioned the matter, not only the proprietress but some people older than she would repudiate the myth of the workers hemmed in at the station and the train with two hundred cars loaded with dead people, and they would even insist that, after all, everything had been set forth in judicial documents and in primary-school textbooks: that the banana company had never existed. So that Aureliano and Gabriel were linked by a kind of complicity based on real facts that no one believed in, and which had affected their lives to the point that both of them found themselves off course in the tide of a world that had ended and of which only the nostalgia remained. Gabriel would sleep wherever time overtook him. Aureliano put him up several times in the silver workshop, but he would spend his nights awake, disturbed by the noise of the dead people who walked through the bedrooms until dawn. Later he turned him over to Nigromanta, who took him to her well-used room when she was free and put down his account with vertical marks behind the door in the few spaces left free by Aureliano’s debts.","Although Aureliano felt a unique bond of friendship and affection with the entire group, to the extent that he thought the other four were just one, he was still closer to Gabrien than to the other three. This bond arose on the night when Aureliano accidentally mentioned Colonel Aureliano Buendía, and Gabrien was the only one who did not believe that Aureliano was mocking anyone. Even the hostess, who usually did not interfere in conversations, raised her voice to argue that Colonel Aureliano Buendía, whom she had indeed heard of a few times, was just a character invented by the government to justify killing the Liberals. On the contrary, Gabrien did not show any doubt about the truth of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, because the colonel was a comrade and a close friend of his ancestor, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez. The memories, not entirely intentional, became even more profound when they talked about the massacre of the workers. Whenever Aureliano touched on that topic, not only the hostess but also some people older than her denied the rumors about the workers being surrounded at the station, about the two hundred-car train carrying corpses, and they even insisted on believing what was recorded in legal documents and in elementary school books that the banana company never existed at all. Aureliano and Gabrien bonded through a sympathy built on real events that no one believed, events that affected their lives to the extent that they found themselves adrift in the turmoil of a devastated world, where only a sense of longing remained. Gabrien slept anywhere when he was sleepy. A few times Aureliano let him sleep in the goldsmith's workshop, but there he stayed awake all night because of the headaches caused by the noises made by the dead who roamed the bedrooms all night. After that, Aureliano entrusted Gabrien to Nigromanta. In her free time, she took Gabrien to her guest room in the brothel and kept track of debts by marking vertical lines on the back of the door, in the few remaining empty spaces after recording Aureliano's debts.",17.752,17.42,"Although Aureliano was bound to the four friends with a common love and solidarity, and sometimes saw them as a single person, he still felt closer to Gabriel than to the others. This closeness was born on the evening when Aureliano spoke of Colonel Aureliano Buendia and only Gabriel took him seriously. Even mama, who usually did not participate in conversations, opposed him, fiercely arguing that there was no such person as Colonel Aureliano Buendia, whom she had once heard of, and that the government had invented such a name as an excuse to kill the Liberals. However, Gabriel had no doubt that Colonel Aureliano Buendia had really lived. Because the colonel was both a comrade-in-arms and a close friend of his great-grandfather, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez. When it came to talking about the killing of the workers, the forgetfulness of those around him would reach its peak. Whenever Aureliano brought up the subject, neither his mother nor the older people would accept what Aureliano said; they claimed that the workers trapped at the station and the train with two hundred carriages full of corpses were just a myth, that everything was documented in legal records, even included in elementary school books, and they insisted that the Banana Company had never been established. Thus, Aureliano and Gabriel grew closer through a bond based on truths that no one believed. These truths had so profoundly affected their lives that they both remained in a world that had ended and was only longed for, while the everyday world receded with the ebbing waters, leaving them in this realm. Gabriel would sleep wherever he happened to be. Aureliano laid him down several times in the silver workshop. However, Gabriel, disturbed by the noise of the dead wandering around the bedrooms until morning, could not sleep at all. Later, Aureliano entrusted Gabriel to Nigromanta. When Nigromanta was free, she would take him to her overly used room, and behind the door, she kept track of Gabriel's tally in the places left uncovered by Aureliano's debts.",21.207,20.94,"Although Aureliano felt connected to the four friends by the same affection and solidarity, to the point that he thought of them as if they were one, he was closer to Gabriel than to the others.

Aureliano accommodated him several times in the silver workshop, but he spent the nights awake, disturbed by the bustle of the dead who roamed the bedrooms until dawn.

791,"In spite of their disordered life, the whole group tried to do something permanent at the urging of the wise Catalonian. It was he, with his experience as a former professor of classical literature and his storehouse of rare books, who got them to spend a whole night in search of the thirty-seventh dramatic situation in a town where no one had any interest any more in going beyond primary school. Fascinated by the discovery of friendship, bewildered by the enchantments of a world which had been forbidden to him by Fernanda’s meanness, Aureliano abandoned the scrutiny of the parchments precisely when they were beginning to reveal themselves as predictions in coded lines of poetry. But the subsequent proof that there was time enough for everything without having to give up the brothels gave him the drive to return to Melquíades’ room, having decided not to flag in his efforts until he had discovered the last keys. That was during the time that Gaston began to wait for the airplane and Amaranta Úrsula was so lonely that one morning she appeared in the room.","Although living very messily, the whole group also tried to do something meaningful and lasting, as requested by the wise man from Catalonia.

Enchanted by the discovery of friendship, mesmerized by the hypnosis of a world previously obscured by Fernanda's narrow-mindedness, Aureliano abandoned the deciphering of the inscriptions on the parchment, right at the moment when the mysterious verses had begun to reveal themselves to him. But after being certain that there was still enough time to do everything without having to give up those brothels, Aureliano regained the will to return to Melquíades' room, deciding not to be discouraged until he had deciphered the final codes.

The Catalonian, enriched by the experiments that came from once being a professor of classical literature and his shop filled with rare books, led them, and in this town where no one read beyond elementary school, he made five youths research what the thirty-seventh dramatic situation was until morning. Aureliano, enchanted by the magic of discovering what is called friendship and reaching the beauties of a world forbidden by Fernanda's wicked heart, stopped working on the manuscripts just as they were beginning to unravel as prophecies woven into encrypted poetic verses. However, as time passed and he realized that there was enough time for everything without giving up the brothels, he returned to Melquiades' room with the decision not to abandon his efforts before finding the final clues by deciphering the writings. At that time, Gaston had dedicated himself to waiting for the plane, and Amaranta Ursula was suffocating from loneliness.",14.873,14.219,"Despite his disordered life, the entire group tried to do something enduring, at the behest of the wise Catalan. It was he, with his experience as a former professor of classical literature and his repository of rare books, who had put them in a position to spend an entire night searching for the thirty-seventh dramatic situation, in a town where no one was interested or had the means to go beyond primary school. Fascinated by the discovery of friendship, dazed by the enchantments of a world that had been denied to him by Fernanda's pettiness, Aureliano abandoned the scrutiny of the parchments, precisely when they began to reveal themselves to him as predictions in coded verses. But the subsequent realization that there was enough time for everything without having to give up the brothels gave him the courage to return to Melquíades' room, determined not to falter in his endeavor until he discovered the final keys. That was during the days when Gastón began to await the airplane, and Amaranta Úrsula was so alone that one morning she appeared in the room.",49.787,49.517

793,"She was irresistible, with a dress she had designed and one of the long shad-vertebra necklaces that she herself had made. She had stopped using the leash, convinced of her husband’s faithfulness, and for the first time since her return she seemed to have a moment of ease. Aureliano did not need to see her to know that she had arrived. She put her elbows on the table, so close and so helpless that Aureliano heard the deep sound of her bones, and she became interested in the parchments. Trying to overcome his disturbance, he grasped at the voice that he was losing, the life that was leaving him, the memory that was turning into a petrified polyp, and he spoke to her about the priestly destiny of Sanskrit, the scientific possibility of seeing the future showing through in time as one sees what is written on the back of a sheet of paper through the light, the necessity of deciphering the predictions so that they would not defeat themselves, and the Centuries of Nostradamus and the destruction of Cantabria predicted by Saint Milanus. Suddenly, without interrupting the chat, moved by an impulse that had been sleeping in him since his origins, Aureliano put his hand on hers, thinking that that final decision would put an end to his doubts. She grabbed his index finger with the affectionate innocence with which she had done so in childhood, however, and she held it while he kept on answering questions. They remained like that, linked by icy index fingers that did not transmit anything in any way until she awoke from her momentary dream and slapped her forehead with her hand. “The ants!” she exclaimed. And then she forgot about the manuscripts, went to the door with a dance step, and from there she threw Aureliano a kiss with the tips of her fingers as she had said good-bye to her father on the afternoon when they sent her to Brussels.","Amaranta Úrsula was unbearably beautiful, she wore clothes she had made herself and one of the long necklaces she had crafted from fish vertebrae. Amaranta Úrsula had relaxed her husband, believing in his fidelity, and for the first time since her return, she seemed a bit at ease. Aureliano didn't need to look to know that she had arrived. Amaranta Úrsula leaned her elbows on the table, very close and very gently, making Aureliano feel the murmurs in her bones, and Amaranta Úrsula asked about the inscribed parchments. Aureliano tried to master his confusion, regain his voice, vitality, and memory as if they had vanished, and spoke to her about the fate of Sanskrit, about the scientific possibility of seeing the future clearly in time as one can read the writing on the back of a paper when holding the front side with writing towards the light, about the necessity of decoding the prophecies to avoid self-defeat, about the Prophecies of Nostradamus, and about the destruction of Cantabria foretold by Saint Midan. Suddenly, while still speaking, as if spurred by a long-dormant impulse, Aureliano placed his hand on Amaranta Úrsula's and believed that the final decision would end the turmoil. But Amaranta Úrsula took his index finger with a tender, innocent gesture that she had often used with him during their childhood, and she kept holding it while Aureliano continued to answer his own questions. In this way, they connected through a cold, unfeeling index finger, until Amaranta Úrsula seemed to awaken from a fleeting dream and slapped her forehead. ""The ants!"" she exclaimed. Then Amaranta Úrsula forgot about the writings on the parchment and took a light, graceful step towards the door, and from there she raised her finger to her mouth and blew Aureliano a kiss, like the one she had sent her father on that distant afternoon when she left for Brussels.",22.634,22.352,"She had an irresistible appearance with the dress she designed herself and the necklace she arranged herself that extended down to her belly. Since she now firmly believed in her husband's loyalty to her, she had loosened the reins and, for the first time since she arrived, she seemed to have some free time. Aureliano realized he had entered the room without needing to see him. Amaranta Ursula rested her elbows on the table. She looked so helpless, she was so close that Aureliano could hear the voice coming from within her bones. Amaranta Ursula was interested in the manuscripts. Aureliano, trying to overcome his nervousness, clung desperately to his fading voice, his ebbing life, and his memories turning into a petrified mass of coral. He spoke to Amaranta Ursula about the fate of Sanskrit, how in the light of time the future could be read just as writings on the back of a paper held up to the light could be read in reverse, how prophecies needed to be deciphered to prevent them from destroying themselves, about Nostradamus's centuries, and Saint Milanus's foretelling of the destruction of Cantabria. At one point, without pausing his speech, Aureliano placed his hand on Amaranta Ursula's, driven by an instinct that had been dormant within him since birth and thinking it would put an end to the doubts of his firm decision. Amaranta Ursula, just as she did in her childhood, caught his index finger with innocence and did not let go as long as Aureliano answered her questions. They sat for a long time with their icy index fingers intertwined, sharing nothing with each other. Finally, Amaranta Ursula woke from her momentary reverie and slapped her hand on her forehead. -Ants! she exclaimed. She forgot about the manuscripts and everything, ran to the door dancing, and blew a kiss to Aureliano with her fingertips, just as she had done to her father the day they sent her to Brussels.",18.365,18.008,"She was irresistible, with her invented dress, and one of the long necklaces made of shad vertebrae, which she herself crafted. She had given up the fishing line, convinced of her husband's fidelity, and for the first time since their return, she seemed to have a moment of leisure. Aureliano wouldn't have needed to see her to know she had arrived. She leaned on the worktable, so close and defenseless that Aureliano perceived the deep murmur of her bones, and she took an interest in the parchments. Trying to overcome his turmoil, he caught the voice that was escaping him, the life that was slipping away, the memory that was turning into a petrified polyp, and he spoke to her about the Levitical destiny of Sanskrit, the scientific possibility of seeing the future transparent in time as one sees the writing on the reverse of a paper against the light, the need to encrypt predictions so they wouldn't defeat themselves, and about Nostradamus' Centuries and the destruction of Cantabria announced by Saint Millán. Suddenly, without interrupting the conversation, driven by an impulse that had been dormant in him since his origins, Aureliano placed his hand over hers, believing that this final decision would put an end to his anxiety. However, she grabbed his index finger with the affectionate innocence with which she had done many times in childhood, and held it while he continued answering her questions. They remained like that, connected by an icy index finger that transmitted nothing in any direction, until she awoke from her momentary dream and slapped her forehead. ""The ants!"" she exclaimed.

795,"She continued going to the room occasionally when she had something to do in that part of the house and she would stay there for a few minutes while her husband continued to scrutinize the sky. Encouraged by that change, Aureliano stayed to eat with the family at that time as he had not done since the first months of Amaranta Úrsula’s return. Gaston was pleased. During the conversations after meals, which usually went on for more than an hour, he complained that his partners were deceiving him. They had informed him of the loading of the airplane on board a ship that did not arrive, and although his shipping agents insisted, that it would never arrive because it was not on the list of Caribbean ships, his partners insisted that the shipment was correct and they even insinuated that Gaston was lying to them in his letters. The correspondence reached such a degree of mutual suspicion that Gaston decided not to write again and he began to suggest the possibility of a quick trip to Brussels to clear things up and return with the airplane. The plan evaporated, however, as soon as Amaranta Úrsula reiterated her decision not to move from Macondo even if she lost a husband. During the first days Aureliano shared the general opinion that Gaston was a fool on a velocipede, and that brought on a vague feeling of pity. Later, when he obtained deeper information on the nature of men in the brothels, he thought that Gaston’s meekness had its origins in unbridled passion. But when he came to know him better and realized his true character was the opposite of his submissive conduct, he conceived the malicious suspicion that even the wait for the airplane was an act. Then he thought that Gaston was not as foolish as he appeared, but, quite the contrary, was a man of infinite steadiness, ability, and patience who had set about to conquer his wife with the weariness of eternal agreement, of never saying no, of simulating a limitless conformity, letting her become enmeshed in her own web until the day she could no longer bear the tedium of the illusions close at hand and would pack the bags herself to go back to Europe. Aureliano’s former pity turned into a violent dislike. Gaston’s system seemed so perverse to him, but at the same time so effective, that he ventured to warn Amaranta Úrsula. She made fun of his suspicions, however, without even noticing the heavy weight of love, uncertainty, and jealousy that he had inside. It had not occurred to her that she was arousing something more than fraternal affection in Aureliano until she pricked her finger trying to open a can of peaches and he dashed over to suck the blood out with an avidity and a devotion that sent a chill up her spine.","Whenever there was something to be done near Melquíades' room, Amaranta Úrsula would randomly enter that room and stay for a while, while her husband continued to observe the sky. This change gave rise to an illusion in Aureliano, from then on he ate with the family, which was different from the months when Amaranta Úrsula had just returned. He made Gastón feel comfortable. In the stories around the table after dinner, often lasting more than an hour, Gastón appeared distressed because his close friends had deceived him. They had informed Gastón that the airplane had been transferred to a ship that had not yet arrived, and although his acquaintances in maritime work assured him that the ship would never come because it was not listed among the ships in the Caribbean, his close friends insisted that their information was accurate, even hinting that Gastón had deceived them through his letters. The correspondence had made them so suspicious of each other that Gastón decided to stop writing and began to consider the possibility of going directly to Brussels to clarify everything and then return here with the airplane. But that plan was immediately deflated when Amaranta Úrsula reiterated her decision not to leave Macondo, even if it meant living without a husband. In the early days, Aureliano, like others, thought Gastón was a fool in a circus act, which made Aureliano feel a slight pity for him. Later, through his visits to brothels, he gained a deeper understanding of the nature of men and thought that Gastón's gentleness stemmed from a stubborn passion. But as he understood Gastón more deeply and realized that Gastón's true character was contrary to his meek behavior, Aureliano suspected that even Gastón's waiting for the airplane was a deceit. From then on, Aureliano believed that Gastón was not as naive as he appeared; on the contrary, he was an extremely patient, cunning, and calm man who planned to win over his wife by making her weary with complete satisfaction, always agreeing absolutely, leaving her entangled in her own web, until one day, unable to bear the boredom of reachable illusions any longer, she would pack her bags and return to Europe. Aureliano's previous pity turned into deep hatred. Aureliano found Gastón's plans and actions despicable yet effective, so he daringly told Amaranta Úrsula about it. But Amaranta Úrsula laughed at Aureliano's suspicion, showing no sign of a crack in her love, no wavering or jealousy in her heart. Amaranta Úrsula did not think she had stirred anything in Aureliano beyond sincere feelings until one day she cut her hand trying to open a jar of peach jam, and Aureliano rushed to suck the blood from her bleeding finger with such desire and longing that it made her shiver.",15.169,14.899,"After that day, whenever she had tasks on the side of the house where Aureliano's room was, she would stop by to see him, and while her husband continued to study the sky, Amaranta Ursula also began to linger for a few minutes by Aureliano's side. Encouraged by this change, Aureliano started joining the family table, which he had been avoiding since the first months of Amaranta Ursula's arrival. This pleased Gaston. In his conversations that lasted more than an hour after the meal, he kept complaining that his partners were deceiving him. His partners had informed him that they had loaded the plane onto a ship, whereas no such ship had ever arrived. And even though the shipping agency insisted that such a ship would never come because it would not operate on the Caribbean route, his partners claimed they had loaded the plane onto a ship that would come there, even accusing Gaston of lying. The correspondence became so filled with mutual suspicion and accusations that Gaston eventually began to consider going to Brussels for a short time to receive the plane and return. However, when Amaranta stated that she was determined not to step out of Macondo even at the cost of losing her husband, the topic of the plane was never brought up again. In the early days, like everyone else, Aureliano also saw Gaston as a crackpot with a velocipede, looking at him with vague pity. Later, as he frequented brothels and got to know men better, he thought that Gaston's quiet demeanor stemmed from an unrestrained lust. When she got to know Gaston closely and realized that his real personality was completely opposite to his mild-mannered appearance, she began to suspect that even Gaston's waiting for the plane was an act. Gaston was not as scatterbrained as he appeared; on the contrary, he must have been extremely consistent, very calculating, talented, and infinitely patient. He wasn't pressuring his wife to accept his wishes; he must have been trying to wear her down by exhausting her. Without opposing anything, without saying no or impossible to anything, he was showing endless compliance, patiently waiting for his wife to tire of the emptiness of the dreams she had built, to catch herself in the trap, pack her bags, and decide to return to Europe on her own. Aureliano's old feeling of pity was replaced by great anger and hatred. Gaston’s method seemed very wrong to him, but also very effective. In the end, he decided to warn Amaranta Ursula. Amaranta Ursula mocked his doubts without ever noticing the weight of love, indecision, and jealousy in his heart. Until the moment when Amaranta Ursula cut her finger while opening a can of peaches one day, and Aureliano rushed to suck her blood with a fervor and passion that made her marrow shiver, the woman did not realize that she had aroused a feeling in him beyond brotherly love.",14.391,14.111,"She continued going to the room occasionally, when she had something to do in that area, and stayed there for a few minutes, while her husband continued scrutinizing the sky. Excited by that change, Aureliano then stayed to eat with the family, something he hadn't done since the first months of Amaranta Úrsula's return. Gastón liked it. In the after-dinner conversations, which usually lasted for more than an hour, he lamented that his partners were deceiving him. They had announced the shipment of the airplane on a ship that never arrived, and although his maritime agents insisted that it would never arrive because it was not listed among the Caribbean ships, his partners stubbornly maintained that the dispatch was correct, and even insinuated the possibility that Gastón was lying in his letters. The correspondence reached such a degree of mutual suspicion that Gastón chose to stop writing, and began to suggest the possibility of a quick trip to Brussels to clarify things and return with the airplane. However, the project vanished as soon as Amaranta Úrsula reiterated her decision not to leave Macondo even if she ended up without a husband. In the early days, Aureliano shared the widespread idea that Gastón was a fool on a velocipede, and that aroused a vague feeling of pity in him. Later, when he obtained deeper information about the nature of men in the brothels, he thought that Gastón's meekness originated from unbridled passion. But when he got to know him better and realized that his true character was in contradiction with his submissive behavior, he conceived the malicious suspicion that even the wait for the airplane was a farce. Then he thought that Gastón was not as foolish as he appeared, but on the contrary, a man of infinite constancy, skill, and patience, who had set out to defeat his wife through the weariness of eternal complacency, of never saying no to her, of simulating limitless conformity, letting her get entangled in her own web, until the day she could no longer bear the tedium of illusions within reach, and she herself would pack her bags to return to Europe. Aureliano's former pity transformed into virulent animosity. Gastón's system seemed so perverse to him, but at the same time so effective, that he dared to warn Amaranta Úrsula. However, she mocked his suspicion, without even glimpsing the heartbreaking load of love, uncertainty, and jealousy he carried inside. It had not occurred to her that she aroused in Aureliano something more than fraternal affection, until she pricked her finger trying to open a can of peaches, and he rushed to suck the blood with an avidity and devotion that made her skin crawl.",51.012,50.918
796,"“Aureliano!” She laughed, disturbed. “You’re too suspicious to be a good bat.”","Amaranta Úrsula did not think she had stirred anything in Aureliano beyond sincere feelings until one day she cut her hand trying to open a jar of peach jam, and Aureliano rushed to suck the blood from her bleeding finger with such desire and longing that it made her shiver. - Auréliano - she laughed, nervous, - you are so ugly, to the point of becoming a cunning bat.",3.81,2.533,"That day, trying to laugh amidst the unease of having her finger sucked, she said, 'Aureliano.'

797,"Then Aureliano went all out. Giving her some small, orphaned kisses in the hollow of her wounded hand, he opened up the most hidden passageways of his heart and drew out an interminable and lacerated intestine, the terrible parasitic animal that had incubated in his martyrdom. He told her how he would get up at midnight to weep in loneliness and rage over the underwear that she had left to dry in the bathroom. He told her about the anxiety with which he had asked Nigromanta to howl like a cat and sob gaston gaston gaston in his ear, and with how much astuteness he had ransacked her vials of perfume so that he could smell it on the necks of the little girls who went to bed because of hunger. Frightened by the passion of that outburst, Amaranta Úrsula was closing her fingers, contracting them like a shellfish until her wounded hand, free of all pain and any vestige of pity, was converted into a knot of emeralds and topazes and stony and unfeeling bones.","At that moment, Aureliano was filled with joy. He placed pitiful kisses on her injured hand, revealing the deepest secrets of his heart, the sorrows, and torments within him. Aureliano told Amaranta Úrsula how he had woken up at midnight to cry with loneliness and madly crave the underwear she hung to dry in the bathroom. He recounted how he had desperately demanded Nigromanta to moan like a female cat and whisper ""Gastón, Gastón, Gastón"" in his ear, and how he had slyly stolen her perfume bottles to rub on the necks of the young women who slept with him for money. Terrified by the desires of the dissolute man, Amaranta Úrsula slowly clenched her hand, her fingers curling like a snail retreating, until her injured hand no longer felt pain, and every trace of pity turned into a mass of jade and quartz, transforming into lifeless, rigid bones.",14.797,14.157,"Then Aureliano opened up his heart. He held Amaranta Ursula's injured hand, kissed her palm, and revealed the deepest corners of his heart. He told her how he would get up at midnight, wrap himself in the clothes Amaranta Ursula had left in the bathroom to dry, and cry in anger and loneliness. He told how he made Nigromanta purr like a cat, how he whispered Gaston, Gaston, Gaston into her ear, and how he stole Amaranta Ursula's perfumes and applied them to the necks of little whores who sold their bodies to avoid starvation. Frightened by this outburst of emotion, Amaranta Ursula began to clench her fingers, making her wounded hand into a fist like a closing clam. Eventually, she felt neither pain nor compassion. Her hand turned into a knot woven from topazes and emeralds, petrified and insensitive little bones.",15.332,14.676,"Then Aureliano overflowed.

He felt so well, so close to perfect companionship, that he thought of no other refuge on the afternoon on which Amaranta Úrsula had made his illusions crumble. He was ready to unburden himself with words so that someone could break the knots that bound his chest, but he only managed to let out a fluid, warm, and restorative weeping in Pilar Ternera’s lap. She let him finish, scratching his head with the tips of her fingers, and without his having revealed that he was weeping from love, she recognized immediately the oldest sobs in the history of man.","From that night onward, Aureliano hid in the gentleness and sympathy of the great-great-grandmother he had never known. Sitting on the wicker rocking chair, the old woman thought about the past, recalling the greatness and misfortunes of the family and the ravaged splendor of Macondo, while Anvaro frightened the crocodiles with his loud laughter, and Alfonso made up terrifying stories about the herons that had pecked out the eyes of a misbehaving village guest the previous week, and Gabriel sat in the room of the mixed-race girl who did not charge her clients but only asked them to write letters for her smuggler lover imprisoned across the Orinoco River after being caught by border guards and forced to sit on a pot until he defecated diamonds and feces. The brothel, with its madam like a mother, was the very world that Aureliano had always dreamed of in his prolonged restraint. He felt happy, felt close to achieving perfect communion, to the point that he thought of no other escape on the afternoon when Amaranta Ursula shattered his illusion. He was ready to beg someone to help him break the frustration that felt like it was choking his chest, but he could only sob in the arms of Pilar Ternera. The old woman stroked his head, letting him cry to his heart's content. And even though he did not say he was crying because of love, the old woman immediately recognized the most ancient cry in human history.",21.224,20.84,"Starting from that evening, Aureliano sought refuge in the affection, tenderness, and understanding of his great-grandmother whom he had never met. Pilar Ternera would sit in her rocking chair, reminiscing about the old days, reviving the family's glorious periods and the disasters that befell them, as well as the magnificent days of Macondo that had long faded away. Meanwhile, Alvaro would scare the crocodiles with his loud laughter, Alfonso would make up stories about bittern birds that gouged out the eyes of four customers who had behaved inappropriately a week earlier, and Gabriel would be in the room of the quiet and pensive angel girl. This girl did not take money for her services but would have letters written to her smuggler lover who was imprisoned on the opposite bank of the Orinoco. Her lover had been caught by border guards, and when the seat they forcibly placed him on suddenly filled with filth and diamonds, they threw him into a hole. This place, a true brothel with a nurturing mama, was exactly the world Aureliano had dreamed of during his years of captivity. She was so happy there, she felt so close to perfect friendship that when Amaranta Ursula's dreams were shattered, she couldn't think of any other place to seek refuge. She was ready to pour out her heart and tell everything, hoping someone would untangle the knots choking her chest, but all she could do was collapse into Pilar Ternera's arms and cry for a long time. Pilar Ternera waited for her crying to stop, gently scratching her head with her fingertips, and even before Aureliano could explain that he was crying from the pain of love, Pilar recognized the oldest tears in human history.",12.65,12.166,"Since that night, Aureliano had taken refuge in the tenderness and compassionate understanding of the ignored great-great-grandmother. Sitting in the wicker rocker, she evoked the past, reconstructed the greatness and misfortune of the family and the ravaged splendor of Macondo, while Álvaro scared the alligators with his thunderous laughter, and Alfonso invented the gruesome story of the curlews that pecked out the eyes of four customers who misbehaved the previous week, and Gabriel was in the room of the pensive mulatto woman who did not charge for love with money, but with letters for a smuggler boyfriend who was imprisoned on the other side of the Orinoco, because the border guards had purged him and then sat him on a chamber pot that ended up full of shit with diamonds. That real brothel, with that maternal owner, was the world Aureliano had dreamed of in his prolonged captivity. He felt so good, so close to perfect companionship, that he did not think of another refuge the afternoon Amaranta Úrsula shattered his illusions. He went ready to unburden himself with words, for someone to untie the knots that oppressed his chest, but he only managed to release himself in a fluid, warm, and restorative cry, in the lap of Pilar Ternera.

He followed her almost on tiptoes, stumbling from drunkenness, and he went into the nuptial bedroom just as she opened the robe and closed it again in fright.

808,"Aureliano, smiled, picked her up by the waist with both hands like a pot of begonias, and dropped her on her back on the bed. With a brutal tug he pulled off her bathrobe before she had time to resist and he loomed over an abyss of newly washed nudity whose skin color, lines of fuzz, and hidden moles had all been imagined in the shadows of the other rooms. Amaranta Úrsula defended herself sincerely with the astuteness of a wise woman, weaseling her slippery, flexible, and fragrant weasel’s body as she tried to knee him in the kidneys and scorpion his face with her nails, but without either of them giving a gasp that might not have been taken for that breathing of a person watching the meager April sunset through the open window. It was a fierce fight, a battle to the death, but it seemed to be without violence because it consisted of distorted attacks and ghostly evasions, slow, cautious, solemn, so that during it all there was time for the petunias to bloom and for Gaston to forget about his aviator’s dream in the next room, as if they were two enemy lovers seeking reconciliation at the bottom of an aquarium. In the heat of that savage and ceremonious struggle, Amaranta Úrsula understood that her meticulous silence was so irrational that it could awaken the suspicions of her nearby husband much more than the sound of warfare that they were trying to avoid. Then she began to laugh with her lips tight together, without giving up the fight, but defending herself with false bites and deweaseling her body little by little until they both were conscious of being adversaries and accomplices at the same time and the affray degenerated into a conventional gambol and the attacks became caresses. Suddenly, almost playfully, like one more bit of mischief, Amaranta Úrsula dropped her defense, and when she tried to recover, frightened by what she herself had made possible, it was too late. A great commotion immobilized her in her center of gravity, planted her in her place, and her defensive will was demolished by the irresistible anxiety to discover what the orange whistles and the invisible globes on the other side of death were like. She barely had time to reach out her hand and grope for the towel to put a gag between her teeth so that she would not let out the cat howls that were already tearing at her insides.","Aureliano smiled, lifting her up by the waist as if he were carrying a pot of begonias, and laid her down on the bed. In a swift motion, he pulled off her bathrobe before she could stop him, and he felt as if he were falling into an abyss at the sight of her freshly bathed, naked body, white and smooth, which he had already imagined in the darkness of the adjacent rooms, down to every pore and hidden mole. Amaranta Úrsula resisted fiercely: with the cunning of an intelligent female, she twisted and turned her supple and fragrant body like a weasel, while pushing her knees into his stomach and scratching his face with her hands, yet neither of them breathed any harder than someone watching the April twilight through a window. It was a fierce struggle, a life-and-death battle, yet almost devoid of violence, because it was a struggle of phantoms, slow, cautious, solemn, meaning that the time they spent grappling with each other was enough for the shield fern to bloom and for Gastón in the next room to forget all his dreams of becoming a pilot, and they were like two hostile lovers striving to reach a compromise at the bottom of a bright pond. In that fierce and solemn tug-of-war, Amaranta Úrsula realized that her cautious silence was utterly unreasonable, as it could make her husband in the next room more suspicious than the loud noises she was trying so hard to avoid. She then smiled gently and continued to resist, but she was defending herself with feigned bites and gradually stopped writhing to avoid him, until both understood that they were both adversaries and accomplices, and the struggle had turned into a game of caresses. Suddenly, as if to test the game, to take a risk once more, Amaranta Úrsula stopped resisting, and when frightened by what she herself had facilitated, she tried to react but it was already too late. A strange tremor had pinned her down, held her tight, and her will to defend herself was crushed by the uncontrollable desire to discover what the yellow howls and the invisible balls waiting for her on the other side of death were. She only had time to grope for the handkerchief, stuff it into her mouth, and bite down hard to keep the growls of a cat in heat from escaping from the depths of her being.",20.793,20.541,"Aureliano smiled. He lifted Amaranta Ursula by her waist like a begonia pot, laid her down on the bed on her back. Without giving the woman a chance to resist, he swiftly pulled off her robe, and the color of her skin, her hairs, the moles in unseen places, all of which had been imagined in the dimness of other rooms, made his head spin in the depth of this freshly washed nakedness. Amaranta Ursula, defending herself in a manner befitting a smart woman, twisted her slender body, which resembled a slippery, flexible, fragrant poppy stem, trying to kick Aureliano's kidneys and scratch his face. But neither of them made a sound, making no more noise than someone watching the setting of the April sun through an open window. It was a relentless struggle, a deadly clash. However, since it consisted of abrupt attacks, heavy, silent, measured movements, it seemed as if there was no struggle. During all this tussle, the petunias found the opportunity to bloom, and in the adjacent room, Gaston could easily forget his aviation dreams. They were like two enemy lovers at the bottom of an aquarium, searching for ways to reconcile. During this relentless and ceremonial struggle, Amaranta Ursula realized that her silence was irrational and unbelievable, and that it would irritate her husband even more than the sounds of the struggle they were trying to prevent. Without parting her tightly closed lips, she began to laugh, refusing to give up the struggle, and pretended to bite Aureliano in an attempt to defend herself. Her writhing gradually subsided. There came a moment when both of them realized that they were both enemies and accomplices, and the struggle turned into a familiar playfulness. Then, suddenly, as if she were playing a game, as if she were acting out a new tantrum, Amaranta Ursula let herself go and, frightened by what she had allowed, tried to regain her composure, but it was too late. A great tremor left him motionless at the center of his own gravity, pinned him to the spot, and his instinct for self-defense was crushed and obliterated by the curiosity of learning the orange whistles and invisible spheres beyond death. He only had enough time to reach out, grab a towel, and clamp it between his teeth to stop the cat-like growls that were starting to tear through him.",15.088,14.779,"Aureliano smiled, lifted her by the waist with both hands, like a pot of begonias, and threw her on the bed face up. With a brutal yank, he stripped her of the bathrobe before she had time to prevent it, and he gazed into the abyss of a freshly washed nakedness that did not have a shade of skin, a streak of hair, or a hidden mole that he had not imagined in the darkness of other rooms. Amaranta Úrsula defended herself sincerely, with the cunning of a wise woman, weaseling her slippery, flexible, and fragrant weasel-like body, while trying to dislocate his kidneys with her knees and scratch his face with her nails, but neither he nor she emitted a sigh that could not be mistaken for the breathing of someone contemplating the leisurely April twilight through the open window. It was a fierce struggle, a battle to the death, which nevertheless seemed devoid of all violence, because it was made of distorted aggressions and spectral evasions, slow, cautious, solemn, so that between one and the other there was time for the petunias to bloom again and Gastón to forget his dreams of being an aeronaut in the neighboring room, as if they were two enemy lovers trying to reconcile at the bottom of a clear pond. In the heat of the fierce and ceremonious struggle, Amaranta Úrsula realized that the meticulousness of their silence was so irrational that it could have aroused the suspicions of the neighboring husband much more than the warlike noises they were trying to avoid. Then she began to laugh with her lips pressed together, without giving up the fight, but defending herself with false bites and gradually unwinding her body, until both became aware of being at the same time adversaries and accomplices, and the struggle degenerated into a conventional frolic and the aggressions turned into caresses. Suddenly, almost playfully, like one more prank, Amaranta Úrsula neglected her defense, and when she tried to react, frightened by what she herself had made possible, it was already too late.

811,"It was the end. In Pilar Ternera’s tomb, among the psalm and cheap whore jewelry, the ruins of the past would rot, the little that remained after the wise Catalonian had auctioned off his bookstore and returned to the Mediterranean village where he had been born, overcome by a yearning for a lasting springtime. No one could have foreseen his decision. He had arrived in Macondo during the splendor of the banana company, fleeing from one of many wars, and nothing more practical had occurred to him than to set up that bookshop of incunabula and first editions in several languages, which casual customers would thumb through cautiously, as if they were junk books, as they waited their turn to have their dreams interpreted in the house across the way. He spent half his life in the back of the store, scribbling in his extra-careful hand in purple ink and on pages that he tore out of school notebooks, and no one was sure exactly what he was writing. When Aureliano first met him he had two boxes of those motley pages that in some way made one think of Melquíades’ parchments, and from that time until he left he had filled a third one, so it was reasonable to believe that he had done nothing else during his stay in Macondo. The only people with whom he maintained relations were the four friends, whom he had exchanged their tops and kites for books, and he set them to reading Seneca and Ovid while they were still in grammar school. He treated the classical writers with a household familiarity, as if they had all been his roommates at some period, and he knew many things that should not have been known, such as the fact that Saint Augustine wore a wool jacket under his habit that he did not take off for fourteen years and that Arnaldo of Villanova, the necromancer, was impotent since childhood because of a scorpion bite. His fervor for the written word was an interweaving of solemn respect and gossipy irreverence. Not even his own manuscripts were safe from that dualism. Having learned Catalan in order to translate them, Alfonso put a roll of pages in his pockets, which were always full of newspaper clippings and manuals for strange trades, and one night he lost them in the house of the little girls who went to bed because of hunger. When the wise old grandfather found out, instead of raising a row as had been feared, he commented, dying with laughter, that it was the natural destiny of literature. On the other hand, there was no human power capable of persuading him not to take along the three boxes when he returned to his native village, and he unleashed a string of Carthaginian curses at the railroad inspectors who tried to ship them as freight until he finally succeeded in keeping them with him in the passenger coach. “The world must be all fucked up,” he said then, “when men travel first class and literature goes as freight.” That was the last thing he was heard to say. He had spent a dark week on the final preparations for the trip, because as the hour approached his humor was breaking down and things began to be misplaced, and what he put in one place would appear in another, attacked by the same elves that had tormented Fernanda.","That was the final judgment. In the grave of Pila Tecnêra, among the hymns and the beads of prostitutes, the decaying refuse of the past, that is all that remains in Macondo since the departure of the wise man from Catalonia. Driven by the longing for an eternal spring, the wise old man from Catalonia had to close his bookstore and return to his village on the Mediterranean coast. No one felt the impact of his decision to return home. To escape the continuous wars, he came to Macondo just as the banana company was flourishing, and he thought of nothing else but to open a bookstore specializing in old books printed in several foreign languages, which random customers would fearfully flip through as if they were dirty books while waiting their turn to have their fortunes told or their futures read in the house across the street. He spent half his life sitting in the hot backyard, diligently recording his peculiar style of literature with violet ink on pages torn from school notebooks, and no one knew exactly what he was writing. When Aureliano met him, he already had two large boxes filled with pages of writing that, in some way, reminded one of the parchment scrolls of Melquíades, and from that time until his departure, he filled a third box, so it was reasonable to think that during his entire stay in Macondo, he did nothing but write. The only people he associated with were four friends who would come to exchange spinning tops and paper kites for his books, and he had them reading Seneca and Ovid while they were still in elementary school. With affectionate tenderness, he treated the classics as if they were roommates he had had in his life. And he knew many things he shouldn't have known, such as Saint Augustine wearing an extra tight-fitting wool vest under his coat until he was fourteen, and that Arnau de Vilanova, a sorcerer, became impotent from a scorpion sting when he was still a child. His enthusiasm for writing was a tapestry interwoven with the locals' respect and gossip. Because he had to learn Catalan to translate them into Spanish, Alfonso had tucked a few of those pages, rolled up with some newspaper clippings and textbook pages, into his pocket, only to lose them one night at the house of one of the prostitutes he was with to stave off hunger. When the wise old man learned of this, instead of scolding him, he laughed and remarked that it was the natural fate of literature. On the contrary, no human force could persuade him not to take the three large boxes of writings with him when he returned home, and he unleashed a torrent of Carthaginian curses to chase away the train inspectors who tried to move the boxes to the freight car, treating them as cargo, until he forced them to let him take them in the passenger car. "" Nothing in the world is more ridiculous than a man sitting in the passenger car while literature lies in the freight car. "" That was the only thing anyone heard him say aloud. He spent a strenuous week with the final preparations for his departure, because the closer the departure time came, the less happy he became, his thoughts became increasingly jumbled, and objects placed in one spot were found in another, haunted by the same ghosts that had once tormented Fernanda.",21.486,21.306,"It had finally come. At Pilar Ternera's grave, among hymns and cheap whore jewelry, the remnants of the past would also decay, and after the departure of the wise Catalonian who sold his shop at auction and returned to his Mediterranean village with a longing for endless springs, whatever remained from the old days would all merge with the soil at Pilar Ternera's grave. No one could have predicted that the wise Catalonian would come to such a decision. The Catalonian had fled from one of countless wars, arrived in Macondo during the most tumultuous days of the Banana Company, and couldn't think of a more practical way to make a living than opening a bookstore that sold old books in various languages and antique first editions that customers waiting in line to enter the dream interpretation house across the street could browse through as if they were second-hand books. He spent half of his life at the back of the shop, meticulously filling pages torn from school notebooks with his purple ink writings; no one could ever definitively understand what he had written. When Aureliano first met him, the wise Catalonian had filled two chests with papers covered in intricate writing that, in a way, reminded him of Melquiades' manuscripts. After their meeting, he filled a third chest until he left. When one saw these chests full of writings, one couldn't help but think that the wise Catalonian had done nothing but write during his stay in Macondo. The only people he constantly interacted with were four friends. He made them abandon their kites and tops, put books in their hands, and had them read Seneca and Ovidius while they were still in elementary school. He knew the classical writers as intimately as members of his own family, as if he had once lived with them in the same room. He knew impossible-to-know things, like Saint Augustine not taking off the woolen undershirt he wore under his clothes for fourteen years, or the magician Arnoldo from Villanova losing his sexual potency because of a scorpion sting in his childhood. His passion for written information was a mix of solemn, serene respect and loquacious irreverence. Even his own writings could not escape this dilemma. Alfonso, who had learned the Catalan language to translate the writings, took a bundle of these papers and stuffed them into his pockets, which were always filled with newspaper clippings and various brochures. One night, he lost those papers in the house of the little prostitutes who sold their flesh out of hunger. When the wise old man heard about this incident, instead of getting angry and scolding as the children feared, he burst into laughter, saying that this was the natural fate of literature. Nevertheless, no force could prevent him from taking three chests full of these writings with him when he returned to his birthplace. After hurling unrepeatable curses at the train conductors who wanted to throw the chests into the freight car, he managed to take the chests with him and place them in the passenger car. And he said, ""If people travel in first class while literature is thrown into the freight car, it means the world has gone to hell."" These were the last words heard from the mouth of the Wise Catalonian. He had gone through a tough week to complete the travel preparations. As the departure day approached, on one hand, his joy was fading, and on the other hand, he couldn't find what he was looking for where he had put it, everything was getting mixed up, as if the spirits that haunted Fernanda were now swarming around him.",18.614,18.436,"It was the end. In the tomb of Pilar Ternera, among psalms and trinkets of prostitutes, the remains of the past were rotting, the few that remained after the wise Catalan finished off the bookstore and returned to the Mediterranean village where he was born, defeated by the nostalgia of a tenacious spring. No one could have foreseen his decision. He had arrived in Macondo during the splendor of the banana company, fleeing one of many wars, and had thought of nothing more practical than to set up that bookstore of incunabula and original editions in various languages, which casual customers browsed with suspicion, as if they were books from a garbage heap, while they waited their turn to have their dreams interpreted in the house across the street. He spent half his life in the hot back room, scribbling his precious writing in violet ink on sheets he tore from school notebooks, without anyone knowing for sure what he was writing.

The only people he associated with were the four friends, to whom he traded books for spinning tops and kites, and made them read Seneca and Ovid while they were still in primary school. He treated the classics with a homely familiarity, as if they had all been his roommates at some point, and he knew many things that simply should not be known, such as that Saint Augustine wore a woolen doublet under his habit that he did not take off for fourteen years, and that Arnaldo de Vilanova, the necromancer, became impotent as a child due to a scorpion bite. His fervor for the written word was a weave of solemn respect and gossipy irreverence. Not even his own manuscripts were safe from that duality. Having learned Catalan to translate them, Alfonso stuffed a roll of pages into his pockets, which were always full of newspaper clippings and manuals of rare trades, and one night he lost them in the house of the girls who slept with men out of hunger. When the wise old man found out, instead of making the feared scandal, he laughed and commented that this was the natural destiny of literature. However, no human power was able to persuade him not to take the three drawers when he returned to his native village, and he unleashed Carthaginian curses against the railway inspectors who tried to send them as cargo, until he managed to keep them with him in the passenger car. “The world will have completely gone to hell,” he said then, “the day men travel in first class and literature in the cargo car. ”That was the last thing he was heard to say. He had spent a black week with the final preparations for the trip, because as the hour approached, his mood deteriorated, his intentions got mixed up, and the things he put in one place appeared in another, besieged by the same goblins that tormented Fernanda.",50.333,50.254

The night before the trip, after nailing up the boxes and putting his clothing into the same suitcase that he had brought when he first came, he narrowed his clam eyes, pointed with a kind of impudent benediction at the stacks of books with which he had endured during his exile, and said to his friends:","Hecman and Aureliano helped the old man carry things.

The night before the departure, after nailing shut the boxes of documents and packing all the clothes into the same suitcase the old man had brought, squinting his clam-shaped eyelids, with a shamelessly blessing gesture, he pointed to the piles of books that had accompanied him throughout his exile, and said to his comrades:",21.146,20.351,"German and Aureliano took close care of him.

815,"Three months later they received in a large envelope twenty-nine letters and more than fifty pictures that he had accumulated during the leisure of the high seas. Although he did not date them, the order in which he had written the letters was obvious. In the first ones, with his customary good humor, he spoke about the difficulties of the crossing, the urge he had to throw the cargo officer overboard when he would not let him keep the three boxes in his cabin, the clear imbecility of a lady who was terrified at the number thirteen, not out of superstition but because she thought it was a number that had no end, and the bet that he had won during the first dinner because he had recognized in the drinking water on board the taste of the nighttime beets by the springs of Lérida. With the passage of the days, however, the reality of life on board mattered less and less to him and even the most recent and trivial happenings seemed worthy of nostalgia, because as the ship got farther away, his memory began to grow sad. That process of nostalgia was also evident in the pictures. In the first ones he looked happy, with his sport shirt which looked like a hospital jacket and his snowy mane, in an October Caribbean filled with whitecaps. In the last ones he could be seen to be wearing a dark coat and a milk scarf, pale in the face, taciturn from absence on the deck of a mournful ship that had come to be like a sleepwalker on the autumnal seas. Germán and Aureliano answered his letters. He wrote so many during the first months that at that time they felt closer to him than when he had been in Macondo, and they were almost freed from the rancor that he had left behind. At first he told them that everything was just the same, that the pink snails were still in the house where he had been born, that the dry herring still had the same taste on a piece of toast, that the waterfalls in the village still took on a perfumed smell at dusk. They were the notebook pages again, woven with the purple scribbling, in which he dedicated a special paragraph to each one. Nevertheless, and although he himself did not seem to notice it, those letters of recuperation and stimulation were slowly changing into pastoral letters of disenchantment. One winter night while the soup was boiling in the fireplace, he missed the heat of the back of his store, the buzzing of the sun on the dusty almond trees, the whistle of the train during the lethargy of siesta time, just as in Macondo he had missed the winter soup in the fireplace, the cries of the coffee vendor, and the fleeting larks of springtime. Upset by two nostalgias facing each other like two mirrors, he lost his marvelous sense of unreality and he ended up recommending to all of them that they leave Macondo, that they forget everything he had taught them about the world and the human heart, that they shit on Horace, and that wherever they might be they always remember that the past was a lie, that memory has no return, that every spring gone by could never be recovered, and that the wildest and most tenacious love was an ephemeral truth in the end.","Three months later, they received a huge envelope containing nearly twenty letters and more than fifty photos, accumulated throughout the leisurely journey on the open sea. Although they were undated, their order clearly indicated the sequence in which the old man wrote these letters. In the first letters, with his usual humorous tone, he told them about the interesting events that happened during the ocean crossing, about the frustration of wanting to knock down the cargo handler who wouldn't allow him to bring three boxes of manuscripts into the cabin on the lower deck, about the cowardice yet wisdom of a lady who was very afraid of the number thirteen, not because of superstition but because she seemed to feel that this number foretold she would stay behind even though the sea journey was not yet over, and about the contest he won on the very first night on the ship because he recognized the smell of radishes soaked overnight in the streams of Lérida in the water served on the ship. However, as the days sequentially passed, the reality on the ship became less and less noticeable to him; even the most recent and ordinary events made him feel they were more distant, as the ship moved further away from the American shore, his memories became increasingly melancholic. This process of nostalgic progression seemed to also manifest in the photos. In the first photos, he appeared happy, wearing a veteran's coat, his hair white as snow in the bright October sunlight of the Caribbean Sea. In the later photos, he appeared in a dark coat, a silk scarf around his neck, looking sad and contemplative due to the emptiness, sitting on the deck of a heavy ship staggering like a sleepwalker on the autumn sea. Herman and Aureliano wrote back to him. In the first months, he wrote letters so diligently that they felt closer to him than when he was still in Macondo, and they felt less irritated for letting him go. At first, he wrote to them, informing them that everything was still normal, that in the house where he was born, the pink snail was still there, that the dried herring still smelled fresh in the biscuit tin, and that the village waterfalls still emitted fragrance at dusk. Once again, he sent them pages of school notebooks written like drawings in violet ink, in which he dedicated a special poem to each friend. However, even though he did not realize it himself, those heartfelt letters gradually turned into pastoral poems full of the meaning of a person who has awakened from a dream. During winter nights, while sitting and watching the pot of soup boil by the fireplace, he remembered the hot air in the backyard, remembered the hum of the sunlight on the trees. almonds covered with dust, remembering the sound of the train whistle in the hot air at noon, is the nostalgia with which he sat in Macondo, remembering the pot of soup boiling in the fireplace, remembering the cries of the coffee seller and remembering the The nimble lark heralds the coming of spring. Purged by nostalgia facing each other like mirrors, he lost the magical sense of unreality, until he finished by advising them all to run away from Macondo, to forget everything he had taught them about life, about human love, to shit on Horazio and wherever they went, remember that the past is a lie, that human memory has no way back, that all ancient springs are irrecoverable and that wild and passionate love is only a momentary truth.",19.686,19.514,"The young men received twenty-nine letters and more than fifty drawings that the Catalonian had written and collected during his free time on the journey, three months later. Although he hadn't dated his letters, the order in which he wrote them was clear. In the first letters, with his usual playful and cheerful manner, he talked about the hardships of the sea voyage; he described in detail how he restrained himself from throwing the cargo officer, who didn't want to put his paper trunks in his cabin, into the sea, the stupidity of the woman who was terrified of being assigned to cabin number thirteen—not because she believed it was unlucky, but because she was scared that the number had no end—and how he won a bet because he knew that the drinking water served on the ship had a taste of beets from the Lerida spring waters. However, as the days passed, the realities of life on the ship interested him less and less, and as the ship progressed, his memories began to cause him pain, making even the most insignificant event or the smallest detail evoke a longing for home. This longing's development was clearly evident in the pictures. In the first pictures, with the snowy peaks of the Caribbean October visible behind him, he had a happy appearance with his snow-white hair and a sports shirt resembling hospital pajamas. In the last pictures, however, with a dark jacket on his back and a silk scarf, he looked as if he was stuck in silence from loneliness on the deck of this melancholic ship advancing like a sleepwalker in the autumn seas. German and Aureliano replied to his letters. In the first months, the Catalonian was writing letters so frequently that German and Aureliano felt closer to him than when he was in Macondo, and they forgot their sorrows. Initially, the Catalonian wrote that everything was the same, that the pink snakes were still wandering in the house where he was born, that the dried herring placed on toasted bread still tasted the same, and that the waterfall in the village smelled wonderful as evening fell. He was again filling the pages torn from the notebook with his purple ink writing, dedicating a paragraph to each of the young men. The healthy and vigorous air in the Catalonian's letters, without him even realizing it, began to transform into a pastoral quality that signaled the breaking of the spell. One night, while the soup was boiling on the stove, he suddenly longed for the suffocating heat behind his shop, the sun hitting the dusty almond trees, and the whistle of the train tearing through the drowsiness of siesta hours. When he was in Macondo, he had missed the winter soup boiling on the stove, the cries of the coffee vendor, and the larks flying in flocks in the spring just like this. Overwhelmed between these two longings, which faced each other like two mirrors, the Catalonian lost that unique surreal feeling and began to advise the children in his letters to leave Macondo, to forget all the teachings about the world and the human heart, to defy Horace, to remember that the past is a lie no matter where they are, that memories have no return, that no passing spring can ever be recaptured, and that the most wild and indispensable love is a momentary reality at the end of life.",23.028,22.862,"Three months later, twenty-nine letters and more than fifty portraits were received in a large envelope, which had accumulated during his idle times at sea. Although he didn't date them, it was evident the order in which he had written the letters. In the first ones, he recounted with his usual humor the adventures of the voyage, the urge he had to throw the purser overboard for not allowing him to bring the three crates into the cabin, the lucid imbecility of a lady who was terrified of the number 13, not out of superstition but because it seemed to her an unfinished number, and the bet he won at the first dinner because he recognized in the onboard water the nocturnal beet flavor of the springs of Lérida. As the days went by, however, the reality onboard mattered less and less to him, and even the most recent and trivial events seemed worthy of nostalgia, because as the ship moved away, his memory grew sadder. That process of progressive nostalgization was also evident in the portraits. In the first ones, he seemed happy, with his invalid's shirt and his snowy lock of hair, in the sparkling October of the Caribbean. In the last ones, he was seen with a dark coat and a silk scarf, pale and taciturn from absence, on the deck of a ship of sorrow that began to sleepwalk through autumnal oceans. Germán and Aureliano replied to his letters. He wrote so many in the first months that they felt closer to him then than when he was in Macondo, and almost relieved their anger that he had left. At first, he sent word that everything remained the same, that in the house where he was born the pink conch was still there, that the dried herrings tasted the same on the tinder of bread, that the village waterfalls continued to perfume the air at dusk. They were once again the notebook pages stitched together with purple scribbles, in which he dedicated a special paragraph to each one. However, and although he himself didn't seem to notice it, those letters of recovery and encouragement gradually turned into pastorals of disenchantment. On winter nights, while the soup boiled in the fireplace, he longed for the warmth of his back room, the hum of the sun in the dusty almond trees, the whistle of the train in the drowsiness of the siesta, just as he longed in Macondo for the winter soup in the fireplace, the cries of the coffee vendor, and the fleeting larks of spring. Dazed by two nostalgias facing each other like two mirrors, he lost his marvelous sense of unreality, until he ended up recommending to everyone that they leave Macondo, forget everything he had taught them about the world and the human heart, curse Horace, and remember always, wherever they were, that the past was a lie, that memory had no paths back, that every old spring was irretrievable, and that the most reckless and tenacious love was nonetheless an ephemeral truth.",42.068,41.974
816,"Álvaro was the first to take the advice to abandon Macondo. He sold everything, even the tame jaguar that teased passersby from the courtyard of his house, and he bought an eternal ticket on a train that never stopped traveling. In the postcards that he sent from the way stations he would describe with shouts the instantaneous images that he had seen from the window of his coach, and it was as if he were tearing up and throwing into oblivion some long, evanescent poem: the chimerical Negroes in the cotton fields of Louisiana, the winged horses in the bluegrass of Kentucky, the Greek lovers in the infernal sunsets of Arizona, the girl in the red sweater painting watercolors by a lake in Michigan who waved at him with her brushes, not to say farewell but out of hope, because she did not know that she was watching a train with no return passing by. Then Alfonso and Germán left one Saturday with the idea of coming back on Monday, but nothing more was ever heard of them. A year after the departure of the wise Catalonian the only one left in Macondo was Gabriel, still adrift at the mercy of Nigromanta’s chancy charity and answering the questions of a contest in a French magazine in which the first prize was a trip to Paris. Aureliano, who was the one who subscribed to it, helped him fill in the answers, sometimes in his house but most of the time among the ceramic bottles and atmosphere of valerian in the only pharmacy left in Macondo, where Mercedes, Gabriel’s stealthy girl friend, lived. It was the last that remained of a past whose annihilation had not taken place because it was still in a process of annihilation, consuming itself from within, ending at every moment but never ending its ending. The town had reached such extremes of inactivity that when Gabriel won the contest and left for Paris with two changes of clothing, a pair of shoes, and the complete works of Rabelais, he had to signal the engineer to stop the train and pick him up. The old Street of the Turks was at that time an abandoned corner where the last Arabs were letting themselves be dragged off to death with the age-old custom of sitting in their doorways, although it had been many years since they had sold the last yard of diagonal cloth, and in the shadowy showcases only the decapitated manikins remained. The banana company’s city, which Patricia Brown may have tried to evoke for her grandchildren during the nights of intolerance and dill pickles in Prattville, Alabama, was a plain of wild grass. The ancient priest who had taken Father Angel’s place and whose name no one had bothered to find out awaited God’s mercy stretched out casually in a hammock, tortured by arthritis and the insomnia of doubt while the lizards and rats fought over the inheritance of the nearby church. In that Macondo forgotten even by the birds, where the dust and the heat had become so strong that it was difficult to breathe, secluded by solitude and love and by the solitude of love in a house where it was almost impossible to sleep because of the noise of the red ants, Aureliano, and Amaranta Úrsula were the only happy beings, and the most happy on the face of the earth.","Anvarô was the first person to heed the advice to leave Macondo. He sold all his possessions, including the tiger that was kept in the yard and often bared its teeth to threaten passersby on the street, and bought a one-way ticket on a train that never stopped traveling. In the postcards he sent from the stations where the train stopped along the way, he described with admiration the fleeting images he saw through the carriage window, as if he were tearing apart and casting into oblivion a long poem of escape: dreamy black people in the white cotton fields of Louisiana, winged horses on the green pastures of Kentucky, Greek lovers in the infernal sunset of Arizona, a girl in a red sweater painting watercolors by the lakes of Michigan who waved her brush to greet him—not a farewell but a hopeful greeting for a reunion, as she did not know she was watching a train that would never return. Then Alphonso and Herman left together on a Saturday with the intention of returning on Monday, but no one ever heard any news about them. A year after the wise old Catalan man left, the only friend still remaining in Macondo was Gabriel, who was still wandering around, completely dependent on the pity of Nigromanta, answering quiz questions for a French magazine, whose grand prize was a trip to visit the capital, Paris. Aureliano, who was a newspaper subscriber, helped him fill out the questions, sometimes right at his house, but almost always among the pretty porcelain jars and the scent of valerian in the only pharmacy in Macondo, the residence of Mercedes, Gabriel's secret lover. That was the only thing that would remain of a past whose destruction was never complete, because it kept self-destructing slowly, depleting itself from within, and minute by minute it would end itself, but would never stop its self-ending. The town had reached those points of stagnation, so when Gabriel won the prize and went to Paris with two bundles of clothes, a pair of shoes, and the complete works of Rabelais, he had to signal the mechanic to stop the train to let him on. The old streets of Turkey at that time were a wasteland, where the last Arabs had finally let the god of hunger drag them to death according to the age-old custom of sitting in front of the door, because for many years they had to sell even the last piece of cross-woven fabric, and in the dark display cases, only headless mannequins remained. The neighborhood of the Banana Company, which perhaps Patricia Brown tried to recount to her descendants during the melancholy nights of pickled cantaloupe from Pratvon Alabama, had become a plain overgrown with weeds. The old priest, who came to replace Father Angel and whose name no one bothered to know, was waiting for God's mercy, lying sprawled on a hammock, suffering from arthritis and insomnia due to doubt, while lizards and mice argued over who would inherit the adjacent church. In that forgotten town of Macondo, where even the birds had forgotten it, where the dust and heat had become so unbearable that even breathing was a struggle, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula were the only happy people and the happiest on this earth, despite being surrounded by loneliness and love, especially the loneliness of love in a house where it was almost impossible to sleep due to the incessant noise caused by the swarm of ants.",28.123,27.985,"Alvaro was the first to heed the advice to leave Macondo. He sold off everything he had, including his pet tiger that roamed his garden and scared passersby, and bought a ticket for a train that would never stop, valid forever. In the postcards he sent along the way, he described the fleeting images seen from the compartment window. It was as if he were tearing up a long poem quickly forgotten and casting it into the void of oblivion. The imaginary black people in the cotton fields of Louisiana, the winged horses in the blue pastures of Kentucky, the Greek lovers making love in the hellfire-like sunset of Arizona, the girl in a red sweater painting a watercolor by the shore of a lake in Michigan and waving at Alvaro with the hand holding the brush—all were parts of this poem. The girl had waved her hand not in farewell, but with hope, unaware that the train had no return. Then one Saturday, Alfonso and German left with the intention of returning on Monday. But no one ever saw them again, nor did any news come. A year after the departure of the wise Catalonian, Gabriel was the only one of the four friends remaining in Macondo. Gabriel was surviving thanks to Nigromanta's benevolence and was continually answering the questions of a contest organized by a French magazine, which offered a free trip to Paris as a prize for the winner. Aureliano, who was subscribed to the magazine, helped Gabriel fill out the answers, sometimes at his house but mostly at the only pharmacy in Macondo, where Gabriel's secret lover Mercedes lived, working among ceramic bottles and the smell of medicines. The pharmacy was the only thing from the past that had not disappeared. Because it was consuming itself, constantly coming to an end but never quite reaching the end of its process of disappearance. The town had sunk into such a stupor and stagnation that when Gabriel won the contest and was about to set off for Paris with two sets of underwear, a pair of shoes, and all of Rabelais's books, he had to signal the engineer himself to stop the train so he could get on. Old Turks Street had turned into a desolate ruin. Only the last remaining Arabs were visible. Even though years had passed since they sold their last yard of cloth and nothing remained in the shaded shop windows but mannequins with broken necks, they sat in front of their doors, waiting to be dragged to death without breaking their century-old habits. In place of the Banana Company site, which Patricia Brown might have described like a fairy tale to entertain her grandchildren on nights when she was bored eating dill pickles in Pratville, Alabama, there stretched a plain covered with wild weeds as far as the eye could see. While lizards and mice were fighting over the church's inheritance in one corner, the old priest who had replaced Father Angel and whose name no one had bothered to learn was lying in his hammock, writhing from arteriosclerosis and insomnia brought on by doubt, waiting for God's mercy. In the vast Macondo, where birds had completely forgotten, and dust and heat had intensified to the point of taking one's breath away, and in the vast house, cut off from the world by the loneliness of love and affection, where there was no possibility of sleeping due to the noise of red ants, the only creatures who were happy were Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula. They were the happiest beings on earth.",23.565,23.408,"Álvaro was the first to heed the advice to leave Macondo. He sold everything, even the captive tiger that mocked passersby in his yard, and bought an eternal ticket on a train that never stopped traveling. In the postcards he sent from the intermediate stations, he described in shouts the instant images he had seen through the window of the carriage, and it was like tearing apart and throwing into oblivion the long poem of transience: the chimeric blacks in the cotton fields of Louisiana, the winged horses in the bluegrass of Kentucky, the Greek lovers in the infernal twilight of Arizona, the girl in the red sweater painting watercolors by the lakes of Michigan, who waved goodbye with her brushes, a farewell that was not of parting but of hope, because she did not know she was watching a train with no return pass by. Then Alfonso and Germán left, on a Saturday, with the idea of returning on Monday, and they were never heard from again. A year after the departure of the wise Catalan, the only one left in Macondo was Gabriel, still adrift, at the mercy of Nigromanta's capricious charity, and answering the questionnaires of a French magazine contest, whose grand prize was a trip to Paris. Aureliano, who was the one receiving the subscription, helped him fill out the forms, sometimes at his house, and almost always among the porcelain jars and the valerian-scented air of the only pharmacy left in Macondo, where Mercedes, Gabriel's silent girlfriend, lived. It was the last remnant of a past whose annihilation was never consummated, because it continued to annihilate itself indefinitely, consuming itself from within, ending every minute but never completely ending.

817,"Gaston had returned to Brussels. Tired of waiting for the airplane, one day he put his indispensable things into a small suitcase, took his file of correspondence, and left with the idea of returning by air before his concession was turned over to a group of German pilots who had presented the provincial authorities with a more ambitious project than his. Since the afternoon of their first love, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula had continued taking advantage of her husband’s rare unguarded moments, making love with gagged ardor in chance meetings and almost always interrupted by unexpected returns. But when they saw themselves alone in the house they succumbed to the delirium of lovers who were making up for lost time. It was a mad passion, unhinging, which made Fernanda’s bones tremble with horror in her grave and which kept them in a state of perpetual excitement. Amaranta Úrsula’s shrieks, her songs of agony would break out the same at two in the afternoon on the dining-room table as at two in the morning in the pantry. “What hurts me most,” she would say, laughing, “is all the time that we wasted.” In the bewilderment of passion she watched the ants devastating the garden, sating their prehistoric hunger with the beam of the house, and she watched the torrents of living lava take over the porch again, but she bothered to fight them only when she found them in her bedroom. Aureliano abandoned the parchments, did not leave the house again, and carelessly answered the letters from the wise Catalonian. They lost their sense of reality, the notion of time, the rhythm of daily habits. They closed the doors and windows again so as not to waste time getting undressed and they walked about the house as Remedios the Beauty had wanted to do and they would roll around naked in the mud of the courtyard, and one afternoon they almost drowned as they made love in the cistern. In a short time they did more damage than the red ants: they destroyed the furniture in the parlor, in their madness they tore to shreds the hammock that had resisted the sad bivouac loves of Colonel Aureliano Buendía and they disemboweled the mattresses and emptied them on the floor as they suffocated in storms of cotton. Although Aureliano was just as ferocious a lover as his rival, it was Amaranta Úrsula who ruled in that paradise of disaster with her mad genius and her lyrical voracity, as if she had concentrated in her love the unconquerable energy that her great-great-grandmother had given to the making of little candy animals. And yet, while she was singing with pleasure and dying with laughter over her own inventions, Aureliano was becoming more and more absorbed and silent, for his passion was self-centered and burning. Nevertheless, they both reached such extremes of virtuosity that when they became exhausted from excitement, they would take advantage of their fatigue. They would give themselves over to the worship of their bodies, discovering that the rest periods of love had unexplored possibilities, much richer than those of desire. While he would rub Amaranta Úrsula’s erect breasts with egg whites or smooth her elastic thighs and peach-like stomach with cocoa butter, she would play with Aureliano’s portentous creature as if it were a doll and would paint clown’s eyes on it with her lipstick and give it a Turk’s mustache with her eyebrow pencil, and would put on organza bow ties and little tinfoil hats. One night they daubed themselves from head to toe with peach jam and licked each other like dogs and made mad love on the floor of the porch, and they were awakened by a torrent of carnivorous ants who were ready to eat them alive.","Gaston had returned to Brussels, because after waiting endlessly for the plane that never arrived, one day he packed his personal belongings and correspondence into a suitcase and left with the intention of returning by plane before his privileges had to be ceded to a group of German pilots who had presented the provincial authorities with a more ambitious plan than his own. Since the afternoon they first made love, Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula continued to seize the rare moments when her husband was away to passionately love each other in brief encounters, always interrupted by the husband's unexpected return. But when they found themselves alone at home, they would collapse in exhaustion in the ecstatic moments of their belated love. It was a wild, frenzied passion, to the point that Fernanda's bones in her grave trembled with fear and seemed to dance incessantly. The joyful moans, the songs of longing from Amaranta Ursula echoed loudly at two in the afternoon on the dining table and at two in the morning in the pantry. "" What makes me sad,"" she laughed, ""is that we wasted so much time. "" And in the frenzy to satisfy her passion, she saw the ants destroying the garden and gnawing at the house's wood to satiate their long-standing hunger, and she saw the red ants once again taking over the hallway, but she only bothered to fight them when they invaded her bedroom. Aureliano neglected the texts written on parchment, stayed indoors, and hastily replied to the letters from the wise old man of Catalonia. They lost their sense of reality, their concept of time, and the rhythm of daily routines. They closed the doors and windows to avoid wasting time undressing, and walked around the house naked like Remedios the Beauty had often wished, rolling in the mud in the yard with their bodies uncovered, and one afternoon they nearly suffocated while making love in the bathtub. In a short time, they wreaked more havoc on the house than the red ants: breaking all the tables, chairs, and cabinets in the living room, tearing apart the hammock that had endured the dull lovemaking of Colonel Aureliano Buendía in the barracks, ripping open the bedding, and scattering the cotton stuffing all over the floor to suffocate each other. Although Aureliano was a lover with as many fierce tricks as his rival, Amaranta Ursula was the one who orchestrated their amusements in that shattered paradise, doing so with such enthusiasm as if she had concentrated in love the fervent energy that their ancestor Ursula had dedicated to making candy figurines. Moreover, while she sang joyfully and laughed heartily at their games, Aureliano grew more contemplative, for his passion was inherently quiet and cold. Nevertheless, both reached the peaks of the art of play, to the extent that when they were exhausted from their indulgences, they found even more delightful mischief in their moments of rest. They devoted themselves to the worship of their bodies, discovering that the moments of rest after pleasure offered untapped possibilities, far more enjoyable than the capabilities of lust. While he applied egg whites to Amaranta Ursula's firm breasts to massage them, or coconut oil to her toned thighs and soft belly to caress them, she treated Aureliano's strong body like a doll to play with, using lipstick to draw clown eyes on him, eyebrow pencil to give him a Turkish mustache, adorning him with an organza tie, and crowning him with a hat made of silver paper. One night, they smeared peach jam all over their bodies from head to toe and licked each other like dogs. Then, like a pair of madmen, they made love in the hallway and were awakened by flesh-eating ants about to devour them alive.",24.866,24.731,"Gaston had returned to Brussels. After getting tired of waiting for the plane, he packed his most necessary belongings into a small suitcase, took his letter file with him, and set out with the hope of taking the plane and returning before a group of German pilots who had presented a more favorable plan to the authorities than his own were granted a work permit. After the first day Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula made love, they continued their silent lovemaking during their meetings, which were almost always unexpectedly interrupted, taking advantage of Gaston's rare moments of absent-mindedness. But when they suddenly found themselves all alone at home, they were swept up in the enthusiasm of lovers trying to make up for all the lost time. It was a wild, unchained lust that made Fernanda's bones ache in her grave and kept the two lovers in a constant state of excitement and arousal. Amaranta Ursula would scream and moan on the dining table at two in the afternoon, just as she would moan and scream in the pantry at two in the morning. Laughing, she would say, -What pains me the most is that we have lost so much time. In the intoxication of passion and lust, losing himself, he watched as the ants ravaged the garden, satisfied their insatiable hunger by gnawing at the beams of the house, and as the ant flood, spreading like live lava, covered the veranda again, but he only endured the trouble of dealing with the ants that entered the bedroom. Aureliano also put aside the manuscripts, never stepped out of the house again, and began to respond randomly to the letters from the wise Catalonian. They lost their sense of reality, their concept of time, and the order of their daily habits. To avoid wasting time undressing, they covered all the doors and windows and started wandering around the house as Beautiful Remedios once desired, lying and rolling naked in the mud of the garden. One day, while trying to make love in the cistern, they almost drowned. In a short time, the damage they caused overshadowed that of the red ants. They smashed and broke the furniture in the living room, tore apart the hammock that had endured Colonel Aureliano Buendia's painful, encampment loves during their frenzied lovemaking, shredded the mattresses, and made love breathlessly amidst the cotton scattered on the floor. Although Aureliano, like his rival, was a wild and passionate lover, it was Amaranta Ursula's mad genius and insatiability that ruled in this disastrous paradise. It was as if Amaranta Ursula had concentrated all the tireless energy that her great-grandmother had spent on making animal-shaped sweets into her love. However, as Amaranta Ursula laughed and sang with joy at the love games she discovered, Aureliano became increasingly withdrawn and silent. Because his passion was inward and burning. Yet they pushed their skills to such extremes that when they were exhausted from excitement, they took advantage of their fatigue. They devoted themselves to worshipping their bodies, discovering countless new possibilities of lovemaking even during their rest periods, and found these to be much richer, more colorful, and intense than mere passion. While Aureliano rubbed Amaranta Ursula's erect nipples with egg white or massaged her flexible hips and peach-like belly with cocoa butter, Amaranta Ursula played with his enormous organ like a baby, drawing clown eyes on its tip with lipstick, putting on a mustache with an eyebrow pencil, tying organza ribbons as ties, and dressing it with tin foil hats. One night, they covered each other from head to toe in peach marmalade and licked like dogs, then made love on the veranda. Later, they woke up to the noise of a voracious ant swarm preparing to eat them alive.",23.085,22.936,"Gastón had returned to Brussels. Tired of waiting for the airplane, one day he packed the essential things and his correspondence archive into a small suitcase and left with the intention of returning by air, before his privileges were ceded to a group of German aviators who had presented the provincial authorities with a more ambitious project than his. Since the afternoon of their first love, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula had continued to take advantage of the husband's rare moments of carelessness, loving each other with restrained ardor in random encounters almost always interrupted by unexpected returns. But when they found themselves alone in the house, they succumbed to the delirium of their overdue love. It was an insane, unhinging passion that made Fernanda's bones tremble with terror in her grave and kept them in a state of perpetual exaltation. Amaranta Úrsula's screams, her agonizing songs, erupted just the same at two in the afternoon at the dining table as at two in the morning in the barn. ""What hurts me the most,"" she laughed, ""is all the time we lost."" In the daze of passion, he saw the ants devastating the garden, satisfying their prehistoric hunger on the house's wood, and he saw the torrent of live lava taking over the corridor again, but he only worried about fighting it when he found it in his bedroom. Aureliano abandoned the parchments, did not leave the house again, and answered the Catalan scholar's letters any which way. They lost their sense of reality, their notion of time, the rhythm of daily habits. They closed doors and windows again to avoid delays in undressing, and roamed the house as Remedios the Beauty had always wanted to be, and they rolled naked in the mud pits of the patio, and one afternoon they almost drowned while making love in the pool. In a short time, they caused more havoc than the red ants: they destroyed the living room furniture, tore apart the hammock that had withstood the sad camp loves of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, and ripped open the mattresses and emptied them on the floors to suffocate in storms of cotton. Although Aureliano was as fierce a lover as his rival, it was Amaranta Úrsula who commanded that paradise of disasters with her wild ingenuity and lyrical voracity, as if she had concentrated in love the indomitable energy that her great-great-grandmother had devoted to making little caramel animals. Moreover, while she sang with pleasure and laughed herself to death at her own inventions, Aureliano became more absorbed and silent, because his passion was introspective and scorching. However, both reached such extremes of virtuosity that when they were exhausted in exaltation, they made better use of their fatigue. They devoted themselves to the idolatry of their bodies, discovering that the tediums of love had unexplored possibilities, much richer than those of desire. While he kneaded Amaranta Úrsula's erect breasts with egg whites or softened her elastic thighs and peachy belly with coconut butter, she played dolls with Aureliano's prodigious creature, painting clown eyes with lip rouge and Turkish mustaches with eyebrow charcoal, and dressing it in organza bow ties and little silver paper hats. One night they smeared themselves from head to toe with peaches in syrup, licked each other like dogs, and made love like mad on the corridor floor, only to be awakened by a torrent of carnivorous ants preparing to devour them alive.",43.395,43.312
818,"During the pauses in their delirium, Amaranta Úrsula would answer Gaston’s letters. She felt him to be so far away and busy that his return seemed impossible to her. In one of his first letters he told her that his Partners had actually sent the airplane, but that a shipping agent in Brussels had sent it by mistake to Tanganyika, where it was delivered to the scattered tribe of the Makondos. That mix-up brought on so many difficulties that just to get the plane back might take two years. So Amaranta Úrsula dismissed the possibility of an inopportune return. Aureliano, for his part, had no other contact with the world except for the letters from the wise Catalonian and the news he had of Gabriel through Mercedes, the silent pharmacist. At first they were real contacts. Gabriel had turned in his return ticket in order to stay in Paris, selling the old newspapers and empty bottles that the chambermaids threw out of a gloomy hotel on the Rue Dauphine. Aureliano could visualize him then in a turtleneck sweater which he took off only when the sidewalk Cafés on Montparnasse filled with springtime lovers, and sleeping by day and writing by night in order to confuse hunger in the room that smelled of boiled cauliflower where Rocamadour was to die. Nevertheless, news about him was slowly becoming so uncertain, and the letters from the wise man so sporadic and melancholy, that Aureliano grew to think about them as Amaranta Úrsula thought about her husband, and both of them remained floating in an empty universe where the only everyday and eternal reality was love.","During the pauses in their orgies, Amaranta Ursula wrote letters to Gaston. She felt he was too busy and distant, making his return seem impossible to her. In one of the earliest letters he sent, he mentioned that his friends had indeed sent the plane, but a shipping company in Brussels mistakenly sent it to Tanganyika, and at that port, it would be redirected to the community of Macondo. The mistake caused so much trouble that it would take two years just to retrieve the plane. Thus, Amaranta Ursula did not have to worry about her husband's sudden return. As for Aureliano, he had no connection to the outside world other than the letters from the wise old man of Catalonia and the news about Gabriel through the quiet pharmacist, Mercedes. Those were the real connections. To stay in Paris, Gabriel had returned his round-trip ticket for spending money and then lived by selling old newspapers and bottles that the maids pulled out from the dismal Dolphin Hotel. At that time, Aureliano could imagine him always wearing a thick turtleneck sweater, only taking it off when the Montparnasse terraces were filled with springtime lovers, and in the room reeking of boiling cauliflower where Rocamato had starved to death, he had to sleep during the day and write at night to trick his hunger. However, the news about Gabriel he received became less accurate, and the letters from the wise old man grew fewer and duller, to the point that Aureliano came to think of them as Amaranta Ursula thought of her husband, and both floated in an empty world where love was the only reality, both mundane and eternal. While they sang and laughed heartily at their own games, Aureliano became more pensive, for his passion was inherently quiet and cold. However, both reached the heights of the art of play, to the point that when they were exhausted from their indulgences, they found even more delightful mischief during their rest.

In one of his first letters, Gaston wrote that his partners had indeed sent the plane, but due to a mistake by the shipping agent in Brussels, the plane had been delivered to the Makondo tribe in Tanganyika. This mix-up had caused so many difficulties that it could take up to two years just to retrieve the plane. Upon receiving this news, Amaranta Ursula dismissed the possibility of her husband's early return from her mind. Aureliano's connection with the world persisted only through the letters from the wise Catalonian and the news he received from Gabriel via the pharmacist Mercedes. Initially, these communications were of a genuine nature. Gabriel had decided to stay in Paris and had returned his return ticket. Now, he was making a living by selling old newspapers and empty bottles discarded by the room attendants from a gloomy hotel on Dauphine Street. Aureliano imagined him on the sidewalks of Montparnasse, in the cafés, with a fisherman's turtleneck sweater that he took off when the spring breeze blew; he envisioned Gabriel sleeping during the day and writing at night to confuse the hunger in that cauliflower-boiling-smelling room where Rocamadour would die. However, as the news from Gabriel became increasingly vague and the letters from the wise Catalonian began to take on a melancholic and disorganized tone, Aureliano started to see them as distant memories, much like how Amaranta Ursula thought of her husband. Thus, Amaranta Ursula and Aureliano remained suspended in an empty universe where the only daily and eternal truth was love.",22.491,22.163,"In the pauses of delirium, Amaranta Úrsula answered Gastón's letters. She felt him so distant and busy that his return seemed impossible to her. In one of the first letters, he mentioned that, in fact, his partners had sent the airplane, but a maritime agency in Brussels had mistakenly shipped it to Tanganyika, where it was delivered to the scattered Makondo community.

819,"Suddenly, like the stampede in that world of happy unawareness, came the news of Gaston’s return. Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula opened their eyes, dug deep into their souls, looked at the letter with their hands on their hearts, and understood that they were so close to each other that they preferred death to separation. Then she wrote her husband a letter of contradictory truths in which she repeated her love and said how anxious she was to see him again, but at the same time she admitted as a design of fate the impossibility of living without Aureliano. Contrary to what they had expected, Gaston sent them a calm, almost paternal reply, with two whole pages devoted to a warning against the fickleness of passion and a final paragraph with unmistakable wishes for them to be as happy as he had been during his brief conjugal experience. It was such an unforeseen attitude that Amaranta Úrsula felt humiliated by the idea that she had given her husband the pretext that he had wanted in order to abandon her to her fate. The rancor was aggravated six months later when Gaston wrote again from Léopoldville, where he had finally recovered the airplane, simply to ask them to ship him the velocipede, which of all that he had left behind in Macondo was the only thing that had any sentimental value for him. Aureliano bore Amaranta Úrsula’s spite patiently and made an effort to show her that he could be as good a husband in adversity as in prosperity, and the daily needs that besieged them when Gaston’s last money ran out created a bond of solidarity between them that was not as dazzling and heady as passion, but that let them make love as much and be as happy as during their uproarious and salacious days. At the time Pilar Ternera died they were expecting a child.","Suddenly, the news that Gaston would return hit them like a thunderbolt in their blissfully unconscious world. Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula opened their eyes wide, looked into their hearts, then placed their hands on their hearts, looked straight at each other, and understood that they were so attached to each other that they would accept death if they had to be apart. So she wrote her husband a letter stating completely contradictory truths, in which she earnestly said that she still loved him and longed to see him again, while also making it clear that she could not live without Aureliano and considered it an unavoidable destiny. Contrary to what they expected, with a calm attitude, one might say a fatherly attitude, in a two-page letter filled with words, Gaston replied to them, noting that they should be wary of impulsive desires arising from their current passion, and at the end of the letter, he completely agreed not to return to Macondo because he believed they would be happy as he had been in their short-lived married life. It was such an unexpected attitude that Amaranta Ursula felt humiliated by the thought that she had prepared an excuse for her husband, which he had been waiting for, to abandon her to fate. Six months later, the hatred deepened when Gaston, from Leopoldville where he had retrieved his airplane, wrote to her again, only asking her to send him the pedal-powered bicycle, which he said was the only thing among what he had left in Macondo that still held sentimental value. Aureliano calmly took care of Amaranta Ursula's bedroom, trying to show her that he was a worthy husband in both good times and bad, and the daily hardships surrounding them as the last of Gaston's money was spent created a bond of solidarity between them. Though it was not as bright and proud as passion, it helped them love each other more deeply and made them very happy, just as they had been during their time of sensual living. When Pilar Ternera passed away, they were expecting the birth of their child.",21.807,21.535,"In this world of blissful abandon, the news of Gaston's return caused an unexpected panic. Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula opened their eyes, searched the depths of their souls, pressed their hands to their hearts as they looked at the letter, and realized that they were so close to each other that they would rather die than part. Upon this, Amaranta Ursula wrote a letter to her husband filled with contradictory truths, explaining how much she loved him and how happy she was to see him again, but that as a fate of destiny, she could not live without Aureliano. Contrary to their expectations, they received an extremely calm, almost fatherly letter from Gaston. For two pages, Gaston warned them about the transience and uncertainty of passions, and as he concluded the letter, he wished them happiness in proportion to the joy he had experienced in his own brief marriage. Gaston’s attitude was so unexpectedly peculiar that Amaranta Ursula, feeling that her husband was looking for an excuse to abandon her to her fate and that she had unwittingly provided him with that excuse, concluded that she had been humiliated. Six months later, when Gaston wrote from Leopoldville mentioning that he had finally acquired his airplane and asking for his bicycle, the only item of sentimental value he had left in Macondo, Amaranta Ursula's anger flared up again. Aureliano patiently endured Amaranta Ursula’s wrath and tried to prove that he could be as good a husband in times of hardship as he had been in times of plenty. When Gaston’s last bit of money ran out, the daily necessities that arose created a bond of solidarity between the two of them. While this bond was not as intoxicating as their initial passion, it still allowed them to make love and be happy as they had in the early days of their relationship.

But except for Mercedes, who bought a dozen, she could not find any customers.

An uncertain and undefined future forced them to direct their emotions towards the past.

830,"So Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula accepted the version of the basket, not because they believed it, but because it spared them their terror. As the pregnancy advanced they were becoming a single being, they were becoming more and more integrated in the solitude of a house that needed only one last breath to be knocked down. They restricted themselves to an essential area, from Fernanda’s bedroom, where the charms of sedentary love were visible, to the beginning of the porch, where Amaranta Úrsula would sit to sew bootees and bonnets for the newborn baby and Aureliano, would answer the occasional letters from the wise Catalonian. The rest of the house was given over to the tenacious assault of destruction. The silver shop, Melquíades’ room, the primitive and silent realm of Santa Sofía de la Piedad remained in the depths of a domestic jungle that no one would have had the courage to penetrate. Surrounded by the voracity of nature, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula continued cultivating the oregano and the begonias and defended their world with demarcations of quicklime, building the last trenches in the age-old war between man and ant. Her long and neglected hair, the splotches that were beginning to appear on her face, the swelling of her legs, the deformation of her former lovemaking weasel’s body had changed Amaranta Úrsula from the youthful creature she had been when she arrived at the house with the cage of luckless canaries and her captive husband, but it did not change the vivacity of her spirit. “Shit,” she would say, laughingly. “Who would have thought that we really would end up living like cannibals!” The last thread that joined them to the world was broken on the sixth month of pregnancy when they received a letter that obviously was not from the wise Catalonian. It had been mailed in Barcelona, but the envelope was addressed in conventional blue ink by an official hand and it had the innocent and impersonal look of hostile messages. Aureliano snatched it out of Amaranta Úrsula’s hands as she was about to open it.","So Auréliano and Amaranta Úrsula accepted the story of the basket as proof of Auréliano's origins, not because they believed it but because it had the effect of bringing peace to their souls. As the fetus grew larger, they became so close that they were like one, increasingly merging themselves into the solitude of a rickety house that could collapse with just a gust of wind. They restricted their activities to the truly necessary spaces, meaning from Fernanda's bedroom, where hours of serene pleasure lit up, to the hallway, where Amaranta Úrsula sat sewing shoes and hats for the newborn, and where Auréliano sat writing responses to the letters from the wise old man from Catalonia, which he only occasionally received. The rest of the house had surrendered to the destructive forces of nature that were tightening their grip. The jewelry workshop, Melquíades' room, the primordial and silent realms of SantaSofía de la Piedad, all were engulfed in a wild forest existing right inside the house that no one dared to step into. Besieged by savage nature, Auréliano and Amaranta Úrsula continued to plant marjoram and defended their world with chalk lines to erect the last bastions of the age-old war between humans and red ants. Her long hair unkempt, her face bruised with blood clots, her feet swollen and sore in the morning, her once sleek and loving body now sagging, all these things had stripped Amaranta Úrsula of the youthful appearance she had when she returned home with the unfortunate canary cage and the obedient husband, but they had not changed her inner strength. ""Damn it,"" she would often joke, ""Who would have thought that we would end up living like cannibals."" The last thread binding them to the outside world was severed when the pregnancy reached seven months, when they received a letter, but it was clearly not from the wise old man from Catalonia. The envelope, sent from Barcelona, was torn at the edges, but because it was written in a neat hand with blue ink, it looked appealing. It had a simple appearance and no sender's name, like letters from an enemy. Auréliano snatched the letter from Amaranta Úrsula's hand just as she was about to open it.",20.497,20.235,"Thus, Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula accepted the basket tale, not because they believed in it, but because it saved them from being terrified. As the pregnancy progressed, they grew closer to each other, becoming a single entity, merging into one being within the loneliness of the house that would collapse at the slightest puff. They had retreated to the very limited part of the house that was sufficient for them. They stayed in Fernanda's bedroom, making love and gazing at each other without moving from their spots. They also made use of a section of the veranda. Here, Amaranta Ursula would sit and sew bonnets and booties for the baby to be born, while Aureliano would write replies to the letters occasionally sent by the wise Catalonian. The rest of the house was left to the relentless assault of decay. The silver workshop, Melquiades' room, and the primitive and silent world of Santa Sofia de la Piedad remained in the depths of this domestic jungle, where no one dared to enter. Amaranta Ursula and Aureliano, surrounded by the insatiability of nature, continued to cultivate hydrangeas and begonias, and were preparing their defensive lines by digging the last trenches of the century-old war between man and ants with lime. Her long and unkempt hair, the pregnancy spots on her face, the swelling of her legs, the deterioration of her once slender body that used to writhe while making love, had distanced Amaranta Ursula from the youthful state she had when she first came home with the unfortunate canaries and her love-struck husband, but it had not changed the liveliness and wildness of her spirit. ""What a shitty job, huh!"" she laughed, ""Who would have thought that we would end up living like real savages!"" she said. With the arrival of the letter they received in the sixth month of pregnancy, which was immediately apparent not to have come from the wise Catalonian, the last tie binding them to the world was severed.

The stranger’s letter, which no one read, was left to the mercy of the moths on the shelf where Fernanda had forgotten her wedding ring on occasion and there it remained, consuming itself in the inner fire of its bad news as the solitary lovers sailed against the tide of those days of the last stages, those impenitent and ill-fated times which were squandered on the useless effort of making them drift toward the desert of disenchantment and oblivion. Aware of that menace, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula spent the hot months holding hands, ending with the love of loyalty for the child who had his beginning in the madness of fornication.

Fully aware of this threat, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula lived hand in hand until the final months, perfecting the conception of their two sons with faithful love that had begun in the throes of carnal frenzy. At night, they embraced each other in bed, unafraid of the loud noises of the ants building nests, the buzzing of the cockroaches, or the groaning and echoing sounds of weeds growing in the adjacent rooms. Many times, they were awakened by the wandering ghosts. They heard Úrsula fighting against the laws of creation to maintain her lineage, heard José Arcadio Buendía searching for the elusive truth of great inventions, heard Fernanda murmuring prayers, heard Colonel Aureliano Buendía dazed by the deceit of war and the golden fishes, heard Aureliano Segundo exhausted by loneliness in his wild revelries, and thus they understood that these primary obsessions held value against death, and they were happy with the clear thought that they would continue to love each other with their essence after death, when some future species would help them eradicate the pests that were wiping out the people in this wretched paradise.",21.737,21.403,"As Aureliano sensed, the wise Catalonian never wrote another letter.

The lovers who were left alone surrendered themselves to the swelling waves of the final stages, caught in the current of those regretless, ill-fated days that embarked on the unnecessary effort of dragging them towards the desert where the spell was broken and forgetfulness began. Amaranta Ursula and Aureliano, aware of the danger hovering over them, spent their last months holding hands and nurturing love for the child that would be born during the period when their bond, conceived in the madness of incest, was absolute.

They tried to help her with applications of spider webs and balls of ash, but it was like trying to hold back a spring with one’s hands. During the first hours she tried to maintain her good humor. She took the frightened Aureliano by the hand and begged him not to worry, because people like her were not made to die against their will, and she exploded with laughter at the ferocious remedies of the midwife.

838,"Aureliano did not understand until then how much he loved his friends, how much he missed them, and how much he would have given to be with them at that moment. He put the child in the basket that his mother had prepared for him, covered the face of the corpse with a blanket, and wandered aimlessly through the town, searching for an entrance that went back to the past. He knocked at the door of the pharmacy, where he had not visited lately, and he found a carpenter shop. The old woman who opened the door with a lamp in her hand took pity on his delirium and insisted that, no, there had never been a pharmacy there, nor had she ever known a woman with a thin neck and sleepy eyes named Mercedes. He wept, leaning his brow against the door of the wise Catalonian’s former bookstore, conscious that he was paying with his tardy sobs for a death that he had refused to weep for on time so as not to break the spell of love. He smashed his fists against the cement wall of The Golden Child, calling for Pilar Ternera, indifferent to the luminous orange disks that were crossing the sky and that so many times on holiday nights he had contemplated with childish fascination from the courtyard of the curlews. In the last open salon of the tumbledown red-light district an accordion group was playing the songs of Rafael Escalona, the bishop’s nephew, heir to the secrets of Francisco the Man. The bartender, who had a withered and somewhat crumpled arm because he had raised it against his mother, invited Aureliano to have a bottle of cane liquor, and Aureliano then bought him one. The bartender spoke to him about the misfortune of his arm. Aureliano spoke to him about the misfortune of his heart, withered and somewhat crumpled for having been raised against his sister. They ended up weeping together and Aureliano felt for a moment that the pain was over. But when he was alone again in the last dawn of Macondo, he opened up his arms in the middle of the square, ready to wake up the whole world, and he shouted with all his might:","Up until this moment, Aureliano hadn't realized how much he loved his friends, how much he needed them, and how much he longed to see them. He placed the infant in the basket that its mother had prepared, covered the corpse with a shawl, and then wandered aimlessly through the desolate village in search of a ravine that would lead him back to the past. He knocked on the door of the pharmacy, a place he hadn't visited recently, only to find that it had turned into a carpenter's workshop. An old woman opened the door for him, holding an oil lamp, pitying him for being lost, and insisted that this was never a pharmacy, that it had never been a pharmacy, and that she had never known a girl with a high-necked collar and dreamy eyes named Mercedes. He leaned his head against the door of the old wise Catalonian's bookshop to cry, believing that with his belated tears, he was paying off a debt for a death he hadn't wanted to mourn at the time, so as not to interrupt the enchantment of love. He clenched his fist and struck the brick walls of the house where the Golden Boy, a name given by Pilar Ternera, was kept, not noticing the bright orange discs flying across the sky that he had eagerly watched during a festival night in the courtyard of the herons. A band of accordions played the songs of Rafael Escalona, the bishop's nephew, and the successor of Francisco the Man at the now deserted outdoor tavern in the gambling neighborhood. The tavern owner, with a withered arm as if scarred by fire from having used it to harm his mother, invited Aureliano to share a bottle of strong liquor, and afterward, Aureliano invited him to share another bottle. The tavern owner told Aureliano about the misfortune of his arm. Aureliano told him about the misfortune of his heart, withered and scarred from having used it to harm his sister's life. After sharing their stories, they cried together, and Aureliano suddenly felt his inner pain ease. But when he stood alone in the final dawn of Macondo, he spread his arms wide in the middle of the square, ready to awaken the entire world, and with all his soul, he screamed:",28.867,28.669,"Aureliano had never understood until that moment how much he loved his friends, how much he missed them, and what he would give to be with them at that moment. He laid the child in the basket prepared by his mother, covered the face of the corpse with a blanket, then wandered around the town looking for a door that opened to the past. He knocked on the door of the pharmacy he hadn't visited recently. A carpenter's shop had opened in place of the pharmacy. The old woman who opened the door of the carpenter's shop, after holding the lamp in her hand up to his face and looking at him, pitied his ramblings and insisted that there had never been a pharmacy there and that she had never known a girl named Mercedes with a slender neck and dreamy eyes. Aureliano began to cry, leaning his forehead against the door of the wise Catalonian's old shop. With these belated tears, he realized he was paying his debt to a deceased person he couldn't cry for in time to avoid breaking the spell of love. Without paying any attention to the orange-colored, bright rings passing through the sky, which he had watched with childlike admiration in the garden full of woodcocks during the old revelry nights, he pounded on the cement-covered door of the Golden Boy and called out to Pilar Ternera. In the last open hall of the red-light district, which had been devastated, a group was playing the accordion and singing the songs of Rafael Escalona, the nephew of the bishop and heir to the secrets of Francisco the Devil Teaser. The bartender, whose arm had shriveled and dried up because he had raised his hand against his mother, invited Aureliano to drink cane liquor. Aureliano bought him a drink. The bartender told him what had happened to his arm. Aureliano then told him what had happened to his heart, which had shriveled and dried up because he had fallen in love with his sister. In the end, they began to cry together, and for a moment, Aureliano felt as if their pain had ceased. However, as the last dawn of Macondo broke, he stood in the middle of the field once again alone, raised his arms to the sides, and shouted with all his might as if he wanted the whole world to hear: -A friend is nothing but a bunch of scoundrels!",31.023,30.844,"Aureliano did not realize until then how much he loved his friends, how much he missed them, and how much he would have given to be with them at that moment. He placed the child in the basket that his mother had prepared for him, covered the face of the corpse with a blanket, and wandered aimlessly through the deserted town, searching for a passage back to the past. He knocked on the door of the pharmacy, where he had not been in recent times, and what he found was a carpentry workshop. The old woman who opened the door with a lamp in her hand took pity on his delirium and insisted that no, there had never been a pharmacy there, nor had she ever known a woman with a slender neck and sleepy eyes named Mercedes. He cried with his forehead pressed against the door of the old bookstore of the wise Catalan, aware that he was paying for the overdue tears of a death he did not want to mourn in time so as not to break the spells of love. He broke his fists against the mortar walls of El Niño de Oro, clamoring for Pilar Ternera, indifferent to the luminous orange discs that crossed the sky, which he had so often watched with childish fascination on festive nights from the courtyard of the curlews. In the last open hall of the dismantled tolerance neighborhood, an accordion ensemble played the songs of Rafael Escalona, the bishop's nephew, heir to the secrets of Francisco the Man. The bartender, who had a dry and seemingly charred arm from raising it against his mother, invited Aureliano to share a bottle of aguardiente, and Aureliano invited him to another. The bartender spoke to him about the misfortune of his arm. Aureliano spoke to him about the misfortune of his heart, dry and seemingly charred from raising it against his sister. They ended up crying together, and for a moment, Aureliano felt that the pain had ended. But when he was alone again in the last dawn of Macondo, he spread his arms in the middle of the plaza, ready to wake up the whole world, and shouted with all his soul:",62.49,62.402

Thinking that it would console him, she took a piece of charcoal and erased the innumerable loves that he still owed her for, and she voluntarily brought up her own most solitary sadnesses so as not to leave him alone in his weeping. When he awoke, after a dull and brief sleep, Aureliano recovered the awareness of his headache. He opened his eyes and remembered the child.","The necromancer pulled him out of the slimy mud of vomit and tears. She took him to his room, cleaned him up, and gave him a glass of sugarcane juice. She used charcoal to erase the marks of the debts he owed after countless times of sleeping with her, thinking that by doing so she would comfort him, and she evoked lonely sorrows in a comforting way so that he wouldn't have to cry alone. When he woke up after a restless and short sleep, Aureliano realized he had a headache. He opened his eyes and remembered the infant.",27.127,26.358,"Nigromanta saved him just as he was about to drown in a pool of vomit and tears. She took Aureliano to his room, cleaned him up, and gave him hot broth to drink. Then, in the hope of comforting him, she took a piece of charcoal and scribbled down old love debts, and to not leave Aureliano alone in his tears, she started crying and pouring out her own troubles. Aureliano briefly passed out and slept. When he woke up, he had a headache. He opened his eyes, and at that moment, the thought of the child crossed his mind.",28.439,27.748,"Nigromanta rescued him from a puddle of vomit and tears. She took him to his room, cleaned him up, and made him drink a cup of broth.

At dawn, after a clumsy and brief sleep, Aureliano regained consciousness of his headache. He opened his eyes and remembered the child.",53.822,53.415
841,"He could not find the basket. At first he felt an outburst of joy, thinking that Amaranta Úrsula had awakened from death to take care of the child. But her corpse was a pile of stones under the blanket. Aware that when he arrived he had found the -door to the bedroom open, Aureliano went across the porch which was saturated with the morning sighs of oregano and looked into the dining room, where the remnants of the birth still lay: the large pot, the bloody sheets, the jars of ashes, and the twisted umbilical cord of the child on an opened diaper on the table next to the shears and the fishline. The idea that the midwife had returned for the child during the night gave him a pause of rest in which to think. He sank into the rocking chair, the same one in which Rebeca had sat during the early days of the house to give embroidery lessons, and in which Amaranta had played Chinese checkers with Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, and in which Amaranta Úrsula had sewn the tiny clothing for the child, and in that flash of lucidity he became aware that he was unable to bear in his soul the crushing weight of so much past. Wounded by the fatal lances of his own nostalgia and that of others, he admired the persistence of the spider webs on the dead rose bushes, the perseverance of the rye grass, the patience of the air in the radiant February dawn. And then he saw the child. It was a dry and bloated bag of skin that all the ants in the world were dragging toward their holes along the stone path in the garden. Aureliano could not move. Not because he was paralyzed by horror but because at that prodigious instant Melquíades’ final keys were revealed to him and he saw the epigraph of the parchments perfectly placed in the order of man’s time and space: The first of the line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by the ants.","He did not see the infant in the basket. Suddenly, he was overwhelmed with joy, believing that Amaranta Úrsula had come back from the dead to take care of the child. But the corpse, like a stone, still lay under the shawl. Remembering clearly that when he got home, he had seen the bedroom door wide open, Aureliano quickly walked through the hallway filled with the morning scent of marjoram, peered into the dining room where the mess from the childbirth was still scattered: the large pan, the blood-stained bed sheets, the ash buckets, and the shriveled umbilical cord of the infant lying on a diaper spread out on the table next to the scissors and spool of thread. The thought that the midwife had returned to hold the baby throughout the night brought him a bit of peace to think. He threw himself onto the wicker rocking chair, the very same chair where Rebeca had once sat to teach embroidery to her friends in the early days of the family, where Amaranta played checkers with Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, where Amaranta Úrsula sewed baby clothes, and in a brilliant flash of insight, he realized that he could no longer bear the weight of the past pressing on his soul. Weary from the deadly spears of his own and others' nostalgia, Aureliano gazed in wonder at the stubborn cobwebs covering the dead rose garden, the persistent weeds growing wildly everywhere, and the tranquil air enveloping the fiery February morning. And then he saw the infant. By now, it was nothing more than a dry, swollen skin, being carried away by ants from all over the earth, who were laboriously transporting it along rocky paths back to their nest. Aureliano could not move. He could not move, not because of the terrifying fear that kept him still, but because in that magical moment, the precise codes of Melquíades appeared before his eyes, and the script written on those parchments was arranged accurately in the time and space of human beings: The first of the line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by ants.",24.46,24.221,"He couldn't find the basket. At first, he was happy, thinking that Amaranta Ursula had woken up from the sleep of death to look after the child. However, his wife's corpse lay under the blanket like a heap of stones. Remembering that he had found the bedroom door open when he arrived, Aureliano passed through the veranda filled with the morning breath of hydrangeas, looked into the dining room where the large basin left from the birth, the bloody sheets, the jars filled with ashes, the umbilical cord lying in the middle of the cloth next to the fishing line and scissors on the table had not yet been cleared away. The thought that the midwife might have come at night and taken the child gave him a moment of relief to think. He sat in the rocking chair where Rebeca had sat while giving embroidery lessons in the early days of the house, where Amaranta had sat playing Chinese checkers with Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, and where Amaranta Ursula had sat sewing the baby's clothes, and in that brief moment of gathering his thoughts, he realized that he could not bear the crushing weight of so many years of past on his soul. With his heart pierced by deadly spears made of his own and others' longings, he admired the resilience of the spider webs on the dried rose bushes, the persistence of the weeds, and the patience of the air filling the bright February morning. Then he saw the child. To this dried and swollen sack of skin that had long since left childhood behind, all the ants in the world clung to the stony path of the garden, each pulling towards its own nest. Aureliario couldn't move from his spot. He was not frozen in place out of terror, but because Melquiades' final clue had just become clear to him. The last sentence in the manuscripts fit perfectly into the arrangement of time and space. -The founder of the line is tied to a tree, and the last one is eaten by ants, Melquiades had written.",26.506,26.254,"He did not find him in the bassinet. At first, he experienced an explosion of joy, believing that Amaranta Úrsula had awakened from death to take care of the child. But the corpse was a mound of stones under the blanket.

He collapsed into the rocking chair, the same one in which Rebeca had sat in the early days of the house to give embroidery lessons, and in which Amaranta played Chinese checkers with Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, and in which Amaranta Úrsula sewed the child's clothes, and in that flash of clarity, he realized that he was incapable of bearing on his soul the overwhelming weight of so much past. Wounded by the mortal spears of his own and others' nostalgias, he admired the impassiveness of the cobweb on the dead rose bushes, the perseverance of the weeds, the patience of the air in the radiant February dawn. And then he saw the child. It was a swollen and dried-up skin, which all the ants in the world were laboriously dragging towards their nests along the stone path of the garden. Aureliano could not move. Not because he was paralyzed by astonishment, but because in that prodigious instant, the definitive keys of Melquíades were revealed to him, and he saw the epigraph of the parchments perfectly ordered in the time and space of men: The first of the lineage is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by ants.",57.945,57.836
842,"Aureliano, had never been more lucid in any act of his life as when he forgot about his dead ones and the pain of his dead ones and nailed up the doors and windows again with Fernanda’s crossed boards so as not to be disturbed by any temptations of the world, for he knew then that his fate was written in Melquíades’ parchments. He found them intact among the prehistoric plants and steaming puddles and luminous insects that had removed all trace of man’s passage on earth from the room, and he did not have the calmness to bring them out into the light, but right there, standing, without the slightest difficulty, as if they had been written in Spanish and were being read under the dazzling splendor of high noon, he began to decipher them aloud. It was the history of the family, written by Melquíades, down to the most trivial details, one hundred years ahead of time. He had written it in Sanskrit, which was his mother tongue, and he had encoded the even lines in the private cipher of the Emperor Augustus and the odd ones in a Lacedemonian military code. The final protection, which Aureliano had begun to glimpse when he let himself be confused by the love of Amaranta Úrsula, was based on the fact that Melquíades had not put events in the order of man’s conventional time, but had concentrated a century of daily episodes in such a way that they coexisted in one instant. Fascinated by the discovery, Aureliano, read aloud without skipping the chanted encyclicals that Melquíades himself had made Arcadio listen to and that were in reality the prediction of his execution, and he found the announcement of the birth of the most beautiful woman in the world who was rising up to heaven in body and soul, and he found the origin of the posthumous twins who gave up deciphering the parchments, not simply through incapacity and lack of drive, but also because their attempts were premature. At that point, impatient to know his own origin, Aureliano skipped ahead. Then the wind began, warm, incipient, full of voices from the past, the murmurs of ancient geraniums, sighs of disenchantment that preceded the most tenacious nostalgia. He did not notice it because at that moment he was discovering the first indications of his own being in a lascivious grandfather who let himself be frivolously dragged along across a hallucinated plateau in search of a beautiful woman who would not make him happy. Aureliano recognized him, he pursued the hidden paths of his descent, and he found the instant of his own conception among the scorpions and the yellow butterflies in a sunset bathroom where a mechanic satisfied his lust on a woman who was giving herself out of rebellion. He was so absorbed that he did not feel the second surge of wind either as its cyclonic strength tore the doors and windows off their hinges, pulled off the roof of the east wing, and uprooted the foundations. Only then did he discover that Amaranta Úrsula was not his sister but his aunt, and that Sir Francis Drake had attacked Riohacha only so that they could seek each other through the most intricate labyrinths of blood until they would engender the mythological animal that was to bring the line to an end. Macondo was already a fearful whirlwind of dust and rubble being spun about by the wrath of the biblical hurricane when Aureliano skipped eleven pages so as not to lose time with facts he knew only too well, and he began to decipher the instant that he was living, deciphering it as he lived it, prophesying himself in the act of deciphering the last page of the parchments, as if he were looking into a speaking mirror. Then he skipped again to anticipate the predictions and ascertain the date and circumstances of his death. Before reaching the final line, however, he had already understood that he would never leave that room, for it was foreseen that the city of mirrors (or mirages) would be wiped out by the wind and exiled from the memory of men at the precise moment when Aureliano Babilonia would finish deciphering the parchments, and that everything written on them was unrepeatable since time immemorial and forever more, because races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth.","In any action in his life, Aureliano had never been as clear-headed as when he forgot his deceased loved ones and their sorrow, took Fernanda's door bolt to lock all the doors and stay inside because at that moment he understood his fate had been written on Melquiades' parchments. He saw them pristine, lying next to prehistoric trees and damp mud puddles with glowing insects that had expelled all traces of human presence from the room, and he no longer had the composure to bring the parchments into the light. Instead, he stood there, still seeing the letters clearly, as if they were written in Spanish under the bright midday light. He began to read aloud the encoded pages. It was the story of the family, written by Melquiades in meticulous detail down to the smallest particulars a hundred years earlier. He had written it in Sanskrit, his native language, encoding the rhymed poems of Emperor Augustus with his own cipher and the unrhymed poems with the Greek military code. Melquiades' ultimate intention, which Aureliano began to realize when he stopped letting his love for Amaranta Úrsula confuse him, lay in the fact that Melquiades did not arrange the events chronologically but instead concentrated a century's worth of daily occurrences to coexist at once. Excited by his achievement, Aureliano read aloud, without stumbling, the elegies that Melquiades himself had read to Arcadio, which were actually prophecies of his execution. Then he read the foretelling of the birth of the most beautiful woman in the world who would completely ascend.",4.112,4.052,"Aureliano has never been as clear-headed in any period of his life as he was when he nailed the doors and windows shut again with Fernanda's crosswise boards, to avoid being seduced by the world's temptations and to not forget his dead and the pain of his dead. Because he knew that his destiny was found in Melquiades' writings. In Melquiades' room, among the prehistoric plants that had developed by erasing all traces indicating the existence of humans on earth, the bubbling puddles, and the shiny insects, he found the manuscripts intact and, unable to wait to bring them into the daylight, stood in the middle of the room and began to read them aloud effortlessly, as if they were written in Spanish and were being read in the dazzling midday sun. These writings were the family's history, written by Melquiades a century before the events, covering everything down to the smallest detail. Melquiades had written the texts in his native Sanskrit, coding the even-numbered verses with Emperor Augustus's secret cipher and the odd-numbered verses with the Spartan military cipher. At the time when Aureliano was preoccupied with Amaranta Ursula's love, the last code he was about to decipher was the manner in which the history was written. Melquiades had not arranged the events in the usual chronological order; he had compiled the daily events that occurred over a century in such a way that all the events seemed to happen simultaneously. It seemed like. Enchanted by this discovery, Aureliano read aloud the passage that Melquiades had read to Arcadio, which actually determined Arcadio's execution, without skipping a word. Then he read the news of the birth of the most beautiful woman in the world who flew to heaven, and discovered the identity of the twins who, not out of lack of talent or laziness but because their attempts were untimely, gave up deciphering the manuscripts after their father's death. When he reached that part of the writings, Aureliano, impatient to learn his own identity, skipped a few pages. Then, a warm breeze began, laden with the voices of the past, the murmur of old geraniums, and the broken sighs that led to the most relentless yearnings. Aureliano did not notice the wind. Because at that moment, he was investigating his own origins, finding the first signs of his own being in a lustful grandfather who had set out in search of a beautiful woman who would not make him happy. Aureliano recognized him, understanding how he came into being among the scorpions in the bathroom at sunset where a woman who devoted herself to rebellion and a worker who quenched his passion with her met, following the secret path of his descendants with yellow butterflies. He was so engrossed in what he was reading that he didn't notice the wind turning into a hurricane, tearing doors and windows off their hinges, blowing off the roof of the east wing, and shaking the foundations of the house. It was only then that he understood that Sir Francis Drake had attacked Rioacha so that Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula could search for each other in the most intricate labyrinths of blood until Amaranta Ursula, who was not his sister but his aunt, brought into the world the legendary creature that would mark the end of their lineage. At the moment Aureliano skipped eleven pages at once to avoid wasting time on events he knew very well, Macondo had already turned into a whirlwind of dust and stones, swept up by the wrath of the storm written in the Holy Scriptures. Aureliano set out to decipher the section describing the moment he was living in. On one hand, he was deciphering the code, on the other, he was living what he read, experiencing the events written on the last pages as if he were looking into a talking mirror. Then, he skipped a page to learn how and when his own death would occur. Before reaching the last line, he had realized that he would never be able to leave that room again. Because the manuscripts stated that at the moment Aureliano Babilonia deciphered the codes, the city of mirrors (or mirages) would be swept away by the wind and erased from people's memories, and what was written would never be repeated from the beginning to the end of the universe. Because the lineages condemned to a hundred years of solitude could not have a second chance on earth.",25.359,25.24,"Aureliano had never been more lucid in any act of his life than when he forgot his dead and the pain of his dead, and nailed the doors and windows shut again with Fernanda's crossbars to avoid being disturbed by any temptation of the world, because he then knew that his destiny was written in Melquíades' parchments.
