3,"There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.","There was a King with a stubborn chin and an ordinary Queen on the throne of England; there was a King with a stubborn chin and a beautiful Queen on the throne of France. In both countries, for those who monopolized the nation's treasures of bread and fish, it was as clear as daylight that everything had ultimately been ordained for eternity.",29.309,28.306,"On the throne of England sat a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, while on the throne of France sat a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face. In both countries, the nobles, who were well-fed at the expense of the people's hunger, had a belief that everything would continue forever in such a state of bliss.",49.351,48.68,"A king with well-developed jaws and a queen with a flattened face sat on the throne of England, and a king with large jaws and a queen with a beautiful face occupied the throne of France.

4,"It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.","It was the year 1775. Prophecies and revelations were becoming popular in England at that time, just as they are now. That year, the prophetess Southcott had just turned the blessed age of twenty-five, but even before that, a humble soldier with the ability to predict in the Guards had foretold her extraordinary advent by declaring that fate had decreed London and Westminster must be buried*. Even the ghost of Cock Lane*, after tapping out its messages, had only been at rest for about twelve years when, just a year before that time, many other spirits (not necessarily of supernatural origin) began tapping out messages again. These messages were all about the mundane events that had recently occurred to the King and the people of England, originating from a congress of English subjects in America*. Strangely enough, this matter turned out to be more important to humanity than all the messages received through any goblin in Cock Lane.",10.943,9.937,"It was the year 1775 AD. In this extraordinary period in England, as it is now, communication with the spirit world was commonplace. Joanna Southcott had just turned twenty-five, and years earlier, a soldier in the Guards Regiment with the gift of prophecy had proclaimed that preparations were being made for the destruction of London and Westminster, actually heralding the arrival of this exalted being into the world. It had only been twelve years since the ghost of Cock Lane, like the spirits that have recently emerged, lightly tapped on tables (never having a share of originality) and left its messages before being exorcised. Simple messages concerning worldly matters were just beginning to reach the throne and people of England from the congress of British citizens in America; interestingly, these messages turned out to be more important for all humanity than any messages received by the girls in the houses of Cock Lane.",8.534,7.371,"It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. In such a favored period, spiritual revelations could not be lacking in England. Mrs. Southcott had recently celebrated her twenty-fifth birthday, whose sublime appearance in the world had been duly announced by a guardsman, a private prophet, predicting that preparations were being made to swallow up London and Westminster. Even the ghost of Cock Lane had been definitively buried, after wandering the world for twelve years, and revealing its messages to mortals in the same manner as the spirits of the previous year, showing a supernatural poverty of originality in their revelations. The only earthly messages received by the Crown and the English People came from a congress of British subjects residing in America, messages that, strangely enough, have proven to be of much greater significance to the human race than any received through the mediation of any of the chicks from Cock Lane.",27.231,26.735
5,"France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.","Generally not favoring mystical matters like its sister wielding a shield and trident*, France kept printing money to spend while plunging into the abyss faster and faster. Moreover, under the guidance of Christian shepherds, France entertained itself with humanitarian achievements such as sentencing a young man to have both hands cut off, his tongue clamped and pulled out, and his body burned alive, because he refused to kneel in the rain to show respect to a filthy procession of monks passing within forty or fifty meters of him*. It is very likely that when that wretched man received his death sentence, many tall trees growing, originating from the forests of France and Norway, had already been marked by the Woodsman Fate to be felled and sawn into planks, to create the mobile guillotine with its blade and sack, a dreadful device in history. It is very likely that in the makeshift sheds of the poor farmers near Paris, even from that day, there were crude carts sheltering from the sun and rain, smeared with rural mud, serving as perches for chickens and rooting places for pigs, carts that the Farmer Death had reserved as vehicles to transport prisoners to the Revolutionary execution grounds. Those Woodsman and Farmer, though working incessantly, did so very quietly, with no one hearing a sound as they stealthily moved around - on the contrary, merely causing someone to suspect that they were aware of this was enough to be accused of impiety and rebellion.",16.717,16.301,"France, which was not as ambitious in spiritual matters as her sister with the shield and trident, was printing paper money and spending it while speeding downhill. Moreover, it did not kneel in the rain to pay respect to a filthy procession of priests fifty or sixty meters away, and instead entertained itself with some humane acts under the guidance of Christian priests, such as cutting off a young man's hands, tearing out his tongue with pliers, and burning his body alive. Long before that poor young man was executed, some of the large trees rooted in the forests of France and Norway were likely to be cut down and turned into timber by the Woodcutter, that is, Fate, and then made into a moving wooden frame, a black mark in history, containing a sack and a knife. On that very day, perhaps, clumsy carts were placed to protect from the rain in the makeshift small outbuildings of farmers working the hard soils near Paris; these were the carts, muddied by the village, sniffed by pigs, perched upon by poultry, and reserved by the Farmer, that is, Death, to transport the victims of the Revolution to the guillotine. These Woodcutter and Farmer worked incessantly but very quietly, and no one heard them as they went about with their ropes; to suspect that they were awake would be blasphemy and treachery.",18.864,18.487,"Less favored was France in spiritual matters compared to her sister of the shield and trident, rolling charmingly and smoothly downhill, printing paper money and spending it with great delight. Under the direction of her most Christian shepherds, she also allowed herself to indulge in humanitarian distractions such as sentencing a young man or two to have their hands cut off, their tongues torn out with pincers, and to be burned alive, for the heinous crime of not having fallen to their knees in the muddy road on a rainy day to pay due homage to a procession of friars that passed within sight, though fifty or sixty yards away. It is very likely that, when that criminal was led to his execution, the woodcutter Destiny had already marked in the forests of France and Normandy the ancient trees that the saw would turn into planks to build that movable platform, equipped with its basket and blade, which has gained such terrible fame in history. It is also very possible that, in the rustic sheds attached to the huts of the farmers near Paris, on the same day, there were primitive carts, splattered with mud licked by pigs and serving as perches for poultry, which the reaper Death had selected to be the carriages of the Revolution. True it is that, although the Woodcutter and the Reaper worked incessantly, their labor was silent and no human ear could perceive their muffled steps, all the more so because harboring any suspicion that they were awake was as much as confessing oneself to the world as an atheist and a traitor.",18.862,18.477
6,"In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of “the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s boy of sixpence.","In England, there were hardly any protective laws that justified such national pride. Armed robberies and highway robberies occurred nightly right in the capital; families were publicly warned not to leave the city without moving all their belongings to the warehouses of merchants for safety; the highwayman in the dark was a city merchant in the light, and when identified and questioned by a colleague whom he had robbed in the role of the Chief, he brazenly shot the other in the head and then rode away; the mail coach was ambushed by seven robbers, the escort shot dead three of them, then ""due to ammunition failure,"" he himself was shot dead by the remaining four, after which the mail coach was peacefully robbed; the Lord Mayor of London, the venerable ruler, was also forced to stand still and hand over at Turnham Green because a thief had completely robbed this dignitary right in front of all his attendants; prisoners in London prison fought with the guards and the supreme law wielded blunderbusses, firing volleys of lead and iron balls into the chaos; thieves cut off diamond-encrusted crosses worn around the necks of noble lords at court celebrations; a group of royal guards stormed into the St. Giles area searching for contraband and thus the populace shot at the soldiers, the soldiers shot at the populace, and no one found this unusual. In that context, the type of person who was more useless than useful and busy, the executioner was continuously ordered to act; sometimes hanging long rows of various criminals; sometimes hanging on Saturday a thief who had just been caught on Tuesday; sometimes burning a dozen people alive right in front of Newgate prison; and sometimes burning a pile of pamphlets right in front of Westminster Hall; today taking the life of a brutal murderer, and tomorrow taking the life of a miserable petty thief who had stolen six pence from a farmer's son.",19.096,18.786,"In England, there was almost no order and security to justify all the national boasting. Even in the capital, armed men were recklessly robbing houses and waylaying roads every night; people were advised not to leave the city without placing their belongings in upholsterers' warehouses for safety; a highwayman at night could appear as a merchant during the day; once, a man whose path was blocked by someone identifying as ""Captain"" turned out to be the owner of the neighboring shop, the man recognized the highwayman, challenged him, and even bravely shot him in the head and continued on his way; on another occasion, seven highwaymen ambushed a mail coach, the coach guard shot three of them but was shot by the remaining four due to ""running out of ammunition."" Thus, the robbery took place peacefully; then, this magnificent person, the Governor of London, was waylaid at Turnham Green, the highwayman stripped this venerable figure of everything in front of all his companions; prisoners in London prisons were fighting with the guards, the mighty law was unloading its cartridge rifles on them; thieves were cutting off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords in palace halls; when soldiers with muskets went to St Giles to look for contraband, the people were shooting at them, and they were shooting back at the people, moreover, no one saw anything extraordinary in this. In the midst of all this, the executioner, who was always busy and more miserable than even the most useless person, was struggling to keep up with the demands; sometimes hanging a variety of criminals, sometimes hanging a thief caught on Tuesday by Saturday; sometimes branding the hands of dozens of men, sometimes burning pamphlets in front of Westminster Hall; today he would take the life of a cruel murderer, tomorrow that of a despicable thief who stole a few pennies from a farmer's son.",13.627,13.238,"In England, there was barely an atom of order and protection left to justify the national boast. The capital itself was every night the scene of armed robberies and the most daring and scandalous crimes. Publicly and officially, families were advised not to leave the city without first taking their furniture to the upholsterers' warehouses, the only places that offered them some guarantee. He who was a bandit under the cover of night appeared as an honorable merchant of the city in the light of day, and if ever recognized by the genuine merchant to whom he presented himself as a ""captain,"" he would coolly fire a shot that sent him to a better world and then make a swift escape. The mail coach was attacked by seven bandits, of whom three were killed by the guard, who in turn were killed by the remaining four ""due to running out of ammunition"": subsequently, the coach was thoroughly and calmly robbed. The very high and mighty Lord Mayor of London was kidnapped and forced to live for some time in Turnham Green by a daring bandit, who had the honor of robbing such an illustrious figure right under the noses of his numerous escort and equally numerous servants. In the prisons of London, prisoners fought fierce battles with their jailers, whom the majesty of the law rewarded with musket shots. In the very halls of the court, skillful hands relieved the highest lords of the diamond crosses that adorned their necks. Musketeers entered St. Giles in search of contraband, and the mob fired upon the musketeers, and the musketeers fired upon the mob, without anyone thinking that such an event was anything but a common and trivial incident of life. Meanwhile, the executioner, always on duty, always busy, could not keep up with the various places where he was needed, today leaving large clusters of criminals hanging from his ropes and tomorrow hanging a common thief who broke into a neighbor's house on Thursday and embarked on the journey to eternity the following Saturday; to burn dozens of people in Newgate today, and hundreds of pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall tomorrow; to send a ferocious scoundrel to eternity today, and do the same tomorrow with a miserable pickpocket who stole six pence from a farmer's son.",12.738,12.425
7,"All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures—the creatures of this chronicle among the rest—along the roads that lay before them.","All those events, and thousands of similar ones, continuously occurred in the memorable distant year of 1775. Amidst those events, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked silently, the two square-jawed men and the two with one plain and one beautiful face still stamped their feet quite noisily, raising high the sacred privileges of kings. Therefore, these great figures along with countless humble people - those whose stories are recorded in books - would be led by the year 1775 along the paths of destiny.",11.402,10.34,"Here, all these events and thousands of similar ones took place in the beloved year 1775 and immediately thereafter. While things were in this state and the Woodcutter and the Farmer worked without anyone caring, those two big-jawed men and the two women, one with a grim face and the other with a clean face, continued to carry their divine right, even if their pants were on fire. Indeed, their majesty lasted throughout the year 1775, and in the same year, countless little people –among them the little people mentioned in this historical record– walked the roads that lay before them.",13.791,12.699,"All these things, and a thousand others of the same kind that I could mention, were our daily bread in the blessed year of seventeen seventy-five without being an obstacle so that, while the Woodcutter and the Peasant Woman continued their silent labor, the two mortals with the developed jaws and the two with the flattened and beautiful faces, respectively, carried their divine rights at the tip of the spear. Thus did the year of seventeen seventy-five lead Their Excellencies and the millions of insignificant creatures, among them those who are to appear in the present chronicle, to their respective destinies, along the paths that were open before their steps.",15.509,14.59

10,"It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter’s Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty.","2. The Mail Coach On a late Friday night in November, the Dover road stretched out before the first character related to this story. The Dover road stretched ahead, the Dover mail coach was laboriously climbing up Shooter's Hill. That person was also trudging up the slope in the mud beside the coach, as were the other passengers; not because they enjoyed the exercise in such circumstances but because the hill and the harnesses, the mud, and the parcels had made the coach so heavy that the horses had to stop three times, and once they dragged the coach across the road with the intent of rebelling back to Blackheath. However, with the reins and the whip, the driver and the guard combined, strictly according to martial law, quashed the intention that would have supported the argument that some animals are endowed with reason; thus, the rebellious group had to submit and return to their duty.",19.235,18.59,"On a Friday night in late November, the road to Dover stretched out before the first little person in this story; the Dover mail coach was laboriously trying to climb Shooter's Hill, with the road stretching out before the man. Like the other passengers, he was trudging up the hill beside the mail coach, sinking into the mud; they were not walking for pleasure under those conditions, of course; the hill, the harness, the mud, the coach, all had become so heavy that the horses had stopped three times, even dragging the coach to the other side of the road as if they wanted to return to Blackheath with rebellious effort. However, despite having read the war-related article that stated it was forbidden to act contrary to the view that some wild animals were endowed with ""reason,"" the whip, the coachman, and the guard persisted in what they knew; thus, the horses gave in and returned to their duties.",11.662,10.636,"The one who was traveling first among the characters who are to play a very important role in the present story, on a Friday night in November, was the one from Dover. The traveler followed the stagecoach as it advanced heavily up the slope of Shooter's Hill. He was walking through the mud clinging to the dilapidated box of the carriage, and alongside him were the other travel companions, not certainly moved by the desire to exercise, which was rather unpleasant given the circumstances, but because the slope, harnesses, mud, stagecoach, and horses were so heavy that the latter had already declared three times their desire not to go any further, not to mention another time when they tried to turn around with the seditious intention of returning to Blackheath. The reins and the whip, the postilion and the guard, in agreement, had to read the article of the Campaign Regulations which ensures that never, under any circumstances, will brute animals be right, thanks to which the team capitulated and resigned themselves to fulfill their duty.",12.45,11.619
11,"With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! so-ho-then!” the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it—like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.","Heads bowed, tails flicking, four horses trudged through the thick mud; every now and then they stumbled as if their joints were about to fall apart. Each time the coachman cautiously uttered a “Whoa! Easy, easy!” and pulled the reins to let them rest, the lead horse on his side would shake its head violently, shaking off everything clinging to it - as if it was vehemently declaring that the mail coach would never reach the top of the hill. Every time the lead horse made a fuss, the traveler would startle, a bit terrified just like all the other faint-hearted people.",6.935,5.32,"The horses, with their heads bowed and tails trembling, trudged through the mud, stumbling as if their legs might fall apart at the joints at any moment. Whenever the driver rested them and cautiously urged, ""Deeeh! Come on now!"" the horse on the left would violently shake its head and everything on it – as if it had an unusual determination to resist the cart climbing the hill. Our passenger, on the other hand, would flinch and become uneasy every time the horse moved, just like any tense traveler would.",10.762,9.275,"With their heads lowered and their tails trembling, they tried to make their way through the seas of thick mud that covered the path, stumbling here, taking a dreadful tumble there, falling not infrequently and always staggering. Whenever the coachman granted them some rest, the lead horse would violently shake its head and all the objects adorning it with a doctoral and emphatic air, as if its intention was to deny that the stagecoach could reach the top of the hill; and whenever he cracked the whip, the traveler I have been speaking of would lift his head in fright, like a man abruptly torn from his meditations.",8.153,6.421
12,"There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.","The mist, heavy with moisture, filled every hollow and sadly wandered to the hilltop like a ghost searching for a resting place but finding none. The damp, icy mist slowly curled and rose, clearly visible in successive layers that overlapped like waves on a stormy sea. The fog was so dense that what could be seen in the light of the lamp mounted on the vehicle was just that thick mist with a few yards of road ahead; the steaming breath of the weary horses blended into the fog as if the entire gloomy sky had been exhaled by them.",10.288,9.093,"A misty fog covered every side and drifted aimlessly up the road like a malevolent spirit seeking peace but unable to find it. The sticky, icy fog spread in rings around, like waves in an eerie sea. The fog was so dense that the car headlights could only illuminate a few meters ahead, and the steam from the rapidly breathing horses mixed with it, as if all this fog had emanated from them.",5.919,4.422,"Seas of watery vapor in the form of thick fog covered all the hollows and slid close to the ground like malevolent spirits seeking rest and finding none. The fog was sticky and very cold, advancing in graceful curls and undulating masses that chased and caught each other like waves do when the sea is rough. It was dense enough to confine within a very narrow circle the light shed by the carriage lanterns, to the point of preventing the visibility of the jets of steam the horses snorted out, which added to the abundance of those filling the atmosphere.",13.257,12.299
13,"Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in “the Captain’s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter’s Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass.","Besides this character, the other two passengers were also trudging up the hill next to the mail coach. All three were wearing cloaks that covered their cheeks, hoods that covered their ears, and boots that reached above their knees. From the outside, no one could tell what the other two looked like; each person concealed themselves under layers of coverings that hid both their thoughts and their appearances from their fellow travelers. At that time, travelers were very wary of making sudden acquaintances because anyone on the road could potentially be a robber or an accomplice of a gang of robbers. With the second possibility, when every post station and inn could have someone on the payroll of the Big Boss, from the landlord to the lowest stable boy, encountering accomplices of a gang of robbers was the most likely occurrence. The escort of the Dover mail coach thought this to himself on that Friday night in November 1775 as the coach laboriously climbed Shooter's Hill, while he stood in the guard compartment at the back of the coach, stamping his feet and never taking his eyes or hands off the weapon chest, inside which lay a loaded blunderbuss on top of six or eight muskets, with a short sword at the bottom.",16.193,15.656,"The other two passengers were also slowly advancing beside the stagecoach. All three of them were wrapped up to their cheekbones and ears, and they wore high-topped boots. None of them could tell what the others looked like; because the only part exposed was their eyes, and the contents of their minds were a mystery. In those days, passengers did not easily trust one another, as there was a high chance that one of the travelers could be a robber or his accomplice. In every inn and tavern, whether gentleman or peasant, they could be ""Captain's"" men. Thus, on that Friday night in November of 1775, as they barely climbed the hill, the guard of the Dover stagecoach, perched in his designated spot at the back of the coach, was thinking about these things while knocking his feet together and never taking his hand or eyes off the chest that contained six or seven loaded guns, a loaded rifle with a cartridge chamber, and a hunting knife.",11.153,10.585,"Two travelers, in addition to the one I have mentioned, were laboriously climbing the ramp following the stagecoach. All three had their coat collars pulled up to their ears, and all three wore very high boots. None of them could have said whether their travel companions were handsome or ugly, young or old; so carefully did they conceal their faces, and it wouldn't be amiss to add that, if it was impossible for the eyes of the body to discern the slightest physical feature, it was even more so for the eyes of the spirit to conjecture those of the soul, that is, the intentions that each of them might harbor. In those happy times, travelers were highly reserved and avoided with great caution placing trust in unknown persons, for any stagecoach or road companion could turn out to be a bandit or an accomplice of bandits, gentlemen who abounded to a blessing, as all taverns and inns had no shortage of soldiers in the pay of the ""captain,"" whose ranks were nourished by everyone without exception, starting with the innkeeper and ending with the last stable boy. This was precisely what the guard of the Dover mail coach was thinking about on that Friday night in November of seventeen seventy-five, as it laboriously climbed the Shooter's Hill, seated on the rear bench of the cart reserved for him, furiously stomping on the boards to prevent his feet from turning into blocks of ice, and with his hand on a loaded blunderbuss, which topped a pile of six or eight saddle pistols, also loaded, which were based on another pile of perfectly sharpened machetes and daggers.",11.54,11.077
14,"The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey.","This Dover mail coach, as usual, had an atmosphere of mutual suspicion: the escort suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected the escort and each other, everyone suspected everyone else, and the coachman only trusted the horses; and with these animals, he could place his hand on both volumes of the Holy Bible and swear with a clear conscience that they were not suited for this journey. −",24.401,23.222,"The usual friendly atmosphere prevailed in the Dover mail coach, meaning that the guard was suspicious of the passengers, the passengers were suspicious of each other and the guard, in short, everyone was suspicious of everyone else. The only thing the driver was sure of was the condition of the horses; even if the world were to end, they wouldn't be able to make it up this road.",16.266,14.669,"On the journey to which the present story refers, what invariably happened on all trips occurred in the Dover stagecoach: the guard suspected the travelers, the travelers suspected each other and the guard, they all looked at each other with distrust, and as for the postilion, he was only sure of the horses: that is, with full awareness, he would have sworn by the Old and New Testament that the livestock was not fit for the task it was destined for.",16.271,15.038

20,"The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative, made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.","With a decisive whip, the leading horse that was protesting had no choice but to lunge forward, and the other three followed closely behind. Once again, the Dover mail coach creaked forward, and the passengers' boots trudged through the mud alongside it.

56,"Jerry started in his saddle. “That’s a Blazing strange answer, too,” said he, at his hoarsest.","What kind of devilish response is that, so strange,* - on horseback, Jerry exclaimed, his voice raspier than ever.",6.712,2.45,"Jerry flinched.

58,"With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action.","Having said that, the guest opened the car door and stepped in; this time without the assistance of his companions, the two others in the car had quickly hidden their watches and wallets in their boots, and were now pretending to sleep. Their intention was clearly to avoid any unnecessary trouble.",16.417,14.786,"After these words, the passenger opened the car door and got inside; this time there was no one to support him, the other passengers had hurriedly stuffed their watches and wallets into their boots, pretending to be asleep.

59,"The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt, looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a few smith’s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw, and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in five minutes.","The mail coach creaked and groaned as it rolled along, with the fog swirling and thickening as the coach began its descent. The escort put away his blunderbuss into the weapon chest, and after checking the weapons inside and the additional pistols strapped to his belt, he examined the smaller box under the seat, which contained some blacksmith tools, a few torches, and a tinderbox. He had to be fully equipped, just in case the coach lamps were blown out - which occasionally happened - so he could simply get inside the coach, keep the flint and tinder away from the straw*, and relight the lamps safely and easily within five minutes (if he was lucky).",12.059,10.904,"The car set off again, moving slowly and with difficulty, and the fog around had become even denser on the descent. The guard soon put the rifle back in its place and, after checking the remaining ammunition and the weapons on his belt, looked at the small box under his seat, which contained repair tools, a few lanterns, and a box of kindling. They were fully equipped, so if the car's lights were to burst and shatter, which happened quite often, all he had to do was stay inside and keep the sparks from the flint and steel away from the straw, and (if luck was on his side) immediately find light in a safe and easy way.",14.94,14.072,"The carriage creaked again and groaned more plaintively than ever as it began the descent of the hill. The guard placed his arquebus on the pile of pistols, but first ensuring that those supplementary ones hanging from his belt were in place, took out from under the seat a small box containing some locksmith tools, two candles, a striker, flint, and tinder. A foresighted man, he carried everything necessary to light the carriage lamps with relative ease and safety (if he was lucky) in about five minutes, should they go out or be extinguished, as happened more than once during the journeys.",8.434,7.276

71,"A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life’s end. In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?","It's truly strange, each person harbors a deep secret and is incomprehensible to others. Whenever I walk through a large city at night, I genuinely think that every house in those dark streets hides a secret; every room in each house hides a secret; every heart beating in the hundreds of thousands of chests in that city, in some dreams, is also a secret to the nearest heart! This relates to something very frightening, perhaps even Death itself. We can no longer turn the precious pages of life's book, with the vain hope of having time to read it fully. We cannot see through the unfathomable depths of life's river, when a sudden light reveals buried treasures and hidden things, fate has decreed that the book will abruptly close, forever and ever, when we have only read one page, fate has decreed that the water will freeze in eternal frost, while the light glimmers on the ice and we remain ignorant on the shore. Our friends die, our neighbors die, our lovers, the beloved of our hearts die; the secret always buried deep within each individual will be sealed forever, never to be revealed, and we will also take our own secrets to the grave. In every cemetery of this city that I have walked through, is it not true that those lying beneath the ground are more mysterious to me than the hidden depths of the bustling residents here, or is it that I am even more mysterious to them?",10.504,9.954,"The fact that every human being is an immense enigma to another, a surprising truth that requires contemplation. When I enter a large city at night, I think about how each of those clustered houses in the dark harbors its own secrets, each room in each house has a separate secret, and each heart beating within them carries a unique secret that even the heart right next to it does not know! The most terrible things, even Death, are like this. I can no longer turn the pages of this book I love, in vain I hope to have read them all one day. Once, I could no longer look into the bottomless depths of the water where the treasure and other wrecks appeared as the light shone upon them. With a single motion, it was decided that the book would be closed forever, even though I had only read one page of it. Then, as the lights played on the surface, it was decided that the water would freeze forever, and I stood there on the shore, not knowing what to do. My friend died, my neighbor died, my lover, the beloved of my soul, died; the secrets persisted with the same steadfastness, and I carried my own secret in my heart until the end of my life. In this city, among all those lying in the cemeteries I pass by, is there anyone among the city dwellers who is more mysterious to me than I am to the city dwellers?",9.936,9.245,"Worthy of careful reflection is the phenomenon that all human beings carry within their constitution the need to be impenetrable secrets to one another. Whenever I enter a large city at night, mechanically and without realizing it, I begin to think that each and every house that forms the immense and tightly packed cluster before my eyes contains its own peculiar secret, that each and every room in the houses contains its own peculiar secret, and that each and every heart that beats in the hundreds of thousands of chests that inhabit them is a profound secret to the heart enclosed in the nearest chest. The phenomenon has something terrifying, something in common with death. The heart of the person dear to me seems like a book whose pages I am turning and whose end I will never reach: it seems like an immense liquid mass in whose unfathomable depths I have glimpsed, by the light that momentarily penetrated them, hidden treasures and a thousand secrets that have excited my desire to know; but an immutable will has decreed that I can only read the first page of the book, that the liquid mass will solidify and turn into an eternally frozen mass, while the light played on its surface and I watched it from the shore, ignorant of what it contained in its depths. My friend has died, my neighbor has died, my loves have died, and with them died the yearnings of my soul, because their death brought with it the inexorable consolidation, the perpetuation of the secret that those individualities contained, just as death will forever seal mine, burying it with me in the grave. Does there sleep, perhaps, in any of the cemeteries of the cities I visit, a dead person whose intimate personality is more inscrutable to me than those of the living who busily and solicitously walk their streets, more than mine is to all of them?",10.688,10.223
72,"As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the breadth of a county between him and the next.","In this regard, the messenger on horseback is no different from anyone else, he also has secrets just like the King, the Prime Minister, or the richest Merchant in London.

The same thing happened with the three travelers confined within the narrow limits of an old and rickety coach. Each one of them was an impenetrable mystery to their companion, as impenetrable as if they had traveled in their own coach, alone and with a nation between each coach.",11.14,9.543
73,"The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together—as if they were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and throat, which descended nearly to the wearer’s knees. When he stopped for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he muffled again.","The messenger rode back at a leisurely trot, occasionally stopping at a tavern for a sip but always maintaining his clarity, pulling up the brim of his hat so as not to obstruct his view. He had eyes that matched the hat perfectly, pitch-black eyes with indistinct shape or color, set too close together—as if they feared revealing something if they were farther apart. Those eyes gleamed with a sinister look beneath the old tricorn hat that resembled a three-sided spittoon, above a scarf that covered his chin and throat, hanging down to his knees. Each time he stopped to drink, he would use his left hand to pull down the scarf while his right hand lifted the cup to his lips; after a sip, he would pull it back up.",13.054,12.204,"The messenger on his horse had started to trot, occasionally stopping at bars along his route to drink something, pulling his hat down to his eyes to signal he wanted to be left alone. His eyes matched the decor well, pitch black, lacking any depth in color or shape, and –as if fearing something would happen if they were apart– set too close to each other. Under his old, three-cornered hat with upturned edges that looked like a spittoon, and over the long scarf wrapped around his chin and almost reaching his knees, his eyes had an unsettling expression. When he drank, he would part his scarf with his left hand, down the drink with his right hand, and immediately wrap himself back in the scarf.",10.353,9.32,"The messenger mounted his horse and began the return journey at a slow trot, stopping at all the taverns and inns along the way to refresh his throat, but without engaging in conversation with anyone and always trying to keep his hat pulled down over his eyes. This precaution harmonized perfectly with his eyes, which were black and very close together; so close, in fact, that it seemed they feared someone might jump over them one by one if they were found separated. They had a sinister expression, perhaps contributed to by the fact that they shone between a hat that looked more like a triangular spittoon than a hat, and a sort of cloak that started from the eyes and ended at the knees of its wearer. When he stopped to drink, he would use his left hand to lift the cloak just enough to pour the liquid into his mouth with his right hand, and as soon as he finished drinking, he would pull it back up again.",15.432,14.709
74,"“No, Jerry, no!” said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode. “It wouldn’t do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn’t suit your line of business! Recalled—! Bust me if I don’t think he’d been a drinking!”","− No, no way, Jerry, - the messenger kept mumbling to himself about that on horseback. - Bad luck for you, Jerry! You, an honest businessman, this matter doesn't suit your way of doing things! Revival...! If he wasn't drunk, may the heavens strike me down!",11.123,8.559,"While riding his horse, still preoccupied with the same issue, the messenger said, ""No Jerry, it won't work!"" ""This is not for you at all, Jerry, you are an honest merchant, Jerry; you don't do such things ever! Revived-!, I bet the man was drunk!""",8.238,6.154,"—No, Jeremiah, no!—murmured the messenger, always harping on the same theme. —Jeremiah cannot agree with that...

75,"His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown, which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was so like Smith’s work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.","That message left him so bewildered that he repeatedly took off his hat to scratch his head. Except for the already bald top, his hair was black, stiff, bristly all over his head, and grew long enough to almost touch his broad nose.

Except for the top of his partially bald head, his stiff and upright black hair almost reached his broad and blunt nose.

His head resembled the work of a blacksmith, a wall ridge bristling with thick spikes, which fans of the game ""at one, the mule"" would have looked at with respectful terror, surely considering it the most dangerous jump a man could make in the world.",14.517,13.589
76,"While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of Tellson’s Bank, by Temple Bar, who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of her private topics of uneasiness. They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.","While he was galloping to deliver the message to the night watchman at the guard post in front of Tellson's Bank near the Temple Bar gate, the spirits of the night seemed to emerge from that very message; even his horse might have seen shapes manifesting from the depths of its own fears. There must have been many ghosts because the horse kept jumping away from the shadows on the road.",11.694,10.054,"When he set out from Temple Bar to deliver the message to the night watchman waiting in the booth in front of Tellson Bank so that it could be passed on to more authoritative individuals, the shadows of the night took on various forms as if they had sprung from that message, and even the mare seemed to see shapes that were extensions of entirely different things that disturbed her. Judging by how often she shied, there were many shadows on the road.",18.816,17.616,"The shadows of the night have truly strange whims. To the messenger, while he was returning with the mysterious message that he had to deliver to the night watchman of Tellson's Bank, so that he could in turn pass it on to his superiors, they were resurrected dead, ghosts risen from the graves, while to the mare he was riding, they were horses running without rest. For the three inscrutable travelers occupying the inside of the coach, while it jumped and bumped over the road's potholes, the shadows of the night took the forms of the thoughts that their respective imaginations conjured.",14.916,13.991
77,"What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside.

For them too, the ghosts of the night appeared in various shapes in their drowsy eyes and in their wandering thoughts.",10.31,7.747,"Meanwhile, the stagecoach, with its three mysterious passengers inside, was moving slowly and shakily along its arduous path.

78,"Tellson’s Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank passenger—with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger, and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special jolt—nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great stroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson’s, with all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson’s, with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.","The Tellson Bank is experiencing a massive withdrawal right on this mail coach trip. While the bank employee dozed off, a hand slipped through the leather strap meant to keep him from bumping into the person next to him and pushing him into the corner each time the coach jolted; through his half-closed eyes, the small windows and the dim mail coach lights, along with the bulky figure of the passenger opposite, had transformed into the very bank itself during a moment of unexpected crisis. The clattering of the harness turned into the jingling of coins, and in five minutes, the amount of banknotes exchanged for cash was more than the total that Tellson, with all its branches at home and abroad, had ever paid out in a period three times as long. Then the vaults beneath Tellson Bank, filled with precious items and secrets that this passenger knew (and knew quite well), suddenly opened wide before him; he then took the large keys and a dim candle, walked through the vaults, and saw that everything was still safe, solid, secure, and quiet as it had been during the last inspection.",8.593,7.513,"Tellson Bank was not absent in the carriage either. The bank passenger –holding onto the leather strap to avoid bumping into the passenger next to him, and slumping into his corner as the carriage jolted– nodded his head with half-closed eyes, while the small windows of the carriage, the dim lamp casting light on them, and the large bundle of the passenger opposite him transformed into the bank, weighing down on him like a heavy task. The sound of the harnesses resembled the clinking of money; within five minutes, more forms appeared in the banker’s mind than from all the domestic and foreign connections of Tellson Bank. Then, the special rooms located underground at Tellson’s, which he knew well (and he knew quite a lot), with their vaults and secrets, came to his mind; he wandered through the rooms with large keys and a dimly lit candle in hand, seeing that everything was in its place and secure, just as he had last seen it.",11.523,10.749,"It could be said that the Tellson Bank had moved to the stagecoach. For the bank employee, holding on with one hand to a strap, which allowed him to avoid colliding with his neighbor every time the vehicle jolted—and it jolted with exasperating frequency—the narrow windows of the coach, the lantern of the same, which filtered faint glimmers through them, and the dark bulk of the traveler he had before his half-closed eyes, were the Bank, in which he was conducting countless operations, each more successful than the last. The noise made by the harnesses seemed to him like the jingling of coins with which he paid bills, securities, and checks at a dizzying speed. It wasn't long before his imagination transported him to the underground vaults, whose secrets he knew so well, and armed with his large keys, he opened the enormous safe, which he found as intact, as full, as solid as he had left it the last time he had the chance to see it.",7.027,6.067
79,"But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was always with him, there was another current of impression that never ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave.","But even though the bank was always on his mind, even though he still knew he was sitting in the mail truck (vaguely aware as if he could still feel the pain while drowsy from anesthesia), there was another stream of thoughts continuously running through, all night long. He was on his way to exhume someone's grave.",21.249,19.832,"Even though the bank and the mail coach (with a strange pain as if under the influence of a sleeping pill) always accompanied him, there was something else that never left his mind throughout the night.

80,"Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed, and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another; so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was prematurely white.

The shadows of the night hadn't revealed this, but all the faces he saw belonged to a man around forty-five years old.

It is not, therefore, surprising that chance led to the path between Concordia and the dining room being occupied by two butlers, three waiters, and several maids, not to mention the owner of the establishment herself, all of whom were engaged in various domestic tasks, when from the mentioned room emerged a gentleman of about sixty years, dressed in a dark-colored suit, almost new and very well preserved, and sporting very large square cuffs, although not larger nor squarer than the wallets that adorned his pockets.",6.464,5.162

He had a good leg, and was a little vain of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass. His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings, was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of Tellson’s Bank. He had a healthy colour in his cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety. But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson’s Bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.","He looked very upright and neat with his hands placed on his knees, the pocket watch under his buttoned jacket ticking loudly and steadily as if it were arrogantly comparing its own dignity and longevity with the playful and ephemeral nature of the flickering firelight. He had strong legs and was somewhat proud of them, as his brown socks were of the finest quality, tightly woven and clinging to his calves; his shoes and buckles, though simple, were elegant. He wore a small wig of a strange brownish-yellow color, tightly curled on both sides and unusually shiny, fitting snugly to his head - wigs are usually made from human hair, but this one seemed to be spun from silk or fiberglass. Though not made of fine fabric like his socks, his shirt was as white as the waves crashing near the hotel, or like the sparkling spots of a sail in the distant sunlight. Underneath that peculiar wig, his calm face, accustomed to restraining emotions, still shone thanks to his bright, wet eyes; over the years, those eyes must have struggled greatly to master the expression of composure and indifference typical of a Tellson's Bank employee. His cheeks were rosy and healthy, his face lined with wrinkles but showing little sign of worry. Perhaps because the solitary employees at Tellson's mainly concerned themselves with other people's affairs, these non-personal concerns, like clothes passed down through two owners, were often easily changed.",9.455,8.819,"With his loud clock ticking under his closed vest like a pompous sermon, countering the nimbleness and gradual disappearance of the lively fire with its own weight and longevity, he looked extremely neat and meticulous while sitting with both hands on his knees. His legs looked good, and he seemed to take pride in that; his tight brown stockings were very shapely and of good quality; his shoes and buckles were simple but very elegant. On his head was a small, light yellow, shiny, spotless, peculiar wig; it was probably made of hair but looked as if it were spun from silk or glass threads. His shirt, though not as high-quality as his stockings, was as white as the foam of waves crashing on the neighboring shore or a sailboat shining under the sun out at sea. Although his face had been subdued and silenced for years, it was illuminated by a pair of moist, bright eyes under that strange wig, and who knows what pains this face had endured until it adopted the distant and dignified expression of Tellson Bank. His cheeks had a healthy color, and the worry lines on his face were almost nonexistent. Perhaps the real occupation of this reliable bachelor clerk of Tellson Bank was other people's problems; second-hand troubles, like second-hand clothes, transient troubles.",13.694,13.253,"He seemed like a methodical and orderly man. From the depths of his vest pocket, a watch of extraordinarily large size let its powerful and sonorous voice be heard, whose undeniable gravity and longevity resembled a noisy and eloquent protest against the lightness and futility of the fire burning in the fireplace. The gentleman had good calves, and it is possible that he was proud of them, judging by the stockings that encased them, of the same tone as his suit, made of very fine material and perfectly fitted. His shoes, which adorned beautiful buckles, although of common class, revealed the hand of a skilled and experienced shoemaker. Perfectly fitted to his head, he wore a small, very fine, and slightly curly wig, which, one might suppose, was made of hair, although to tell the truth, it more closely resembled filaments of silk or glass. As for his shirt, if in fineness it could not compete with his stockings, in whiteness it rivaled the crests of the waves that gently came to kiss the sand of the nearby beach, or the sails that shone offshore in the rays of the sun. Adding animation to that face of tranquil expression, or rather, that expressionless face, for the persistent hand of habit had erased any expression from it, were two penetrating eyes, though a little soft, which in past years must have given their owner quite some trouble before he managed to tame them and give them that impenetrable reserve and composure that was characteristic of all the employees of Tellson's Bank. On the face, healthy in color though furrowed with numerous wrinkles, the anxieties and worries had left no traces, perhaps because the old bachelors employed at Tellson's Bank never concerned themselves with anything other than the affairs of other people, and those affairs are like used gloves, which go in and out without effort.",10.171,9.739

130,"When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.","After finishing his breakfast, Mr. Lorry went out for a walk on the beach. The city of Dover, winding, narrow, and small, nestled far from the shore, with one end jutting straight out to the chalk cliffs like an ostrich burying its head in the sea. The desolate beach had only waves tossing stones around; the sea did whatever it pleased, and its pleasure was destruction. The sea thundered down on the city, thundered down on the cliffs, and furiously pounded the shore. The air between the houses was so fishy that one might think all the sick fish had come to soak themselves in the city just like sick people soaking in the seawater. Few people fished in this harbor, but at night many loitered around and looked out to sea - especially during high tides and near floods. Many petty traders who did no business at all sometimes inexplicably amassed great fortunes, and it was noteworthy that no one in this area was comfortable with the night lamp lighter*.",15.975,15.32,"When Mr. Lorry finished his breakfast, he went for a walk by the seaside. The small town of Dover, with its winding streets, was hidden from the shore, burying its head in the white hillside like an ostrich. The shore resembled a desert where the stones rolled with the swelling waves of the sea, and the sea did whatever it wanted, which was to wreak havoc. Its roar echoed in the town, on the hillside, everywhere, turning the shore upside down. A heavy fish smell enveloped the houses so much that one would think all the sick fish had risen to the surface of the sea to mix with this air, unlike the sick people who sank to the bottom of the sea to merge with it. There was a bit of fishing in the harbor, and in the evenings, especially when the waters rose and flooded the surroundings, the place would become quite lively with walkers and sea watchers. The small tradesmen, who didn't do much business, sometimes – somehow – made great fortunes, and at those times everyone stayed away from the lighthouse keepers.",14.164,13.48,"After lunch, Mr. Lorry went out for a little walk along the beach. The small and irregular town of Dover was not visible from there, except for its rooftops which, nestled among the peaks of limestone quarries, resembled a gigantic marine oyster. The beach was a desert bristling with rocks and plagued with reefs, where the sea did whatever it pleased, and what it invariably pleased to do was destroy. Almost continuously, it roared against the town, bellowed against the cliffs, charged against the rocks that tried to block its path and knocked them down with a crash. In the houses, there was such a strong smell of fish that it seemed as if the inhabitants of the waters came out to cure their illnesses in the houses, just as sick people often seek health in sea baths. A few, very few, engaged in fishing in those waters, and if during the day the beach was always deserted, at night, on the other hand, people could be seen staring anxiously into the vastness of the sea. Insignificant merchants who were never seen doing business suddenly amassed immense fortunes that had no rational explanation, and it was very noticeable that no one in those places could tolerate the presence of a light, from which they fled as if from the devil.",12.363,11.773

As his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions—as his eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him, of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender—and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.","The room was so dark that Mr. Lorry, while groping his way on the worn-out Turkish carpet, thought that Miss Manette was in an adjacent room. It wasn't until he passed two tall candles that he saw a young girl, no older than seventeen, standing to greet him by the table between them and the fireplace. She was wearing a riding cloak and still holding the ribbon of her straw traveling hat. When his eyes settled on the graceful, pretty figure, with long blonde hair and blue eyes that met his gaze with a questioning look, and a forehead (so youthful and smooth) that had the characteristic of often furrowing into wrinkles not entirely of confusion, surprise, or alarm, but rather of attentive sharpness, though expressing all those emotions - looking at the girl, he suddenly vividly recalled the image of a child he had carried in his arms while crossing this very strait on a cold day of pouring rain and rough seas. That association vanished as quickly as breath on the narrow, long mirror behind the girl, framed by a carved group of pitifully blackened angels, most of them headless and all chipped, offering a blackened basket of Dead Sea fruits to a blackened saint - and so he solemnly bowed to Miss Manette.",15.528,15.115,"The uncertainty that filled the room was so intense that Mr. Lorry, as he moved across the worn Turkish carpet, for a moment thought Miss Manette was in the adjacent room; but after passing the two candles, he saw, beside the table between them and the fireplace, a young lady who couldn't have been more than seventeen, waiting for him with her cloak on and a straw hat with ribbons in her hand. His eyes fixed on this petite, delicate figure, the golden hair, the blue eyes examining him with curiosity, and the forehead shaped by a special expression that reflected neither astonishment, nor curiosity, nor anxiety, nor merely natural interest, but rather a combination of all these (and how young and smooth it was), a scene from the past suddenly flashed before his eyes; it was a cold day, hail was falling, and the sea was very rough, and during the crossing of the English Channel, he had held a child resembling this girl in his arms throughout the journey. Just like a breath dispersing on the surface of the gloomy wall mirror behind the girl, in which some headless, all crippled, black children were lined up and offering Sodom apples in black baskets to black goddesses, his thoughts scattered – and Mr. Lorry greeted Miss Manette with a formal nod.",16.625,16.202,"The darkness was so dense that Mr. Lorry, while advancing on a carpet, quite worn out by the way, assumed that the young lady would be in some adjoining room, and he persisted in this belief until, after leaving the two candelabras behind him, he stumbled upon a person who was waiting for him, standing between the table and the fireplace. It was a young woman of about seventeen years of age, dressed in a riding habit, whose hands still held by the ribbon the straw hat she had worn during the journey. As he fixed his eyes on that tiny, perfectly oval face with graceful lines, framed by an abundant mass of golden hair, two blue eyes met his, looking at him with a penetrating gaze and an expression that was neither of perplexity, nor of astonishment, nor of admiration, nor of alarm, although it probably partook of all four. In Mr. Lorry's imagination, as he appreciated the features before him, the figure of a little girl he had carried in his arms many years before on a crossing journey through that same channel with cold weather and extraordinarily rough sea emerged. The image dissipated almost as quickly as the stain produced by breath on the not very clean cornucopia placed behind the young woman, and enclosed in a frame that offered a procession of headless black cupids, many of them limping or maimed, who offered black baskets full of Dead Sea fruits to some black female idols, and he bowed deeply and solemnly before Miss Manette.",9.424,8.716

200,"“And you in brown!” she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry; “couldn’t you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her to death?

209,"A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.","5. The Wine Shop A large wine cask fell and broke on the street. While being unloaded from the cart, the incident occurred, the wine cask rolled too quickly, the hoops burst off, and it shattered like a nutshell on the stone road in front of the wine shop.",11.292,8.924,"A large wine barrel had fallen and broken in the street; the barrel had rolled, its hoop had come off, and it lay in front of the wine shop's door, shattered like a walnut shell.",13.78,11.891,"A barrel of wine had fallen in the street, breaking into pieces. The accident occurred while taking the barrel out of a cart. It fell to the ground, began to roll, the hoops jumped off, and it burst open like the shell of a monstrous nut in front of the door of a tavern.",16.886,13.752
210,"All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women’s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants’ mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.","Everyone nearby immediately stopped their work or ceased their idleness to rush over and drink the wine on the spot. The rough, uneven, and sharp-edged paving stones, seemingly arranged solely to cripple any creature that came near, had blocked the flowing wine into small puddles; around each puddle was a group of people, clustering in fives or threes, depending on the size of the puddle, jostling each other. Some knelt down, cupping their hands to scoop up the wine and sip it; or raised their hands high so that the women leaning over their shoulders could drink before the wine trickled through their fingers. Others, both men and women, dipped chipped earthen cups into the puddles; or even some women dipped their headscarves into the liquid and then wrung it into the mouths of the infants they were carrying; some scooped up mud to build dams to prevent the wine from spilling away; some, following the instructions of those watching from high windows, ran around to block the wine that had started to flow in another direction; some focused solely on licking the wine-soaked fragments of broken barrels, even delighting in gnawing on the damp, wine-soaked wood. There were no drains for the wine to escape, and people not only drank up the spilled wine but also swallowed all the mud carried along with the wine, so thoroughly that one might think the street sweeper had just graciously passed by, if anyone familiar with this impoverished neighborhood could believe in such a miraculous appearance.",11.107,10.553,"Everyone around had left their work or laziness to come to the scene to drink wine. The rough and irregular stones of the street, facing different directions, gave the impression that they were designed specifically to cripple every living being passing over them; the spilled wine had formed puddles among the stones, and at the head of each puddle, there was a crowd jostling proportionally to its size. Some men were kneeling, using their cupped hands to drink the wine before it could slip through their fingers, either drinking it themselves or helping the women leaning over their shoulders to drink. Another group of men and women, with cracked earthenware in their hands, were huddled around the puddles; some women even dipped their headscarves into the wine and squeezed it into their babies' mouths; some were busy making small dams out of mud to prevent the wine from flowing away; some were running back and forth following the words of those watching from the windows above to block the small streams of wine; some, in a state of ecstasy, were licking the soaked barrel pieces, even gnawing on the wooden pieces that had absorbed the wine with great appetite. There was no channel for the wine to flow through, and quite a bit of mud was swallowed along with the wine; the place was as clean as if a street sweeper had passed through, so much so that anyone who saw it could believe that this miraculous event had taken place.",11.527,11.028,"All the people in the vicinity suspended their tasks or ended their idleness to run to the scene of the accident and drink the wine. The rough, uneven, and pointed stones that made up the cobblestones of the street, seemingly placed on purpose to make as many limping people as fortunate mortals who had the luck to pass over them, had distributed the red liquid, forming a variety of ponds of different sizes, all of which were surrounded by larger or smaller groups, depending on their extent. Many men, lying face down, collected the wine in the hollow of their hands and drank, or made the women who eagerly leaned over their shoulders drink, before the liquid escaped through their fingers. Others, men and women, collected it with small earthenware vessels or soaked the women's headscarves, which they then wrung out into their mouths or those of the children: some built mud dams to stop the flow of the wine, while others, following the shouted advice from onlookers at the windows, jumped here and there to divert the course of new streams, and there were even those who, seizing the half-rotten fragments of the barrel, sucked and licked them with indescribable anxiety. It can be assured that the crowds collected not only the last drop of wine but also the last molecule of earth that had come into contact with it. The street was left as if all the city's street-sweeping brigades had just passed through, if the city had known the brilliant institution of street sweepers.",14.184,13.75
211,"A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices—voices of men, women, and children—resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.","The loud laughter, the enthusiastic voices - men's, women's, and children's alike - animated the street with this drinking game. A game that is somewhat crude but full of joy. A game with a special camaraderie, clearly everyone was eager to join in; especially those who were carefree or luckier than others, this camaraderie urged them to embrace each other in delight; toast to health; shake hands; even dozens of people held hands and danced. When the wine had run out, and the places with the most wine left were just streaks of finger marks scraping the bottom, this lively gathering ended as abruptly as it had begun. The man who had earlier left the saw embedded in the log now resumed sawing; the woman who had hastily placed the hot ash jar to warm her aching, emaciated fingers and toes, whether hers or her children's, now held the jar again; the few men in sleeveless shirts, disheveled hair, and gaunt faces who had come up from the basements to warm themselves in the winter sun now dispersed and returned to the basements; and the scene once again sank into its familiar gloom, no longer cheerful.",9.218,8.558,"Throughout this wine game, the street – filled with the voices of men, women, and children – echoed with cheerful laughter and screams. There was a bit of roughness and plenty of clowning around involved. A completely different sense of camaraderie enveloped everything; they acted with the instinct to move together, and those who were more cheerful and carefree among them were always entwined, drinking to each other's health, shaking hands, and forming circles to dance. When the wine ran out and the ponds were replaced by grill-like fingerprint marks, the commotion ended as suddenly as it had begun. The man who had left his saw on the wood he was cutting returned to his work; the woman who had left the ash-filled bucket she used to ease the aching hunger of her and her child's fingers outside her door returned to her brazier; the bare-armed, disheveled-haired, pale-faced men who had come out of their cellars into the winter sun went back down again, and a gloom that seemed much more natural than the recent daylight settled over the surroundings.",13.952,13.445,"While the fun of the wine lasted, the street was filled with the clamor of joyful laughter and shouts of jubilation, launched by dozens of throats of men, women, and children. The distraction was a bit crude and very lively. Those who took part in it showed a special tendency towards affinities and confidences, which resulted in toasts of questionable taste, handshakes, hugs, and whimsical dances, in which those who had drunk the most, or those of a more jovial and fun character, took special part. When the wine ran out, and the stones and earth that had been soaked were dry and clean, the demonstrations of joy ceased as abruptly as they had begun. The individual who had left his saw leaning against the log he was sawing, grabbed it and set it in motion again; the woman who had left her pot cooking in front of her house door, returned to attend to it; the men with bare arms, dirty hair, and cadaverous faces who had emerged into the daylight minutes before, descended once again into the depths of the dark caves, and the shadows enveloped with their mantle a scene that, in reality, was painful to behold in the light of the sun.",18.2,17.724
212,"The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again. Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees—blood.","The wine was the red wine that had dyed the ground of the narrow street in the Saint Antoine district of Paris red. The wine also dyed many hands and many faces, many bare feet and many wooden shoes red. The hands of the woodcutter left red marks on the logs; the forehead of the nursing mother was stained red with the wine that had soaked through the tattered cloth now wrapped around her head. Those who had eagerly gnawed at the wine barrels now had their mouths streaked with a fierce red; and a mischievous person, also smeared red, with a filthy long nightcap almost slipping off his head, dipped his finger into the mushy wine residue and scrawled a word on the wall - BLOOD.",20.911,20.271,"The spilled red wine had painted the narrow street in the suburb of St. Antoine in Paris red. Of course, it had also stained many people's hands, faces, bare feet, and wooden clogs. Red stains had formed on the handle of the saw of the man cutting wood; the forehead of the woman feeding her baby was stained because of the old cloth she had wrapped around her head again. The wine marks were still visible at the corners of the mouths of those bloodthirsty people who had attacked the barrel planks with greed, and a tall fool, whose clothes were filthy and whose nightcap, resembling a dirty sack, was almost falling off his head, had written this on the wall with his finger smeared with mud and wine: BLOOD.",17.987,17.168,"The wine that the shattered barrel contained was red, and it stained the narrow street of the San Antonio suburb where it had spilled. It also stained many hands and many faces and many bare feet and many clogs. The hands of the man who was sawing the log left reddish marks on the boards, and the forehead of the woman who was nursing her tender child was also stained when it collided with the forehead of the old witch with whom she embraced and danced in moments of fleeting joy. Those who eagerly seized the remnants of the barrel and sucked and licked them, left the revelry with reddish circles on their mouths that gave them the appearance of fierce tigers, and there was one, undoubtedly more fond of jokes than the others, who with his finger dipped in the mixture formed by the mud and the wine, scrawled the word blood on the wall.",19.116,18.426
213,"The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.","There will come a time when that red liquid will also flow abundantly on the cobblestone streets, and will also soak many people there.",9.456,5.483,The days when this type of wine would flow in the streets and its stain would cover everything were near.,5.726,2.104,"The day would come when blood would be spilled in torrents, and many of those who took part in the aforementioned diversion would be drenched in blood from head to toe!",10.67,7.307
214,"And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was heavy—cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence—nobles of great power all of them; but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh, was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal, among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the baker’s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant drops of oil.","At this moment, the fog has once again enveloped Saint Antoine after a brief burst of light, and the face of the district named after the saint* has returned to its former darkness with cold, filth, disease, ignorance, and poverty - the five companions of the saint, each powerful but the last one the most dreadful. At every street corner, entering every threshold, standing in every window, wrapped in every ragged garment fluttering in the wind, are the people who have been crushed and ground down by the machinery of poverty. The machine that molded them is a machine that turns the young into the old; children with the faces of the elderly and serious voices; and on every face, whether child or adult, deeply etched in the wrinkles of age, there is a glaring sign: Hunger. Hunger is evident everywhere. Hunger overflows from the tall houses, in the tattered clothes hanging on poles and lines; hunger is padded, patched, combined, and glued together with straw, rags, wood, and paper; hunger manifests itself in every piece of scrap wood of the sawyer; hunger glares down from the smokeless chimneys, steps along the filthy, trash-filled streets where there is not a scrap of edible food. Hunger carves its name on the shelves of the baker, writes letters on every small, stale loaf of bread in the meager reserves; leaves its mark in the sausage shop selling concoctions made entirely from dead dog meat. Hunger crackles, rattling dry bones among the roasted chestnuts in the oven; hunger disintegrates into atoms in the low-grade bowls containing slices of unpeeled potatoes, fried in a few precious drops of oil.",13.198,12.781,"Now a huge cloud had covered St. Antoine, and although a light briefly escaped from his holy bulk, the predominant element was a dense darkness – and the cold, filth, disease, ignorance, and hunger that accompanied this saintly being – each was almost a powerful noble; especially the last one. Examples of people, ground repeatedly in a mill – and this was certainly not a mill that rejuvenated the old – were shivering at every corner, entering and exiting every door, looking out of every window, fluttering under every garment played by the wind. The mill that ground them was a mill that aged the young; the faces of children looked old, and their voices were serious. And on these adult faces, in every line progressing like the mark of a plow, the same thing was seen, Hunger. Hunger was everywhere. It hung from the miserable clothes thrown out of high buildings, lined up in rows; Hunger was patched into these with straw, rags, wood splinters, and paper; it showed itself in every piece of wood the man cut with his saw. Hunger stared out from the chimneys that did not smoke, stood tall in the filthy street where there wasn't a single crumb of food in the garbage. Hunger was an inscription on the shelves of the bakeries, written over the few remaining dry loaves of bread; it was in the shop where sausages made from rotten meat were sold. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the chestnuts cooking in the cylindrical stove; it spread over every slice of potato frying with a few reluctant drops of oil.",13.874,13.439,"Once the street of San Antonio returned to its usual state and condition, from which it had been momentarily taken by a fortuitous incident, it remained sad, dark, and gloomy, groaning under the scepter of cold, filth, disease, ignorance, and hunger, all of them powerful nobles, but particularly the one mentioned last. In every corner, one could see crouched figures of the unfortunate who had been pressed and crushed one hundred times over by the heavy stones of the mill, shivering from the cold and collapsing from hunger. The mill that had crushed them was not that fabulous mill that has the property of turning the old into young people full of life, but the one that turns the young into old. The boys had the faces of old men, and the children had deep and grave voices. Their backs bent under the weight, not of years, but of hunger, which was the mistress and lady of those neighborhoods. Hunger was the word repeated in all the houses, hunger the fateful phantom mounted on the miserable rags hanging from poles or ropes stretched in front of the filthy shacks, hunger repeated all the fragments of sawdust falling under the carpenter's saw, hunger the dreadful monster that, finding no filth in the streets to feed on, climbed to the top of the chimneys, which also offered no smoke to its voracity; hunger was the inscription read in the shelves of all the bakers, hunger the word stamped on all the breads, expensive, of poor quality, and lacking in weight.",7.606,6.929
215,"Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops) were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops, croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler’s knives and axes were sharp and bright, the smith’s hammers were heavy, and the gunmaker’s stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement, with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down the middle of the street—when it ran at all: which was only after heavy rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted, and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.","As the person is, so is the dream. A narrow, winding road, full of unpleasant and foul things, branching into many other narrow, winding roads, everywhere were people in tattered clothes wearing nightcaps, everyone reeking, filthy, with gloomy, sickly faces. In the appearance of those people still lurked the instinctive resistance of wild beasts being hunted to the end of their tether. Though melancholic and desperate, their eyes still blazed with fire; their tightly pressed lips turned pale from restraint; their foreheads, wrinkled like ropes on a gallows, still harbored thoughts of resignation or revenge. The signs on every shop were almost all harsh illustrations of poverty. The butcher shops depicted the least nutritious scraps of meat; the bakeries showed skinny loaves made from the worst flour. The signs of the taverns crudely depicted people sitting and drinking, with frowning, suspicious faces over meager servings of beer and liquor. Nothing was depicted as prosperous, except for tools and weapons; yet the axes on the hardware store signs looked sharp and gleaming, the hammers on the blacksmith signs looked heavy, and the goods of the gun shops looked menacing. The cobblestone streets were uneven and dangerous, with muddy puddles, and there were no sidewalks, abruptly cutting off in front of houses. On the other hand, the sewers ran right down the middle of the street - if they weren't clogged, and they only cleared after heavy rains, and when they did, ironically, the water flooded into the houses. On both sides of the street, at regular intervals, there was a rickety lamp hanging high by ropes and pulleys; in the evening, the lamplighter would lower them, light them, and then pull them back up, a cluster of dimly burning wicks swaying overhead as if they were seasick. And they truly were at sea, and both the ship and the crew were in the peril of a storm.",12.77,12.365,"The never-ending presence of hunger had permeated everywhere and everything. A narrow, winding street where all kinds of faults and filth brewed, intersected by other narrow and winding streets, people wearing tattered clothes and nightcaps on their heads, smelling just like those tattered clothes and caps, and a morbid gloom in everything visible. Even in their disheveled state, people carried a terrifying hope within them to escape from the corner they were trapped in. Though they were overwhelmed and weary, flames were shooting from the eyes of some; their lips were tightly shut, turning white from the things they couldn't say; their furrowed brows had turned into the noose they thought would either be placed on their heads or on the heads of others. The pictures on all the signs (which were almost as numerous as the shops) depicted Hunger. The butcher and the pork seller had hung pictures of the scrawniest cuts of meat, while the baker had pictures of the stalest loaves. The coarse demeanor of people drinking in the wine shops was also depicted, with men conversing with sullen faces over the small amounts of diluted wine and beer in their glasses. Aside from tools and weapons, nothing was depicted in its entirety; the knives and axes of the cutler were sharp and shiny, the hammers of the blacksmith were heavy, and the goods of the armorer were lethal. The small puddles of mud and water and the loose cobblestones led nowhere, abruptly ending at doorsteps. In contrast, the open sewage channels flowed through the middle of the street – if they flowed at all – which only happened after heavy rain, finding various ways to seep into the houses. Along the streets, at wide intervals, there were shaky lanterns hanging from a rope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter lowered and lit them before pulling them back up, they would sway above like a faint ember from the dim wicks, as if they were floating on the sea. Indeed, they were at sea, and the ship and its crew were facing the danger of a storm.",19.074,18.797,"The districts where he had established his headquarters could not be more suitable for the purpose. A narrow and winding street, a filthy and foul-smelling dump, from which even narrower and more winding alleys branched off, inhabited by human rags and smelling of human rags, in which only people and things that caused nausea could be seen. In the grim expression of its inhabitants, one could glimpse fierce longings to turn things upside down. There was no shortage of emaciated faces with eyes that emitted flames, nor of clenched lips, nor of horribly furrowed brows. Even the shop signs were vivid illustrations of need. In the butcher shops and pork shops, they painted scrawny cattle, and in the bakeries, tiny, fraudulent loaves of bread. The only industry that seemed to be experiencing a period of flourishing prosperity was that of tools and weapons. The butchers' knives and axes were shiny, perfectly sharpened, the blacksmiths' hammers weighed many pounds, and the armories were packed with instruments of death. The streets, full of potholes, deposits of mud and corrupted water, lacked sidewalks. The lanterns, which hung at very long intervals from ropes, cast a sickly light that was not enough to dispel the darkness, just as the lights of lanterns placed high on the yards do not dispel the darkness of the sea. To tell the truth, Paris was a sea, and both the ship and those who manned it were in grave danger of shipwreck.",5.196,4.27

But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of song and feather, took no warning.","Because it will soon come to a time when the ragged, gaunt figures like scarecrows in this area, who have long been sitting idly with empty stomachs watching the night lamp-lighters, will think of a way to improve their dark situation by using those ropes and pulleys to hang people.

225,"Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way.","Mrs. Defarge, his wife, was sitting behind the counter in the shop when he walked in.

Mrs. Defarge exuded an air that made one think this proprietor rarely made mistakes in financial matters. Unable to bear the cold, Mrs. Defarge wrapped herself tightly in a fur coat, her head covered with a large, brightly colored scarf twisted around, but still revealing large hoop earrings. The knitting lay before her, but she had stopped knitting to pick her teeth with a toothpick. Her left hand supporting her right elbow as she picked her teeth, Mrs. Defarge said nothing when her husband walked in, merely clearing her throat softly.

Absorbed in her occupation, with her right elbow resting on her left hand, Mrs. Defarge said nothing when her husband entered the establishment, but she let out a barely perceptible little cough.

245,"Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus, joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard, and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret, angry, dangerous man.","Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette left the tavern, following Mr. Defarge to the entrance of the staircase that he had previously directed his guests to. The door was located in a small, dark, and foul-smelling courtyard, serving as a common entrance for many houses, home to many people. At the dimly lit brick-paved entrance leading to the dimly lit brick-paved staircase, Mr. Defarge knelt on one knee before the daughter of his former master and lifted her hand to his lips to kiss it. It was a gesture of kindness, but the manner of its expression did not appear so; in an instant, his demeanor had visibly changed. His face no longer bore a cheerful or open expression but had become one of secrecy, fury, and danger.",15.628,14.775,"Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette left the wine shop and went to Monsieur Defarge, to the entrance where the man had just described the room to the men. This led to a small, dark courtyard that smelled terrible and was used as a passage to an area with a bunch of houses and a lot of people living there. In this gloomy, tiled entrance that opened onto gloomy, tiled stairs, Monsieur Defarge knelt before his former employer's daughter and brought her hand to his lips. Although it was a polite gesture, it was not done in an overly polite manner; within a few seconds, the man's entire demeanor had changed. The cheerful, clear-faced man was gone, replaced by a mysterious, angry, and dangerous man. Mr. Defarge warned Mr. Lorry at the top of the stairs with a firm attitude.",14.827,14.05,"Mr. Maurice Lorry and Miss Manette, who were the visitors to the tavern, as the readers will have undoubtedly guessed, found the innkeeper by the door that moments earlier he had indicated to the three patrons with whom we have seen him exchange a few words. In the gloomy entrance that led to the equally gloomy staircase, the innkeeper knelt on one knee and brought to his lips the hand of the daughter of his former master. It was a homage, a testimony of submission, though executed with a demeanor that was anything but gentle. A few seconds had sufficed to radically transform Defarge; his face no longer reflected good humor, nor was it a mirror of frankness: on the contrary, in his reserved expression, in his angry attitude, in the fury that sparkled in his eyes, it was easy to read the dangerous man.",11.979,11.039

256,"Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high building—that is to say, the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircase—left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to his young companion’s agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr. Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.","Such a staircase, along with its dependencies, in the more crowded and older areas of Paris, must have been worse compared to today; but even at that time, it was already unpleasant for those who were not familiar and hardened. Every residence within the heart of this stinking nest, this tall house, in other words, every room, apartment behind any door that opened onto this common staircase - left a pile of their garbage at the top of the stairs of each floor, along with throwing other waste out the window. Even if one were not burdened by the stench of poverty, the heap of desperate decay and uncontrollable proliferation would have been enough to poison the entire atmosphere; but when both garbage and poverty join forces, the stench becomes unbearable. To proceed, one must pass through that atmosphere, traverse the dark, steep, filthy, and noxious staircase. Mr. Jarvis Lorry had to pause twice to catch his breath, exhausted by his own anxious thoughts and the restlessness of the young lady accompanying him. Each time he stopped at the miserable ventilation window, it seemed that any desirable fresh air had already escaped, and the foul, stinking fumes from outside had seeped in. Through the rusty bars of the ventilation window, one could almost taste rather than see this chaotic area; and within the range from here to the two high towers of Notre-Dame Cathedral, everything closer or lower offered no promise of a peaceful life or lofty aspirations.",10.546,9.946,"In the relatively older and more crowded areas of Paris, it would be natural for such a staircase to look bad with all its details, but that day, for these genteel individuals who knew nothing of misery, this place was utterly disgusting. The inhabitants of every small dwelling in this high filth nest of a building –in other words, every room or rooms opening onto the staircase– had piled all their rubbish onto their own landing and thrown the rest out of the windows. This out-of-control heap of hopeless trash had covered everything so much that even if the invisible filth of poverty and deprivation had not been added to it, it would have been enough to pollute the air; the combination of these two was truly unbearable. But to continue on their way, they had to breathe this air, dive into this steep, dark pit of filth and poison. Mr. Jarvis Lorry, unable to bear his increasing anxieties and the excitement of his young companion, stopped and rested twice. Each of these pauses was taken in front of sorrowful window grilles where a piece of clean, beautiful, and melancholy air had flown away, replaced by a foul vapor. Instead of the views of that chaotic neighborhood, the air was noticeable through the rusty bars, and as far as could be seen, there was no sign of healthy living or hope anywhere near or below the tops of Notre-Dame's two great towers.",10.202,9.543,"Painful, very painful, it would be today to climb the stairs of one of the oldest houses located in one of the most populated neighborhoods of Paris; but at the time to which this story refers, it was almost impossible for those who did not have their senses atrophied by force of habit. All the neighbors of those immense hives left the garbage and filth on the landings of the main staircase, where they piled up without anyone caring to remove them, thus generating a mass of decomposition sufficient to poison the air, if it were not already saturated with the intangible impurities that are the natural result of misery and deprivation. Combined, the two sources of corruption created an unbearable atmosphere. Mr. Lorry, yielding to the discomfort caused by climbing that dark, dirty, and poisoned well, as well as to the agitation he observed in his young companion, which multiplied by the moment, stopped twice to rest. Each of those rests seemed to take away the last reserves of uncorrupted air, filling the space they left free with mephitic emanations that sprang from all sides.",6.005,5.194
257,"At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder, took out a key.","Finally, they reached the top of the staircase, and they stopped for the third time. There was still one more staircase to climb, steeper and narrower, to reach the attic. The innkeeper, always a little ahead, stayed close to Mr. Lorry, as if he feared the girl might ask any questions; at this point, he turned around, carefully searched through the pockets of the coat draped over his shoulder, and pulled out a key.",25.344,24.641,"Finally, they reached the last step and stopped for the third time. However, before reaching the attic, a steeper and narrower staircase stretched out before them. As if afraid that the young lady might ask a question, the owner of the wine shop, who had been walking slightly ahead and on Mr. Lorry's side since the beginning of the stairs, turned around here and carefully searched the pockets of the coat he was carrying on his shoulder, producing a key.",16.518,15.516,"They finally reached the top of the stairs, where they stopped for the third time. They still had to climb another section, steeper than the previous ones, and of extremely reduced dimensions, before reaching the attic.

287,"The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way. Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.","Once built as a storage for firewood and similar items, this attic room was dim and dark; because that dormer window was actually an opening to the roof, equipped with a small crane to hoist goods from the street below; it had no glass panes but consisted of two shutters folding in the middle like all French-style doors. To avoid the cold, one shutter was tightly closed, and the other was only slightly ajar. Through that narrow gap, very little light entered, making the room pitch dark; upon first entering, it was very difficult to see anything; one had to stay for a long time to gradually get used to it, to be able to do any meticulous work in such darkness. Yet, such a meticulous task was being carried out right in this attic room. With his back to the door and facing the window where the innkeeper was standing and looking, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, bent forward, busy making shoes.",19.808,19.281,"The attic, which was made to store wood and similar things, had a rather dim and mysterious appearance; the skylight was actually a door opening to the roof and had a small pulley mechanism used to get things from the shops below; it was unpolished and, like all other doors in French buildings, it was double-winged. To block the cold, one wing of the door was tightly closed, while the other was left slightly ajar. In this way, so little light came in that it was difficult to see anything upon first entering, and to do any work requiring descending in such darkness, one had to be doing it for a long time. However, the very work being done in the attic was just like this; the person, with his back to the door and his face turned towards the window where the owner of the wine shop stood watching him, was an old man with white hair, sitting on a low stool, hunched over, making shoes with all his might.",15.727,15.056,"The attic, built to be a wood storage, barely received the visit of a very scarce light, as the window, extremely narrow and almost closed to avoid the cold, hindered the passage of light so much that it was impossible to see absolutely anything.

295,"The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller, wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.","That weak voice was both pitiful and frightening. It was not the weakness of a physically exhausted body, although certainly the captivity and harsh treatment had contributed to it. The pitiful aspect was due to the voice having long been unused in loneliness. The response sounded like the final dying echo of a sound that had been extinguished long ago. The voice had lost all vitality and resonance of human speech to the point that it was no different from a once beautiful color now faded into a pitiful, dull stain. The voice was deep and muffled, as if it were rising from the depths of the earth. The voice of a lost and desperate person, so sorrowful that one might think a starving, exhausted wanderer, lonely in the wilderness, would express their homesickness and longing for friends with such a mournful sound before collapsing to die.",11.944,10.851,"The frailty of the voice evoked both pity and suspicion within a person. It did not contain a physical weakness, but undoubtedly the impact of being imprisoned and enduring harsh conditions was significant. The pitiful state of the voice stemmed from loneliness and not being used for a long time. It was as if it were the last faint echo of a voice that had sounded long ago. It was so far removed from the liveliness and resonance of a human voice that it gave the impression of a once beautiful color having turned into a pale stain. This voice was so deep and suppressed that it seemed to come from underground. It was so affecting that only a hopeless and lost creature, a traveler exhausted from wandering alone in the desert, on the brink of death from hunger, could produce such a voice while reminiscing about its home and friends before lying down to die.",16.026,15.181,"The languor of that voice hurt the ear. It was not that languor that follows the decline of strength, physical weakness, no, although it is undeniable that insufficient nourishment, hardships, and mistreatment received during the terrible captivity played some part in it: its special and typical characteristic came from the fact that it was a languor produced by solitude and lack of use of the voice. It was something like the echo of a sound that was born many years before and at a considerable distance: a voice that had lost the life, the timbre of a human voice, a voice that produced in the senses the same impression that the sight of a most beautiful and delicate color turned by the hand of centuries into a faint stain of indefinable hue would produce, a voice that vividly reflected the despair of a lost and abandoned human being so eloquently that any traveler whom hunger and fatigue had overcome in the solitudes of the arid desert he was traversing would recognize in its timbre the voice of his home, the voice of the loved ones he left in the world, before bowing his head to draw his last breath.",8.07,7.095

302,"The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so. His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.","The slightly ajar door was pushed open a bit more and temporarily secured at that angle. A broad beam of light shone into the attic room, revealing that the craftsman had stopped working, with an unfinished shoe resting on his lap. At his feet and on the bench were a few common tools and pieces of leather of various sizes. He had a white, scraggly beard, but it wasn't very long, a deeply sunken face, and strangely bright eyes. The gaunt, emaciated face made his eyes appear even larger under still-black eyebrows and a tousled head of gray hair, although that wasn't actually the case; but his already large eyes now seemed extraordinarily big. The tattered yellow shirt, open at the collar, exposed a wrinkled, withered body. Both he, the old canvas cloak, the baggy socks, and all the tattered, ragged clothes had been away from sunlight and fresh air for so long that everything had turned the same yellowish hue as dried skin, making it hard to distinguish between the man and his clothing.",15.816,15.194,"The half-open wing opened a bit more and was fixed at a certain angle. With a broad beam of light entering the attic, the craftsman who had paused his work and was sitting with an unfinished shoe in his lap came into view. At his feet and on his workbench were a few tools and various pieces of leather. He had a short, patchy white beard, a sunken face, and bright, sparkling eyes. His face was so sunken and thin that even if his eyes, peering out from under his dark eyebrows and tangled hair, were small, they would certainly appear large; but his eyes were naturally large and did not look natural at all. His withered old skin was visible through the open collar of his shabby yellow shirt. Both the man himself, his sack-like work clothes, his loose socks, in short, all those rags he wore had not seen light or air for so long that they had all taken on a lifeless pale yellow like parchment paper, making it hard to distinguish one from the other.",12.562,11.757,"Defarge opened the window a little more. The rays of light that penetrated the attic perfectly illuminated the shoemaker, who had an unfinished shoe on his thigh. Scattered on the floor, or placed on the bench, were various tools of the trade. He was a man with a beard trimmed in any manner, but not of excessive length. In his gaunt and emaciated face, two eyes shone extraordinarily, which would have seemed large and slanted, even if they were not naturally so. The yellowish shirt he wore open at the chest revealed flabby flesh as white as paper. His skin, the old canvas blouse that covered the upper part of his body, the stockings, which, full of wrinkles, served as a wrapping for his fleshless calves, and in a word, all his garments, had acquired, by being deprived of the contact of air and light, a parchment tone that made it extremely difficult to determine the material used in their manufacture.",4.925,3.833

They tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughter’s voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.","Looking at the bewildered, dazed, and fearful expression of the shoemaker, no intellect could comprehend the mysteries within his mind. No one could answer the question of whether he understood what was happening, whether he remembered what he had heard, or whether he knew he had been set free. They tried to start a conversation, but he was so bewildered and responded so slowly that everyone became worried and agreed to leave him alone for the time being. From time to time, he would raise his hands to his head in a manner so foolish and absurd; yet, just hearing Miss Manette's voice would bring him some pleasure, and he would always turn to listen.",7.908,6.409,"No one looking at that fear-stricken, bewildered face could guess what was going through the shoemaker's mind. Did he know what was happening, had he understood what was told to him, did he know he was now free, no one could figure it out. They tried to talk to him; but his mind was so confused and he responded so slowly that they were frightened by his bewildered state and decided not to bother him any further for now. Every now and then, he would take his head in his hands and shake it like a madman, something he had never done before; on the other hand, he really enjoyed hearing his daughter's voice and would immediately turn to look as soon as she spoke.",11.35,10.235,"No one would have been able to read in the expressionless apathy of his face the mysteries among which the old man's intelligence probably wandered aimlessly, nor would human insight, no matter how subtle and perceptive, have been able to determine whether he retained any memory of what had happened, if he remembered what he had been told, or if he realized that he was free. They tried to probe him with a barrage of questions; but the responses were so slow and confused that, fearing to disorient him further, they decided to leave him in peace for the time being. The old man's expression was one of senselessness, of ferocity, almost. He frequently pressed his head between his hands, something he had not been seen to do before; however, his face softened as soon as his daughter's voice reached his ears, and he invariably turned his head towards her whenever she spoke to him.",11.129,10.074

It was an old-fashioned place, moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness, proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business.

Five years later, Tellson's Bank near Temple Bar gate was an antiquated place, just as it had been in 1780. This place was very small, very dark, very ugly, and very inconveniently cramped. Moreover, it became even more antiquated as the bank's shareholders took pride in this darkness, ugliness, and cramped inconvenience. They were even proud of all these characteristics and harbored a special conviction that if this place were not so unappealing, it would lose some of its respectability. This was not a negative belief at all but rather a positive weapon for them to flaunt to businesses with more convenient facilities, saying that Tellson did not need spaciousness, Tellson did not need brightness, Tellson did not need decoration. Noakes and the Brotherhood might need it, or the Snooks Brothers company might need it, but Tellson does not, thank God!",14.757,14.022,"Even in 1780, Tellson Bank next to Temple Bar looked old-fashioned.

They even boasted, thinking these features enhanced the bank's reputation, and believed that without such unsuitable conditions, it would not be as respectable. This was not a passive thought but an active weapon they directed at businesses with more suitable premises. According to them, Tellson needed neither more space, nor light, nor showiness. Perhaps Noakes and Company or the Snooks Brothers Company did; but fortunately, Tellson had no such need!",15.379,14.708,"Already in the year seventeen eighty, the headquarters of the Tellson Bank could boast of its respectable old age. It was a very small, very dark, very dirty, and very uncomfortable building. The partners of the House prided themselves on its smallness, prided themselves on its darkness, prided themselves on its dirtiness, and prided themselves on its discomforts: moreover, their greatest badge of honor was that it possessed these qualities to an eminent degree, and they held the intimate conviction that if it were less small, less dark, less dirty, and less uncomfortable, it would be much less respectable. And note that this was not a passive belief; not at all: it was a weapon they wielded against other similar houses established in luxurious buildings. The Tellson house, they said, does not need halls, does not need light, does not need comforts or luxuries. Let Noakes and Company, or Snooks Brothers, have those, that's fine; but the Tellson house... Horrors!",13.012,12.286
401,"Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding Tellson’s. In this respect the House was much on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable, but were only the more respectable.","The heir of any shareholder would be disinherited if they dared to suggest renovating Tellson. In this regard, Tellson's company is quite similar to England, a country that very often strips the freedom of any citizen who dares to propose reforming long-standing customs that only increase reverence but are extremely reprehensible.",6.446,4.372,"If one of the bank's partners' sons were to propose rebuilding Tellson, his father would disinherit him. In this respect, the bank was no different from the state of the country; it too disinherited sons who proposed to reorganize the laws and traditions that, though inappropriate for so many years, still maintained their respectability.",10.702,8.203,"Any of the partners would have been capable of disinheriting the most pampered child who dared to even hint at the convenience of rebuilding the social domicile. In this regard, the house was very similar to the nation, which frequently disinherits those children who take their inconceivable audacity to the scandalous extreme of proposing improvements and advances in laws or customs that everyone recognizes and admits are bad, but which precisely for this reason are more respectable.",8.246,6.488
402,"Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson’s was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson’s down two steps, and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street, and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing “the House,” you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back, where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee.","Therefore, it came to be that Tellson reached the pinnacle of inconvenience. After pushing open the stubborn, foolish door that always creaked and groaned, I immediately stumbled upon two steps leading downwards, and upon regaining my composure, I realized I was in a miserably cramped space with two small counters where old men with trembling hands held my check and scrutinized the signature through dark windows, perpetually splattered with mud from Fleet Street, and further darkened by the iron bars on the window frames and the gloomy shadow of the Temple Bar gate. If my business required me to meet the “Boss,” I would be taken into something resembling a solitary confinement cell at the back, where I could reflect on my wasted life while waiting for the Boss, hands in pockets, to appear, inevitably startling me in that dim, twilight gloom. Whether my money jumps out or flies into those old, termite-ridden wooden drawers, a cloud of dust will rise up to my nose and creep into my throat as these drawers are pulled out and slammed shut. My money has a moldy smell as if it will quickly rot back into rags*. My gold and silver items are placed in those filthy compartments, and the polish will be destroyed in just one or two days by all the filth inside. My property deeds are stored in makeshift vaults that used to be kitchens and dishwashing rooms, and the papers will be eroded in the atmosphere of this bank. My family document boxes are taken upstairs to the Barmecide* room, which always has a grand banquet table but never any food; where the first letters from an old lover or my young children, dating back to 1780, have just escaped the horror of being spied on through the windows, because Temple Bar's gate was previously the place where the heads of executed people were displayed - a barbaric and cruel act thought to only occur in ancient times in Abyssinia or Ashanti*.",8.008,7.479,"Thus, Tellson became known as the triumphant perfection of uselessness. Accompanied by a feeble creak from its hinge, you would quickly open the stubbornly resistant door, descend two steps as if falling, and enter Tellson's, finding yourself in a wretched little shop with two small counters where the oldest of men would shake your check in his hand as if rustled by the wind, then examine your signature in front of the dirtiest windows imaginable, constantly exposed to the splashes of mud from Fleet Street, further soiled by their own iron bars and the heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business required seeing someone of higher status, you would be taken to a section at the back resembling that of convicts, and there you would ponder your wasted life until that important person came to you with both hands in his pockets, and when he arrived, you would barely make him out in that gloomy twilight. Your money would go in and out of worm-eaten and old wooden drawers, from which particles would fly into your nose and then your throat as they opened and closed. The paper money would smell musty, as if rapidly turning into rags. The gold and silver would be piled right next to a cesspool, and this filthy association would strip them of all their luster within two days. As for the promissory notes, they would be kept in rooms converted from kitchens and sculleries, and all the oils from the parchment paper would permeate the bank's atmosphere. The less important boxes containing your family documents would go upstairs to a room with a large dining table that had never been dined upon, and inside these boxes would be the first letters from your old lover or your young children, which would have only recently escaped the horror of being watched by the heads appearing in the windows of Temple Bar, reminiscent of the heartless cruelty and savagery practiced in Abyssinia and Ashantee, even as late as 1780.",15.592,15.251,"So, we agreed that the Tellson house was something like a glorification of discomforts and inconveniences. Those of my readers who might have had the need or desire to visit the Tellson house, after opening a door that would have welcomed them with harsh and strident creaks, and descending two steps, would have found themselves in a miserable hovel, where two employees, as old as time, sitting behind two rickety counters, would have snatched the check or checks from their hands, to examine the signatures by the light of the dirtiest window imaginable, windows that barely let light filter through, for aside from the fact that their panes were never cleaned of the layer of mud that was thrown at them from the street the same day they were installed, they were defended by thick rusty iron bars and enjoyed the protective shade of the Temple Court. If business had obliged anyone to tour ""the house,"" this anyone would have been led to a kind of Condemned Cell, located at the back of the building, where they would have remained making philosophical reflections on the futility of life until the house presented itself, with hands in pockets. Money entered or left from drawers of wood gnawed by woodworms. The banknotes smelled of mold, as if they were in full decomposition. Silver piled up in deposits that, without a doubt, were in communication with the latrines, two or three days were enough to rob it of its peculiar shine. Anyone who went to deposit titles or securities of any kind in the Bank could be assured that, once closed in rooms that were once kitchens or stables, they would soon smell of leftover stews or manure, and if a fatal thought induced them to bring family documents or papers, these were kept in a chamber on the upper floor, in the center of which was a dining table, although a meal was never served on it, where the letters written by their first love, or by their tender children, were condemned, in the full year of seventeen eighty, to suffer the horror of being the target of the gazes of the heads that an insensate brutality and a ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or the Ashantis daily exposed in the Temple Court.",8.429,8.02
403,"But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson’s. Death is Nature’s remedy for all things, and why not Legislation’s? Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder of a horse at Tellson’s door, who made off with it, was put to Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention—it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse—but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after. Thus, Tellson’s, in its day, like greater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.","But in reality, during that time, capital punishment was a prevalent solution in all professions, especially with the Tellson company. If death is nature's cure-all, why shouldn't the law apply it? Accordingly, anyone who forged documents was sentenced to death; anyone who wrote a bad check was sentenced to death; anyone who secretly opened and read someone else's letter was sentenced to death; anyone who stole forty shillings and six pence was sentenced to death; anyone who kept a horse in front of the Tellson Bank and stole one to ride away was sentenced to death; anyone who counterfeited a single shilling was sentenced to death; just a slight deviation in the entire spectrum of crimes related to money could lead to a death sentence. And with so many executions, did it have any deterrent effect? - in fact, quite the opposite - but like everything in life, executing people saved the trouble of dealing with each case individually and avoided worrying about any consequences afterward. Therefore, at that time, just like other larger businesses of the era, Tellson Bank had taken so many lives that if the severed heads were not secretly disposed of but instead piled up at the Temple Bar gate, the number of heads would almost block the sunlight from reaching the ground floor of that place.",10.32,9.585,"Actually, at that time, the death penalty was quite a popular solution for Tellson as well as for many businesses and institutions. Why shouldn't it be for the laws when Death was Nature's remedy for everything? Thus, the counterfeiter received the death penalty; the forger received the death penalty; the person who opened letters without authority received the death penalty; the thief who stole forty shillings received the death penalty; the one who stole a horse in front of Tellson Bank, the swindler, and everyone who, in one way or another, got involved in Crime received the death penalty. This practice did not actually prevent crimes –it is worth emphasizing that it had the opposite effect– but it cleaned up the problem in each individual case, leaving no matter to deal with. Indeed, Tellson, at that time, like other major companies of the period, had taken many lives, so much so that if the heads were kept below before being lined up at Temple Bar instead of being thrown away, they would have significantly blocked the little light that reached the ground floor.",8.809,8.129,"It is true that in those happy times, the death penalty was a universal panacea, a very fashionable prescription in all trades and professions, and the Tellson Bank was not going to be an exception, far from it. If Nature remedies everything with death, why shouldn't the law do the same? Nothing, then, was more natural and logical than imposing the death penalty on the forger, the death penalty on the bearer of a counterfeit bill, the death penalty on the one who improperly opened a letter, the death penalty on the one who stole forty shillings and sixpence. He who guarded a horse at the doors of the Tellson Bank and disappeared with the animal was condemned to death, those who minted a counterfeit shilling were condemned to death, and three-quarters of mortals who brushed against the boundaries of crime paid with their heads. It is true that the penal sanction, being a little severe, far from preventing, far from reducing transgressions, multiplied them, but at least it concluded, once and for all, with the annoyances and inconveniences attached to each particular case. So many lives had been reaped by the Tellson Bank, and like it, all its contemporary similar establishments, that if the heads of the dead had been piled up in front of its facade, it is almost certain that they would have completely blocked the scant light that penetrated its interior through its dirty windows.",8.598,7.908
404,"Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson’s, the oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young man into Tellson’s London house, they hid him somewhere till he was old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he permitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.","Stuffed in various compartments, the dingy cages at Tellson were manned by the oldest and most solemn individuals doing everything. If they took a young person into the London branch of Tellson, they would hide him somewhere until he grew old. They would lock him in a dark place, like aging cheese, until he turned blue and reeked of Tellson. Only then would he be allowed to show his face, scrutinizing the large ledgers, and donning breeches and gaiters to add to the bank's solemnity.",19.157,17.981,"At Tellson's Bank, old men, squeezed among various dark cabinets, were carrying on their work with great seriousness. When they hired a young clerk at Tellson's London branch, they would hide him somewhere until he aged.

Only then would he be allowed to emerge, and he would bury himself among the large ledgers, blending into the institution's general heavy atmosphere with his trousers and gaiters.",9.87,7.791,"Perched on implausible benches and chests of strange shapes, the old employees of the Bank worked with extreme gravity and composure of a sphinx. When a young person was admitted, they were locked up who knows where and did not reappear until they were old. Evidently, they kept them, like cheese, in some dark chamber until they had acquired the peculiar smell of the House. Outside the building, whose door he was never allowed to cross without being called, there was an old man, vested with the functions of doorman and messenger, who was something like the living emblem of the house.",4.106,2.399

He was never absent during business hours, unless upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellson’s, in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added appellation of Jerry.","Sitting outside Tellson's was the living sign of this bank; it was an errand boy - never allowed inside without orders - who occasionally doubled as a porter and messenger. He was never absent during working hours, except when he had to run an errand, and if he did, he was replaced by his son: a ghastly twelve-year-old brat who looked exactly like his father. Everyone understood that Tellson had condescended to accept that errand boy. The bank had always accepted someone to do such work, and time and fate had brought this person into that position. His surname was Cruncher, and having promised in his youth to renounce dark deeds during a baptism ceremony at the parish church of Hounsditch in East London, he was given the additional name Jerry.",20.139,19.458,"In front of Tellson's door stood a man who did errands – never entering unless summoned – sometimes carrying goods, sometimes news; this person was like the bank's living signboard. He was always there during working hours, and if he had an errand to run, he would go, and during those times, his son would take his place; the twelve-year-old boy, with mischief written all over his face, was a copy of his father. People knew that they managed this errand man of Tellson's. The bank had always tolerated people of this sort, and over time and circumstances, it had come to the postal business. His surname was Cruncher, and after giving up the shady businesses of his youth, he had taken the name Jerry at the church in the eastern part of Houndsditch.",11.268,10.294,"Outside the building, whose door he was never allowed to cross without being called, there was an old man, vested with the functions of doorman and messenger, who was something like the living emblem of the house. He never left the door during office hours, unless he was sent on an errand, and even then, his son, a twelve-year-old rascal who was his spitting image, would stand in for him at the door. There were no lack of malicious people who claimed that the house merely tolerated the old man in question, whom they nicknamed Lapa, although many years earlier, in the parish church of Houndsditch, where tired of being confined and in darkness, he wanted to glimpse the light of the world, he was given the name Jeremiah.",13.133,12.14

459,"They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it. But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner’s, and even died before him. For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard, from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any. So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice illustration of the precept, that “Whatever is is right;” an aphorism that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.","At that time, people hanged criminals at Tyburn, so the road outside Newgate Prison had not yet gained the notoriety it would later. But this prison was a dreadful place; so many heinous and corrupt acts occurred within it, and it was a breeding ground for diseases. Prisoners would bring their illnesses to court, and sometimes the disease would spread from the defendants' area to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, causing him to collapse from his judicial seat. There were many instances where judges, donning the black cap to pronounce a death sentence, met the same fate as the condemned criminals, sometimes even dying before the convicts. To everyone else, the Old Bailey Criminal Court was notoriously known as a kind of death inn, from which pale travelers continuously departed in carts and carriages on their brutal journey to the other world - they had to traverse about two and a half miles of public road, causing some good Citizens to feel ashamed if they encountered them. Violence, initially useful because it was necessary, had now become a habit. Old Bailey was also famous for its long-standing custom of the pillory, where prisoners were shackled hand and foot for public humiliation, a punishment without limit; another cherished long-standing custom was the whipping post, where seeing a prisoner tied up and flogged would surely make one more compassionate and humane; and countless blood-stained coins were exchanged among hired thugs, another manifestation of the wisdom of the forefathers, leading to numerous horrifying crimes under the sky. In summary, Old Bailey at that time was an excellent illustration of the principle ""Everything that exists has its reason"" - a decisive maxim that makes one lazy to think if it did not encompass the annoying corollary that: nothing in the world is unreasonable.",8.334,7.618,"In those days, they used to hang criminals in Tyburn, so the street stretching in front of Newgate Prison did not yet have the bad reputation it would later acquire. But the prison was a dreadful place, a site of every kind of immorality and depravity, where ominous diseases contracted from defendants coming to court would breed, sometimes even spreading directly from the defendant to the High Judge, toppling him from his bench. Sometimes, the judge, in his black robe, would sign his own death warrant as well as the defendant's, and would even die before him. For the rest, Old Bailey was like the courtyard of a deadly infamous inn, where pale-faced travelers were constantly taken away by carriages on a sorrowful journey to the other world; they would proceed slowly on the main streets and roads to serve as a lesson to the public, breaking the hearts of the few kind-hearted citizens, if any. It was quite an effective, ideal method to bring people to their senses. The area where the executed were displayed, the wise old prison, was famous for punishments whose extent no one could predict; another old, extremely humane area that softened the situation was the whipping post; here, blood money transactions, an ancestral wisdom leading to the most horrific contract killings imaginable, were conducted. In short, Old Bailey in those days was a prime example of the principle ""What exists is right""; an ultimately lazy aphorism that never considers the troubling consequence it creates, namely the idea that nothing that existed in the past is wrong.",11.605,11.139,"They used to hang people at Tyburn back then, and consequently, the street where Newgate stood had not yet gained the grim notoriety that later weighed upon it. It was, however, a dreadful prison, where all kinds of villainies and atrocities were practiced, a hotbed of the most terrible diseases, which often entered the Hall of Justice with the prisoners, preyed upon, showing very little regard, the very Chief Justice, and forced him to abandon his high seat forever. It often happened that the judge with the black cap pronounced his own sentence along with that of the accused, and even died sooner than the latter. Moreover, the Bailey was like an inn through whose spacious hallway pale travelers constantly departed, mounted on carts or coaches, heading to the other world after a journey of two or three miles of public streets and roads, instilling healthy fear in some citizens, perhaps in none: such is the power of habit. It was also famous for the pillory, a shrewd and happy institution that implied a punishment whose extent and reach no one could foresee; it was also known for the posts where those condemned to the penalty of whipping were tied, a system most suitable for softening customs and sweetening temperaments, as well as for the myriad deals made there, in which gold entered on one side and the shedding of blood on the other, a remnant of the indisputable wisdom of our ancestors, which systematically led to the perpetration of the most heinous mercenary crimes that could be committed under the sky. Furthermore, the Old Bailey at that time was an eloquent demonstration of the precept, ""All that is, is just,"" an aphorism that would be as foolish as it is innocent if it did not carry the highly detrimental consequence that ""Nothing that has existed was unjust.""",15.406,15.047

494,"Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England, on secret business of which he could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered. That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the prisoner’s schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his Majesty’s Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council. That, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and attitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, he had been the prisoner’s friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country. That, if statues were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one. That, Virtue, as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues; whereat the jury’s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country. That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had communicated itself to the prisoner’s servant, and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his master’s table-drawers and pockets, and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that, in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-General’s) brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr. Attorney-General’s) father and mother. That, he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the evidence of these two witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his Majesty’s forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power. That, these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoner’s handwriting; but that it was all the same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. That, the proof would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans. That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they were), and being a responsible jury (as they knew they were), must positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon pillows at all, unless the prisoner’s head was taken off. That head Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good as dead and gone.","3. Disappointed, the Attorney General had to inform the jury that the defendant before them, despite his young age, was experienced in treacherous schemes that required him to pay with his life. That colluding with the enemy nation was not something new today, or yesterday, or even last year or the year before. That, certainly, this defendant, over a longer period, had frequently traveled between France and England to carry out secret activities that he had never honestly disclosed. That, if these treacherous acts had naturally developed (fortunately, this did not happen), the true harm and guilt of his actions might not have been discovered. That, thanks to the Almighty's prompting, a person with a fearless heart, unafraid of hardships, discovered the nature of his schemes, and this person, being too horrified, reported it to the Secretary of State and the esteemed Privy Council. That, this patriot will present himself before the jury. That, the status and character of this person are all noble. That, this person was once a friend of the accused, but at the fortunate yet unfortunate moment, discovered the crimes of the friend he dearly loved, and decided to sacrifice the traitor on the sacred altar of the Fatherland. That, if England, like ancient Greece and Rome, issued decrees to erect statues of the nation's benefactors, this distinguished Citizen would surely be honored. That, since England has no such decree, this person will not have a statue erected. That, morality is inherently contagious; especially the shining virtue of patriotism, or love for the country - a sentiment recorded by poets (in many verses which the Attorney General knows the jury must have memorized word for word; upon hearing this, the faces of the jurors clearly showed a guilty conscience as they did not know a single verse). That, the noble example of this unquestionably pure witness for the Kingdom, whom we are unworthy to honor by name, inspired the servant of the accused and led this servant to the noble resolve of rummaging through the master's pockets and drawers and hiding away many documents. That, he (the Attorney General) is ready to hear slanderous insults against this admirable servant; but that, he cherishes this servant more than his own siblings (of the Attorney General) and respects this servant more than his own parents (of the Attorney General). That, he confidently calls upon the jury to do as he does. That, the evidence from these two witnesses, along with the documents they discovered and are about to present to the court, will show that the accused had obtained lists of the Royal forces, along with deployment plans, both naval and military, and there is no doubt that he regularly transmitted such information to the enemy. That, it cannot be proven that these lists were written by the accused himself; but this does not lessen the severity and actually facilitates the prosecution; that, it shows the accused was cunningly cautious. That, evidence shows that five years ago the accused began these dangerous missions, just a few weeks before the first battle between the British army and the Americans*. That, for these reasons, the jury, being loyal (as he knows they are) and responsible (as they know they are) - must unequivocally find the accused guilty and sentence him to death, whether they want to or not. That, they cannot eat or sleep well; that, they cannot accept the idea of their wives eating or sleeping well; that, they cannot tolerate the thought of their children eating or sleeping well; in short, no one, whether they or their wives or children, can eat or sleep well anymore if the accused is not beheaded. That head, the Attorney General demands the jury to sever, in the name of all that is good and reasonable that he can think of, and with unwavering belief, he solemnly concludes that he considers the accused as good as dead.",19.335,19.207,"The prosecutor had to inform the jury that, although the defendant was young, he was experienced in the matter of treason, which would cost him his life. His relationship with enemies of the state did not belong to today, yesterday, last year, or even the year before. He had been traveling back and forth between France and England for a very long time, and it was very clear that he was involved in secret activities that he could not explain. If treason had engulfed everything (fortunately, this was not the case), the true evil and guilt of his actions might never have come to light. Fortunately, God had given a servant, free from fear and sin, the duty to uncover the conspiracies organized by this defendant and, in horror, to explain all this to His Majesty's assistant and the honorable Privy Council. This patriotic individual was now about to come before them. He was a person of utmost nobility in both position and demeanor. This person was a friend of the defendant, but on a fateful and troublesome day, upon realizing his disgrace, he decided that he could no longer embrace this traitor or harbor him at the sacred altar of his homeland. If statues were erected in England, as in ancient Rome and Greece, for those who had benefited the public, this extraordinary citizen would certainly have had a statue. But since there was no such decision, he probably would not have a statue. As poets have said, Virtue had a contagious nature (he thought many of the jurors knew many poems by heart, line by line; yet the jurors' faces bore a guilty expression indicating they knew nothing about poems); especially what was known as patriotism and love of country was a radiant virtue. This example of purity and perfection, who was to testify on behalf of the King and whom it was an honor to even speak of, had contacted the defendant's servant and inspired in him a sacred determination to rummage through his master's desk drawers and pockets and to hide certain documents. The prosecutor was actually ready to hear derogatory remarks about this commendable servant; but he preferred him over his own brothers and showed him more respect than he did to his own parents. He then invited the jurors to act in the same manner. The evidence presented by these two witnesses and the other documents they had obtained would show how the defendant was equipped with information about Her Majesty's armies, and furthermore, it was an undeniable fact that he had always conveyed information about the structuring and preparations on land and sea to enemy forces. Perhaps it could not be proven that the lists were written in the defendant's handwriting; but this changed nothing; in fact, it was better for the case as it showed how cunning the defendant was in taking precautions. The evidence dated back five years and showed that the defendant had undertaken this harmful duty even then, a few weeks before the first clashes between the British and American armies. For these reasons, the patriotic (he was sure of this) and responsible (he was also sure of this) jurors should definitely declare this defendant Guilty, and whether they were pleased with this situation or not, they should end his life. Unless this defendant's head was cut off, neither the jurors could rest their heads on their pillows in peace, nor could they tolerate their wives resting their heads on their pillows, nor could they bear the thought of their children resting their heads on their pillows; in short, none of them would be able to rest their heads on their pillows in peace and tranquility. The Chief Prosecutor concluded his speech by reiterating his demand for the defendant to be found guilty in the name of everything conceivable; in fact, as a result of all the legal claims he had put forward, the defendant was already dead to him.",12.395,12.209,"The Crown Prosecutor stated in his report that the accused, though young in years, was so old in treacherous acts and perfidious practices that it was necessary to end his life. "" His dealings and continuous correspondence with the public enemy,"" he said, ""do not date from yesterday, nor the day before, nor from last year, nor from two years ago. From a much earlier date, the accused has been making constant trips between England and France, mysterious trips, the purpose of which he himself has not been able to explain to us satisfactorily. Ah! If Heaven, in its high wisdom, had not condemned the machinations of traitors to eternal failure, the criminal acts of this man would have borne their natural fruits, but Providence, which watches in a special way over the fate of our beloved England, inspired a person, in whose heart fear has no entry and in whose conscience malice has no place, with the fortunate thought of uncovering the sinister plans of the accused, and when he achieved his goal, filled with terror, he hurried to reveal them to the first Secretary of State and to the august Privy Council of His Majesty. Soon you will have the opportunity to meet this patriot, whose conduct has been sublime. He had been an intimate friend of the traitor, but as soon as he discovered his infamies, he decided to sacrifice a friendship, which he could no longer keep in his heart, on the sacred altar of patriotism. If England ever erects statues, as Greece and Rome did in honor of those who sacrificed their deepest affections for the sake of the homeland, there is no doubt that this eminent citizen will have his own. Virtue, as countless poets have affirmed, whose names I will not cite because all my listeners have them on the tip of their tongues, is eminently contagious, and above all, the sacred virtue of patriotism, the love of the homeland. It is not surprising, then, that the high and sublime example of the immaculate and impeccable witness I refer to, whose name honors anyone who pronounces it, was contagious to a servant of the same accused, and inspired in him the holy resolution to search the drawers of the tables and the pockets of his master, to seize or take note of his most secret documents. There will be detractors who sink their teeth into the reputation of this admirable servant, slanderers who will expose the peccadilloes of his past life in the public pillory, but even so, I must protest that his present conduct makes him deserving of all my respect, I must say that he deserves more consideration than my own brothers, more consideration than my own parents. I do not doubt, I cannot doubt that those who listen to me will do the same. The statements of the two named witnesses, together with the documents that will be exhibited in due course, demonstrate as clearly as sunlight that the prisoner possessed numerical relations of His Majesty's military forces, explanatory states of their disposition and preparation, and there is no doubt that these relations, these states, he carried, as he has carried so many others, to an enemy power. I confess that it has not been possible to prove that these relations and these states are in the handwriting of the accused, but that does not matter, it means nothing, and in any case, it will be an aggravating circumstance, since it will highlight the cunning malice of the accused. The evidence goes back five years, clearly demonstrating that the prisoner was already then carrying out infamous and pernicious missions, that he was already selling out the homeland weeks before the first battle between English and American forces was fought. All these reasons will necessarily influence the mind of the Jury, if it is a loyal Jury, as I know it is, if it is a responsible Jury, as I consider it to be, to declare the prisoner guilty, and to rid the world of a traitor. Ah, gentlemen of the jury! As long as there is a head on the prisoner's shoulders, it is not possible for your heads to rest peacefully on the pillows of your beds, it is not possible for the heads of your tender wives to rest peacefully on the pillows of their beds, it is not possible for the little heads of your dear children to rest peacefully on the pillows of their beds. The Crown Prosecutor asks you by the most sacred, by what is most dear to you, by the oath you have taken, by the august and excellent King who governs us, by the homeland, which is our mother, to sentence the prisoner to be hanged, beheaded, and quartered.""",10.657,10.461
495,"When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in anticipation of what he was soon to become.

496,"Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader’s lead, examined the patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The story of his pure soul was exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be—perhaps, if it had a fault, a little too exactly.

After unburdening his noble heart, he should have humbly withdrawn, but the barrister wearing a wig, holding a stack of papers, sitting in front of him not far from Mr. Lorry, requested to ask a few questions.

He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him. He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of charity—never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions of the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the prisoner’s pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoner’s desk. He had not put them there first. He had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn’t bear it, and had given information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot; he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years; that was merely a coincidence. He didn’t call it a particularly curious coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too. He was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.","It was the virtuous servant Roger Cly's turn to take the oath before the interrogation. He had been working for the defendant for four years and knew nothing. He had asked the defendant on the Calais train if the defendant needed a servant, and the defendant had hired him. It was not out of charity that the defendant took him as a servant - there was no such thought. Soon after, he began to suspect the defendant and kept an eye on him. While preparing clothes for the defendant during a trip, he saw lists similar to these in the defendant's pockets many times. He took these lists from the defendant's desk drawer. He did not put those papers in the drawer from the beginning. He saw the defendant show similar lists to many French people in Calais, and show similar lists to many French people in both Calais and Boulogne. He was patriotic and could not accept that, so he went to report it. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver teapot; he had been falsely accused of stealing a mustard pot, but it turned out to be only silver-plated. He had known the previous witness for seven or eight years; it was just a coincidence. He did not consider it a strange coincidence because any coincidence is strange.

But later, he started to suspect the defendant and began to watch him. While preparing the defendant's clothes for travel, he constantly saw similar lists in the defendant's pockets. He had also taken these lists from the defendant's desk drawer. It wasn't the first time he had seen them. He had seen the defendant show the same lists to the French in Calais, and similar ones to the French in both Calais and Boulogne.

Four years earlier, he had entered the service of the prisoner, simply and in good faith. On board the ship that serviced Calais, he asked the prisoner if he needed a servant, and the latter accepted him. Very shortly after, the prisoner's behavior seemed suspicious to him, and he resolved to spy on him. During the various trips he made in his company, he saw several times in his master's clothes lists and records similar to those held by the authorities. He was the one who took some of those lists from a drawer in his master's desk. He saw that his master showed other identical lists to a French gentleman in Calais and others to other French gentlemen, both in Calais and in Boulogne. A lover of his country, his conscience rebelled against such dark treacheries and he reported the facts. Regarding his honesty, he assured that it was so impeccable that no one ever dared to accuse him of stealing a silver teapot, for although there were slanderers who once accused him of stealing a butter dish, upon verification, it turned out it was not silver but silver-plated metal. He had known the witness who preceded him in the statement for seven or eight years, but they only ever interacted by coincidence.

The judge asked Mr. Stryver (the defense attorney) whether they were intending to try Mr. Carton (our esteemed colleague) for treason. Mr. Stryver replied that they were not, but he would ask the witness if he was sure that what had happened once could not happen again; if the witness was certain he had encountered the defendant if he had ever seen such a resemblance before; and now that he had seen it, if he could still be so confident, along with many other questions. The result was that the witness's credibility in court was shattered like a clay pot, and his testimony became a pile of useless fragments.",15.877,15.274,"If we disregard the appearance of our wise friend, which, although not immoral, could be described as disheveled and slovenly, it could be said that when compared to each other, they resembled each other so much that it would astonish not only the witness but everyone present. The judge, upon the prosecutor's request, ordered our wise friend to remove his wig, which made this resemblance even more apparent. The judge asked Mr. Stryver (the defendant's lawyer) whether the other person they were going to try for treason was Mr. Carton (our wise friend). Mr. Stryver told the judge no; but he would ask the witness to tell the judge the likelihood of something happening again once it had happened once; if he had seen his imprudence before, would he still speak so confidently or would he still speak confidently even after seeing it, were among the many questions on his mind. The aim was to crush this witness and nullify his part of the case.",18.476,17.923,"However, despite the negligence and untidiness of the gentleman with the little paper, there was a rather remarkable resemblance between him and the prisoner, enough to surprise not only the witness but also everyone present in the courtroom. The president of the tribunal requested the aforementioned gentleman with the little paper to remove his wig, and the resemblance became much more notable. The president asked Mr. Stryver, who was the defense attorney, if they were to prosecute Mr. Carton, the name of the gentleman with the little paper, for the crime of treason, to which the defense attorney replied no, but that he wished to ask the witness if he believed that what had happened once could not happen again, if he would have dared to speak with such certainty and confidence if he had previously seen that palpable example of his temerity, if the sight of a person who so closely resembled the prisoner would not have been a severe blow to his confidence, etc., etc. The result of this incident was to annihilate the witness, destroy the effect of his testimony, and strip all value from his statements.",8.592,7.563
592,"Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his fingers in his following of the evidence. He had now to attend while Mr. Stryver fitted the prisoner’s case on the jury, like a compact suit of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas—which he certainly did look rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner, and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his making those passages across the Channel—though what those affairs were, a consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him, even for his life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been warped and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young lady so thrown together;—with the exception of that reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke. How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it; how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the State Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed (with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions.","At this point, Cruncher had thoroughly sucked the rusty, metallic taste from his fingers as a substitute for lunch while following the testimonies. Now he listened to Mr. Stryver refute the incriminating evidence, as if tailoring a suit to fit the jury; the barrister showed them that the patriot Barsad was actually a paid informant and traitor, a shameless human trafficker, and one of the most malicious individuals since Judas Iscariot - who he even resembled. As for the virtuous servant Cly, he was Barsad's friend and accomplice, no better than him; the barrister demonstrated how these two perjurers had targeted the defendant and plotted to frame him; the defendant, being of French origin, had legitimate reasons to travel frequently between the two countries - matters involving his closest and dearest, which he would not disclose even under threat of death. The barrister proved that the testimony of the young lady, who everyone could see was distressed while testifying, had been distorted and coerced into worthless evidence; her statements were merely polite, impartial exchanges that any gentleman or lady might have, except for the wildly inappropriate comment about George Washington, which could only be seen as a crude joke. The barrister argued that it would be a weakness in governance to undermine efforts to win the affection of subjects through fear and hatred sown among the public, which the Attorney General had exploited to the fullest; however, this had no significance other than the fact that the vile and despicable nature of the evidence often discredited such trials, a fact well-documented in our country's State Trials. But at this point, the judge interrupted (with a stern expression as if the barrister had spoken untruths), declaring that he could not accept such insinuations during the trial.",9.63,9.199,"Mr. Cruncher had eaten all the rust off his fingers as if it were lunch while watching the witnesses. Now he was watching with curiosity as Mr. Stryver fitted the defendant's case onto the jury like a well-tailored suit; he was telling them that the so-called patriot Barsad was a secret spy and traitor, and moreover, a shameless blood merchant, and the greatest traitor since the accursed Judas – to whom he indeed bore a resemblance. He explained that the very virtuous servant Cly was his friend and partner and that he deserved such company; that the fraudsters and false witnesses had chosen the defendant as their victim due to family matters in France, after all, he was of French origin and had to cross the Channel frequently – but these family matters, which concerned those close to him, prevented him from explaining all this, even at the cost of his life. The words forcibly taken and distorted from the young lady meant nothing, and everyone had witnessed how much she suffered while saying them; in that environment, such innocent conversation and courtesy between a young gentleman and lady were very natural; meanwhile, those excessive words about George Washington could be nothing but a bad joke. It would appear as a weakness of the state to halt the attempts to apply the lowest levels of national hatred and fears, so the Attorney General had done his best; but it was to no avail, these disgraceful and vile pieces of evidence frequently tainted such cases, and there were many trials like this in the country. But the courts, which were packed to the brim, should not be occupied with such baseless cases. But there the Judge objected (with a stern expression on his face as if what was being said was not true) and said from his bench that he could not allow these insinuations.",12.356,11.925,"The result of this incident was to annihilate the witness, destroy the effect of his testimony, and strip all value from his statements. The good Jeremiah Lapa, who was following the course of the trial without missing a word or gesture, had to listen as the defense turned the tables on the prosecutor and the witnesses who had served the Jury, saying that the exalted, the sublime patriot Barsad, was a mercenary spy, a vile traitor, a blood trafficker who knew neither decorum nor shame, the blackest-souled reptile that had existed in the world since the accursed Judas, to whom he bore a physical and moral resemblance, dishonored it with his presence. He asserted that the mirror of a servant, the innocent Cly, was a friend and accomplice of Barsad, and certainly worthy of being so, that the ever-watchful eyes of those miserable forgers and perjurers had resolved to turn the prisoner into a victim of their greed, taking advantage of the fact that he, being of French origin, made frequent trips between England and France for family matters he could not explain, and that the prisoner would not explain, even if his silence cost him his life, because high considerations forbade him. He demonstrated that the statements made by Miss Manette, whose anguish in making them everyone had had the opportunity to appreciate, were of no importance, and were nothing more than innocent gallantries, very natural for a young man who encounters a charming girl on a journey, except for the part concerning George Washington, which in his opinion was so extravagant that it could only be considered a wildly inappropriate joke. He added that Justice would show palpable weakness if it persisted in the idea of pursuing a sterile populism by exploiting low antipathies and national fears that the Crown prosecutor had exploited in his report, which, in truth, had no more foundation than the meanness and vileness of a statement whose bad faith was glaringly obvious, a statement made with the deliberate intention of distorting the facts, a statement that tends to make Justice, to our shame, add a most lamentable error to the endless series of those it has committed. The president, as if what the defender had just expressed was not an exact expression of the truth, interrupted the speaker with a grim face, to say, with a grave demeanor, that it was impossible for him to continue occupying his elevated seat if he was forced to tolerate such unpleasant allusions.",6.106,5.561
593,"Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr. Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.","Mr. Stryver then called a few more of his witnesses, and afterward Cruncher attentively listened to the Attorney General turn the suit that Mr. Stryver had dressed the jury in inside out; the Attorney General proved that Barsad and Cly were a hundred times better than he had ever imagined, while the defendant was a hundred times worse. Finally, it was the Chief Judge's turn to turn the suit inside out and right side out, but overall he decided to trim it into a shroud for the defendant.",24.5,23.575,"Then Mr. Stryver called a few more witnesses, and while Mr. Cruncher waited, the Attorney General turned the suit that Mr. Stryver had dressed the jury in inside out; that is, he explained that both Barsad and Cly were much better people than the lawyer had thought, and the defendant was a much worse person. Finally, the Judge turned that suit inside out, then right side out, but in the end, he decisively cut it and fashioned a shroud for the defendant.",15.372,13.566,"The defense attorney questioned the few exculpatory witnesses, and subsequently, the audience had to admire the efforts made by the Crown prosecutor to turn inside out the case that the former had crafted for the Jury. The most striking part of his speech was to assert a thousand times over that the heroic Barsad and Cly were a thousand times more virtuous than initially stated, and the prisoner a thousand times more criminal. In his final report, the president went over and over the case crafted by the prosecutor and tried to undo the seams of the one presented by the defense attorney, showing a clear tendency to prepare the prisoner's shroud with both.",9.116,8.051
594,"And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.",Now it's time for the jury to deliberate and the blue flies swarm and buzz again.,15.497,9.001,"When it came time for the jury members' deliberation, the large flies gathered in the courtroom once again.",11.961,6.893,"The Jury withdrew to deliberate, and the large blue flies once again made their unpleasant buzzing heard.",15.978,10.976
595,"Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court, changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement. While his learned friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him, whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat, and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day. Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness, when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would hardly have thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the observation to his next neighbour, and added, “I’d hold half a guinea that he don’t get no law-work to do. Don’t look like the sort of one to get any, do he?”","Right in this bustling scene, lawyer Carton - who had been sitting and staring at the ceiling - did not change his posture or attitude at all. While his colleague Stryver was gathering the papers in front of him and whispering to those nearby, occasionally glancing anxiously at the jury; while everyone attending the trial was moving and forming new groups to some extent; while even the judge left his seat and slowly paced back and forth on the podium, causing the crowd to suspect that he was feeling impatient; only Carton remained leaning back in his chair, his old robe almost slipping off his shoulders, his disheveled wig haphazardly perched on his head as if protesting being removed earlier, his hands in his pockets, and his eyes still fixed on the ceiling. That very disdainful attitude not only made him appear somewhat disreputable but also diminished the undeniable resemblance to the defendant (a resemblance that was quite clear when he temporarily showed a serious demeanor for comparison), to the extent that many trial spectators now remarked to each other that Carton and the defendant did not look much alike. Cruncher made this observation to the person standing next to him and added: −I'd bet half a guinea that this lawyer doesn't get hired much. Doesn't look like the kind of lawyer who has work to do, right?",13.341,12.886,"Mr. Carton, who had been sitting with his eyes fixed on the ceiling of the hall for hours, had neither changed his position nor his demeanor even in this confusion. His wise friend Mr. Stryver, who was gathering the papers in front of him, was whispering to those beside him while occasionally glancing anxiously at the jury; meanwhile, the Judge had risen from his seat and was pacing up and down the podium, causing the audience to suspect he had a fever; the man sitting back with his torn robe half fallen, his disheveled wig crooked after falling off, and his hands in his pockets still had his eyes on the ceiling. The indifference in his manner not only gave him a disreputable air but also diminished his strong resemblance to the defendant (though the resemblance had increased a moment ago with the seriousness that arose when they were compared), so much so that most of the spectators who noticed him were whispering that they didn't look much alike. Mr. Cruncher was also sharing his observations with the man next to him: ""I bet this man never wins a case. He doesn't look like the type who can win a case, does he?""",16.943,16.562,"The movement, the general murmurs, the anticipation that had taken hold of all the witnesses of the scene, did not cause Mr. Carton, who continued to sit and stare at the ceiling, to change his posture or position. Meanwhile, his friend Mr. Stryver, gathering the papers in front of him, conversed with the people closest to him and from time to time cast anxious glances at the Jury, while all the spectators moved about more or less, sometimes separating, sometimes coming together again, while even the president left his seat to walk around the platform, giving reason for those present to suspect that his state of mind was far from calm, Mr. Carton remained slouched in his seat, with his wig half askew, hands in his pockets, seemingly indifferent to everything and everyone, his eyes fixed on the ceiling as they had been all day. Nevertheless, Mr. Carton noticed more details of the scene unfolding before his eyes than it seemed at first glance. Proof of this is that, when Miss Manette, overwhelmed by so many emotions, fainted into her father's arms, it was Carton who noticed it first and was the first to come to her aid, saying: —Guard!",15.916,15.541
596,"Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette’s head dropped upon her father’s breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly: “Officer! look to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her out. Don’t you see she will fall!”","Yet this Carton, despite appearances, was actually observing everything in the court; because at this moment, when Miss Manette collapsed into her father's arms, he was the first to notice and shouted: −Officer?! Take care of the lady. Help the gentleman take her outside. Can't you see she's about to faint?!",18.199,16.799,"Despite his indifferent appearance, Mr. Carton was watching everything in detail, and when Miss Manette's head fell onto her father's chest, he was the first to see it, and as soon as he saw it, he shouted in a voice that everyone could hear, ""Hey, attendant!

597,"There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much sympathy with her father. It had evidently been a great distress to him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud, ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a moment, spoke, through their foreman.","The crowd felt great sympathy for the girl and compassion for the father as she was taken outside. The father was clearly extremely distressed, having to recall the days of his imprisonment. He was deeply moved when questioned, and from that moment on, he looked significantly older, his face perpetually gloomy and contemplative as if shrouded in dark clouds. As he walked out, the jury turned their faces and took a break so that the foreman could speak to the court.",13.297,11.924,"As the girl was being taken outside, a great sense of pity for her and compassion for her father arose in the hall. It was clear that recalling the prison days had disturbed her greatly. During the interrogation, she felt a deep pain inside, and the pensive and thoughtful demeanor that made her look older had settled over her like a heavy cloud. As she was leaving, the jury members returning to their seats remained silent for a moment, then the jury spokesperson spoke.",10.172,8.108,"Everyone was moved to compassion upon seeing the young lady being taken out of the room, and there was no one who did not extend all their sympathies to the father. The scene, which could not help but remind him of the endless years of his undeserved imprisonment, deeply affected him. A good proof of this was the intense inner agitation that the interrogation caused him, an agitation that did not go unnoticed by anyone. Moments later, the Jury appeared, and through its president, stated that, not having reached an agreement, they wished to withdraw again.",4.785,3.309

The spectators dropped off to get refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat down.","The jury did not have a consensus and wanted to retreat to the deliberation room.

The hearing had lasted all day and it was necessary to light the lamps in the Courtroom.

628,"It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent reason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long lingering agony, would always—as on the trial—evoke this condition from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three hundred miles away.","Under a stronger light source, it might be difficult to recognize Dr. Manette with his intelligent face and upright posture as the shoemaker in the attic in Paris. However, anyone who has once looked closely at him cannot help but look again; even if they do not have the opportunity to hear the melancholy tone in his gentle, solemn voice, or see the occasional absent-minded expression that inexplicably appears on his face. Just like during the trial, any external trigger that reminds him of the years of prolonged suffering would cause that gloomy emotion to resurface from the depths of his soul, but that vacant expression often reveals itself, astonishing those who do not know Dr. Manette's past; as if they are seeing the real Bastille casting its dark shadow on his face under the summer sun, while in reality, that place of imprisonment is three hundred miles away from here.",11.942,11.106,"It was difficult to connect the sharp-faced and upright Doctor Manette with the shoemaker in the attic in Paris, even in a brighter light. But no one could look at his face a second time; the opportunity to observe him did not extend to hearing the mournful harmony of his low and gloomy voice or noticing the occasional absent-mindedness that settled over him like a cloud for no reason. There was always a completely different reason deep within his soul that evoked this feeling – as it was during the trial – something related to his long-standing sorrowful state, but sometimes this feeling arose on its own, and then a sadness that those who did not know his story could never understand enveloped him, as if the shadow of the Bastille, three hundred kilometers away, fell upon him even in that summer sun.",7.941,6.353,"The light was scarce, but even in the brightness of a summer sun, it would have been very difficult to recognize in the serene and intelligent face and upright body of the doctor the cobbler from the garret in Paris. Nevertheless, it was impossible to see him once without feeling an irresistible itch to examine him again, even if the observer had not had the chance to hear the gloomy rhythm of his deep voice, nor noticed the kind of cloud that overshadowed his countenance for no apparent reason. And it was because he did not need external causes to evoke in his soul, as had happened in the Courtroom during the hearing, painful echoes of his past agonies; these arose spontaneously, and when they did, they enveloped him in something like a funeral veil that could not be seen by those who were unaware of his sad story.",11.863,10.926

So very great is the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration.

Men drank a lot, and certainly the luminaries of the forum and the notabilities in any other branch of human knowledge were no exception to the rule, as science has never been a barrier raised between its possessor and the altars of Bacchus.

Both freely used the liquor table, each in their own way; The Lion usually lay on his back, hands hooked into his waistband, eyes gazing at the fireplace or occasionally flipping through a simple file; the Jackal, on the other hand, furrowed his brow, deeply immersed in his work, his eyes not even following his hand as it reached for a glass - the hand often groped around for a minute or more before finding the glass to bring to his lips. Two or three times, when the issue at hand became too difficult, the Jackal was forced to stand up and wet his towel again. After each pilgrimage to the water jug and basin, the Jackal would return with the wet towels draped over his head in an indescribably peculiar manner; looking even more ridiculous with his serious, tense expression.",22.09,21.567,"Then, while the lion leaned back on the sofa next to the liquor table, the jackal went to his own table, which was covered with papers and had wine bottles and glasses right beside it. They both frequently reached for the liquor table but in different styles; the lion usually with his hands resting on his belt, looking at the fire or occasionally shuffling the papers in his hand; the jackal, on the other hand, was so engrossed in his work with a frown and a determined face that his eyes didn't even follow his hand reaching for the glass – thus, he often brought the glass to his lips by feel. Two or three times, the matter at hand became so intricate that the jackal felt the need to get up and put the towels back in the water. He would return from his visits to the pitcher and basin with wet towels wrapped around his head in such a way that it was impossible to describe the oddity, and adding his restless solemnity to this, he looked even more comical.",17.21,16.553,"The lion of the forum lounged on a sofa while the jackal took a chair. On the table, placed between the two, there were bottles and glasses. Both of them resorted to them frequently but in different ways: the lion drank, mostly absorbed or at most glancing indifferently at some unimportant document, but the jackal, with such ardor and enthusiasm, devoted himself to his task that his eyes almost never followed the movement of his hands when they reached for the glass, resulting in him groping for one or two minutes more than four times before finding the glass and bringing it to his lips. On two or three occasions, he must have found the matter he was studying so convoluted that he considered it necessary to get up from the chair and dampen the towels again.",7.58,6.193
732,"At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution, made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The jackal then invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal; this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.","Finally, the Jackal gathered a full meal to offer to the Lion. The Lion carefully received it, meticulously selecting the meat from the bones and giving his comments to the Jackal. After the meal was thoroughly savored in that manner, the Lion hooked his hands into his waistband and lay down to ponder. The Jackal then restored his strength with a full glass of wine poured down his throat, a new wet cloth applied to his head, and continued to prepare the second meal; this meal was again offered to the Lion as before, and was only fully digested when the clock struck three in the morning.",20.494,19.612,"In the end, the jackal prepared a hearty meal for the lion and placed it in front of him. After the lion examined it with great care and caution, he made comments by making selections from it, while the jackal assisted him. After the matter was thoroughly discussed, the lion again put his hands on his belt and lay down, lost in thoughts. Then the jackal downed a glass filled to the brim to clear his head and prepared the second meal; this meal was also presented to the lion in the same manner, and when they were done, the clock showed three in the morning.",24.353,23.609,"After a while, the jackal managed to prepare an acceptable meal for the lion and proceeded to offer it to him. The lion tried to digest it carefully and with exquisite precautions, separating some delicacies, dispensing with some components, and making judicious observations, which seemed agreeable to the jackal. Having digested the meal, the lion lay down on the sofa, while the jackal, after revitalizing himself again with libations and cold water compresses, dedicated himself to the preparation of the second meal, which was served to the lion in the same manner as the previous one.

769,"The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived, on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor’s friend, and the quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.","6. Layer upon layer, the quiet house of Dr. Manette lay on a quiet street not far from Soho Square. On a beautiful Sunday afternoon, when the waves of time had swept away the memories of the treason trial four months ago into the sea of public forgetfulness, Mr. Jarvis Lorry strolled along the sunlit streets from his home in Clerkenwell to Dr. Manette's house for dinner. After several instances of his habitual dedication to work, Mr. Lorry became close to the doctor, and this quiet street became a bright part of his life.",19.06,17.94,"Doctor Manette's Quiet House was at the corner of a quiet street just beyond Soho Square. Four months had passed since the treason trial, and the matter had drifted out of the public's interest and memory into the open seas, when Mr. Lorry, on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, walked along the sunny streets from his home in Clerkenwell to dine with the Doctor. Having come together many times for business, Mr. Lorry and the Doctor had become friends, and that quiet street corner had become a sunny part of his life.",24.139,23.219,"Dr. Manette resided in one of the city's quietest streets, not far from Soho Square. On a delightful Sunday afternoon, when the eternal waves of four months had passed over the criminal case for treason, relegating it to oblivion and dragging it out to sea to regions beyond public interest and memory, Mr. Maurice Lorry was striding briskly through the sunlit streets between Clerkenwell, where he lived, and the doctor's house, where he was to dine that evening. It is well for readers to know that Lorry, after several periods of complete withdrawal and total absorption in business, had eventually become an intimate friend of the doctor and saw the quiet street where he lived as the most delightful oasis of his life.",16.599,15.679
770,"On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie; secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the Doctor’s household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them.","That beautiful Sunday afternoon, Mr. Lorry took a walk to Soho quite early for three familiar reasons. The first was that on beautiful Sundays, he usually took a walk with the doctor and Lucie before the meal; the second was that on Sundays with bad weather, he was accustomed to visiting like a family member, chatting, reading books, looking out the window, passing the time; the third was that he happened to have some difficult matters to resolve, and he was so familiar with the doctor's family that he knew this time was the best to think.",16.261,15.279,"On this beautiful Sunday, Mr. Lorry had three reasons for making it a habit to walk towards Soho in the afternoon: First, on such lovely Sundays, he would generally go for a walk with the Doctor and Lucie before dinner; Second, on unpleasant Sundays, he had gotten used to spending the whole day with them as a family friend, chatting, reading books, watching outside from the window, in short, spending time with them in this manner; Third, when he had small problems that needed to be resolved in his mind, the Doctor's house was the best place to solve them.",16.202,14.967,"Three very important reasons were driving Mr. Lorry, on this delightful Sunday, towards Soho Square in the early afternoon. First: because before lunch, he almost always used to go for a walk accompanying the doctor and his daughter Lucia. Second, because on Sunday afternoons, if it was not very pleasant, he would spend it with them, as a family friend, talking, reading, looking out the window, and constantly moving around, and third, because he wanted to resolve some intricate doubts, and he knew that nowhere was it as likely that he would find the solution as in the doctor's house.",16.85,15.821
771,"A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be found in London. There was no way through it, and the front windows of the Doctor’s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then, north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom, instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which the peaches ripened in their season.","In London, there was no better corner than the corner of Dr. Manette's house. It was a cul-de-sac, and from the front windows of this house, one could overlook a small, peaceful street very suitable for a reclusive lifestyle. At that time, there were still few houses north of Oxford Street, so tall trees grew like a forest, wildflowers bloomed everywhere, and hawthorns blossomed on the vacant lands that no longer exist now. Therefore, the countryside wind freely rushed into Soho vigorously, not sluggishly like a homeless beggar wandering into the parish*; not far to the south, the peach trees with trellises bore ripe fruit every season.",9.851,8.501,"There was no corner in London stranger than the one where the Doctor lived. No road passed through there; the front windows of the Doctor's house overlooked a part of the street that had a pleasant air of seclusion. At that time, there were very few buildings north of Oxford Road, and everywhere was covered with large trees, overgrown wildflowers, and blooming hawthorns; now, none of those fields remain. Later, instead of wandering around like vagrant poor people without a home, this rural air took its freedom and blew freely in Soho; and nearby, there was a beautiful wall where peaches ripened when the season came.",13.946,12.819,"There was no more picturesque corner in all of London than the one where the doctor lived. Isolated from the main arteries of the city, there was hardly any traffic, and from the balconies at the front of the house, one could enjoy beautiful views that bore the stamp of tranquility. The buildings were very scarce, and even more so towards the north of Oxford Road, in whose now vanished expansive fields, delightful groves stood, colorful flowers grew spontaneously, saturating the air with fragrant emanations, and lovely buds sprouted from the white hawthorns and the hawthorns. As a result, the air circulated freely around Soho, whose inhabitants were not compelled to breathe the mephitic and poisonous atmosphere of the great centers where the poor suffocate and the rich languish. Near the doctor's balconies, there was more than one pear tree, whose fruits ripened in due time.",6.875,5.432
772,"The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow, though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.","The summer sun shines on this corner of the street from early morning; but as the roads heat up, this corner remains in the shade, not so shaded as to be glaring when looking out into the sunlight. It is a cool, quiet yet cheerful place, a perfect spot for reminiscing; truly a haven away from the storms of the bustling city.",5.899,3.454,"In the early hours of the day, the rays of the summer sun would shine brightly on the corner; but when the streets heated up, a shadow would fall on the corner, though it wasn't a very dense shadow, you could see the brilliance just a bit further away. It was a cool corner, dignified yet cheerful, a wonderful place for the echoing of sounds, like a harbor to escape and take refuge from the angry streets.",19.829,18.487,"The rays of the summer sun radiantly penetrated that delightful retreat in the early hours of the day, but when they burned, when they turned the other districts of the city into a scorching oven, the little corner remained enveloped in shadows, although these were not so deep that they couldn't be penetrated by the brilliant glows of a distant sun. It was, in a word, a cool, calm, and tranquil place, yet pleasant, a sheltered harbor against the roar and bustling agitation of the streets.",6.656,5.01
773,"There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall—as if he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.","In such a harbor, there must be a ship peacefully anchored, and indeed there was. Dr. Manette's house occupied two floors in a large, solid building, surrounded during the day by many professional establishments that were almost silent, and at night, they all ceased operations. Across a courtyard rustling with the sound of elm leaves was a house with a shop inside that made church organs, silver engravings, and even gold leafing; on the wall of this house, right in front of the main door, instead of a sign, there was a large golden arm symbol, as if some mysterious giant inside had gilded his entire body and thrust his arm out to threaten to turn everyone passing by into precious metals. It was rare to see or hear the people working these trades, or the lodger rumored to live upstairs, or the dark-faced man who upholstered carriage seats and insisted he had a shop on the ground floor. Occasionally, a stray worker in a coat would pass through the hall, or a stranger would appear, occasionally there would be the faint clinking sound from across the courtyard, or the thumping of the golden giant. But these were just exceptions that proved the rule that from Sunday morning to Saturday night, this place was dominated by the birds in the elm trees behind the house and the quiet echoes from the street corner in front.",14.073,13.526,"There must have been a calm ship anchored in such a harbor, and indeed there was. The doctor had settled on the two floors of a large and quiet house; many visitors came and went throughout the day, but they made little noise, and at night, not a sound was heard. It was said that a church organ was being made, silver was being crafted, and gold was being hammered by a mysterious giant figure in a building at the back, reached through a courtyard with a plane tree rustling its green leaves; the man had hung a golden arm on the wall of the entrance hall as if he had forged himself out of gold, thus intimidating the visitors. No one had ever seen or heard of the solitary tenant said to live upstairs, or the thick-headed car decorator who was claimed to have an accounting office downstairs. Occasionally, a stray worker would don his jacket and pace from one corner of the courtyard to the other; sometimes a stranger would be seen, and sometimes there would be a clatter from somewhere beyond the courtyard or thumping sounds from the giant man hammering gold. But these were merely exceptions that emphasized the rule that the sparrows perched on the plane tree behind the house and the echoes heard from the corner dominated this place from Sunday morning to Saturday night.",17.741,17.25,"An ideal anchorage was inconceivable without a tranquil boat, and indeed, it had one. The doctor occupied two floors of a rather spacious house, at whose doors many knocked during the night, requesting services to be rendered the following day. At the back of the house, separated from it by a courtyard in the center of which grew a wild banana tree, there was a building where church organs were manufactured, and a mysterious giant chiseled silver and hammered gold, whose powerful arm seemed to emerge from the wall, casting golden flashes, as if the arm itself were made of gold and threatened to turn into gold all those who visited that place. Hardly did these industries make the slightest noise, very rarely was a solitary visitor seen arriving, and even more rarely did a carriage cross those peaceful spots. It was true that from time to time a worker could be seen crossing the courtyard while putting on his jacket, or an unknown person drawn by curiosity, or the distant echo of a hammer blow from the golden giant would strike the ears, but these were the only exceptions, always necessary to prove the rule that this was the corner of echoes, the center of rest and silence, interrupted only by the chirping of sparrows that had their headquarters in the top of the wild banana tree.",11.863,11.288

Simple as the furniture was, it was set off by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy, that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours, the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him, with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time, whether he approved?","Although the doctor's daughter knew nothing about her native country, she seemed to have inherently inherited from her father's homeland the ability to adapt maximally in minimal conditions - one of the most useful and best characteristics of the French people.

""The moment you push a little, it gets worse. The best thing is to leave him alone. In short, whether we like it or not, we must leave him alone. Sometimes in the middle of the night, he gets out of bed, and we hear him above us, pacing back and forth, back and forth in his room. My little bird then understands that her father, in his mind, is pacing back and forth, back and forth in his prison cell. She immediately runs to her father's side, and then the two of them continue to walk back and forth in the room together, until her father calms down. But he doesn't say a word to his daughter about the real reason for his restlessness, and his daughter doesn't even touch on the subject. In silence, they go back and forth, back and forth together, until the Doctor regains his composure with his daughter's love and support.""",13.969,13.276,"—Evil, if it truly is evil, has no remedy—replied Miss Pross, shaking her head. —Touch that string, and the results will be counterproductive; so, it is better to remain silent. How many times, in the late hours of the night, he jumps out of bed and begins to pace agitatedly, up and down, up and down, through his room! Miss knows by now that when this happens, her father's imagination is pacing up and down, up and down, through the dungeon that served as his tomb for so many years. She then runs to her father's room and, standing by his side, paces with him up and down, up and down, until she is convinced he has calmed down. But the doctor never explains the cause of his unrest, and his daughter never asks him. The two of them pace together up and down, up and down, without uttering a word, until the presence of his daughter, and the blind love she has for him, bring the doctor back to himself.",18.918,18.369

841,"Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking off her darling’s bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her—which last she only dared to do playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too, beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of Miss Pross’s prediction.","Ms. Pross looked fierce, aggressive, and intense, but she was truly endearing when she removed Lucie's bonnet as her beloved mistress went upstairs, then she dusted the bonnet with a few handkerchiefs, placed Lucie's cloak aside, and brushed Lucie's magnificent hair with utmost pride as if it were her own hair and she were the most beautiful and proud woman in the world. Equally endearing was the sight of Lucie hugging her caretaker to thank her and then playfully protesting that she had gone to too much trouble for her beloved mistress - Lucie only dared to protest in a playful manner, otherwise Ms. Pross would be hurt and retreat to her room to cry. The doctor also seemed pleased as he watched the scene and told Ms. Pross that she spoiled Lucie too much, with a tone and look that were just as indulgent as the caretaker's, and if he could, he would spoil her even more. Mr. Lorry was also pleased, his face brightening under his wig, and he silently thanked his single fate in his later years for leading him to find a family.

Her dear little one also looked very pleasant as she hugged Miss Pross, thanked her, and said she was sorry for causing her so much trouble. The young girl had said her last words half-jokingly, otherwise Miss Pross would have been terribly upset, locked herself in her room, and cried. The doctor also looked very pleasant as he watched them and told Miss Pross how much she spoiled Lucie. However, at that moment, both his speech and his eyes were at least as indulgent as Miss Pross's, and if possible, he would have spoiled her even more. Mr. Lorry, with his small wig on his head, also looked very pleasant as he watched all this with laughing eyes and thanked his fortune for providing a Home that illuminated his world at this advanced age. But not hundreds of people had come to see these beauties, and Mr. Lorry looked around in vain to see if Miss Pross's prediction would come true.",13.291,12.716,"It was charming to see Miss Pross, despite her ugliness, her bright red color, and her frowning expression, hurrying to take off her lady's hat as she climbed the stairs; how, to avoid staining it, she wrapped her fingers with a handkerchief, how she tried to remove the dust by blowing on it, how she fluffed her splendid blonde hair with as much pride and satisfaction as she would have done with her own, assuming she had been the most beautiful and vain woman in creation. It was also charming to see the lady hugging her maid, thanking her and protesting against so much attention and work, though protesting with a smile on her lips, for if she did not, Miss Pross, deeply hurt, would have retired to her room to spend the day crying. It was no less charming to see the doctor gazing at them with rapture and to hear him tell Miss Pross that she was spoiling Lucie with so much attention and care, but with such a sweet tone and tender look that it was enough, and even more than enough, to spoil Miss Pross and a hundred more like her, and finally, it was also charming to see Mr. Lorry adjusting his wig and mentally thanking his lucky star that, if it made him a confirmed bachelor, it allowed him to glimpse, in his old age, the pure joys of a home. Everything was charming, but the hundreds of people who were supposed to revolve around Lucie were nowhere to be seen, and Mr. Lorry waited in vain for Miss Pross's prophecy to come true.",12.314,11.832

Her dinners, of a very modest quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be better. Miss Pross’s friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress, or Cinderella’s Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit, a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she pleased.","It's mealtime, yet no groups or classes are arriving. In the organization of this small family, the kitchen work was the responsibility of Miss Pross, and she managed it perfectly single-handedly. Although not luxurious, the meals she cooked were very skillful and beautifully presented, consisting of very delicately prepared dishes, half English and half French, extremely delicious. Very practically, Miss Pross expressed her affection through her cooking skills; she scoured Soho and the surrounding areas in search of poor French immigrants and, with shillings and half-crowns, persuaded them to share their cooking secrets. From these sons and daughters of Gaul, she learned wonderful cooking tips to the extent that the two maids, one old and one young, in the house viewed her as nothing less than a witch or the fairy godmother of Cinderella - who would send them to fetch a chicken, a rabbit, or some vegetables from the garden and transform them into anything at will.",17.567,16.928,"Dinner time had arrived, but there were still hundreds of people missing. The organization of household chores on the lower floors was under Miss Pross's management, and she had always handled this task admirably until now. The modest meals were always so delicious, so beautifully served, and the dishes of the semi-English, semi-French cuisine were so nicely prepared that it was hard to find better ones. Resourceful Miss Pross, whose friendships were based on mutual benefit, had turned the neighborhoods of Soho and its surroundings upside down to find poor French people, from whom she learned all sorts of kitchen secrets in exchange for a few pennies. She had learned such amazing tips from the destitute children of the Gauls that the woman and young girl working at home almost saw Miss Pross as a sorceress or the fairy godmother of Cinderella – the one who sent them poultry, rabbit, or a few vegetables from the garden and transformed them into whatever she wished.",7.004,5.594,"The time to sit at the table had come, but the hundreds were not arriving. In the distribution of household chores, Miss Pross had reserved the scepter of the lower regions of the house for herself, and it must be confessed that she wielded it marvelously. It was impossible to bring her meals, modest in themselves, to a greater degree of perfection, but they were admirably cooked and even more admirably served, according to a taste that was half French and half English. Since Miss Pross's dedication was eminently practical, she had scoured every corner of Soho and the adjacent territories in search of poor French people who, tempted by the cheerful jingle of shillings and half-crowns, revealed to her all the mysteries of the culinary art. She learned so many wonderful skills from those sons and daughters of Gaul that the woman and the girl who made up the household staff saw her as a sorceress, a grandmother of Cinderella capable of taking a chicken, a rabbit, or a couple of potatoes in her hands and turning them into whatever dish she fancied.",15.551,14.893

The young girl, acting as Mr. Lorry's attendant, had settled under the tree a bit earlier than the others, and when they all arrived and started chatting, she continued to refill Mr. Lorry's empty glass. While they were talking, the mysterious houses around them secretly watched them, and the plane tree whispered something of its own from above.",7.342,5.805,"It was a day of scorching heat, in view of which, at dessert, Miss Lucía proposed going to drink the wine under the wild plane tree in the courtyard, where they could enjoy a more pleasant atmosphere. As everyone was eager to please the spoiled one of the house, they immediately went out to the courtyard and took a seat under the plane tree, where Lucía, who for some time had assigned herself the role of Mr. Lorry's cupbearer, poured the wine.

They were done with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand. At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been.

The prevailing sentence in his order (the only difference from the original sentence was a pronoun, nothing much) was this: ""The earth and everything in it is mine,"" says the Monsignor.",11.1,9.621,"The gentleman had a most noble idea about public affairs in general, which was that they should be allowed to follow their natural course, and another idea, no less noble, about private affairs... that they too should follow their natural course; and the natural course of the former, like the natural course of the latter, was to go straight into the gentleman's hands and pocket. As for pleasures, both general and private, the gentleman believed that the world had been created for him to enjoy them, and man placed in it for that purpose. His motto was the following: ""The world and all it contains is mine, says the Lord.""",5.606,4.325
886,"Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General, poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer rooms, much prostrated before by mankind—always excepting superior mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt.","However, the Lord gradually found that many unpleasant mundane matters had infiltrated his grand affairs, both public and private; and for both of these grand affairs, he was forced to associate with a lowly tax collector.* Regarding public finances, he knew nothing and had to rely on someone knowledgeable; regarding private finances, after many generations of extravagant waste, he too gradually became impoverished and thus needed the very wealthy tax collectors. Therefore, the Lord timely took his sister out of the convent before she could don the waiting nun’s veil, the cheapest attire - and bestowed her like a treasure upon a wealthy but lowly tax collector. This tax collector, holding a staff with a golden apple on top befitting his status, is currently sitting with the guests in the outer room, looking down on humanity who bow and scrape - only the superior humanity of the Lord’s lineage, including his wife, always regard him with utmost disdain.",8.627,7.722,"Bishop Monsignor had noticed that the people's troubles were gradually infiltrating both their public and private relationships, and therefore, he had inevitably been forced to collaborate with the Tax Farmers to resolve matters of both kinds. Since Monsignor was incapable of handling financial matters in the social sphere, he had delegated these tasks to a Tax Farmer; the reason for entrusting them with his private financial affairs was that Monsignor had been becoming increasingly impoverished after years of all the splendor and wealth. The Tax Farmers, on the other hand, were wealthy. For this reason, just before Monsignor was about to don the cheapest attire he could wear, the nun's habit, he took his sister out of the convent and gave her to a Tax Farmer whose family was poor but who himself was very rich. This Tax Farmer, who had previously been scorned by the nobility, now found himself among those staying in the outer rooms of the hotel with a staff topped with a golden apple, and since he always acknowledged the superiority of the blood running through his veins, he did not object to Monsignor and even his own blood relatives looking down on him with the most arrogant attitudes.",7.051,6.118,"Despite his opinions, the gentleman had seen, with natural displeasure, that in his affairs and pleasures, both private and public, the most vulgar annoyances had come to mix in, which inevitably created difficulties and troubles, also of the most vulgar kind, in view of which, he decided to ally himself with a general steward, a resolution all the wiser as it had become indispensable, and this, for two main reasons. First: because the gentleman did not understand such vulgar matters as those related to public finance, and consequently, he had to entrust them to hands that understood them, and second, related to private finance, because general stewards are wealthy, while the gentleman, a descendant of lords who lived many generations of splendid luxury and pomp, was impoverishing day by day. Hence, the gentleman saved his sister from the veil that threatened her, and which was the most economical wedding trousseau he could gift her, and granted her as a precious prize to a general steward, as rich in goods as he was poor in family. This general steward, armed with a staff crowned by a golden apple, figured in the present occasion among the characters that filled the outer rooms and played a somewhat awkward role because the gentleman, and even the gentleman's wife, used to look at him with the deepest contempt.",8.402,7.624
887,"A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could, the Farmer-General—howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality—was at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.","This tax collector is so wealthy. In his stable, there are thirty horses; in his household, there are twenty-four male servants, and his wife alone has six maids serving her. Boasting that he does nothing but rob and steal whenever and wherever he can, this tax collector, despite becoming noble through marriage - at least, was the most honest person among those present at the Lord's mansion that day.",6.62,4.625,"The tax farmer was a very extravagant person. He had thirty horses in his stables, twenty-four servants in his house, and six maids serving his wife. This tax farmer, who did nothing but plunder and raid at every opportunity, was at least the greatest reality among the personalities at the Monseigneur's hotel that day.",23.914,22.68,"The general overseer was a man of the utmost sumptuousness imaginable. Thirty horses occupied his stables, twenty-four servants awaited orders in his halls, and six maids helped dress his wife. In his capacity as a man whose sole mission was to plunder and loot wherever he could, the general overseer was at least the most tangible reality among the characters who were on duty in the lord's halls that day.",19.286,17.534
888,"For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business—if that could have been anybody’s business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship; civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives; all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State, yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time—and has been since—to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur—forming a goodly half of the polite company—would have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world—which does not go far towards the realisation of the name of mother—there was no such thing known to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close, and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty.","Although these rooms, despite being splendid and luxurious with the most beautiful and exquisite decorations of the time, were in fact not a safe haven if one considered the ragged and destitute people in other places (not far away, but from the two towers of Notre-Dame Cathedral, one could see both the magnificent mansion and the poor neighborhood at nearly the same distance); this ragged crowd must have been a very worrying concern if anyone in the Lord's mansion cared about it, but no one did. The generals were clueless about military matters; the naval commanders were not familiar with ships; the officials did not know how to govern; the worst of all were the brazen clergy, with lustful eyes and deceitful tongues, living even more deceitfully; no one was capable of handling responsibilities, all of them lied shamelessly to match their titles, but all of them, whether near or far, belonged to the high-ranking officials like the Lord, thus being secretly inserted into any public service where they could profit from anything; this group numbered in the dozens, not a few. Equally abundant in this mansion were those who had no direct relationship with the Lord or the nation, but also had no connection to anything honest, or those who lived their entire lives deceitfully to achieve all sorts of petty goals. The doctors, getting rich by prescribing all sorts of expensive medications for imaginary diseases that don't actually exist, are smiling at the court patients in the reception rooms of the Lord's mansion. The advisors, who suggest various treatment methods for trivial national issues but fail to invent any serious solutions to eradicate a single root cause, are whispering insane babble into the ears of anyone they can catch in the reception rooms of the Lord's mansion. The godless philosophers who want to reform the world with their mouths and use the card of building sky-high towers are chatting with the faithless alchemists who want to turn metals into gold at the fascinating gatherings convened by the Lord. The elite aristocrats - famous then as now for their indifference to all matters that naturally concern humanity - are also in their most typical state of apathy at the Lord's mansion. And right within the families of the various distinguished and noble houses of this Parisian elite, the spies - making up half of the courteous guests devotedly gathering at the Lord's mansion - would find it hard to spot among their angelic ladies a single wife whose appearance and demeanor suggest she has ever been a mother. Indeed, aside from the act of bringing into the world a troublesome being - which is not enough to be called motherhood - there is nothing to indicate that this aristocratic class knows anything about being mothers. The peasant wet nurses hide and raise the untimely born infants, while their charming sixty-year-old ladies dress up like youthful maidens.",5.428,4.803,"Although the rooms looked pleasant and were furnished with all the decorative objects available at the time, they were actually quite unsuitable. Compared to the shabby-looking and nightcap-wearing wretches elsewhere (they were not so far apart, as both of Notre Dame's watchtowers, equidistant to both sides, could be seen), it created a rather disturbing environment – of course, it was not anyone's place to say this about Monsignor's house! Officers lacking military knowledge; naval officers who knew nothing about ships; civil servants who understood no work; the most worldly and impudent clergymen with fiery eyes, drooping tongues, and disheveled lives, none of them were suitable for these jobs, but they acted as if they belonged there and were all part of Monsignor's order, so they were rushed into any job involving money, while they looked at the money they collected. People were as disconnected from real things as they were attached to Monsignor or the State, and honest people who had set themselves on a true path were as rare as a finger could count. Doctors who made great fortunes from the marvelous medicines they prepared for imaginary illnesses smiled at the distinguished patients in Monsignor's ground floor rooms. Planners who produced all sorts of solutions to the minor filth the State was involved in, other than setting out to clean them up from the root, whispered into every ear they could reach at Monsignor's reception. Faithless Philosophers who reshaped the world with words and built a Tower of Babel from playing cards to scrape the sky were conversing with faithless Chemists who had set their sights on the transformation of metals at this magnificent gathering organized by Monsignor. In that extraordinary era – and afterwards – gentlemen from the most well-mannered families, known for their indifference to every matter concerning mankind, sat as epitomes of exhaustion in Monsignor's hotel. These famous individuals had left behind such houses in the beautiful world of Paris that among Monsignor's admirers gathered there – who made up at least half of this polite community – spies would find it difficult to discover a wife among the angels in those houses who, in both manner and appearance, would be fit to become a Mother. Indeed, these women's connection to motherhood was limited to bringing into the world a troublesome creature who did not even know their mothers' names. Peasant women would not separate their ragged babies from their sides and would raise them that way; while sixty-year-old charming grandmothers dressed and behaved as if they were twenty.",8.756,8.432,"To tell the truth, in those halls, which offered delightful scenes to the eyes, in those halls, where they had accumulated everything that the art and taste of the time could produce, business was not going well, moreover: both when considered with reference to the scarecrows that surrounded the lord's person, and regarding the ragged ones who swarmed everywhere, matters were taking a rather unsettling turn... assuming that in the lord's house there was someone who cared about matters. Military men who were ignorant of what military science was, sailors who had no idea what a ship was, clergymen, covered in silks and lace, worldly to the inconceivable, with sensual eyes, free tongues, and customs freer than their tongues, in a word: ineptitude in those who held positions, debauchery in customs, lies on every lip. No less abundant were the people who, despite having no relation, remote or close, with the lord or the State, were obstinate in having no relation with anything real and just, and in not walking the journey of life on straight paths, nor pursuing an honorable earthly goal. Doctors who amassed immense fortunes pretending to cure imaginary diseases and ailments that had never existed, mocked their courtly clients from the sanctity of their homes, while the latter broke their backs making bows in the lord's halls. Projectors who, if they never found the remedy for the slightest sin, instead discovered daily universal panaceas with sure effects to correct the minor ills affecting the health of the State, annoyed with their endless and heavy speeches all those who attended the lord's receptions and had ears to listen to them. Atheist philosophers who aimed to cast new molds with their words to forge a new world, and erect new Towers of Babel to scale the heavens, conferred in the lord's halls with disbelieving chemists or alchemists, who pursued no other objective than the transmutation of metals. In the lord's palace, hordes of gentlemen with distinguished manners and exquisite education vegetated, sunk in the most exemplary state of enervation, whose natural fruits at that time, and have continued to be since then, were an invincible indifference, and a notable repugnance towards everything that should be the natural objective of human interest. In the homes that those brilliant notabilities left abandoned in the most aristocratic neighborhoods of Paris, the spies who frequented the lord's halls, to whose number belonged, by the way, at least half of those who courted him, would have hardly been able to find among the angels of their social class a woman who, by her customs, deserved the honor of being a mother. It is true that fashion did not allow mothers anything other than the material act of bringing a helpless creature into the world, which certainly is not much to do. It is acceptable that peasant women spend their lives beside their tender children: women born in another sphere must brighten the halls, and even when they are grandmothers, they must dress and dance as when they were twenty years old.",10.903,10.622
889,"The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the spot—thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the Future, for Monseigneur’s guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a jargon about “the Centre of Truth:” holding that Man had got out of the Centre of Truth—which did not need much demonstration—but had not got out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre, by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much discoursing with spirits went on—and it did a world of good which never became manifest.","This artificial quality is like a leprosy that deforms everyone present in the Lord's mansion. In the outer rooms, about half a dozen extraordinary people have vaguely feared over the past few years that the general situation would deteriorate. As a prospect for improving the situation, three out of these six people joined the Kinh Phong sect of shamanism*, and right there they even considered whether they should foam at the mouth; scream loudly and stiffen up on the spot - doing so to gain clairvoyance to guide the future of their Lord. Unlike these epileptic followers; the other three rushed into another sect that specialized in solving problems with a mysterious incantation about the “Center of Truth”, which claimed that humans had strayed from the Center of Truth - a point that needed little proof - but had not yet left the Periphery, and could be pulled back into the Center through fasting and contacting spirits. Therefore, these three had many discussions with spirits, thereby accomplishing many wonderful things that no one ever saw.",7.771,6.788,"The leprosy of unreality had crippled all the people around the Monsignor. In the outermost room, there were half a dozen privileged men who had felt for the past few years that something was going wrong. In the hope of setting the country in order, half of these half dozen people had joined a fanatical sect called the Convukionists, and even then, among themselves, they were discussing raging, getting angry, roaring, and remaining indifferent to the matter – thus trying to put a clear signpost to show the Monsignor the path to the Future. Outside of these Dervishes, three more people had turned in another direction to correct the course with the jargon of the ""Center of Truth"": the human not from the Circle. They were saying that it had emerged from the Center of Truth – there was no need for much evidence and it should be prevented from flying out of the Circle, even pushed back into that Center by fasting and sending off souls. Thus, the conversation with the souls continued – and if it worked, its benefit never became apparent.",12.015,11.32,"The leprosy of fiction disfigured all the human beings who served the lord. In one of the most remote rooms, there were half a dozen people who, exceptionally, for some years had been believing that things were generally following dangerous paths. Half of this half dozen exceptional people, in their eagerness to remedy the evils, had joined the fantastic sect of the so-called convulsionists, and spent their time deliberating whether it would be convenient for them to foam at the mouth, rage, roar, bellow, and become cataleptic, thus presenting before the lord's eyes a vision of the futures that could serve as a sure guide. Besides these dervishes, there were three others who had formed another sect whose objective was to straighten the tortuous course of events through convoluted theories about ""The Center of Truth,"" maintaining that man had sprouted from this center... which needed no demonstration, but had exited the circumference, and that it was necessary to make him re-enter it and prevent him from exceeding its perimeter in the future, which would be achieved by invigorating the life of the spirit and weakening that of the flesh. As they never spoke of anything but spirits and incorporeal substances, it is not surprising that their speeches did not yield material results.",12.494,11.886
890,"But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells; and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and his devouring hunger far away.","But the pleasant thing is that all the guests in the lord's magnificent mansion are dressed beautifully. If the Last Judgment were to judge by attire, then everyone here would surely be eternally innocent. Behold the curly, powdered, and towering hairstyles; the delicate skin cared for and adorned with makeup; the majestic swords that captivate the eyes; the exquisite fragrances that honor the sense of smell; these things will surely keep the world perpetually turning. The refined gentlemen, the most elite lineage, wore small dangling jewelry that jingled as they sluggishly moved; those golden shackles chimed like precious little bells; and that chiming sound, along with the rustling of silk, brocade, and fabrics, stirred up a breeze that swept away the image of Saint Antoine and the starving neighborhood named after that saint.",11.902,10.918,"But the good thing was that everyone at Monsignor's grand hotel was impeccably dressed. If judgments were made based on attire, everyone in the hall would be acquitted forever. Curly, pure white, and upright hair, delicate skins preserved and beautified by artificial means, dazzling brave swords, and pleasant fragrances that filled the surroundings were enough to make many things last forever. On the polite gentlemen from the most well-mannered families, small ornaments that jingled lazily as they moved were hanging; these golden chains made sounds like precious little bells; this sound and the rustle of the fabric, a mix of silk, brocade, and linen, caused a commotion in the air that spread to St. Antoine and drove away its ravenous hunger.",10.475,9.416,"On the other hand, the people who frequented the gentleman's salons dressed admirably, which is no small consolation. If Judgment Day is to be simply and plainly a fashion show, where prizes are awarded to the best-dressed, it is quite certain that the fortunate individuals who inspire these lines will dress for eternity with impeccable taste and exceptional richness. The laborious hairstyles of those heads, so artistically curled and tastefully powdered, those delicate faces, defended against the ravages of time, and even amended and corrected thanks to commendable artificial means, the finely chiseled swords worn by the gentlemen, which delighted the eye in their contemplation, the fine and delicate perfumes that embalmed the air and delighted one of the senses with which the Creator pleased to endow man, were sufficient resources to eradicate the ills that afflicted humanity from the root and forever. The gentlemen of high lineage and refined education displayed a prodigious profusion of rich gold jewelry that emitted a delightful tinkling in time with their languid steps, and before the tinkling of gold and the rustling of silk and brocade, hunger and misery had no choice but to hide their sallow faces in the foul-smelling poor neighborhoods of the city.",4.059,3.042

Monsieur Paris, following the fashion among his bishop brothers in the provinces, Monsieur Orleans and others, always appeared in this elegant attire during executions at the gallows and torture wheels –the axe was seldom used.

No! It is not possible that any of the fortunate mortals who attended the fortnightly reception given by the lord in the year seventeen eighty would question the durability of a system founded on such a solid base as an exquisitely combed, artistically curled, solicitously powdered executioner, adorned with a rich gold-braided frock coat and exquisite silk stockings.",5.973,4.778

897,"He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose, beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a handsome face, and a remarkable one.","He was around sixty years old, dressed elegantly, with an arrogant demeanor and a face like a finely crafted mask. His face was pale, almost translucent, with well-proportioned and expressive features. Although his nose was delicate, it flared slightly at the nostrils. Only at the flared nostrils did his face reveal any hint of changing emotions. At times, that area would change color, occasionally contracting and expanding as if something was gently pulsing; during those moments, the tip of his nose gave his entire face an air of treachery and cruelty. Upon closer inspection, this expression was accentuated by his overly thin and flat mouth and eyes; nevertheless, the overall impression of his face remained extraordinarily beautiful.",4.464,3.338,"He was a man in his sixties, elegantly dressed, with arrogant manners, and a face that resembled a delicate mask. There was a transparent pallor to his face; all his features were distinct and his expression was stern. His nose had a very beautiful shape, but it was slightly flattened over the nostrils. The only thing that altered the expression on the man's face were these two flattened points, these two depressions. Sometimes they would change color persistently, sometimes they would expand and contract like a faint pulse; then they would impart a treacherous and cruel expression to the entire face. Upon close inspection, it could be seen that the source of this expression was his mouth, which appeared as a line due to being overly horizontal and thin, and his half-closed eyes; yet his face had a pleasant and striking air.",7.028,5.618,"He was a man of about sixty years, richly dressed, with haughty gestures and expression, and endowed with a face that, more than a human countenance, seemed like a fine mask. A face of transparent pallor, all its lines, all its features appeared perfectly defined. The nose, artistically shaped, had the peculiarity that its two nostrils showed a very slight contraction towards the upper part. In those two contractions lay, precisely, the only visible alteration in that face. The nostrils sometimes remained contracted, while on some occasions, dilations followed contractions, but in either case, they gave the face an unpleasant expression of cruelty and perfidy. Upon careful examination of that face, it was not difficult to observe that the expression of cruelty was due to the lines of his mouth and the excessively fine and horizontal eye sockets. It cannot be denied, however, that that face was extraordinarily beautiful.",17.186,16.571
898,"Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age, that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could.","The owner of that face descended the stairs, went out to the yard, got into the carriage, and set off. During the reception, few people talked to him; he stood somewhat aloof, and the Lord's attitude towards him was not warm at all. In this situation, he seemed more interested in the scene of commoners scattering in panic in front of the horses pulling the carriage, often narrowly escaping disaster. His coachman whipped the horses forward as if attacking an enemy, and that reckless, frenzied driving did not cause the owner's face or lips to change color in the slightest. At that time, in this deaf and mute capital, one occasionally heard complaints about the aggressive nobility accustomed to racing their carriages down narrow, sidewalk-less streets, endangering and injuring the common folk without a hint of compassion. But few cared to think twice about it, and in this matter, as in all others, the suffering commoners were left to fend for themselves.",14.309,13.636,"The owner of the face came down and went out into the courtyard, got into his car, and left. Not many people at the reception had spoken to him; he had stood in a corner away from everyone; in fact, the Monsignor could have been warmer towards him. He didn't seem to see anything wrong in people scattering in front of his car and narrowly escaping being run over. The driver was driving the car as if he were chasing an enemy, and this angry indifference of his did not cause any reaction on the face or lips of the gentleman sitting in the back. Even in this deaf city and this mute era, from time to time, complaints were heard in the narrow streets without sidewalks that this harsh driving habit of the wild nobles cruelly endangered and maimed the common people. But very few people paid attention to this situation, and as in many other matters, the miserable populace had to fend for themselves in the face of difficulties.",19.547,18.978,"Its owner descended the palace stairs and went out to the vestibule, where his carriage was waiting for him. Few had spoken to him during the reception, and the gentleman could have been more affectionate than he was when he arrived at the place where he remained withdrawn and separated from the groups. Without stopping for a moment, he got into his carriage, and the horses set off at a gallop, scattering the people they encountered along the way. The coachman drove as if he were charging against an enemy army, without his master thinking to curb the coachman's reckless fury, which, far from angering him, seemed rather to please him. Sometimes, very rarely, complaints had been voiced, even in that insensitive city and in that age of ignorance and idiocy, against the barbaric custom of galloping through narrow, sidewalk-less streets, without regard for the unfortunate people who were often run over, but no one deigned to give a second of attention to such trifles, and in this matter, as in many others, the wretched lower class was left free to deal with the difficulty as best they could.",14.427,13.841

At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.","Racing madly like a lunatic, disregarding all propriety in a brutal manner that people nowadays cannot comprehend, the carriage sped through the streets, dashed around corners, crashed into screaming women, into men grappling with each other, and swiftly pulled children away.

The fountain's water kept flowing; the river kept rushing; the day quickly turned into night, countless lives in this city rushed towards death according to the law, time waited for no one, the rats huddled together to sleep in the dark holes, the masquerade procession became vibrant again at dinner time, everything proceeded as usual.",18.9,18.439,"The car started moving and other cars quickly followed; the Minister, the Planner, the Tax Collector, the Doctor, the Lawyer, the Priest, the Grand Opera and Comedy, and the guests of the Masquerade Ball were shining brightly as they sped along in the cars chasing one another.

The father had already taken his small pile and retreated to a corner; the women who had been bending over and looking at the pile under the fountain were now sitting and watching both the flow of water and the guests coming out of the Masquerade Ball – the only woman knitting with the determination of Fate was still knitting, standing out from everyone else. The water of the fountain was flowing, the water of the river was flowing, the day was turning into night, and many lives in the city were heading towards death as per the order, time and seasons were waiting for no one, the mice had retreated to their dark holes and were sleeping huddled together, while the Masquerade Ball was shining brightly at dinner, everything was flowing in its own course.",18.06,17.581,"Through the same place, many other carriages crossed in a frenzied race and rapid succession.

The father, who had been left without a son, withdrew; the rats retreated to the depths of their holes, and on the base of the fountain, there remained only the woman who had dared to look sternly at the Marquis, rigid as Fate.

Expressive signs of what made them poor, were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.","The village had a poor road, with a poor brewery, a poor tannery, a poor inn, a poor relay station for changing carriage horses, a poor fountain, and all the familiar poor amenities. The village also had poor people. All the villagers were poor, many sitting in front of their doors, chopping the rare onions and similar items for dinner, while many others sat around the fountain washing vegetables and any meager produce that could be harvested from the land. Everywhere one looked, the cause of their poverty was evident; taxes for the state, taxes for the church, taxes for the officials, taxes for the local authorities, and taxes for the nation, having to pay here and there, according to the solemn instructions recorded in this small village, to the extent that one must wonder if there is any village not consumed by taxes.",13.31,12.151,"In the village, there was a bad street where everything was bad: a bad brewery, a bad tannery, a bad restaurant, a bad stable where the postal horses were changed, and a bad fountain. The people were also in bad condition. They were all poor, and many of them were sitting in front of their houses, chopping thin onions and similar things for dinner, while some were at the fountain washing the leaves and various herbs they had gathered that were edible.

They all lived in misery, and many were sitting at the doors of their homes, preparing discarded onions and other similar items for their dinner, while others washed vegetables, herbs, and all kinds of edibles that the earth provides at the fountain. It was not necessary to be very astute to discover the causes that reduced them to misery: just reading the solemn inscriptions placed in all visible spots of the village, detailing the taxes to be paid to the State, the Church, and the lord, along with local and general contributions, was more than enough, not only to understand why the inhabitants were poor, but to marvel that hunger and misery had not ended all their lives.",10.679,8.821

1110,"More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had dropped out of Tellson’s ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a tutor, whose attainments made the student’s way unusually pleasant and profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with the circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest. So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.","Two promises Months turned into years, and after twelve months, Charles Darnay had settled in England as a senior French teacher well-versed in French literature. Nowadays, he would be called a professor; back then, he was referred to as a university tutor*. He taught young men who were interested and keen on learning a globally popular language, nurturing in them an appreciation for the treasure trove of knowledge and the beauty of the French language. Additionally, he could write fluently in English on these subjects and translate works into English very well. Such teachers were not easy to find at that time; the royal family members awaiting succession had not yet been exiled to teach for a living, nor had any nobleman exhausted their accounts at Tellson's Bank to become a cook or carpenter. As a tutor with the goal of making learning interesting and useful for students, and as a talented translator who could bring new meanings to translations beyond the limits of dictionaries, Darnay quickly became famous and was encouraged. Moreover, he was well-informed about current events in France, which were becoming of increasing interest to many people. Thus, through perseverance, he succeeded.",10.206,9.323,"About twelve months had passed, and Mr. Charles Darnay had settled in England as a French teacher specializing in French Literature. If it were this age, he would be a Professor; in that age, he was a private tutor. He worked with young gentlemen who had the time and interest to learn a living language spoken all around the world, and he had developed tastes for knowledge and appreciation in this field. Additionally, he could write beautifully and translate these writings into English in an elegant manner. At that time, finding experts in this field was not easy; the Princes of the past and the Kings of the future were not included in the Teacher class, and no poor noble had emerged from Tellson's ledgers to become a cook or a carpenter. Young Mr. Darnay quickly gained a reputation and attracted attention as a teacher who both entertained and taught useful things to his students with his skills, and as a meticulous translator who added much more than just vocabulary knowledge to translations. Due to the conditions of the country and the growing interest, he became known by many people. Thus, with great determination and unending efforts, he achieved prosperity.",20.729,20.294,"Twelve months passed. Carlos Darnay had established himself in England as a teacher of the French language and French literature. Today he would be given the pompous title of professor; at that time he was called a tutor. He taught young people who had time and wished to learn a living language that was spoken all over the world. Teachers like Darnay were not easily found in those times. Princes and kings were far from being able to be among those who could teach, and the ruined nobility did not think of straining their eyes working over the Ledgers of Tellson's Bank, nor of dedicating their skills to the culinary arts or carpentry. The young Darnay soon became known, as he possessed the secret of making his students find his lessons enjoyable as a teacher, and as a translator, he knew how to put something more into his work than just the knowledge derived from grammar and the dictionary. Since, moreover, he managed to assimilate the customs of the country in which he lived, it is not surprising that with some perseverance, he managed to prosper.",11.993,11.387

But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long, long, dusty roads—the solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dream—had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.","He had loved Lucie Manette from the moment his life was in danger. Never before had he heard a sound as gentle and lovely as her sympathetic voice; never before had he seen a face as beautiful and kind-hearted as hers when Lucie looked at him standing by the edge of the freshly dug grave.

I know, Doctor Manette—how can I fail to know—that, mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted, loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration.

Truly, it is rare to see such a father-daughter bond. I know, Doctor... how could I not know,... that besides the love and duty of an adult woman, Lucie also holds for you all the love and reliance of a child. I know that since childhood, Lucie has lived without her parents, so now she gives her father all the deep affection of the present years, along with the trust and attachment she lacked as a child. I know very well that even if you were to return to this world from the other side, in her eyes, you could not be more sacred than you have always been. I know that when she hugs her father tightly, the arms around his neck are those of a child, a young girl, and a grown woman all at once. I know that through the love she has for her father, she sees and loves her young mother, sees and loves her young father, loves the suffering mother, and loves the father who faced terrifying ordeals and was fortunate to survive.

Of course, I know that, due to her growing up without a mother and father in the past, and now, because of her temperament and the longing and attachment brought by the years she spent apart from you, she has devoted herself to you with great loyalty and enthusiasm. I know very well that even if you were to reunite with her in the afterlife, she would not appear more sacred than she does now. When she embraces you, I know that the hands wrapping around your neck are simultaneously those of a baby, a young girl, and a mother.

I know, Doctor Manette, that along with the love of a daughter, who is now a woman, all the love of her childhood lives in her heart. I know that, precisely because she was deprived of her father's caresses during her childhood, she has now devoted herself to you with all the constancy, with all the fervor that her years and character give her. I know perfectly well that if you had descended from heaven after your death to accompany your daughter on earth, you could not be more loved, more sacred, or more revered than you are today. I know that when your daughter embraces you, it is the arms of the child, the arms of the maiden, the arms of the woman that tenderly encircle your neck.

If you please, committing you in no way, representing you in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is best spared. What do you say?”","− I forgive you. Thank you. Now, Mr. Stryver, what I mean to say is... it might be distressing for you if you find yourself mistaken, it might be distressing for Dr. Manette to have to speak frankly with you, it might be very distressing for Miss Manette to have to speak frankly with you. I have the honor and good fortune to be close to that family, you know. If you allow, I will try to observe and consider more clearly to give better advice without harming your intention to propose, or having to speak for you. Then if you are not satisfied with my advice, you can investigate yourself; on the other hand, if you are satisfied when what I say turns out to be true as I just said, then both sides can avoid unpleasantness. What do you think?",21.961,21.411,"""Accepted. Thank you. So, Mr. Stryver, what I meant to say was this: Seeing that you were mistaken might upset you, having to tell you some things plainly might upset Doctor Manette, and speaking frankly might also be very distressing for Miss Manette. You know under what circumstances I had the honor and happiness of being with them. If you wish, without involving your name at all, I can try to observe a bit more and come to a judgment in order to review my advice. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can question its validity yourself, but if you are satisfied and reach the point where we are now, everyone will go their own way. What do you say?""",12.639,11.91,"—Forgiven, and thank you. What I meant to say was the following: it would be painful for you to suffer a disappointment, it would be painful for Dr. Manette to find himself in the position of having to be explicit with you, and it would be very painful for Miss Lucía to find herself in the harsh necessity of speaking frankly to you. You know that I have the honor and the happiness of being a good friend of the family. Well then: if you want me, without representing you in any way, without involving you in anything at all, to make new observations that confirm or modify the impressions I have today, I offer myself for that right away. If the result of my new observations does not satisfy you, you will be free to personally verify their foundation; otherwise, we will have at least managed to avoid unpleasant scenes and situations.

Having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view—it is hardly necessary to say I could have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you, I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account. And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you, and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do; you were right, it never would have done.”","− Not at all; I assure you, not at all. After mistakenly believing there was reason where there was none, and mistakenly believing there was noble aspiration where there was none, I realized my error and suffered no harm. Young ladies often make similar foolish mistakes and often regret them when they find themselves in poverty and obscurity. For the person in question, I regret that this did not come to pass, because if it had, it would have been a misfortune for me, from a material gain perspective; but for myself, I am glad it did not come to pass, because if it had, it would have been a misfortune for me, from a material gain perspective... needless to say, I would have gained nothing. No harm has occurred. I have not proposed to that lady, and just between you and me, looking back, I am not even sure if I need to get married that much. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the whimsical, capricious, and inconsistent nature of empty-headed girls; do not dream of it if you do not wish to be disappointed. Now, please don't talk about that anymore. I've already said it, I feel sorry for them but happy for myself.

I was mistaken in thinking that where there is no logic, there is logic, and where there is no enthusiasm, there is praiseworthy enthusiasm, but it's okay, it's not a problem. Other young ladies I knew before had done such foolish things, and then they regretted it in misery and poverty. If I think without being selfish, I am saddened that it didn't happen, because it would have been bad for me financially; if I look at it selfishly, again it would have been bad for me financially – I would have gained nothing from this. So, I have no loss. I made no offer to the young lady, and between us, thinking about it, I'm not even sure it was a good decision to bring it to that point. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the delicate pride and frivolity of empty-headed girls; one should not have such an expectation, otherwise, you will always be disappointed. Now please, let's not talk about this any further. As I said, I felt sorry for them but I am pleased for myself.

I thought I saw common sense and laudable ambition where neither exists. I was mistaken, I am cured of my error, and the matter is concluded.

There are many young ladies who have committed similar follies, which they have come to regret when it was already too late, when they found themselves plunged into ruin and misery... Poor things!... I do not blame them! Indeed, they are worthy of compassion! Youth is so thoughtless!... Seeing what happened from a point of view free of all selfishness, I regret it, because it would have been a good deal for her, and if I look at it through the prism of my selfishness, I cannot help but celebrate a failure that saves me from making a disastrous deal. You will understand, without me having to say it, that I, far from gaining, was losing, and not a little. Of course, so far it has done me no harm. I have not offered my hand to that young lady, and here between us, speaking frankly, I never thought of making such an offer. Follow my advice, Mr. Lorry: never try to fight against the frivolities and follies of those flighty little heads if you don't want to reap disappointments in abundance... No... do me the favor!

1361,"With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams, like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one stream—saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind, since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from Tellson’s side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.","With a straw in his mouth, Cruncher sat watching the two streams of movement as if he were the ferryman god for centuries tasked with guarding the river of the underworld - only he did not wish for this flow to dry up. If it dried up, what would be worth hoping for, because a small part of his income came from leading timid women (most of whom were encumbered by their clothing and had long passed their prime) from Tellson's side across the traffic to the other side. Each time he accompanied them, no matter how brief, Cruncher managed to befriend the ladies to express his desire for the honor of toasting their health. And the small sums of money the ladies gave him when he performed this charitable purpose were an additional source of income, and that is why he sat there observing.",13.56,12.844,"Mr. Cruncher, with a straw in his mouth, was watching these two currents like a boatman observing the flow of the river that has surrounded hell for centuries, but Jerry never believed that these currents would ever dry up. He hoped they wouldn't either, as a small portion of his income came from ferrying delicate ladies (mostly well-dressed, middle-aged ones) across to the other side on behalf of Tellson. In these brief acquaintances, Mr. Cruncher would always show great interest in the ladies and felt a tremendous desire to reach the honor of toasting to their health. Thus, he earned a part of his income, as he did now, from the money given as a reward for this benevolence.",10.256,9.361,"The good Lapa, chewing the obligatory straw, watched the course of the two gigantic streams, similar to that gentle rustic who spent several centuries contemplating the course of a river, with the only difference between the two being that the latter feared the river would dry up, while Jeremiah was certain that the course of those streams would never be interrupted. It is true that this certainty was for Lapa a source of cheerful hopes, since a large part of his income was earned by serving as a guide for women who wished to cross the street. Although, as a general rule, the ladies who sought his services were well into the decline of life, and on the other hand, the relationships established during the brief crossing were necessarily short-lived, such an impression did the fiery Jeremiah have of the fair sex that he never rendered such a service without expressing a fervent desire to be granted the honor of drinking to the health of his companion.",6.73,5.698

Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this funeral, which engendered uproar.","It turned out that he was encountering a time when the streets were not crowded, devoid of slow-moving ladies, and when business was not thriving, he began to suspect that his wife Cruncher at home must be ""sitting around"" cursing him; just at that moment, he saw an unusual crowd pouring down Fleet Street heading west.

Among the first volunteers was Jerry Cruncher, who timidly hid his bristly head in the farthest corner of the hearse so that the people from Tellson's Bank would not see him.",13.801,13.039,"While those around were tearing all these items into pieces with great pleasure and scattering them around, the shopkeepers hastily pulled down their shutters; in such times, such a mob knew no bounds and could turn into a terrifying monster. The crowd had gone so far as to open the car door and take out the coffin, but a bright-minded person suggested that instead of removing it from the car, they should accompany it cheerfully to its destination. Due to the need for practical suggestions, this proposal was also met with applause, and suddenly eight men filled the inside of the car, a dozen clung to the outside, and meanwhile, a large number swarmed onto the roof of the car with great skill. Among those leading the way was Jerry Cruncher, who had curled up in a corner inside the mourning car and was humbly hiding his spiky hair to avoid being seen by those from Tellson's.",7.024,5.548,"The town entertained itself by tearing and scattering to the four winds the indicated objects and garments, demonstrating wild joy, while the merchants hurriedly closed the doors of their establishments, as the mob, in those happy times, was a highly dangerous monster, capable of devouring everything once it opened its jaws. They had already opened the doors of the hearse to take out the coffin, when another genius proposed escorting it to its destination amidst general rejoicing. The proposal, like all those that are eminently practical, deserved to be approved by acclamation, and immediately eight individuals stormed the coach while another six climbed onto the roof of the hearse. One of the first volunteers was Jeremías Lapa, who, in his modesty, hid himself and his head in a corner of the coach.",16.278,15.519
1383,"The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief. The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the hearse—advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under close inspection, for the purpose—and with a pieman, also attended by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he walked.","The official employees of the funeral home opposed the change in funeral rites; but the river was alarmingly close, and many in the crowd noted that using cold water would effectively calm any stubborn employee, so the funeral home staff only weakly and briefly protested. The funeral continued with the new rites, a chimney sweep took control of the hearse - under the guidance of the actual driver who was precariously perched beside him to closely supervise - while a street vendor, also with an assistant advisor, drove the funeral carriage. A bear trainer, a popular street character of the time, was also enlisted as an additional decoration before the procession reached Strand Street; and his mangy black bear was the only one in the procession with a truly mournful face.",14.607,13.775,"The funeral attendants initially protested a bit about this change in the ceremony, but the river was quite close, and when some of them started making remarks that dipping the stubborn attendants into the cold water would bring them to their senses, the objections ceased. The transformed procession set off with the chimney sweep as the driver – the actual driver sat next to him, carefully watching and guiding him; the mourning coach was driven by a minister and a pie seller. Before the cavalry regiment even reached the Strand, a bear handler, a street character much loved at the time, joined them, adding color to the procession; as for his very dirty black bear, it gave the procession a truly funereal atmosphere as it walked along.",5.282,3.974,"The funeral home employees protested against that alteration of the ceremony; but the distance to the river was alarmingly short, and several voices had already advocated the effectiveness of a cold immersion to bring the recalcitrant funeral employees to their senses, and as a result, the protests were weak and brief. The procession continued once it was reformed. A chimney sweep guided the hearse, advised by a professional coachman sitting next to him, and the driving of the car was handled by a baker, assisted in turn by a responsible minister. A Hungarian with his bear, a very popular street type at that time, joined the procession; the bear, being black and very thin, perfectly harmonized with the funereal character of the procession of which it was a part.",10.384,9.065
1384,"Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally, accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and highly to its own satisfaction.","So, while drinking beer, smoking cigarettes, singing loudly, and making all sorts of sorrowful and mocking gestures, the chaotic crowd kept moving forward, constantly drawing more people to join, and wherever they went, all the shops would shut their doors tightly. The destination was the old Saint Pancras church, far out in the countryside. The crowd eventually arrived, all pouring into the cemetery; and finally, they completed the burial of the late Roger Cly in the manner they wanted, and everyone was satisfied.",10.187,8.137,"Thus, the boisterous procession advanced, drinking beers, puffing on pipes, singing songs, accompanied by an endless imitation of sorrow, and constantly adding new members to their ranks; everyone who saw them closed their shops.

After a while, they reached their destination and all flowed into the cemetery like a flood; finally, they managed to bury the late Roger Cly in their own way and to their own satisfaction.",8.649,6.912,"In this manner, the disordered procession continued, growing at every step and forcing all the shops on the streets it passed through to close.

1385,"The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual progress of a mob.","The dead had been buried, and the crowd now needed new entertainment for themselves. A brilliant mind (or perhaps the same person from earlier) came up with the fun idea of accusing random passersby of being spies at the Old Bailey and venting their hatred on them. Dozens of innocent people who had never set foot near the Old Bailey in their lives were chased, knocked down, and assaulted. From this game, it was an easy and natural step to move on to breaking windows and then to looting pubs. Eventually, hours later, when many summer houses had been torn down and many fences had been broken to make weapons for the more aggressive ones, a rumor spread that the guards were coming. Upon hearing this news, the crowd gradually dispersed, and whether the guards came or never came, this was the usual course of events for a frenzied mob.",20.056,19.452,"The dead had been buried, and the crowd was in a rush to find a new amusement when another genius (perhaps the same man) came up with the witty idea of accusing passersby of being Old Bailey spies and taking revenge on them. To bring this idea to life, they grabbed hold of a bunch of innocent people who had never even passed near Old Bailey in their entire lives and harassed them by pushing and shoving. Naturally, from there, they moved on to the game of breaking windows and looting houses. Eventually, a few hours later, after some summer houses had been demolished and fences torn down, rumors spread that soldiers were coming to support the warrior spirits. Even before the rumor spread, the crowd had gradually dispersed; the soldiers may or may not have come, but this was what happened in all stampedes.",9.342,8.186,"Once the deceased was buried, the author of the previous humorous proposition, or perhaps another genius, as they are never lacking in crowds, conceived and proposed the diabolical idea, unanimously approved, of accusing passersby of being spies from the Old Bailey and calling for vengeance against all those whom chance brought to those places. Dozens of innocent unfortunates who had never in their lives been within a thousand yards of the despised court were pursued like wild beasts, harassed, and mercilessly beaten. The transition from this game to breaking windows, knocking down doors and windows, and looting inns and taverns could not have been simpler, more natural, or more logical. After several hours of looting, when several country houses had been stormed, many shops ransacked, and numerous iron fences destroyed, providing weapons to the most belligerent characters, word spread that the guards were coming. The mere news was enough to disperse the mobs before the guards arrived, who perhaps did not even think of approaching the scene of the events.",9.387,8.459

Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher, extinguished the light, and went out.","The evening passed with the Cruncher family like that, until young Jerry was made to go to bed and his mother had to follow the same order. Cruncher sat alone, smoking a few pipes to pass the time, waiting until nearly one o'clock in the morning to set off. At that dark, late hour, he got up from his chair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a cupboard, and pulled out a sack, a large crowbar, ropes with chains, and other tools needed for this special fishing trip. After skillfully tucking, wrapping, wearing, and hooking all those items around himself, Cruncher gave his wife a grumbling farewell, extinguished the light, and left.",28.308,27.707,"Little Jerry was sent to bed, and his mother was sent to sleep with a similar pacifier, thus ending the evening for the Cruncher family. Mr. Cruncher spent the early hours of the night smoking his pipe alone and waited for the clock to strike one to go for his walk. As the first and eerie hour of the day approached, he got up from his chair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cabinet, and took out a sack, a crowbar of appropriate size, a rope, a chain, and other fishing equipment. After carefully placing these items in the sack, he gave Mrs. Cruncher one last scornful look, turned off the light, and went outside.",32.701,32.172,"Thus the evening slipped away in the peaceful home of the Lapas, until mother and son were ordered to go to bed. The head of the family passed the hours of the night smoking solitary pipes until a little past midnight, when he got up to go out. Before that, however, he took from a cupboard, whose key he kept in his pocket, a sack, a rather thick iron bar, some ropes, a chain, and other similar fishing tools, which, once placed and arranged conveniently, he turned off the light and left.",9.956,8.665
1413,"Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the door stood ajar all night.","Little Jerry, who had been pretending to change clothes and lie down on the bed, immediately got up and followed. Hidden in the darkness, he followed his father out of the room, down the stairs, into the yard, and then onto the street. Returning to this house was not difficult for him because the house was full of tenants and the door was ajar all night.",21.815,20.403,"Little Jerry, who just pretended to undress when he went to his room, went outside right after his father.

He had no worry about how to return home because there were plenty of tenants in the building and the door would stay ajar all night.",19.036,17.559,"Minutes later, the curious child followed his father, having had the foresight to lie down dressed on the bed when he received the order to retire. Under the cover of night, he left his room, descended the stairs stealthily, and ventured through the deserted streets. As for returning to his father's house, he had no fear, for he knew very well that the door remained open all night.",7.253,5.077
1414,"Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his father’s honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts, walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and the two trudged on together.","Driven by the commendable aspiration to learn the honest craft secrets of his father, young Jerry kept close to the house fronts, walls, and doorways as he walked, his eyes always closely following his esteemed father. As for the esteemed father, he had just headed a short distance north when he encountered another night fisherman, and the two proceeded together.",17.804,16.453,"With admirable determination, Little Jerry, trying to learn the intricacies and mysteries of his father's honorable work, followed him with his eyes on his honorable father, passing through door frames, wall edges, and door cracks. The honorable father, heading north, had not gone far when another disciple of Izaak Walton joined him, and they continued their arduous walk together.",15.571,14.096,"Driven by the very commendable desire to learn the arts and mysteries of the nocturnal occupations of his honorable father, the boy, sticking to the walls of the houses, immersing himself in the doorways, tried not to lose sight of the hardworking author of his days for an instant. The latter took a northern direction, and he had not gone very far when he encountered a new disciple of Isaac Walton, in whose company he continued the journey.",5.946,4.132
1415,"Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here—and that so silently, that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split himself into two.","After half an hour, they passed through the area with flickering streetlights and the watchmen who had already fallen asleep, and then reached a deserted road. Here, they picked up another fisherman - so silently that if Jerry were superstitious, he would have thought that the fisherman they had just met had suddenly split into two.",9.322,7.259,"Half an hour after setting out, they passed the flickering street lamps and the even more flickering watchmen, and reached a deserted road.

Another fisherman joined them on the path, but with such discretion and silence that if the boy had been superstitious, he surely would have believed that the man who first joined his father had suddenly and miraculously split into two.",13.901,12.0
1416,"The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which the wall—there, risen to some eight or ten feet high—formed one side. Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate. He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay there a little—listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands and knees.","The three men continued walking and Jerry followed them until the three fishermen stopped under a bank that jutted out close to the road. On the bank was a low brick wall with an iron fence. In the darkness of the bank and the fence, the three men left the main road and turned into a dead-end alley beside the fence - which was up to three meters high in some places. Crouching in a dark corner, looking into the alley, young Jerry immediately saw the silhouette of his esteemed father clearly illuminated in the dim moonlight, swiftly climbing up the iron gate. His father climbed over quickly, followed by the second fisherman, then the third. All three quietly jumped down to the ground inside the gate and lay still for a while - perhaps listening. Then they crawled away on their hands and knees.",19.19,18.498,"The trio continued on their way and Jerry followed these three men until they stopped under an earthen embankment on the road. There was a low brick wall with iron railings on top of the embankment. The trio, in the shadow of the embankment and the wall, turned into a narrow dead-end road; the wall still extended along one side of the road – two and a half to three meters high. The next thing Jerry, crouched in a corner and watching this narrow road, saw was the figure of his honest father, very clearly visible in front of the pale and cloud-covered moon, hurriedly testing the weight of an iron gate. Soon after, his father jumped over it, followed by the second fisherman, and then the third fisherman jumped over. They all made a soft landing over the gate and lay on the ground for a while – probably listening to their surroundings. Then they proceeded on their hands and knees.",17.998,17.304,"The three continued their march followed by Lapa's son, until they halted at the foot of an embankment whose slope rose above the path. On top of the slope, there ran a low brick wall, crowned by an iron fence. The men slid like ghosts along the slope, trying to take cover in its shadow, until they reached an indentation that gave access to a sort of alley, one side of which, formed by the brick wall, was about ten feet high. In the whitish light of the moon, the boy could see that the honest tradesman to whom he owed his existence was climbing the iron fence with unparalleled agility. He was immediately followed by the second fisherman, and then by the third. The three reached the ground inside the fence, where they remained for a few minutes, lying on the ground... probably listening. Then they advanced, crawling on their hands and knees.",13.491,12.651
1417,"It was now Young Jerry’s turn to approach the gate: which he did, holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass! and all the gravestones in the churchyard—it was a large churchyard that they were in—looking on like ghosts in white, while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to fish.","Now it's Jerry's turn to sneak to the gate; he holds his breath and tiptoes forward. Retreating into the dark corner and looking in, it noticed the shadows of three people fishing, crawling through the dense grass, surrounded by tombstones - they were in a vast cemetery - the white tombstones like ghosts while the church tower rose high like the shadow of a giant monster. The three people crawled a short distance and then stood up. And they began their night fishing.",11.143,9.474,"Now it was Little Jerry's turn to jump from the door. He jumped, holding his breath. When he crouched in a corner again and looked at them, he saw the three fishermen crawling among the thick grass and all those tombstones in the churchyard – it was a big yard – the tombstones looked like ghosts in white, and the church tower looked like the ghost of a terrible giant. Soon they stopped crawling, stood up, and began to fish.",21.921,20.846,"The boy approached the gate, holding his breath. From a corner where he crouched, he saw the three fishermen crawling like snakes through the tall grass that covered the ground... and among many crosses and tombstones. They were in a cemetery, and they looked like dreadful ghosts being watched by an even more dreadful, more monstrous ghost: the tower of the nearby church, a terrifying giant tasked with guarding the peace of the dead. They did not advance much further. The boy soon noticed that they straightened up and began to fish.",14.411,13.167
1418,"They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew. Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off, with his hair as stiff as his father’s.","At first, they fished with a shovel. Then Jerry's venerable father seemed to be adjusting a tool that looked like a gigantic corkscrew. Whatever tool they used, they worked hard until the church clock bell struck a terrifying chime, causing young Jerry to flee in fright, his hair standing on end just like his father's.",17.975,15.68,"They started fishing with a garden spade. Then the honorable father continued with a tool that resembled a large corkscrew. No matter what tool they used, they were working hard, but the church clock struck so terribly that it scared Little Jerry so much that, with his hair standing up like his father's, he didn't know how to run away.",10.653,8.213,"They first fished with a hoe. Shortly after, the honorable Lapa prepared an instrument similar to an enormous corkscrew. Whatever fishing tools they used, they handled them with unusual fervor. The spikes that crowned the boy's head acquired the steely hardness of his father's when the giant guardian of the city of the dead let out slow, resonant, grave, terrifying, the two o'clock in the morning.",6.705,4.977
1419,"But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.","However, the long-held desire to understand not only prevented it from running away but also pulled it back. The three others were still persistently fishing at night when little Jerry peeked through the gate again; but this time, it seemed there were fish biting. From the dug hole came creaking and rumbling sounds, and the three figures above were straining as if something very heavy was pulling them down. Bit by bit, that heavy object was pulled up from the surrounding soil and emerged to the surface. Little Jerry already knew what it was, but when he first saw it with his own eyes, and saw his esteemed father about to pry it out, he was so terrified that he ran away, this time running nonstop for several kilometers.",10.454,9.371,"But the desire to learn what was happening inside him, which he had been carrying for a while, soon stopped him and even made him turn back. When he hid by the door for the second time and watched them, they were still fishing with determination, but this time it seemed like something had been caught on the line. Sounds of struggling and whining came from below, and the bodies of the men, bent forward, tensed as if something was pulling them down. Slowly, the weight slipped out of the soil and surfaced. Little Jerry had understood what was going to come out, but when he saw it, moreover, when he saw that his honorable father was about to pull and open it, he was so terrified by this sight he was not used to that he started running without looking back, and only after running a mile or two did he stop.",13.041,12.25,"The boy embarked on a reckless escape; but his desire to know was so great that not only did he stop after a short distance, but it also prompted him to return to the gate. He saw that the three men continued fishing, and assumed they had caught something upon observing that the fishermen seemed bent over and as if doubled, making efforts aimed at pulling out a very heavy fish. Indeed, it was so: little by little they were hoisting the fish until it surfaced. The shape of the fish was unmistakable; but when the boy saw that his father was about to open it, he was seized by such panic that he took off in a frantic run, not stopping or slowing down until he had covered more than a mile of ground.",6.021,4.684
1420,"He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath, it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his side—perhaps taking his arm—it was a pursuer to shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy’s kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road, and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on his breast when he fell asleep.","At that moment, he ran as fast as he could, only stopping to catch his breath, as if it were a ghostly race with the ultimate desire to reach the finish line. The boy was convinced that the coffin he had just seen was chasing after him; and he imagined that terrifying thing standing on one end, jumping onto his back, about to catch up and grab him - perhaps it would seize his arm - and he had to run for his life. The ghostly coffin appeared and disappeared, present everywhere, so when the entire darkness behind him turned into horror, the boy had to dash into the middle of the road to avoid the dark alleys, fearing that ghost would leap out from there like a kite with its wings and tail cut off. The ghost also hid at the doorways, rubbing its ghastly shoulders against the doors, then hunching its shoulders and tucking its neck as if laughing loudly. The ghost hid in the darkness on the road, lying on its back waiting to trip him. And there was always a ghost jumping right behind, chasing closely, so that even when the boy reached his house, he still hadn't recovered his wits. Even then, the ghost didn't let go but followed the boy upstairs, pounding on the steps, jumping onto the bed with him, and ramming its head into his chest, pushing him into a deep, exhausted sleep.",12.596,12.048,"Even if he didn't need to catch his breath, he wouldn't stop; it was as if he was racing against ghosts, and his only desire was for this race to end. He had a strong belief that the coffin he had just seen was chasing him; it seemed to be hopping and bouncing after him, upright on its narrow side, and at any moment it could catch up to him and hop right beside him – maybe it would grab him by the arm – the chase never ended. It was like a demon whose actions were unclear and whose emergence was unpredictable, and as it had made the night he left behind utterly terrifying, Little Jerry burst out from the dark side streets onto the main road and fled from it in terror, like a skinny child's tailless and wingless kite, leaping away in fright. The demon also hid in door cracks, rubbing its terrifying shoulders against the doors and pulling them up to its ears as if it were laughing. It blended into the other shadows on the road. It cunningly lay on its back on the ground to trip Little Jerry. All this time, it never stopped hopping behind the child and didn't leave him alone; when he finally reached the door of their house, Little Jerry was exhausted. But even then, the demon hadn't left him alone; it had followed him up the stairs with thudding steps, entered the bed with him, and when the child fell asleep, it settled heavily on his chest.",15.535,15.096,"Not even then would he have stopped if he hadn't run out of breath, for he wasn't fleeing from images conjured by fear, but from specters that were haunting him terribly. The coffin he had seen was right on his heels, jumping over the stones and dirt of the path in a perpendicular position and on its narrowest end, determined to catch up to him and place itself by his side... perhaps to cling to his arm. That diabolical coffin must have been a marvel of incongruity and ubiquity, for it would leap among the black rows of trees lining the path as soon as it would fly over the thick treetops, like a kite without a tail or wings. It also hid in the doorways, against which it rubbed its horrible ribs, producing a sound similar to hollow laughter. It constantly gained ground on the boy in that fantastic race. When the pursued reached the door of his house, he was half-dead with fear. Not even after taking refuge inside did he find himself free from the relentless pursuit of the coffin, which climbed the stairs after him, jumping over the steps, and lay down in his bed, and climbed onto his chest when sleep or terror overcame the unfortunate curious one.",7.1,6.334
1421,"From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the family room.

A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy.

As a general rule, the wine sold at Defarge's tavern had received the healthy waters of baptism, but the wine that these early Bacchic drinkers were consuming on this occasion must have been sour, or at least had the property of souring the temperament of those who drank it.

The wretched villagers assured that the expression of pride and disdain of the stone guardians of the castle turned into an expression of pain and anger when the knife struck the House, and they assured that from the moment the body of the murderer swung forty feet above the ground, the expression of pain and anger of those stone faces was replaced by one that breathed fierce vengeance, which would endure in them until the end of time.

He returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and that he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day; at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry’s friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him.","On the second day, Mr. Lorry cheerfully greeted the doctor by name and talked about the topics that the two had recently been discussing. Mr. Manette did not respond, but it was clear that he heard what Mr. Lorry said and was thinking about those matters, despite his disturbed mind. That encouraged Mr. Lorry to call Miss Pross in to help several times a day; during those times, they calmly talked about Lucie, about the father who was present, as if nothing had happened. They tried to appear as if they were having natural conversations, not too long, and not too often to avoid disturbing the doctor; and Mr. Lorry's friendly heart lit up when he saw that the doctor was looking up more often, showing some attention to the unusual things around him.",15.875,15.109,"On the second day, Mr. Lorry cheerfully greeted the Doctor and talked about the topics they had become familiar with recently. He always spoke of these subjects. Even though he did not respond, it was clear that the Doctor heard what was being said and, no matter how complex, pondered over them. This situation encouraged Mr. Lorry to involve Miss Pross at certain times of the day; during such times, the two of them would put their heads together and talk quietly about Lucie, her father, and the day's affairs as if nothing was amiss, with their usual demeanor. During this time, they did not act overly exaggerated, did not prolong the conversation, nor did they speak so frequently as to disturb the Doctor; the fact that the Doctor began to lift his head more often and seemed affected by the inconsistencies around him somewhat eased Mr. Lorry's warm heart.",11.413,10.568,"On the second day of the crisis, Lorry greeted the doctor by calling him by his name, and then began to talk to him about matters that were very familiar to both of them.

This encouraged Lorry, who asked Miss Pross to come in and keep him company several times during the day, in order to constantly talk about Lucia and her father, who was present at the conversations, naturally and as if nothing had happened. The results were not very successful, but neither were they so fruitless as to discourage Lorry from continuing the plan, as it managed, if nothing else, to dispel, even if only for brief moments, the state of indifference in which he was immersed.",17.207,16.558

For, going to the door of the Doctor’s room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker’s bench and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly studious and attentive.","He rubbed his eyes and stood up; but even so, he wasn't sure he was fully awake.

There he stopped abruptly, wondering if he was asleep or awake. Reasons? He had plenty: the stool, with the rest of the shoemaker's tools, was in a corner, and the doctor was calmly reading, lounging in an armchair by the window. He was wearing a morning suit, and his face, which Lorry could see perfectly, though a little pale, reflected absolute calm and placidity.",14.911,13.596
1770,"Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?","Even when he was sure he was truly awake, Mr. Lorry still felt dizzy for a moment, confused about whether the shoe-making episode last night was a disturbing dream if he hadn't seen his friend in familiar attire and manner, doing his usual work; so, had all the signs of change that had worried him for the past nine days really happened?",10.714,9.04,"Although Mr. Lorry convinced himself that he was now awake, in his dazed state, he couldn't decide for a moment whether this recent shoemaking matter was a bothersome illusion created in his mind; after all, his friend was sitting right in front of him in his usual attire and appearance, engaged in his usual occupation, showing not the slightest sign of any change or discomfort.",9.284,7.267,"A few pinches administered with a firm hand convinced Mr. Lorry that he was not asleep: this point was perfectly clarified and elucidated.

1771,"It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?

1774,"So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe advance, he at first supposed that his daughter’s marriage had taken place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however, he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid he sought. And that aid was his own.","If we follow the cautious methods exactly - Mr. Lorry saw it as the only safe way - it is understandable why Dr. Manette initially thought that his daughter's wedding had only taken place yesterday. The seemingly random but actually intentional hints about the day, date, and month made the doctor count and recount and think, clearly indicating that he was not at ease. Otherwise, he was extremely calm, to the point that Mr. Lorry decided there was no need to go far to seek anyone's guidance. Dr. Manette himself would indicate what needed to be done.",11.698,10.196,"Mr. Lorry thought that they could only make solid progress if they approached her gently and gradually, and from what they could understand in this way, the Doctor believed that his daughter's wedding had been the day before.

On the other hand, he was so composed in every other aspect that Mr. Lorry was determined to find the remedy he sought. The remedy was the Doctor himself.",10.685,9.213,"From the conversation, initiated and followed by Lorry with exquisite caution and tact, he inferred that the doctor believed his daughter's marriage had taken place the day before. Proceeding methodically in his explorations, he casually dropped a reference to the day of the week and month they were in, a reference that visibly confused the doctor, but since in all other respects he reflected an evident serenity of judgment, Lorry resolved to seek the help he desired, and he expected that help from the doctor himself.",13.275,12.216

This was much more difficult and thorny than the first: Lorry was very persuaded of this; but he recalled the conversation he had with Miss Pross on Sunday, took into account the painful scenes he had witnessed in the last nine days, and understood that he had a duty to face it.",12.863,11.865

1828,"“You see,” said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause, “it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings of this poor man’s mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not find it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.”","− You see, - Dr. Manette turned to look at his friend after a moment of confused silence, - it is indeed difficult to thoroughly explain what goes on in the mind of this poor soul. This person had a terrible longing to do that work, and was very happy to do it; surely it helped him alleviate his suffering a great deal by replacing the complex activity of the mind with the complex activity of the hands; and in doing so, he became more and more proficient, the dexterity of his hands helped him forget the torment in his mind to the extent that he couldn't bear the thought of being separated from that work. Even now, when I see that he is more hopeful about himself than ever before, he even speaks about himself with confidence, but the thought of needing the old work and not having it suddenly terrifies him, like the fear in the heart of a child who has once been lost from their mother.",13.129,12.361,"After a disturbing short silence, Doctor Manette turned to Mr. Lorry and said, ""Now look,"" he said, ""it is very difficult to fully explain what is going through this poor man's mind. Once upon a time, he very earnestly wanted to find a job to occupy himself and was very happy when he found it; clearly, this job greatly alleviated his pain at the time; the confusion of his mind was replaced by the confusion of his fingers, and with this change, as he became more skilled, the dexterity of his fingers replaced the skill of self-tormenting; therefore, he never thought of parting with it. Even now, although your friend is more hopeful and confident than ever, he panics with a feeling similar to that of a lost child, thinking that if one day he feels the need to return to this old occupation and cannot find it.""",9.557,8.722,"—You must understand—replied Doctor Manette, turning to his interlocutor—that it is extremely difficult to explain, adhering to the inflexible rules of logic, the intimate operations of the mind of the poor man to whom you refer. In the past, he so fervently requested to dedicate himself to that trade, that when what he longed for was granted to him, he thanked Heaven from the depths of his soul. It is undeniable that, upon finding a means that allowed him to substitute the perplexity of his fingers for the perplexity of his brain, and with the dexterity of his hands the operations of his tortured mind when he acquired some practice in the trade, his torments were greatly alleviated, in which case, it is natural that he shows resistance to parting from what did him so much good. Even today, although I believe there is not the slightest danger of new relapses, even if his friend shares this confidence of mine, the idea that there could come a day when he might need the forge, and not find it, I believe would cause him a pain only comparable to that of a father threatened with being separated from his child.",12.868,12.267

Then, among these approaching echoes, her daughter's tiny steps and chirping sounds mingled. Yet, the young mother beside the cradle always heard the approaching great echoes. As the sounds continued to approach, the dim house was illuminated with the child's laughter, and in the young mother's troubled days, the divine friend of children seemed to have taken her baby into its arms and made her a source of sacred joy.",13.093,11.979,"Those times have passed. In her arms now played an angel, named Lucía, like her; and then, dominating all the echoes of the advancing steps, always stood out those of tiny little feet mixed with silver sounds emitted by a tongue that begins to babble. The world could be deafened by the most thunderous echoes: the young mother, sitting by the cradle, only heard the soothing music of her little daughter's half-formed words. The divine friend of children, to whom all mothers usually entrust the care of their children, had taken Lucía's child in his arms and turned him into an inexhaustible source of joy for her!",14.158,13.182
1890,"Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together, weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husband’s step was strong and prosperous among them; her father’s firm and equal. Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the plane-tree in the garden!","Always busy with the golden thread that entwines everyone together, weaving her efforts to build happiness into their lives without ever revealing herself, Lucie hears in the echoes of time the soothing, affectionate reverberations. Among them are the steady and successful footsteps of her husband, and the stable and healthy footsteps of her father. There, under the linden tree in the garden, Miss Pross, like an untamed warhorse that has been bridled and tamed with a whip, is snorting, stamping, and stirring up even more reverberations!",14.09,12.667,"The golden thread that tirelessly connected them all was weaving Lucie's happiness into the lives of others, prioritizing it above everything else, so that Lucie heard warm and comforting sounds in the echoes of the years. Among these, her husband's footsteps were strong and intense; her father's were steady and calm. As for Miss Pross, she amplified the echoes like an unruly cavalry horse in its harness, snorting through her nose and pawing the ground under the plane tree in the garden when whipped!",13.665,11.895,"Lucía was always busy twisting the golden thread that bound the happy members of that family, always contributing to the fabric of everyone's lives with the weave of her beneficial influence, while carefully avoiding letting it dominate; in the echoes of the footsteps of the years, she heard nothing but friendly steps. Among them, her husband's steps stood out for being strong and prosperous; her father's were firm and always the same, and Miss Pross's were impetuous and violent, an echo that awakened a thousand echoes, similar to the harsh neighing and stamping of a horse being punished.",11.643,10.34
1891,"Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant smile, “Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!” those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mother’s cheek, as the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it. Suffer them and forbid them not. They see my Father’s face. O Father, blessed words!","Even when the echoes are of sorrow and pain, those reverberations are neither cruel nor harsh. Even when the golden hair like Lucie's, shining with a halo around the head of the son lying on the pillow about to depart, and the boy says with a radiant smile, “Papa and maman, I am very sorry to leave you and my pretty sister; but God has called and I must go!” the tears soaking the mother's cheeks are still not the utmost agony as the little soul leaves the arms entrusted by God. Painful but accepting. They will meet again before God. Oh, hallowed be Thy name!",20.112,19.392,"Even in times of sorrowful voices, they were neither hurtful nor rude. When the weary face of a little boy with golden hair similar to Lucie's was surrounded by a halo of light on the pillow, and with a radiant smile on his face, he said, ""Dear mother and father, I am very sad to leave you and my sweet sister; but they are calling me, I must go!"" even then, the tears wetting his young mother's cheeks were not tears of pain, but the soul entrusted to her had been taken away. Feel sorrow for him but do not hinder him. He will meet God. God bless him!",16.412,15.379,"Not even on the rare occasions when echoes of joy were mixed with echoes of pain, was the latter cruel or lacerating. When on the pillow of a little bed fell in disarray the curls of a blonde hair, similar to Lucia's, framing the emaciated and transparent face of a child, who, smiling sweetly, said: ""I am very sorry to leave my daddy and my mommy; I am also very sorry to part from my dear little sister; but they are calling me from above and I must answer the call,"" the tears that flooded the mother's cheeks were not tears of agony; for the fact that an angel leaves the covering that served as its dress should not tear them from her eyes. To the gentle fluttering of an angel's wings were joined the echoes born on earth, resulting in a murmur that was not entirely earthly, as it was animated by a breath from the heavens.",9.206,8.305
1892,"Thus, the rustling of an Angel’s wings got blended with the other echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed murmur—like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore—as the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or dressing a doll at her mother’s footstool, chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life.","Thus, the rustling of the Angel's wings blended with other echoes, reverberations not entirely earthly but imbued with the breath of Heaven. Whispering softly in the mother's ear, the sigh of the wind blowing over the small grave in the garden also carries the sound of little Lucie diligently and amusingly performing her morning duties, or dressing her doll on her mother's footstool, chattering in the language of both cities that are her homelands.",12.151,10.9,"Thus, to the other echoes was added the fluttering of an angel's wings, and these were not earthly echoes, but ones that carried the breath of heaven. Then the sighs of the winds blowing over the small grave in the garden joined them, and both came to Lucie's ear with a calm murmur, like the breeze of the sea that had fallen asleep on a beach in summer – meanwhile, little Lucie would be eagerly engaging in her morning activities or dressing her doll while chattering away in the language of the Two Cities that had intertwined with her life, at her mother's knee.",15.649,14.381,"To the gentle fluttering of an angel's wings were joined the echoes born on earth, resulting in a murmur that was not entirely earthly, as it was animated by a breath from the heavens. Also mingled with those faint sighs of the wind that kiss the flowers of the cemetery were sighs that Lucía's ear picked up, believing they were the breathing of a summer sea that sleeps upon a flat sandy beach while her little daughter, studying with comical seriousness the lessons of the morning, or engrossed in the task of dressing her dolls, chatted, mixing words from the two cities that had combined in her life.",18.348,17.375
1893,"The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages.","Those echoes rarely truly reflected the footsteps of Sydney Carton. About six times a year at most, he exercised the privilege of visiting this house without prior invitation, often spending the entire evening with everyone as he used to. He never came when he reeked of alcohol. And there was one more thing related to Carton that silently echoed, something that throughout the ages every true reverberation quietly continued.",15.283,13.672,"The echoes rarely responded to the footsteps of Sydney Carton. Carton exercised his right to visit uninvited at most five or six times a year, and as he once frequently did, he would spend the entire evening with them. He never went there while intoxicated. There was one more thing whispered about Carton among the echoes, and this had been whispered by all honest echoes for years.",18.482,16.73,"Very rarely did the echoes respond to the real steps of Sydney Carton. Half a dozen times a year, at most, he exercised his privilege of showing up at the doctor's house uninvited and taking part in the evening gathering as he had so often done in the past. He never showed up drunk or even half-drunk. But if the echoes of his steps rarely sounded in the little corner of Soho, it was very common to hear the brief and beautiful story that they whispered about him.",17.815,16.712
1894,"No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother, but her children had a strange sympathy with him—an instinctive delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms, and he kept his place with her as she grew. The little boy had spoken of him, almost at the last. “Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!”","The man who truly loves a woman, even if his love is unrequited but remains devoted without resentment, when she becomes a wife and a mother, none of her children will lack extraordinary feelings for him - a subtle compassion instinctively directed towards him. What hidden emotions resonate in such situations? There is no echo to reveal these occurrences, and it is the same with Carton. He was the first stranger to whom little Lucie extended her chubby hands, and he held a place in her life. As for the little boy who passed away, even near the end, he still said, ""Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!""",23.47,22.718,"No man could love a woman this much, and even if he lost her, he couldn't remain so innocently and stubbornly attached to her, knowing that she was now a wife and mother, to the extent that even Lucie's children felt a strange sympathy for Carton – perhaps they pitied him with an instinctive sensitivity. No echo could tell what secret emotions created this; but it was so, it was very obvious. The first stranger to whom little Lucie extended her chubby arms was Carton, and he was always by her side as she grew up. Even the little boy, while taking his last breath, was murmuring his name. ""Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!""",20.526,19.658,"There has never existed a man madly in love with a woman, who has seen and treated her with pure eyes and immaculate thought after she has become a wife and mother. As if her tender little children understood her silent pain, they showed him a singular sympathy... something like a delicate instinct of compassion towards him. The echoes do not speak when these sensitivities, which have their seat in the deepest recesses of the soul, vibrate, but although silent, they whisper. Carton was the first stranger to the house to whom little Lucía extended her chubby arms, and the child, moments before taking his flight to heaven, exclaimed: ""Poor Carton! I wish they would give him a kiss for me!""",13.982,13.124
1895,"Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great engine forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in his wake, like a boat towed astern. As the boat so favoured is usually in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped life of it. But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his state of lion’s jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of rising to be a lion. Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.","Stryver continued to aggressively push forward in the legal field, like a large engine-powered ship cutting through murky waters, dragging his steadfast friend behind like a small boat. As the boats being towed are often those that have met with severe misfortune and mostly end up sinking, Sydney remained submerged in that life. But Sydney's weakness and deeply ingrained habits, unfortunately, were too weak and too deeply ingrained for him to have any desire to abandon them or feel ashamed; he chose that way of life, no longer thinking about escaping the state of being a Jackal to a Lion—unlike a true wild dog that might dream of becoming a mighty lion. Stryver, already wealthy, married a flamboyant widow with assets and three children, three of whom had nothing particularly remarkable except for their straight hair on their round heads.",5.779,4.553,"Mr. Stryver, like a large boat trying to make its way through muddy water, was forging ahead on the path of law, dragging his useful friend in his wake like a dinghy at the stern of the boat. These privileged dinghies generally encounter difficulties, often bobbing up and down in the water, and thus Sydney was living such a sunken life. The indifferent and powerful state within him, even if not pleased, was so much easier and stronger than any kind of unpleasantness and disgrace that Carton could not deviate from the path he was on, and never considered giving up being the jackal to the lion, whereas it was expected that all true jackals would hope to become lions one day. Stryver, on the other hand, had become wealthy; he had married a vigorous widow with a lot of property and three sons, who had no brilliance other than the straight hair shining on their dull heads.",13.179,12.338,"Stryver penetrated the domains of law each day with greater vigor, like a powerful ship plowing through turbulent seas, and in his wake, Carton could be seen like a barge being towed. The barge thus favored by the ship that took it in tow faces serious dangers, generally navigates with difficulty, and is almost always waterlogged. Carton also navigated the seas of life, lurching and exposed to capsizing at any moment. However, a deeply ingrained and firm habit, more ingrained and firmer in his heart than any of the stimulants we commonly call the perception of abandonment of misfortune, indicated the course he should follow, and Carton followed it, without ever thinking of leaving the lamentable state he found himself in, without having more aspirations to renounce his role as a jackal to a lion than a flesh-and-blood jackal has ever had to elevate itself to the category of a lion. Stryver was rich. He had married a widow who owned magnificent properties and was the mother of three children, none of whom had been endowed by the hand of nature with exceptional gifts, although they were distinguished by the thick mass of bristly spines that adorned their heads.",7.317,6.641
1896,"These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the most offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to Lucie’s husband: delicately saying “Halloa! here are three lumps of bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!” The polite rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr. Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in the habit of declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to “catch” him, and on the diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him “not to be caught.” Some of his King’s Bench familiars, who were occasionally parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed it himself—which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender’s being carried off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.","From every pore exuded the most obnoxious air of superiority, Stryver had once made these three sons walk ahead of him like three sheep to the quiet corner of Soho, and he had suggested to Lucie's husband to take them as his students. Stryver had said very tactfully: ""Hey friend! Here are three pieces of cheese bread I bring to your marriage adventure, Darnay!"" The fact that these three pieces of cheese bread were politely declined made Stryver unbearably angry, but later it became a useful lesson for him to teach these three sons to beware of the pride of beggars, just like that fellow countryman tutor. When his belly was full of wine, Stryver would also often speak eloquently about Lucie, about the tricks she had used to ""trap"" him, and about his own counter-tricks to ""avoid being trapped"". Stryver's colleagues at the Supreme Court would occasionally gather to drink their fill and listen to those tall tales, but no one believed them; they overlooked the fabrications because they thought Stryver repeated them so often that he himself came to believe them - if anyone said this and Stryver heard it, the fault of that person would only become more grievous and irredeemable, with the only recourse being to drag the offender to some suitable secluded spot and hang them to death as deserved.",12.481,12.002,"Mr. Stryver, in his most unpleasantly domineering manner, herded these three young gentlemen like sheep to the corner in Soho and, after handing them over to Lucie's husband as students, said, ""Hello! Their flesh is yours, their bones are mine. If you want to use these three pieces of flesh while going on a family picnic, Darnay!"" The polite refusal of this offer of three pieces of flesh drove Mr. Stryver mad, and he decided to educate the young gentlemen himself. He first advised them to steer clear of the arrogance of Beggars, like this private tutor. On nights when he drank too much, he would sit across from Mr. Stryver and loudly recount the traps Ms. Darnay had set to ""catch"" him and the magnificent tactics he had used to avoid being ""caught."" His colleagues from the bar who attended these boozy and boastful gatherings would tolerate him, noting that Stryver had begun to believe his own lies – it was such an incorrigible situation that everyone avoided him as much as possible.",9.646,8.935,"Stryver, exuding protection from every pore of his body, had presented these three little gentlemen in the peaceful house in Soho, and offered them as disciples to Lucie's husband. With unparalleled delicacy, said the brilliant lawyer when making the presentation: —I have the pleasure of contributing these three pieces of bread to your wedding lunch, Darnay. With very courteous words, Darnay declined those three pieces of bread, raising such a tempest of indignation in Stryver's noble chest, that from then on he made a special effort to ensure that in the souls of the little gentlemen in question, the idea of treating beggars like that famished teacher, whose only patrimony was pride, would be born and deeply rooted with the utmost disdain. He also had the good habit of enumerating and explaining to his wife the arts that Lucie Manette once used to ""catch"" him, and the diamond wall he opposed to her artifices, thanks to which he was an ""uncatchable"" fish for that fisherwoman. Some of his colleagues, who used to be his companions in his bacchanalian excesses, excused him by saying that he had repeated the lie in question so many times that he himself already believed it as a matter of faith... which, far from excusing an offense, aggravates it enough to justify the offended party taking the offender to a secluded and convenient place, and nicely and without annoying procedures, leaving him hanging from any tree with a noose.",8.0,7.242
1897,"These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little daughter was six years old. How near to her heart the echoes of her child’s tread came, and those of her own dear father’s, always active and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband’s, need not be told. Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her “What is the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us, as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have too much to do?”","Those were the echoes that Lucie, sometimes sad, sometimes joyful, heard at the corner of this echoing street until her little daughter turned six years old. Oh, how affectionate were the echoes of the child's footsteps, along with the father's - always brisk and calm - and needless to say, the footsteps of the loving husband. It goes without saying that every gentle echo in this close-knit family, thanks to Lucie's skillful and clever management making everything prosperous, was sweet music to her ears. It also goes without saying how soothing were the echoes around Lucie when countless times Mr. Manette told her that although his daughter was married (if that were indeed the case), she was even more devoted to her father than when she was single, and when countless times Darnay told her that it seemed her filial piety did not divide the love or support she gave to her husband, he asked her: ""My dear, what magic do you possess that you manage everything for everyone as if the whole family were just one person, yet you never seem hurried or busy?""",9.87,8.977,"All these were among the echoes that Lucie sometimes listened to thoughtfully, sometimes with cheerful laughter, in her corner until her little girl turned six. There is no need to mention how the pitter-patter of her child's footsteps, the always lively and confident steps of her father, and the footsteps of her beloved husband warmed her heart. Moreover, every little echo in their peaceful home, which Lucie managed with great delicacy and thrift, where nothing was wasted, sounded like a beautiful melody to the young woman's ears. Especially when her father told her that he felt even more connected to her after she got married, and her husband said that none of her attentions and duties diminished her love and support for him, and asked her, ""How do you manage to be everything to all of us? You attend to all our needs but never seem rushed or act as if you have too much to do?"" these words sweetly echoed in Lucie's ears.",13.659,13.114,"Such were, among others, the echoes that Lucía, sometimes pensive and other times amused and even laughing out loud, heard from the peaceful corner of Soho. The girl turned six years old. The echoes of her steps along the paths of life resonated deep in her mother's heart, mingled with the equally delightful steps of the doctor, always calm and always active, and with those of her husband, always tender and always in love. In Lucía's ears, the gentle echoes of that home, managed by herself, sounded like divine music, a home where opulence did not reign, but abundance did. The echoes of what her father so often said, namely, that he found her more affectionate, if possible, married than when she was single, also sounded with exquisite sweetness.",7.838,7.19
1898,"But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about little Lucie’s sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound, as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.","But there were other echoes from afar that roared and threatened this corner of the street during that time. Now, as little Lucie turned six, those echoes began to resonate fearfully like the terrifying stormy seas echoing from France.",9.959,7.452,"But all this time, there were also voices echoing in the distance and rumbling menacingly in the corner.

1993,"“See!” cried madame, pointing with her knife. “See the old villain bound with ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back. Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now!” Madame put her knife under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.","There! - Madame Defarge shouted, brandishing her knife. - Look at that wicked old man tied up with rope. They've tied a bundle of grass to his back too, how wonderful. Ha ha! Wonderful indeed. Make him eat grass! - She tucked the knife under her arm, clapping as if watching a play.",14.957,12.829,"Pointing with her knife, ""Look at that!"" shouted the madam. ""Look, they've tied up the old man with ropes. It's a good idea to tie a bunch of grass to his back. Ha ha! They had a very clever idea. Now let him eat it!""

1994,"The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl, and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge’s frequent expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.","The people standing right behind Madame Defarge explained the reason for her satisfaction to those behind them, and these people would explain to others, and so on; thus, the nearby streets also echoed with applause. For two or three hours straight, along with the whispered explanations, Madame Defarge's frequently anxious expression was quickly mimicked and spread - the image even traveled faster than the words - because many strong and agile people had climbed up the outside beams to look in through the windows. They knew Madame Defarge well and took on the task of conveying her reactions to the crowd outside.",18.727,17.881,"The people standing right behind Madam Defarge explained to those behind them why the woman was so delighted, then they explained to those behind them, and they to those behind them, until all the surrounding streets echoed with applause. Thus, during the two to three hours of interrogation and while the words spilled from the man's mouth were being sifted, even the people far away were instantly informed of every expression that appeared on Madam Defarge's impatient face. One reason for this rapid dissemination was that some agile men who knew Madam Defarge well climbed the building from the outside to look in through the window and acted as telegraphs between the madam and the crowd outside.",12.698,11.625,"As the people who were positioned behind Madame Defarge hurried to explain to those following them the cause of her satisfaction, and the explanation spread from ear to ear like wildfire, soon deafening applause resounded in the hall, in the street, and in the nearby squares. In the same way, all the expressions of impatience uttered by Madame Defarge over two or three hours were transmitted with astonishing speed over great distances. It is not surprising: men endowed with exceptional agility climbed the facade of the building, taking advantage of the architectural adornments that covered it, until they perched on the windowsills, from where they could perfectly see and hear Madame Defarge and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd roaring outside.",18.418,17.657

Bring him to the lamp!”","Even from the farthest corner of the crowd, everyone immediately knew what was happening. Defarge jumped over a fence and a table, tightly gripping the wretched unfortunate in a deadly embrace - Madame Defarge, closely following her husband, immediately seized the rope binding the prisoner - The Goddess of Vengeance and Jacques Three had not yet arrived, the crowd clinging to the windows like perched birds had not yet managed to get inside - when it seemed the entire city echoed with the shout: ""Bring him out! Bring him to the lamppost!""",17.748,16.685,"Even those at the very back of the crowd were instantly informed of the situation.

Bring him to the lamp!""",21.643,20.737,"Clouds of dust rose in the distance; the sound of furious galloping horses was carried by the air in its waves; but Saint Anthony was awake, Saint Anthony was vigilant, and his keen eyes saw the clouds of dust, and his sensitive ears heard the thunder of the horses' hooves. Defarge leaped over the balustrade and the table, and embraced the unfortunate old man in a deadly grip. The tavern keeper followed her husband like a faithful wife, and grabbed one of the ropes that bound the prisoner.

Once, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.","Falling down, being pulled up, head thrust down on the steps of the City Hall; then, kneeling; then, standing up; then, falling backward; being dragged away, being punched and kicked, suffocating from the handfuls of grass and straw thrust into his face by hundreds of hands; clothes torn, flesh bruised, suffocating, bleeding, but never ceasing to plead, to beg for mercy; then struggling fiercely in agony within the cramped space as waves of people pushed closer to look; then like a dead log being dragged through a forest of human legs; the criminal was dragged to the nearest street corner where a fateful street lamp hung, and there Madame Defarge let him go - like a cat playing with a mouse - then silently, coldly watched the victim while everyone prepared. And while the prisoner begged her, the women continued to scream madly at him, the men aggressively shouted to stuff grass into his mouth and then kill him. The first time, the rope broke when he was hanged, and the crowd caught him as he screamed falling down; the second time, the rope broke again when he was hanged, and the crowd caught him again as he screamed falling down; and on the third time, the merciless rope held tight, and soon after his head was displayed on a pike, grass stuffed in his mouth for all of Saint Antoine to see and dance in celebration.",19.489,19.068,"They dragged the man down the stairs of the building; sometimes on his knees, sometimes standing, sometimes pulling him on his back, they pushed him, and when hundreds of hands pressed grass and straw into his face, he felt like he was suffocating; his clothes were torn, he was covered in wounds and bruises, he was struggling to breathe, and he was bleeding all over; yet he did not stop begging and pleading for mercy; during this passionate and painful act, people made space by pulling each other back to see him; he was like a dry log in a forest of hundreds of legs; they dragged the man to the nearest corner where one of the deadly lamps was hanging; Madam here –like a cat releasing a mouse– let him go and watched him with a calm demeanor while the crowd made their preparations, and he begged and pleaded with Madam. Meanwhile, the women were constantly screaming shrilly, and the men were shouting that they would kill him by stuffing his mouth harshly. At one point, they pulled the man up, but the rope broke and they caught him as he fell to the ground screaming; then they pulled him up again, the rope broke again, and they caught him again as he fell screaming; finally, the rope held him painfully, and soon his head, with enough grass in his mouth to make all of St. Antoine dance before him, was on the end of a stake.",14.795,14.225,"Knocked to the ground and lifted back up, forced to descend dragging that fatal ladder, sometimes headfirst, other times on his knees, now face down and now on his back, brutally beaten and wounded, suffocated by the bundles of grass and straw that hundreds of hands violently shoved into his mouth, shattered, crushed, losing blood in torrents, the wretched man did not cease for an instant to beg for mercy. His agonies increased when the beasts closest to him stepped aside so that no one would be deprived of the pleasure of watching him, and they reached their ultimate limit when he saw that they tied him by the feet to a log and carried him to the nearby corner, where there was a lantern. There, Madame Defarge released him, like a cat playing with a mouse, and looked at him with terrifying calmness without uttering a word, while the men completed their preparations, unaffected by the pleas the unfortunate man directed at her. They hoisted him up, and the rope broke... The same thing happened twice, until finally, a rope, more compassionate than the men, held and put an end to his sufferings. Moments later, Saint Anthony danced around a head, impaled on a pike, from whose mouth bundles of grass and straw protruded.",9.682,8.971
1998,"Nor was this the end of the day’s bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the people’s enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper, seized him—would have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear Foulon company—set his head and heart on pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession through the streets.","The brutal work of that day was not yet over, for the people of Saint Antoine, having shouted, danced, and boiled with hatred, were once again seething with resentment at the end of the day upon hearing the news that the son-in-law of the slain man - another enemy and offender of the people - was coming to Paris with five hundred escort soldiers, all cavalry. The people of Saint Antoine recorded this man's crimes on fluttering papers, then captured him alive - surely they must have attacked the entire army to capture him and subject him to the same fate as Foulon - beheading him and displaying his heart on a sharp stake, and the whole wolf-like crowd paraded all three trophies through the streets.",11.996,10.95,"But the day's bad deeds were not yet over, for when the wretched man's despicable son-in-law, another enemy of the people, arrived in Paris with five hundred soldiers, St. Antoine screamed and went so berserk that the place was in turmoil again.

Then, the miserable bakers’ shops were beset by long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in common, afterwards supping at their doors.","It wasn't until late at night that the group of men and women returned to their crying, hungry children. As a result, the unfortunate bakeries were once again surrounded by long lines of people patiently waiting to buy moldy loaves of bread; while waiting with their empty, shrunken stomachs, they passed the time by embracing each other to celebrate their recent achievements and reminiscing about the day's events.

Thus it was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable.","The blessing of the nation is the high-ranking officials (considered individually, they are often the most elite nobles), they create a chivalrous appearance for everything, are the elegant epitome of luxurious and splendid life, and bring so much meaning to similar matters.

As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.","Therefore, at that time, when working alone in the dust, the road worker seldom thought about his dusty fate of returning to dust, but mainly worried about how many meals he could earn and, if possible, how many meals he could eat - at that time, when he lifted his eyes from his solitary work to look into the distance, he often saw a rustic figure walking towards him, a type of traveler that was once rare in this area but was now becoming more common. As the figure became clearer, the road worker would recognize without much surprise that it was a person with disheveled hair, a somewhat savage face, tall and large, wearing crude wooden shoes that even the road workers like him found clumsy, with an aggressive, rough, dark appearance, covered in dust from miles of travel, soaked in mud from marshy lands, and full of thorns and moss from cutting through forest shortcuts.",9.366,8.448,"Meanwhile, the road worker, lost in thought about how little food he had left and how long he could last if he ate it, far from the thought that he came from the earth and would one day return to it, working alone amidst the dust and dirt, looked up and saw a rough-looking man approaching him, the kind that used to be rare in the area but now was frequently encountered. When the man got closer, the road worker noticed that he was tall, wild-looking, and disheveled, and he wasn't surprised at all. But what did catch his eye were the man's wooden shoes, covered in dust and dirt, caked in mud, soaked in low-lying wet areas, and smeared with thorns, grass, and mold from the secluded paths in the groves, which even to a grim, rough, and sunburnt road worker like himself seemed misshapen.",5.102,3.839,"At the time we refer to, when the solitary road worker labored turning the soil, without thinking that it was dust and to dust it would return, for his thoughts almost always revolved around how little he would find to eat for dinner at home, and how much he would eat if he had it, in those times, if he lifted his eyes from the ground and looked along the road, it was not impossible that they would encounter men of rough appearance, very rare before in those places and very frequent now. As those men approached the road worker, he saw that they were generally individuals with coarse bristles and an almost barbaric appearance, tall, wearing clogs, with a fierce look, covered in mud and dust, like someone who has walked many roads.",9.384,8.513

2037,"As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account. The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips. Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no obstacle, tending to centres all over France.","While the road worker was diligently engaged in his dusty work, the black clouds gradually dispersed, revealing patches of sky through which silver sunlight pierced, casting long streaks of light on the scenery below. The short road worker (now wearing a red hat instead of a blue one) seemed to be drawn to the person lying on the pile of rocks. He kept glancing in that direction, thus only working mechanically and, I must say, perfunctorily. As for the traveler - with a sunburned face, a tangled mess of black hair and beard, a coarse red woolen hat, a ragged assortment of self-woven fabrics and furry animal skins, a strong build that had weakened from lack of food, lips tightly pressed in despair and irritation in his sleep - he inspired awe in the road worker. The traveler had journeyed many miles, his feet swollen, ankles blistered and bleeding, his bulky shoes stuffed with grass and leaves were too heavy to drag along the long road, his clothes torn and full of holes, and his body covered in sores. Stooping beside him, the road worker tried to see if there were any hidden weapons on the traveler; but in vain, for the man slept with his arms firmly crossed over his chest, as resolute as his tightly pressed lips. Fortresses with high walls, deep moats, watchtowers, barred gates, and drawbridges seemed meaningless to the road worker as he looked at this sleeping figure. And when he looked up and around the horizon, in his mind he imagined similar figures, unstoppable, heading towards the cities across France.",11.916,11.405,"When the road worker returned to his dusty job and the clouds dispersed in the sky, making way for bright rays that cast silvery glimmers on the scenery, the small man (now wearing a red hat instead of his blue one) seemed mesmerized by the man lying on this pile of stones. His eyes frequently drifted to the man, and he used his tools almost absentmindedly, even a bit clumsily. The man's bronze face, his tangled hair and beard, his red woolen hat, his handmade outfit pieced together from various cheap fabrics and hides, his strong body thinned from a life of scarcity, and his lips tightly shut in a sullen and hopeless manner as he slept, evoked a mixture of respect and fear in the road worker. It was evident that the traveler had come from a very long distance; his feet were swollen and covered in wounds. It must have been difficult to drag those large shoes filled with leaves and grass for so many hours, and just as he was battered, his clothes were also torn and tattered. The road worker bent over the man to see if he was hiding a weapon in his bosom, but it was in vain, for the man had his arms tightly crossed over his chest, just like his lips. The road worker thought that cities protected by embankments, watchtowers, gates, ditches, and drawbridges were nothing for a figure of this stature. When he lifted his eyes from the man and looked at the horizon, he vaguely saw that such unstoppable men covered all of France.",13.944,13.522,"A strange fascination was exerted by the traveler's figure lying on the pile of stones over the road worker, whose cap was no longer blue, as before, but red. Engaged in his rough task, he so frequently turned his eyes towards the sleeper that it can be said he handled his tools in a mechanical manner and with scant results. The bronzed face, the tousled black hair and thick beard of the same color, the red cap made of coarse wool, the rough cloth suit, the robust constitution slightly diminished by deprivations, and the rigid and violent compression of the traveler's lips, filled the road worker with fear. The unknown man must have traveled great distances, judging by his blistered feet and his chafed and bleeding ankles. The road worker tried to see if the sleeper was carrying weapons or not, but in vain, as the sleeper's arms, crossed over his chest, prevented it. Fortresses, walled enclosures, deep ditches, and drawbridges must have been minor obstacles for men like him; and when the road worker, taking his eyes off him, raised them and looked around, he believed he saw with his imagination men like him who, blind to obstacles, ran determinedly from the periphery towards the center of France.",6.654,5.867

When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed, as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle, chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.","The road worker headed back, the dust on the road ahead swirling with the wind, and soon he reached the water fountain, squeezing in among the bony cows being led to drink, and it seemed he was whispering secrets for both the village and the cows to hear. When the villagers had finished their modest dinner, they did not climb into bed as usual but instead sat in front of their houses, staying there. The peculiar habit of whispering into each other's ears had infected the entire village, and when they gathered around the fountain in the dark, they caught another peculiar habit of looking in one direction, waiting for something in the sky. Mr. Gabelle, the station commander here, became anxious; he also climbed onto the roof alone to look in that direction, then looked down at the dark faces behind the chimney below and sent a message to the church keyholder that the alarm bell might need to be rung soon.",12.601,11.789,"The road worker, pushing the dust and dirt ahead of him with the blowing wind, moved towards the house and, shortly after reaching the fountain, mingled with the skinny cows brought to drink water, pretended to whisper to them, and whispered something to the whole village.

The strange whisper had spread everywhere, and when the villagers gathered at the fountain in the dark, everyone looked in the same direction in the sky with hopeful eyes, as if it had spread from one to another. Monsieur Gabelle, who was responsible for that region, was alarmed; he climbed to the roof of his house alone and also looked in that direction; he glanced at the increasingly darkening faces at the fountain below from behind the chimneys and soon sent word to the sexton, who kept the church keys, thinking that the bell might need to be rung.",16.301,15.592,"The truck driver returned home, following the cloud of dust raised by his feet and pushed by the wind blowing at his back, and soon found himself by the fountain among tightly packed herds of skinny cows brought there to drink.

Everyone spoke in very low voices, as if whispering in each other's ears had become fashionable, and everyone had their eyes fixed on the horizon, the most curious thing being that they all looked in the same direction. Mr. Gabelle, the chief authority of the village, began to feel strange unease. After climbing to the roof of his house and looking from there towards the point on the horizon that seemed to exert such fascination over the usually calm villagers, and after examining, sheltered behind the chimney, the somber faces of those gathered around the fountain, he sent word to the sacristan, who was in charge of the church keys, that perhaps that night there might be a need to ring the alarm bell.",11.697,10.936
2043,"The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all was black again.","The night thickened. The rows of trees surrounding the ancient castle, isolating this building, moved with the rising wind as if they were threatening the massive, dark structure in the darkness. The rain lashed wildly down the two staircases leading up to the corridor, pounding on the large main door, thundering as if a messenger were urgently alerting those inside; fierce gusts of wind slipped into the great hall, howling through the old spears and hunting knives, then moaning up the stairs, shaking the curtains covering the bed where the last Marquis lay asleep. From the four directions of east, west, south, and north, through the forest, four disheveled figures, their footsteps crushing tall grass and breaking fallen branches, cautiously advanced to the meeting point in the castle courtyard.

From the east, west, north, and south, four ragged-looking men emerged from among the trees, walking cautiously with large steps, crushing the tall grass and snapping the branches as they moved towards the courtyard.

The two monumental staircases on the terrace seemed like overflowing torrents whose turbulent flow crashed thunderously against the main door, akin to a swift messenger trying to wake those sleeping inside. The gale penetrated through the spacious galleries, whipping the spears, swords, knives, and pikes that decorated the walls, and, ascending the stairs, stirred the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis had rested. Confused figures, coming from the East and the West, the North and the South, trampled the overgrown grass of the forest and cautiously advanced towards the castle courtyard, where they gathered. Four lights emerged, moving in opposite directions, and everything returned to darkness seconds later.",13.499,12.76

Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front, picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches, and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter. Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.","But not long after. Immediately after that, the castle began to take shape in a strange way with a self-illuminating light, as if it were gradually radiating a halo.

2045,"A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur Gabelle’s door. “Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!” The tocsin rang impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the sky. “It must be forty feet high,” said they, grimly; and never moved.","Around the castle echoed the murmurs of a few people still living there, and the sound of horses being saddled and then galloping away swiftly.

""Help, Gabelle! Help, everyone!"" The urgent alarm bells rang out but no one came to assist. The road worker and his two hundred and fifty friends just stood with their arms crossed at the fountain, watching the column of fire blaze against the sky.

""Help, Gabelle! Help!"" The bell was ringing impatiently, but there was no one else to help. The road worker and his two hundred and fifty companions stood with their arms crossed in front of the fountain, watching the flames rising to the sky.

The alarm bell rings out, but aside from this aid, if it can be called that, the rider receives none.

2047,"As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred and fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything, occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary’s part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with, and that post-horses would roast.","As the horse rider clattered down the hill and crossed the road, the whole village was brightly lit. The road worker and his two hundred and fifty friends, excited by the fire, unanimously rushed home to light candles in every frosted glass window. Lack of everything was the common state, so the villagers had to force Mr. Gabelle to temporarily lend them some candles; and while this official was still reluctant and hesitating, the road worker, who usually cowered before authority, now spoke up, saying that if they set fire to Gabelle's carriages, they would burn fiercely and roast the entire relay station's horses.",8.305,6.558,"As the horseman descended the hill and passed through the village again, the village had begun to light up. The road worker and his two hundred and fifty companions, moved by the idea of illuminating the surroundings, rushed to their homes like a single man and woman and placed a candle in front of each dim windowpane. Since candles, like everything else, were scarce, they demanded candles from Monsieur Gabelle in an authoritative manner, and when this important figure acted reluctantly and hesitantly, even the road worker, who had once been so obedient to authority, suggested that the carriages were quite suitable for lighting bonfires and that it would be good to cook the post coach's horses on them.",10.784,9.369,"The rider descends again, crosses the village street, and sees with astonishment that all the houses are illuminated. How did the miracle happen? In the simplest way. The road worker and his two hundred and fifty personal friends had the whim to light up their houses.

The official shows hesitations, resistances, and in his view, the road worker, who was once so submissive to his authority, hints to his two hundred and fifty personal friends that the carriages, conveniently broken into pieces, provide excellent torches, and that the post horses are begging to be roasted.",9.794,8.404
2048,"The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake and contending with the fire.","The castle was left to burn to ashes. Amidst the roaring flames, a blazing gust of wind blew straight from inside out as if trying to sweep away the building. In the flickering, intense firelight, the stone statues' faces looked as if they were being tortured.

Great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next destination.

2050,"Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes—though it was but a small instalment of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter days—became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon, Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet, and crush a man or two below.","Not only that. Dizzy from hunger, fire, and the sound of bells, the villagers began to think that Mr. Gabelle must be involved in the collection of rent taxes, even though Gabelle had only collected small taxes in recent days and had not collected any rent; so they impatiently demanded an explanation, gathering to surround the station and insisting that this official come out to speak with them directly. Meanwhile, Mr. Gabelle had locked the door tightly and retreated inside to question himself. The result of that self-conversation was that Gabelle once again went up to the roof to stand behind the cluster of chimneys; this time he was determined (being a small-built man from the South with a combative nature) that if the villagers broke in, he would throw himself over the edge of the roof and jump into the crowd, crushing a few people below.",12.92,12.18,"It wasn't just these; hunger, fire, and the incessant ringing of bells had left the villagers, who were already frustrated with Gabelle for collecting rent and taxes –though Gabelle was collecting taxes in small amounts and no longer collecting rent– eager to meet with him, surrounding his house and calling him out to speak face-to-face. Upon this, Monsieur Gabelle tightly bolted his door and retreated to his room to decide what to do. After pondering for a while, he decided to climb onto the roof of his house and hide behind the chimneys; this time he was determined, if they broke down the door and came in, he would jump over the railings (after all, he was a small but vengeful southerner) and crush a few of them to death.",12.236,11.275,"And it didn't stop there: the village, whose mind seemed to have been suddenly cleared by hunger, flames, and the voices of the alarm bell, which now rang with joy, suspecting that Mr. Gabelle might have something to do with the collection of rents and taxes, although truth be told, the good Gabelle had not collected any taxes in the previous days, and only some overdue rents, wished to have an interview with him, and to that end, surrounded his house and invited him to come out to the street, where they could confer personally. Mr. Gabelle responded by solidly barricading his door and retreating to the most hidden room, in order to hold the conference with himself. The result of this one-person conference was that the good Gabelle climbed back up to the roof of his house and hid behind the chimneys, resolved, in case the villagers broke down the front door, to throw himself headfirst from the roof to the street in order to crush under the weight of his body one or two of those who so eagerly wished to confer with him. Do not be surprised by his decision: Gabelle was a southerner with a vengeful character.",11.553,11.012
2051,"Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door, combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate, which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour. A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed, and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while.","Perhaps Mr. Gabelle had spent a long night on the rooftop, with the castle in the distance as a lantern, and the sound of knocking along with the jubilant church bells as music; not to mention the ominous light swaying across the street in front of the post station gate, where the lively villagers wanted to hang him instead. A perilous and tense situation to endure the entire summer night on that dark brink, ready to plunge into the sea of people as Mr. Gabelle had resolved! But the friendly dawn finally arrived, the village candle wicks had burned out, the people cheerfully dispersed, and Mr. Gabelle descended from the rooftop, temporarily preserving his life.",16.764,15.757,"The night, accompanied by the image of the distant castle that gave him warmth and light, the knocking door, and the cheerful bell music, probably seemed never-ending for Monsieur Gabelle; the ominous lamp swinging directly opposite the post office door only added salt to the wound, as the villagers were very eager to use it in his honor. Spending an entire summer night waiting on the shore of a dark ocean, ready to jump at any moment according to his decision, was a highly distressing situation for Monsieur Gabelle! But finally, when the sweet dawn broke, and the flickering candles burning in the village melted away, people dispersed in joy, and Monsieur Gabelle, with his life still intact for now, descended.",10.159,8.788,"It is more than likely that the night seemed eternal to Mr. Gabelle, for it is indeed not very pleasant to spend it on the roof, watching from afar the sinister glow of a burning castle, listening to the blows that an enraged crowd delivers against the door of his house, and above all, seeing a lantern hanging from its post, which the crowd looked at from time to time with the desire to replace it with another object, which very well could be his body. It is indeed sad to spend an entire summer night on the eaves of a roof, watching at your feet an ocean of tumultuous black waves, and resolved to throw yourself headfirst into its center; but at last a cheerful dawn appeared, the lights went out, the crowd dispersed, and Mr. Gabelle was able to come out of the ordeal alive.",6.696,5.324

But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West, North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned.

Spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be. Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson’s was a munificent house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made provident remittances to Tellson’s, were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren. To which it must be added that every new-comer from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson’s, almost as a matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellson’s was at that time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous, that Tellson’s sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran through Temple Bar to read.","Of course, the headquarters and the meeting place of the high-ranking French officials in London was Tellson's Bank. It is believed that ghosts often frequent the places they visited most when they were alive, and the destitute nobles now frequent the place that once held their wealth. Moreover, it was the place where news from France arrived the fastest and was the most reliable. Furthermore, Tellson's was a generous firm, extremely kind to its former clients who had fallen on hard times. Additionally, there were nobles who foresaw the coming storm and, fearing robbery or confiscation, prudently entrusted their money to Tellson's, making it also a place where their impoverished brethren came to inquire. It should be added that anyone newly arrived from France would come to Tellson's to report news and describe the situation, which was almost inevitable. For these reasons, Tellson's at that time resembled a hub for information exchange from France; this was well-known, and people flocked there in such numbers to inquire about news that Tellson's often had to briefly note the latest news and post it on the bank's window for all those passing by Temple Bar to read.",10.941,10.244,"Naturally, the headquarters of the Monsignor in London and the meeting place with others was Tellson Bank.

Furthermore, Tellson Bank was a generous institution and behaved with great liberality towards its former clients who had lost their property. Additionally, some nobles, who foresaw the approaching storm and expected looting and foreclosure, prudently transferred their money to Tellson in England, which was known to other impoverished members of the order. It should be added at this point that every newcomer from France both provided information about themselves and brought news to Tellson. For these reasons, at that time, Tellson had become a kind of information repository for the French; this was well known by the public, and the number of those asking questions to obtain information had increased so much that Tellson sometimes posted the latest news in a few lines on the windows of the bank for those coming and going at Temple Bar to read.",11.463,10.811,"As is natural, the headquarters, the meeting center of the gentry in London was the Tellson Bank. They say that spirits haunt the places where their bodies are buried, and in accordance with this law, the penniless gentleman haunted the place where in better times his money had been deposited. Moreover, the Tellson Bank was the center where news from France arrived most quickly: it extended its generosity to the point of making advances to those who had been its clients in prosperous times; it kept immense sums deposited by nobles who, more foresighted than the majority, saw the storm brewing and preempted thefts and confiscations, and finally, all the people arriving from France began by showing up at the Tellson Bank, where they recounted the latest events. For all these various reasons, the Tellson Bank at that time was a kind of Stock Exchange Palace as far as French matters or people were concerned, a circumstance so well known to the public, and which gave rise to so many questions and commissions, that the latest news was often posted on placards hung from the building's windows, so that all who passed in front of the Temple Bar could read them.",12.539,11.947

So, if someone has to rush over there to carefully select those documents, bury them or store them in a safe place, it can only be me who is capable of doing it, and it must be done urgently.

The shame rose to his face with such force that while he walked aimlessly without knowing what resolution to adopt, he didn't even dare to look at the passersby.",11.362,9.789
2118,"He knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold, he had acted imperfectly. He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie, his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own mind, had been hurried and incomplete. He knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant to do it, and that it had never been done.","He knew very well that he had acted negligently in the horror of the events that had pushed the infamy and vile actions of this ancient family to the extreme, in the suspicion and resentment towards his uncle, in the disgust he felt for the crumbling pillars of the society he should have supported. He knew very well that it was because of his love for Lucie that he had hastily and carelessly abandoned his social status, even though this intention had been harbored in his heart for a long time. He knew that he should have resolved it in proper order and overseen the matter; he had the means to do so but did not follow through.",17.852,16.86,"The fear created in him by the evil deeds of his old family and their bad reputation, the hurtful suspicions he harbored towards his uncle, and the dissatisfaction awakened in his conscience by the scattered pieces he needed to gather made him aware that he was not behaving as he should. He was also fully aware that his renunciation of his social status for his love for Lucie, although not a new thought in his mind, was rushed and incomplete. He knew that he needed to handle and manage this matter systematically, but it hadn't happened.",17.708,16.922,"He knew very well that, driven by the horror of the deed that put a fitting end to the misdeeds and the terrible reputation of his ancient family, prompted by the suspicions his uncle had inspired in him and by the aversion with which his conscience viewed the ruinous factory that, according to his lineage, he was duty-bound to sustain and strengthen, he had acted in an imperfect manner. He knew very well that by yielding to the love he felt for Lucía, by renouncing the position he was supposed to occupy in society, he had rushed into things, he had acted with reprehensible recklessness. He knew very well that his resolution should have been carried out personally, as he knew he had intended to do so, and that, nevertheless, he did not do it.",17.701,16.951
2119,"The happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week following made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of these circumstances he had yielded:—not without disquiet, but still without continuous and accumulating resistance. That he had watched the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from France by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out, was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in France that might impeach him for it.","He knew very well that, for his own happiness, he had chosen England as his home, needing a stable job amidst the rapid and chaotic upheavals of the times, with events succeeding each other so quickly that last week's work was unfinished before this week's tasks ended it, and next week's issues were already poised to arise; all of this swept him along with the circumstances - it wasn't that Darnay didn't blame himself, but he couldn't resist the relentless and overwhelming cycle. Indeed, he was still waiting for an opportunity to act, but the timing kept shifting and delaying until it was too late; now the nobility was fleeing France on every road, properties were being confiscated and destroyed, even identities were being erased; Darnay himself knew this as well as any new government in France, who could very well punish him.",5.538,4.16,"His own family happiness, the necessity of being constantly occupied with work, all the changes and troubles were following one another at such a great speed that the events of this week were obliterating the undeveloped plans of the previous week, everything was being planned anew for the next week, and Darnay felt the weight of all these developments that he let flow over him; he was not without anxiety, but he also did not have a constant and steadily increasing resistance. He was observing the developing events, changes, and struggles from where he stood each passing day; Darnay knew as well as the new authority in France, which was least likely to accuse him, that the nobles in France were fleeing by any means they could find, their properties were being confiscated and destroyed, and their names were being erased one by one.",13.569,12.773,"The happiness of the home that had been created in London, the need to lead an active life, the continuous upheavals of the time, so abrupt and so rapid that plans not well matured the previous week fell apart the following week under the overwhelming force of new events, were weighty circumstances to which he yielded; he knew it very well; but it was also not hidden from him that, if he yielded to the force of circumstances with reluctance, he did not attempt to oppose them with continuous and formal resistance. His conscience told him that he wished to act and that several times he had been lurking for the opportunity; but it added that just as many times he let the opportunity pass, while the nobility fled from France by all roads and paths, while their properties were confiscated and destroyed, and even the names of those who had until then been favored by fortune were erased from the book of life.",7.381,5.932
2120,"But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own bread. Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little there was to give—such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summer—and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his own safety, so that it could not but appear now.","But he did not oppress anyone, he did not imprison anyone; he did not even demand to enjoy a status befitting his position but voluntarily gave up all his titles, renounced all privileges to dive into life, find a place for himself, and make a living on his own. According to the directive written by his own hand, Mr. Gabelle managed that depleted estate, exempting the people from taxes, sharing with them whatever could be shared - a bit of dry wood in the winter that the usurers could not seize, a few vegetables in the summer that the sharks could not take - and surely Gabelle had brought this up to plead and prove, for his own safety, hence the current situation.",9.156,8.07,"He had never oppressed anyone, never had anyone arrested; he had not collected taxes from the people by force, and when giving away his possessions, he did so willingly. He had thrown himself into a world where he had no privileges, achieved something through his own efforts, and earned his own bread. Mr. Gabelle had managed the land in accordance with written orders, distributing the basic necessities to people little by little – firewood in winter as much as the cruel creditors allowed, and in summer, crops to the extent they could wrest from them – and of course, Gabelle, albeit late, had presented this situation as evidence in his defense to save his life.",10.345,9.288,"But on the other hand, he had oppressed no one, he had sent no one to jail. Far from having trampled on anyone to collect his rents, he had freely and spontaneously abandoned his property, sought refuge in a foreign nation, and earned the bread he put in his mouth through his own effort. Mr. Gabelle had administered an impoverished estate according to written instructions that directed him to treat the people well, to give them what little could be given... firewood to keep warm in winter and some fruits to help them through the summer, as the creditors allowed nothing else... and surely he would have cited these facts in his defense. These were public facts, facts that could easily be proven; and if the facts in question justified the administrator before the people, it goes without saying that they were a patent of friendship with the people in favor of the one who issued the orders that he followed.",10.847,10.08

2122,"Yes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind drifted him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible attraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there, trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy and humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison (injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur, which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were coarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle’s letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his justice, honour, and good name.","Yes. Like the sailor in the old tale, the storms have driven him into the magnetic field of the Magnetic Mountain, he is being drawn in, and he must go. Every thought that appeared in his mind pulled him, faster and faster, more and more surely, towards that terrible gravitational pull. The long-standing simmering discomfort was precisely the fact that his unfortunate country was being used by bad means to achieve bad ends, something he knew better than anyone: he himself was not there to try to prevent some of this bloodshed and to speak out for tolerance and humanity. Half suppressed, half reproachful, that discomfort made Darnay bitterly compare himself to the old, conscientious man at the bank; then immediately after, he bitterly thought of the mocking words of the nobles who had insulted him, the words of Stryver, full of spite and insolence due to old grudges. And finally, he thought of Gabelle's letter: an innocent prisoner, close to death, pleading for justice, honor, and his reputation.",14.326,13.771,"Here. Just like the sailor in the old story, he was being drifted towards the Magnet Stone Cliff by winds and currents, and Paris was drawing him in the same way, and he had to go. Everything that came to his mind was dragging him towards this terrible center of attraction with greater speed and even more stability. While the sorrowful lands had fallen into the hands of ill-intentioned people, his mere sitting there made Darnay very uneasy, and he could do nothing to stop the flowing blood, only hoping for mercy and humanity. Under the influence of this uneasiness that both suffocated and saddened him, he found himself comparing with the brave and old gentleman with a strong sense of duty; immediately after this touching comparison (which was quite humiliating for him), he remembered Monsignor's sarcastic and mocking words and Stryver's rude and hurtful remarks regarding old matters. As if these were not enough, he then thought of Gabelle's letter; an innocent prisoner in mortal danger was seeking help from his justice, honor, and high name.",10.668,9.889,"Yes. Similar to the sailor from the ancient legend, the winds and currents had dragged him until they placed his ship within the radius of influence of the Magnetic Mountain, and it attracted him with an increasingly irresistible force. All the thoughts that germinated in his mind impelled him, pushed him towards the center of that terrible attraction. His initial impatience obeyed the thought that his unfortunate homeland, guided by bad instruments, pursued bad objectives and was running headlong into the abyss, while he, who perhaps could have given a better direction to the national aspirations, remained in London without intervening, without attempting something that would put an end to the brutal effusion of blood, something that would secure the rights to mercy, to humanity, unknown at the time. When those remorseful feelings were already stirring in his soul, the conduct of the elderly Lorry came to multiply their strength a hundredfold, as he, obedient to the voice of duty, hastened to face the tremendous risks involved in a journey to France under those circumstances, and if that were not enough, there came the comments of the gentlemen, comments that deeply wounded him, and those of Stryver, a thousand times harsher than those of the others. All this was followed by the letter from Gabelle, the letter of an innocent prisoner who, coming to the edge of the grave, made a desperate appeal to his justice, to his honor, and to his name.",10.663,10.165

2124,"Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The intention with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert it. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging Revolution that was running so fearfully wild.","Yes. The Magnetic Rock was drawing him in, and he had to rush towards it, until he faced it head-on. He did not see the danger; he did not know the risk. He only thought about completing what had been left unfinished, believing that once he returned to France, merely presenting that intention would be happily accepted. Then, in Darnay's mind, appeared the glorious prospect of noble deeds, the optimistic illusion often seen in kind-hearted people; he even imagined himself having the power to lead the fierce Revolution that was raging savagely and brutally.",9.721,7.86,"Yes. The Magnetic Stone Cliff was pulling Darnay towards itself, and he had to keep going until he crashed into the cliffs. Darnay was unaware of the rock; he saw no danger in this. Even if he left what he intended to do unfinished, when he went to France and explained it, it would be met with great appreciation. Then the splendid image of this good deed appeared before him like an optimistic mirage belonging to many noble minds, and he even imagined that it had the power to influence this furious revolution advancing with a terrible madness.",10.134,8.747,"Yes. The Magnetized Mountain was pulling him, and there was no other choice but to steer the bow of his skiff towards it. He was unaware that there were reefs in the seas he was about to sail, nor did he believe that the voyage would pose any dangers to him. The intention that guided him to act as he had, even if his work had remained incomplete, seemed to him more than sufficient to earn him the gratitude of France, as soon as he set foot on its soil and asserted the rights that supported him. Before his eyes rose the glorious vision of having acted rightly, and he even began to harbor illusions that he would have some influence in steering that horrendous revolution, which had risen with such uncontrollable fury, threatening to destroy everything in existence.",7.709,6.189
2125,"As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone. Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old, should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in the balance of suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not discuss with himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence in his course.","While coming and going with his resolved intention, he was determined not to let either Lucie or her father know about this until the very last moment. He had to spare Lucie the sorrow of parting; to spare her father from the anxiety and worry—the doctor did not want to recall the dangerous homeland, so when he found out, it would already be done. His difficult situation was very similar to Dr. Manette's, although he did not discuss it with him to avoid bringing up old connections from the time in France. But that very situation also influenced Darnay's decision.",6.318,4.738,"With this decision in mind, while walking up and down the street, he decided that neither Lucie nor Doctor Manette should be aware of it until he left. Lucie should not experience the pain of separation, and her father, who was always ready to return to the dangerous old days, should see it not as a cause for worry and suspicion but as a step taken. Since he avoided with sorrowful anxiety evoking the old days in France in the Doctor's mind, it was debatable how appropriate it would be to talk to him about the void inside. But this was a matter in itself.",14.873,13.87,"Having made his decision, he believed that neither Lucie nor Doctor Manette should know about it until he had put it into practice. As for Lucie, it was only natural to spare her the pain of separation, and as for her father, whose aversion to thinking about the places where he had endured so much suffering in past years was so strong, it was also best not to speak to him about the plan, but rather about its execution, the only way to avoid causing him painful doubts.",8.393,7.22

2147,"The traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory; but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these. Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them, inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own, turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.","The traveler took a long time to traverse the distance from England to Paris in the autumn of 1792. So many bad roads, poor carriages, and exhausted horses ready to hinder the journey even though the unfortunate king of France was still reigning gloriously on the throne; but changing times brought forth many more obstacles. Every city gate and village toll station had groups of patriotic Citizens armed with muskets ready to fire, stopping everyone passing through, questioning, checking papers, cross-referencing names with their lists, turning people back, letting them through, or detaining and arresting them, depending on their judgment or whims, which they deemed best for the early days of the United Indivisible Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.",15.114,14.493,"In the autumn of 1792, the traveler who set out from England to go to France progressed slowly on his way. Even if the unfortunate King of France had been sitting on his throne in all his splendor, he would have been delayed in reaching his destination due to all those bad roads, poor equipment, and bad horses, but the changing times harbored other obstacles as well. At the entrance of each village and in front of the tax office, a group of patriots, with rifles ready to fire in their hands, stopped passersby, subjected them to cross-examination, examined their documents, checked their names against their own lists, and in the name of the approaching ""Republic and Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death,"" they either sent them back, allowed them to continue on their way, or stopped and arrested them, whichever they deemed most appropriate at the moment.",22.062,21.474,"Little by little, the traveler shortened the distance that separated him from Paris. We are in the autumn of the year seventeen ninety-two. He would not have lacked detestable roads, terrible carriages, and horses afflicted by old age that hindered his progress, even if the dethroned king of France had continued to occupy his throne and reign amidst splendors of glory; but aside from those obstacles, the alteration of the times had accumulated a thousand more. All the city gates, all the town entrances, were manned by bands of patriotic citizens, armed with national muskets ready to fire on their own, who stopped everyone entering or leaving, to subject them to strict interrogations, meticulously examine their documents, see if their names appeared on the lists they had, and either allow them to continue their journey or arrest them, as their whim advised, for the good of the newly born One and Indivisible Republic, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.",17.626,17.027
2148,"A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey’s end. Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and England. The universal watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net, or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone.","Only a few miles into his journey on French soil, Charles Darnay began to realize that there was no hope of returning as long as he was not recognized as a good Citizen in Paris. Now, no matter what happened, he had to see the journey through to the end. No sorrowful village had yet slammed its gates on him, no public barrier had yet blocked the road behind him, but he knew that yet another difficult threshold had been added to the long series of obstacles standing between him and England. Wherever he went, he was closely watched as if he had fallen into a trap or was being transported in a cage to his destination; he could not have imagined losing his freedom so completely.",21.696,20.951,"Charles Darnay realized that very shortly after arriving on French soil, it was impossible to return from these roads until he was declared a good citizen in Paris. Whatever happened to him, he had to go to the end of the road. No village had turned him back, no barrier had been set in his way yet, but it felt to him as if there was a tightly bolted iron gate stretching between himself and England. He was in such great anxiety that even if he had been caught in a net or was being taken to his destination in a cage, he could not have felt his freedom being taken away as much as he did.",22.076,21.359,"Charles Darnay had traveled very few leagues of French territory when he began to realize the impossibility he would face in treading those eternal roads again, unless he was first declared a good citizen of Paris. But he could no longer turn back; whatever fate destiny had in store for him, he had no choice but to continue the journey to the end. Behind him, he left an open road, free of barriers and ditches, but nonetheless, he knew that between England and himself stood obstacles a thousand times more insurmountable than the strongest iron gates. Such was the universal vigilance surrounding him, that if he had been traveling within the meshes of a thick steel net, or well confined inside a cage, he would not have considered his freedom more lost.",15.161,14.266
2149,"This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had been days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.","The constant surveillance not only blocked his way on the highway twenty times in one stretch but also delayed his journey twenty times a day. People rode horses to catch him and make him turn back, rushed ahead to intercept him, rode alongside him, and guarded him closely. For several days, he had been wandering alone in France, and when night fell, he was exhausted on the bed in a small town inn by the main road, with Paris still far away.",13.668,12.08,"This great unease not only made him stop twenty times a day on the road, but also delayed him twenty times from his path; sometimes a rider would come from behind and turn him back from his path; sometimes he would suddenly become suspicious while going ahead and stop him; sometimes he would go alongside him, not taking his eyes off him. When he threw himself into bed in a small town on his way, still very far from Paris, in an utterly exhausted state, days had passed since his solitary journey in France had begun.",6.131,4.301,"That universal surveillance not only forced him to stop twenty times a day on the main roads, at the post relays, but also hindered and delayed his progress just as many times each day, sometimes catching up with him and ordering him to turn back, sometimes accompanying him and preventing him from advancing as quickly as he desired. He had been traveling through French territory for several days when one night he went to bed early in an inn in a small, insignificant town, located quite far from Paris.",12.467,10.792
2150,"Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle’s letter from his prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far. His difficulty at the guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis. And he was, therefore, as little surprised as a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.","If he had not presented the letter from the wretched Gabelle sent from the Abbaye prison, he would not have been able to get this far. The guard post of this small town had harassed him to the point that he felt this journey had reached a perilous stage. Therefore, he was not surprised when he found himself being awakened in the middle of the night at the inn where he had rented a room to wait until morning.",13.853,12.243,"Nothing but the sorrowful letter from Gabelle in the Abbaye Prison could have brought him this far. They had cornered him so much at the police station in this small place that he had the feeling his journey would end here. Therefore, he was not at all surprised when someone came to the small inn where he was staying in the middle of the night and woke him up.",16.87,15.474,"To the letter that Gabelle sent him from the Abbey prison, he owed having come so far, but upon reaching the town we are talking about, he was met with so many difficulties at the gates that he understood the crisis was very near.

""Calm down, aristocrat!""",10.945,7.508,"—Silence!—shouted a red cap, striking the bed with the butt of the musket. —Shut up, aristocrat!",15.904,11.146

2159,"Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by a watch-fire.

2160,"The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either side of him.","The escort group consisted of two patriots wearing red hats adorned with the tricolor emblem, carrying guard muskets and curved swords, riding horses on either side of Darnay.",15.942,11.872,"Two escorts with red caps and badges, on their horses, advanced on either side of Darnay with their rifles and cavalry swords in hand.",18.02,13.876,"The escort consisted of two mounted patriots, who rode at their sides, with red caps adorned with tricolor cockades, and they were armed with muskets and national sabers.",16.038,12.165

In this state they traversed without change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay between them and the capital.","The escorted person rode a horse alone, but a slack rope was tied to his reins, with the other end wrapped around the wrists of the two patriots. Thus, they set off in the face-stinging rain, the horses clattering like heavy cavalry on the town's rough cobblestone streets, and proceeded to the main muddy roads. In this manner, they sped along the distant roads, only pausing to change horses or adjust their pace, traveling straight through the muddy miles to the capital.",9.93,7.835,"Although the escorted man managed his own horse, a rope was tied to its reins, and one of the citizens had wrapped the other end of the rope around his own wrist.

Without making any changes during the journey other than switching horses, they finally reached the capital.",9.377,7.532
2162,"They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly clothed, that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for, he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations, confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.","They traveled all night, stopping only an hour or two after dawn, and rested until dusk. The two escorts were so poorly dressed that they wrapped straw around their bare feet and covered their tattered shoulders with straw to keep the rain off. Apart from his personal discomfort at being taken away and the constant worry about the ever-present danger posed by a perpetually drunken patriot carelessly wielding a musket, Charles Darnay felt no fear of being treated as a prisoner; for he believed that this general situation had nothing to do with his specific case, and it would end as soon as he explained his reason for returning to France, which would be confirmed by the prisoner at Abbaye prison.",10.291,9.254,"They traveled throughout the night and took a break a couple of hours after dawn, resting until dusk fell. The escorts' clothing was so shabby that the men had wrapped straw around their bare legs and covered their tattered shoulders with the same straw to protect themselves from the rain. Despite the discomfort of being followed so closely and the danger posed by one of the escorts carelessly carrying a rifle while constantly drinking, Charles Darnay tried to keep his heart light and not let the pressure weigh him down; for it was pointless to fear an unopened case and the kind of statements that a prisoner in the Abbaye could approve of.",7.775,6.273,"They traveled during the night, stopping an hour or two before daybreak, and sleeping until the twilight of the afternoon. The escort dressed in such extreme poverty that to cover their bare legs, they had to resort to straw, with which they padded them. Apart from the inconveniences of the journey, the annoyance of being escorted, and the inherent dangers of depending on patriots who were chronically drunk and armed with muskets that fired on their own, Charles Darnay could dismiss all kinds of fears, since it was to be expected that, as soon as he referred to his merits, which would be confirmed by the prisoner of the Abbey, they would hasten to treat him as a man friendly to the people.",12.193,11.078
2163,"But when they came to the town of Beauvais—which they did at eventide, when the streets were filled with people—he could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming.

2226,"Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat; otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal family. The few words that he caught from this man’s lips, first made it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him.","Charles Darnay found that making another request would be futile, moreover, his pride would be hurt. As they walked quietly, he couldn't help but notice that the people had become too accustomed to the sight of prisoners being escorted through the streets. Even children didn't bother to pay attention to him. A few people passing by turned to look, a few others gestured at him as if he were a nobleman; besides that, a well-dressed person going to prison was no more remarkable than a laborer in shabby clothes going to work. In a narrow, dark, filthy street they passed through, an enthusiastic orator stood on a stool, speaking to an eager crowd about the crimes against the people committed by the king and the royal family. Now, hearing a few words from this person, Charles Darnay learned that the king had been imprisoned and all foreign envoys had left Paris, leaving no one behind. On the way (except when in Beauvais), he hadn't heard any news. The escort and the surveillance everywhere had completely isolated him.",23.77,23.275,"Darnay felt that there was no point in pleading any further, moreover, his pride was hurt. As he proceeded in silence, he saw how familiar the public was with prisoners passing by. Except for a few children, no one noticed him. Two or three passersby turned their heads to look, and a few, thinking he was an aristocrat, pointed their fingers and shook them; after all, a well-dressed man being taken to prison had become as normal as a worker going to his job in his work clothes. In a narrow, dark, and dirty street they passed, an excited speaker standing on a stool was telling an enthusiastic crowd about the crimes the king and the royal family had committed against the people. As far as Charles Darnay could catch from this man's lips, the king was in prison and all the foreign ambassadors had left Paris. He had heard nothing on the road (except outside Beauvais). His escorts and his great anxiety must have isolated him from everything.",22.595,22.082,"Darnay fell silent, both because he considered all chances of obtaining even the slightest favor from that man to be definitively lost, and because his wounded pride led him to view his pleas as humiliations. He couldn't help but notice, as he silently walked through the streets, how accustomed the people were to the sight of prisoners passing by. Not even the children paid attention to him. Some passersby turned their heads and pointed at him, indicating that he was an aristocrat, and nothing more. Indeed, seeing a well-dressed man being taken to prison was as common and natural as seeing a worker heading to his job with his tools in hand. In a narrow, dark, and dirty alley they had to cross, they encountered a highly agitated street orator, delivering fervent speeches to an equally agitated audience, extolling the crimes committed against the sovereign people by the King, the royal family, and the nobles. From the few words that reached Darnay's ears, he was able to infer that the King had been imprisoned and that foreign ambassadors had left Paris en masse, news of which he was entirely unaware, as during his journey, the individuals escorting him, along with the universal surveillance, had kept him in such absolute isolation that he had heard nothing.",11.77,11.116
2227,"That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled as the future was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away. The “sharp female newly-born, and called La Guillotine,” was hardly known to him, or to the generality of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?","Now, of course, he knew that he had fallen into dangers far greater than those that had arisen since he left England. Now, of course, he knew that those dangers were quickly closing in on him and the situation had become increasingly urgent. He had to admit to himself that if he had known about these developments a few days earlier, he would not have taken that trip. However, looking back more clearly later, it would be evident that Darnay's worries were not as dark as he had imagined. Even if the future is uncertain, it remains an unknown future, and it is precisely because of this ambiguity that we still have hope. In his understanding, there was no sign of the horrific massacre that lasted many days and nights, a massacre that, after just a few turns of the clock's hands, had stained an entire season of fortunate achievements with blood; that image was as distant as if it had been a hundred thousand years ago. Neither he nor the French populace knew anything about ""the newly born sharp lady named La Guillotine."" The terrible things that will be done perhaps even at this moment cannot be imagined even by those who will carry them out. So how can a gentle mind possibly envision such things in its own obscure perception?",13.321,12.762,"He knew now that he was in much greater dangers than those he was in when he left England. He also knew now that the threat was rapidly increasing and would continue to increase. If he had known what he would experience in the last few days, he might never have embarked on this journey. Still, his anxieties were not as dark as they seemed; there was a faint light, it seemed. The future was as uncertain as it was troubled, and within all this uncertainty, there was an ignorant hope. The massacre that would begin in a few hours and last for days and nights would stain the sacred harvest time with blood, but to Darnay, it felt like something that would happen a hundred thousand years later. ""The newly born harsh lady guillotine"" was not yet well-known by name. The terrible actions that would soon take place perhaps had not yet formed in the minds of those who would carry them out. How could all these fit into the vague concepts within a polite mind?",10.85,10.158,"As is natural, he understood that the dangers threatening him were infinitely greater and infinitely more numerous than he had supposed when leaving England; he understood that the dangers were multiplying at an alarming rate and that they would multiply even more; he could not help but confess to himself that the idea of making the journey would never have crossed his mind had he foreseen the events that had unfolded in recent days. And yet, his fears, when examined in the light of the most recent incidents, were not as great as they seem they should have been. No matter how nebulous the future appeared to him, it was an unknown future that, in its very obscurity, held a certain hope. As unaware as those who lived thousands of years before him, he was to the horrible massacres that, continuing day after day, night after night, would drown the always blessed harvest season in torrents of blood. He barely knew by name the ""newly born woman called Guillotine,"" just as the general populace barely knew her by name, for in those days, even those who had brought her into the world could not have imagined the dreadful deeds that would soon envelop her in an immense bloody aura.",7.327,5.963

The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women’s lace and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through and through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyes;—eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.","The grindstone had two hand cranks, being frantically turned by two men; the fierce spinning threw their long hair back, exposing two faces more brutal and terrifying than the most savage-looking barbarians.

Look as closely as you might, you couldn't find a single person among them not stained with blood. Clustered around the grindstone were half-naked men, their limbs and bodies smeared with blood; men dressed in rags, those rags also bloodstained; fierce men wearing lace, silk, and ribbons stolen from women, those trinkets too dyed in blood. Axes, knives, bayonets, swords, all waiting to be sharpened, were all stained red. Many large swords were tightly bound to the wielders' wrists with strips of cloth torn from clothing; all sorts of bindings, all soaked in blood.

There was not a single person whose face was not smeared with blood. Half-naked men were trying to reach the grindstone by shouldering each other; their hands and arms were stained all over; their clothes, resembling rags, were stained all over; they were men loaded with lacy, silky, and ribboned spoils they had collected from women, which were finely stained with blood. They had brought a lot of small axes, knives, bayonets, and swords to make them sharper, and they were all covered in blood. Some of these sharp swords were tied to the wrists of those carrying them with linen strips and scraps of clothing. Although the things they tied varied, they were all shades of a single color. As the frenzied carriers of these weapons took them from the sparks and carried them to the streets, the same red had covered their mad eyes; the eyes looked so crazed that anyone who had not turned cruel would give twenty years of their life for the weapon aimed at them to freeze in place.",14.852,14.471,"Two men, whose faces were more horrible and cruel in expression than the fiercest savages when they display their most barbaric garments and paints, were turning the stone.

The crowd paused for a moment, then hurried, then murmured, then the indistinct voice of the doctor; then Mr. Lorry saw Mr. Manette, surrounded by the crowd, standing amidst a group of about twenty people, all shoulder to shoulder, hastily moving out while shouting “Long live the prisoner of the Bastille! Save the relatives of the prisoner of the Bastille who are imprisoned in La Force! Make way for the prisoner of the Bastille! Save the prisoner Evrémonde in La Force!” and a thousand voices echoed in response.",19.56,18.864,"His flowing white hair, striking face, and the hurried confidence in his demeanor carried him through the weapons as if parting water, bringing him instantly to the very center of the crowd. After a few minutes of silence, there was some movement, murmurs; then his incomprehensible voice was heard and at that moment Mr. Lorry saw the Doctor. He was surrounded; standing in the midst of twenty men, shoulder to shoulder, hands on each other's shoulders, shouting in agitation. ""Long live the prisoners of the Bastille! Let's help the prisoner in La Force who is a relative of those in the Bastille! Make way for the Bastille prisoner in the front lines! Let's save Evremonde, the prisoner in La Force!"" and thousands responded.",17.42,16.545,"Her hair white as snow, her face, which could not help but draw attention, the decisiveness with which she pushed away the weapons of that mob of monsters, opened the way for her to the center of the gathering, to the very sharpening stone. Lorry observed that everyone fell silent, that in the midst of a solemn silence the old man's voice rose vibrantly, that everyone listened attentively, that everyone looked at the speaker with the deepest respect; and after a few minutes, he saw that more than twenty men formed a compact group, surrounding the doctor and, enthroning him on their shoulders, they went out into the street shouting with delirious enthusiasm: —Long live the prisoner of the Bastille! —We want the relative of the one from the Bastille imprisoned in La Force! —Make way for the prisoner of the Bastille! —Freedom for the prisoner Evrémonde, confined in La Force!",9.433,8.448
2293,"He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew.","He closed the shutters, his heart pounding, then closed the outer window and drew the curtains, hurriedly going to Lucie to inform her that the townspeople had helped to search for Charles. Lucie was not alone but accompanied by her little girl and Miss Pross; however, it was only much later that Mr. Lorry, sitting and watching them in the familiar stillness of the night, realized this with surprise.",8.305,6.433,"Mr. Lorry, his heart fluttering, closed the cage again, shut the window and the curtains, and hurriedly went to Lucie, telling her that her father had gone with others to look for her husband. He found Lucie with her child and Miss Pross; but for a long time, that is, until he sat down and watched them in the silence of the night, it did not even occur to him to be surprised that they were there.",26.046,24.925,"Lorry closed the window very hopefully, and hurried to join Lucie, to whom he reported that her father, aided by the townspeople, had gone to look for her husband. With Lucie was her daughter and Miss Pross, but such was the confusion of good Lorry that he wasn't even surprised to find them there until much later.",8.12,6.395
2294,"Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet, clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And O the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!","Lucie had by then fallen asleep on the floor at Mr. Lorry's feet, one hand still clutching his. Miss Pross had earlier placed the child on his bed, her head slowly sinking onto the pillow next to this charming responsibility. Oh, how the night dragged on with the sighs of the poor wife! Oh, how the night dragged on with no news of the father who had not returned!",17.216,15.7,"At that moment, Lucie, in a state of unconsciousness, was sitting on the ground by Mr. Lorry's knee, holding tightly to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child on Mr. Lorry's bed, and before long, her own head had fallen onto the pillow right next to her sweet responsibility. The night, oh what a long night it was, accompanied by the poor woman's moans! Oh, throughout that long, very long night, neither had her father returned home, nor had any news arrived!",18.053,16.988,"The night was horrible. Lucía, in a state of stupor, was sitting on the floor wringing her hands, and Miss Pross, after putting the child to bed, succumbed to the sleep that besieged her and fell asleep with her head bent over the child's little bed. Horrible night, during which Lorry had to listen to the constant sobs of the unfortunate Lucía! Horrible night, eternal night, night of anguish, night of anxiety, night spent waiting for the arrival of a father who did not come, the arrival of news of a husband placed at the edge of the grave, and the news did not come!",4.639,3.223
2295,"Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered. “What is it?” cried Lucie, affrighted. “Hush! The soldiers’ swords are sharpened there,” said Mr. Lorry. “The place is national property now, and used as a kind of armoury, my love.”","Twice more in the dark night, the gate bell rang and a crowd surged in, and the grindstone wheel hissed and spun furiously. − What is happening? - Lucie cried out in fear. − Shh! The soldiers' swords are sharpened here, - Mr. Lorry said. - This place is now national property, and it is used as an armory, my dear.",15.583,13.486,"In the darkness, the bell of the large door rang twice more and people poured in again in droves, and the grindstone spun furiously, scattering sparks. ""What is this?"" cried Lucie, in horror. ""Stay calm! The soldiers' swords are being sharpened there!"" said Mr. Lorry. ""This place now belongs to the people, my dear, and is being used as a sort of armory.""",16.604,14.958,"Twice more the gate bell rang violently, twice more the intrusion was repeated, twice more they set the grindstone in motion. Lucía was frightened. —What is that?—he asked. —Silence!—responded Lorry. —It is the soldiers sharpening their swords. The house is now national property, my dear.",6.703,4.646
2296,"Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful. Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air. Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle, climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty cushions.","Then two more times like that; but the last time there were fewer people and it was brief. Right after that, dawn broke and Mr. Lorry gently separated the girl's hand that was tightly holding his, carefully walked to the window and looked out. A man, covered in blood like a severely wounded soldier just regaining consciousness on a massacre battlefield, stood up from the roadside near the grindstone wheel and looked around with a dazed expression. Immediately after that, in the dim light, this exhausted murderer saw a Lord's carriage and staggered towards it, opened the door, climbed in, and closed the door to sleep on the luxurious cushioned benches.",8.644,6.898,"The number of those who came this time was twice that of the previous ones; but by the end of this last mission, they had begun to weaken. Soon after, as dawn began to break, Mr. Lorry gently separated his hand from the one clinging to him and cautiously looked out the window. Standing on the pavement where the grindstone was, a man with a blank expression looked around; his clothes were so dirty that he resembled a wounded soldier crawling back to consciousness from a massacre site. The exhausted villain soon noticed one of Monseigneur's carriages in the dim light, staggered towards the magnificent carriage, climbed the steps, and closed the door to rest on the elegant cushions.",8.368,6.519,"The new day dawned. Lorry managed to free himself from Lucia's clenched hands and looked out the window. Next to the sharpening stone, a man, covered in blood from head to toe, resembling a wounded soldier regaining consciousness on the battlefield, was rising from the ground where he had been lying and looking around with a dazed expression. That killer, tired of killing, saw the lord's magnificent carriages, walked unsteadily to one of them, opened the door, and locked himself inside, ready to rest from the night's exertions on the plush cushions.",10.169,9.048
2297,"The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again, and the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had never given, and would never take away.","The Earth, the great wheel, had completed its turn when Mr. Lorry looked out once more and the sun dyed the outer yard red. But the smaller grindstone wheel still stood solitary there in the tranquil morning, stained red with a color not bestowed by the sunlight, and would never fade.",23.139,21.243,"When Mr. Lorry looked out the window again, the great grindstone called the world was turning, and the sun was painting the courtyard red. But the smaller grindstone, in the morning coolness, stood alone with a redness that the sun never gave and would never take back.",30.434,28.77,"That killer, tired of killing, saw the lord's magnificent carriages, walked unsteadily to one of them, opened the door, and locked himself inside, ready to rest from the night's exertions on the plush cushions.",4.282,2.345

2300,"One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr. Lorry when business hours came round, was this:—that he had no right to imperil Tellson’s by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded for Lucie and her child, without a moment’s demur; but the great trust he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business.","One of the first considerations that arose in Mr. Lorry's professional mind as the work hour approached was the thought: he had no right to endanger Tellson's Bank by sheltering the wife of an exiled prisoner within its walls. He was ready to sacrifice his property and personal safety for Lucie and her little girl without hesitation; but the work entrusted to him was not his own, and with that responsibility, he resolutely placed his duty above all else.",25.608,24.696,"When the working hour arrived, the first thought that occupied Mr. Lorry's work-focused mind was this: Did he have the right to endanger Tellson's by sheltering the wife of a refugee prisoner under the bank's roof? For Lucie and her child, he would unhesitatingly give all his property, even his life, but this great responsibility was not something that belonged solely to him, and when it came to work, he was a serious businessman.",18.774,17.525,"One of the first reflections that Mr. Lorry's practical understanding suggested to him, as soon as the hour to commence the Bank's operations struck the next day, was that he had no right to create difficulties and attract dangers to Tellson's Bank by providing shelter in the building to the wife of an imprisoned emigrant. Without a second of hesitation, with joy, with all his soul, he would have sacrificed everything he possessed, including his freedom and his life, on the altar of the affection he felt for Lucie and her daughter; but the great banking establishment was not his, and when it came to business, Lorry was rigid, inflexible.",17.264,16.363
2301,"At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in its dangerous workings.","At first, his mind thought of Defarge and considered going to that tavern again to ask the innkeeper to introduce him to the safest refuge in the city's madness. But that very consideration made him abandon the idea; Defarge was living right in the most brutal area, certainly had influence there, and was surely deeply involved in the current dangerous situation.",14.523,12.538,"At first, he thought of Defarge and considered finding the wine shop again to get advice from the owner on where the safest place in this wayward city might be. But then he gave up on this idea; Defarge lived in the most dreadful area and was certainly an influential person there; he might even be at the forefront of these dangerous affairs.",11.045,8.674,"As a consequence of his musings, he thought of Defarge, and the thought was followed by the decision to go to the tavern and ask its owner to indicate a safe refuge for Lucie, if there was one in that troubled city, a refuge that could very well be, if Defarge agreed, the same garret where Dr. Manette had lived in the past. However, he dismissed this plan almost as soon as he conceived it, considering that the tavern was located in the most dangerous neighborhood of the city and that Defarge, undoubtedly an influential person among the inhabitants of that violent region, would be fully involved in the enterprises that were being forged and matured there.",6.197,4.951
2302,"Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute’s delay tending to compromise Tellson’s, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.","By noon, the doctor still hadn't returned, and each minute of delay made things more difficult for Tellson's Bank, so Mr. Lorry had no choice but to discuss it with Lucie. Lucie said that her father intended to rent a short-term lodging in an area near the bank. Since renting a house did not harm the company, and he anticipated that even if everything went well and Charles was released, he would still hope to leave the capital, Mr. Lorry went out to find a lodging, found a suitable place, on a high floor, in a secluded small street, where all the windows were tightly curtained, indicating that these were abandoned houses.",17.09,16.039,"Noon was approaching, the Doctor still hadn't returned, and with each passing minute, he was putting Tellson in a bit more danger. Mr. Lorry had had a tête-à-tête with Lucie. Lucie mentioned that her father had talked about renting a house in that area, near the bank, for a short period. From a business perspective, it wasn't a matter to object to, and as far as he could see, even if everything went well for Charles and he was released, there was no hope of leaving the city immediately; Mr. Lorry went out to find a house for them and found a suitable place in a gloomy building in a secluded side street on the hills, where the closed shutters indicated that no one was living inside.",15.096,14.008,"As it was nearing twelve in the morning and the doctor had not yet appeared, with each passing minute increasing the predicament in which he had placed Tellson's Bank, Lorry decided to hold a consultation with Lucie. She mentioned that her father had spoken to her about renting a room in that very district, not far from the Bank. Seeing that the doctor's plan was not in opposition to the Bank's affairs, and foreseeing that even if Charles's situation was resolved favorably, and even if through the doctor's intervention and influence he was released, it would still be impossible for him to escape the city, Lorry immediately went out to find a suitable room and found one on an isolated street surrounded by uninhabited buildings.",11.048,9.917
2303,"To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross: giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself. He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations. A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him.","He immediately took Lucie and her mother, along with Miss Pross, to their lodging; providing them with all the comforts possible, even more comfortably than he arranged for himself. He left Jerry with them as an obstacle blocking the doorway and willing to take a punch to the head, then returned to his work. He worked with a heart full of anxiety and suffering, and the long day passed slowly and heavily.",17.436,15.983,"He first placed Lucie, her daughter, and Miss Pross in this small place; he tried to make them as comfortable as possible, even giving them comforts that he himself did not have. He placed Jerry, with his door-sized bulk and thick head capable of withstanding any blow, next to them and returned to his work. But he was always uneasy and unhappy inside, and thus the day slowly, gradually came to an end.",10.96,9.229,"Without losing a moment, he moved Lucía, her daughter, and Miss Pross to the mentioned room, giving them as much comfort as he could, which was more than he himself had. He left Jeremiah Lapa with them and went back to immerse himself in his tasks. He spent the rest of the day sad, worried, and suspicious, until it was time to close the establishment.",10.974,8.742

He was alone again in the room like the night before, contemplating what to do when he heard footsteps ascending the steps. A moment later, someone stood before him, sharp eyes observing, calling his name directly.",20.699,19.398,"When the day ended and the bank closed, Mr. Lorry was also exhausted.

Those who brought the doctor had introduced him to the court, and he had declared his name and profession as someone who had been unjustly imprisoned in the Bastille for eighteen years, at which point one of the judges had stood up and said he recognized him; this man was Defarge.",21.457,20.819,"The doctor informed Mr. Lorry, not without demanding the utmost secrecy, that the mobs had forced him to witness brutal scenes of butchery and bloodshed in the prison of La Force; that there he had found a Tribunal in permanent session, before which the prisoners were presented one by one, who were immediately condemned to death and executed, or set free (very few), or else locked up again in their cells. He added that, having been presented to the Tribunal in question by the patriots who accompanied him, he stated his name and profession and made it known that, without prior accusation, and consequently without prior sentence, he had been a secret prisoner of the Bastille for eighteen years; and that one of the individuals who composed the Tribunal stood up and identified him, the individual in question turning out to be Defarge.",18.747,17.97
2358,"That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table, that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard to the Tribunal—of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not—for his life and liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That, the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance, delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.","Then, knowing for certain that his son-in-law was among the surviving prisoners from the list on the table, Mr. Manette urgently pleaded for his release and his life with the group of judges - some awake, some asleep, some sober, some drunk, some clean, some stained with blood. After the initial frenzied welcome given to him as a victim of the overthrown regime, everyone agreed to bring Charles Darnay to trial before this unlawful court. Then, just as Darnay was nearly set free, the favorable turn of events was suddenly blocked without any explanation (the doctor could not understand why), causing the judges to confer privately for a moment. Then, the presiding judge informed Dr. Manette that they would continue to detain the prisoner, but for his own benefit, he would be held safely and unharmed. Then, immediately, they signaled to have the prisoner returned to his cell; but upon hearing this, Mr. Manette fervently pleaded to stay in the prison to ensure that his son-in-law would not, due to some misfortune or malice, be handed over to the crowd outside the gates who were clamoring for blood; his request was granted, and he remained in that Blood Temple until the danger had passed.",11.349,10.726,"Then the Doctor learned from the records on the table that his son-in-law was on the list of the living, and he pleaded at length for his son-in-law's life and freedom to the court committee, some of whom were dozing, some awake, some with bloody hands, some clean, some drunk, some sober. As someone who had suffered greatly in this collapsed order, following the applause for the Doctor, it was decided that Charles Darnay would be brought before this unlawful committee and re-evaluated. At one point, just when he was about to be released, the favorable atmosphere inexplicably dissipated (the Doctor couldn't understand why), and they whispered something secretly among themselves. The person presiding over the committee then told Doctor Manette that the prisoner needed to be kept under supervision, but for his sake, he would be safe during this supervision. Upon this, with a signal, the prisoner was sent back to his cell; at that time, the Doctor pleaded so much with the court to ensure that his son-in-law could pass through the crowd that was suppressing the case with cruel screams rising behind the door and remain there without any harm or misfortune befalling him, that he finally got permission and waited there in that bloodthirsty hall until the danger had passed.",14.013,13.475,"He said that from the records on the Tribunal's table, he could ascertain that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and that he defended him fervently before the Tribunal, some of whose members were snoring outrageously while others were awake, and among whom there were those stained with blood from head to toe and those clean of crimes (very few), some sober and others drunk (almost all), in honor of Liberty. That in the first moment of enthusiasm, consequent to the presence in that place of a man who had suffered so much, a martyr tortured by the overthrown situation, they granted that Charles appear immediately before that strange Tribunal and be examined. That when everything suggested they were going to decree his freedom, the decidedly favorable currents encountered obstacles, whose origin and nature were mysteries to the doctor, which led to a secret conference. That the person occupying the presidential chair then informed the doctor that the prisoner should remain confined, although, in consideration of the doctor's pleas, the prisoner's person would be inviolable. That immediately, at a signal from the president, the prisoner was taken back to his cell, but that he, the doctor, so insistently requested permission to stay there to ensure that his son-in-law, by mistake or malice, was not handed over to the mobs, whose ferocious howls deafened the judges, that he was granted the requested authorization, and that he did not move from the Hall of Blood until the final scene of the bloody drama concluded.",17.488,17.086
2359,"The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitude—had made a litter for him and escorted him carefully from the spot—had then caught up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.","Dr. Manette did not recount what he had witnessed in prison between meals and the brief moments of sleep snatched from time. The mad joy of the prisoners who escaped death did not astonish him as much as the mad brutality inflicted on those unlucky enough to be dismembered. One prisoner there, he recounted, was released to go outside, but as he stepped onto the street, he was mistakenly speared by a savage weapon. Due to the crowd's pleas, a doctor went out to bandage the wound of the unfortunate man; he also went out through the same gate and found himself amidst a group of volunteer militia sitting on the corpses of their victims. With a ghastly inconsistency like anything in that horrific nightmare, they themselves assisted the doctor in caring for the mistakenly speared man with utmost concern - they made a stretcher and escorted the wounded man out of danger - then they themselves took up arms and plunged into a new massacre, so terrible that Dr. Manette had to cover his eyes and fainted amidst the slaughter.",11.197,10.33,"The things the Doctor saw between the few bites of food he snacked on and his dozing off were indescribable. The enthusiastic joy the public felt for the released prisoners was almost as surprising as the enthusiastic savagery they showed for those being torn apart. In fact, it had happened that a released prisoner was accidentally speared by a cruel person the moment he stepped out onto the street. Upon this, they begged the Doctor to go and tend to his wound, and he found the prisoner, passing through the same door, in the arms of a few compassionate men sitting on the bodies of their victims. Moreover, with a brutality as monstrous as this horrific nightmare, they both helped the Doctor and took great care of the wounded man – they immediately made a stretcher for him and moved him away from the scene – and then, grabbing their weapons, they resumed their butchery so horrifically that Doctor Manette covered his eyes with his hands and eventually fainted in the midst of the event.",15.925,15.311,"Impossible to detail all the brutalities, all the acts of fierce savagery that the doctor had to witness during those four days and nights. The mad joy with which the prisoners who obtained an acquittal indulged impressed him almost as much as the mad ferocity with which the mob tore apart those who were condemned. There was a prisoner whom the Tribunal declared acquitted and who, upon being freed onto the street, was struck by a spear by a monster, undoubtedly by mistake. Doctor Manette, who was asked to come out to treat the wounded man, immediately went out to the street and found him surrounded and attended to by countless compassionate Samaritans, all of them sitting on the corpses of their victims. Showing proof of an inconceivable inconsistency due to its monstrosity, they helped the doctor, attended to the wounded man with exemplary solicitude, improvised a stretcher and transported him... but once again plunging their murderous weapons into the corpses that filled the street and committing other brutalities so repugnant that the doctor had to cover his eyes with his hands, and even then he could not avoid fainting in the midst of those beasts.",14.173,13.588
2360,"As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger.","While Mr. Lorry listened to those confessions and looked at the face of his friend, now sixty-two years old, he became fearful that Dr. Manette's old ailment might recur when going through these horrifying experiences.",19.226,16.434,"Mr. Lorry, while listening to all these secrets and looking at the face of his friend who was now sixty-two years old, felt a doubt that these terrible experiences might trigger his old illness.",20.259,17.336,"Vivid fears assailed the good Lorry, while he listened to the dreadful story from the lips of his friend, whose age was already nearing sixty-two years, that the horrifying scenes he had witnessed might breathe new life into the ancient danger.",7.91,5.382
2361,"But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughter’s husband, and deliver him. “It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin. As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid of Heaven I will do it!” Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.","But Mr. Lorry had never seen his friend in the current aspect; had never known his friend in the current character. Because this was the first time the doctor felt that his own suffering was a source of strength and power. Because this was the first time he felt that in that burning flame, he had slowly forged an iron bar to pry open the prison door and free his daughter's husband. − Everything will end well, my friend; it won't be entirely in vain and destructive. Just as my beloved daughter helped me recover, now I will help bring Charles back to my daughter; with God's help, I will do it! That was Dr. Manette. When Mr. Jarvis Lorry saw the blazing eyes, the determined face, and the calm, strong demeanor of a man whose life had been halted like a stopped clock, now functioning with a source of energy that had long been dormant and useless, he believed his friend.",23.323,22.851,"But he had never seen him like this, he did not know this state of his. For the first time in his life, the Doctor felt that the pains he suffered gave him strength and endurance. For the first time in his life, amidst this great chaos, he felt that he was slowly forging the iron that would break the door of the prison where his daughter's husband was lying and take him to his wife. ""Everything will be fine, my friend; nothing is actually wasted or destroyed. Just as my dear daughter helped me regain my health, I will help her reunite with her lover; I will do this if God permits!"" said Doctor Manette. When Mr. Lorry saw the Doctor's blazing eyes, determined face, his firm and calm expression, and the endurance of this man who seemed to have been stopped like a clock for years and then restarted with the energy he had accumulated during all the time he lay dormant, he believed him.",16.236,15.506,"Perhaps he was mistaken, however, and the cause of his mistake was the fact that he had never seen his friend under the aspect and character in which he then saw him. For the first time in his life, the doctor understood that his past sufferings were a source of energy and influence for him; for the first time he felt that in that fiery forge he was slowly shaping the irons that would break down the doors of the prison in which his daughter's husband was confined and grant him freedom. —In the midst of it all, it was a blessing, my friend; not everything has been calamities and ruins. Just as my idolized daughter did everything humanly possible to help me recover the health of my body and soul, I will not rest until I return to her what constitutes the most cherished part of herself. With Heaven's help, I will do it! Such were the words spoken by Dr. Manette, once he had finished presenting the facts. And when Maurice Lorry saw the fire of enthusiasm spark in his eyes, and when he noticed the calm serenity of that man, whose life, paralyzed for several years, was once again brimming with energy, he opened his heart to hope, and believed.",16.941,16.451
2362,"Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor’s hand), but she was not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.","Obstacles greater than any the doctor had ever faced would surely have to yield to his will. While still maintaining his position as a doctor working with all kinds of people, imprisoned and free, rich and poor, good and bad, he used his personal influence very wisely, so it wasn't long before he became the doctor for three prisoners at La Force. He could now assure Lucie that her husband was no longer in solitary confinement but was among the general population of prisoners; he met Charles weekly and brought back to her loving messages spoken directly by Charles; sometimes Charles also sent her a letter (though not delivered by the doctor), but she was not allowed to write to her husband, because every prisoner was suspected of plotting, especially the exiled aristocrats who had many friends and constant connections abroad.",24.565,24.099,"On the determined path he embarked on, there were things much greater than what the Doctor was dealing with at the time. He was a doctor who attended to all kinds of people, whether chained or free, good or bad, and he used his influence so wisely that he soon took on the role of doctor for three prisons, including La Force. He could now tell Lucie that her husband was not alone, that he was among other prisoners; every week, he went to see her husband and conveyed what he said as sweet messages to her; sometimes her husband sent letters directly to her (never through the Doctor), but she was not allowed to write to him, as the most suspicious situations in the prisons arose from refugees known to have friends or acquaintances outside.",19.514,18.935,"Obstacles much greater than those that stood before the doctor would have yielded to a perseverance as indomitable as his. Without exceeding the boundaries of his profession as a doctor, whose mission is to interact with all classes and social conditions, both with prisoners and those who enjoy freedom, with the rich as well as the poor, without distinction of oppressors and oppressed, good and bad, wise and ignorant, he knew how to employ his influence with such sagacity that he was soon appointed medical inspector of the prisons, and consequently, of La Force. He was able to assure Lucie that her husband was no longer kept alone in an isolated cell, but mixed with the general population of prisoners; he could visit his daughter's husband once a week and convey messages from him to her; he managed to ensure that Lucie received some letters from her husband, although never through the doctor himself, but he did not allow her to send letters to Charles, for among all the emigrants suffering in the prisons, none aroused as much suspicion among the populace as those known to have relatives outside.",16.096,15.522
2363,"This new life of the Doctor’s was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it. Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one; but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness. Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles’s ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change, that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. “All curious to see,” thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, “but all natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldn’t be in better hands.”","The new life of the doctor was certainly troubling; but Mr. Lorry noticed that it still maintained a new sense of pride. No imperfection could affect that pride; the doctor was naturally and deservedly proud, but Mr. Lorry still found it strange. Until then, the doctor knew that in the minds of his friend and daughter, his past imprisonment was associated with personal suffering, loss, and weakness. Now it was different; he knew that the hardships of the past had given him the strength to rescue Charles, making his loved ones weak and himself the one with authority. The previous relationship between him and Lucie had now reversed, and only deep love and gratitude could reverse it because he was only proud of repaying Lucie for all the devotion she had given to her father. “It is indeed strange,” Mr. Lorry thought to himself, in his wise and affectionate way, “but naturally right; so take charge, my dear friend, just like that; no one can do it better than you.",12.146,11.557,"Undoubtedly, the Doctor's new life was a restless one; yet the sensible Mr. Lorry could see the new nourishing pride involved in it. There was nothing to mar this pride; it was natural and valuable; but he was also curious. The Doctor knew that until then, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and friend with his personal suffering, deficiency, and weakness. But now the situation was different, both knew that he saw his past painful experiences as a strength that would ensure Charles's safety and ultimate salvation, and this change had given him such life that the Doctor had taken control and leadership, asking the weak to trust in him as the strong one. In his relationship with Lucie, they had switched places, but this change stemmed from the gratitude and love they felt for each other, and the greatest pride was in helping the daughter who had once helped him so much. ""How strange,"" thought Mr. Lorry in his usual charming and intelligent manner, ""but of course a natural situation; so take control, my friend, and continue as such; it couldn't be in safer hands anyway.""",18.256,17.78,"There is no doubt that this new phase in the doctor's life brought with it countless anxieties, but Lorry, who was not lacking in shrewdness, understood from the very beginning that these anxieties were accompanied by a certain pride that acted as a powerful support for him. There was nothing inconvenient about this pride; on the contrary, it was a natural and dignified pride. However, Lorry observed it as a curiosity worthy of study. The doctor knew that until then, both his daughter and his friend had attributed his personal affliction, his weakness, his exhaustion to his long years of confinement. But the circumstances had changed radically; and convinced that his past tortures had endowed him with strengths that he could put at the service of Charles's cause, strengths that, if well employed, could result in the freedom of his daughter's husband, he became so exalted that he took charge of the matter and accepted the others as secondary cooperators, as one who considers himself strong accepts the help of others whom he deems weak. The respective positions of the doctor and his daughter were reversed, though only in ways that could be reversed without diminishing the tenderest affection and the most profound love, for the father took all his pride in rendering some service to the one who had rendered him such immense services. —The phenomenon is very curious—thought Lorry;—but very natural and very noble. So, take the leadership, my dear friend, take charge of the direction and keep it: it cannot be in better hands.",16.646,16.239
2364,"But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial, the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils of France, as if the dragon’s teeth had been sown broadcast, and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore. What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year One of Liberty—the deluge rising from below, not falling from above, and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!","”But despite Dr. Manette's utmost efforts and continuous striving to find freedom for Charles Darnay, or at least to get him a retrial, he could not resist the general tide of the times.

How could the private desire of one person stand against the flood of the First Year of Liberty - a flood rising from the ground rather than pouring from the sky, with the gates of Heaven closed tight and indifferent!",21.917,21.558,"Dear Doctor, no matter how hard he tried to get Charles Darnay released or at least brought to trial, events were unfolding very harshly and rapidly. A new era had begun; the King had been tried, sentenced to death, and beheaded; defying the world, the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death had been declared with the cry ""Victory or Death!""; the black flag was waving day and night from the high towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men from all over France had gathered to rise against the landowners, it seemed like the time had come to harvest the dragon's teeth sown into the ground, these had yielded crops equally in the mountains, plains, rocks, gravelly soil, alluvial mud, under the bright skies of the South and the clouds of the North, in pastures and forests, vineyards, olive groves, and fields of mown grass and corn, on the fertile banks of wide rivers and on the sandy shores by the sea, in every conceivable place. Who could stand alone against this flood in the first year of freedom –a flood that was not flowing from above but rising from below, with the windows of heaven not open but closed?",26.788,26.427,"The doctor worked hard to get his son-in-law released, or at least to have him appear before the Tribunal that would decide his fate, but he could not overcome the overwhelming currents that had been unleashed at that time. A new era had dawned, the King had been sentenced, condemned, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death had declared that it would conquer the world risen in arms against it or perish; the black flag waved day and night atop the towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned by the powerful call to fight the tyrants of the earth, sprang from the various provinces of France, as if the teeth of the fierce dragon, sown in flight, had sprouted and flourished equally in the mountains and the plains, in the rocks and the gravel, in the dry lands and the marshes, under the beautiful southern sky and the misty northern one, in the wastelands and the forests, in the vineyards and the olive groves, among the wheat and the grasses, in the beautiful valleys bathed by rivers and on the sandy beaches kissed by the sea. What particular effort, no matter how immense, could fight against the deluge of the Year One of Liberty... a deluge that sprang from below instead of coming from the clouds, a deluge that flooded France while the gates of the heavens remained closed?",25.92,25.606
2365,"There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the head of the king—and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.","Unceasing, unmerciful, unpeaceful, unhesitating, regardless of the passage of time. Though night and day alternated as regularly as before, and mornings followed evenings as they always had, time no longer existed. The concept of time was lost in the feverish delirium of a country in a frenzy. At times, to break the unusual silence of the entire capital, the executioner showed the people the head of the King - and now, it seemed no different, the executioner displayed the head of the beautiful Queen, who had been a miserable widow in prison for eight months to the point of her hair turning white.",19.217,18.445,"Neither a pause, nor pity, nor peace, nor a moment of mercy, nor even a concept of time existed. Even though night and day followed each other in their old patterns, and within the same day there was still a morning and an evening, no other measure of time remained.

Now the executioner, breaking the unusual silence of the vast city, was showing the people the King's head – and now, though it seemed to have happened immediately after, he was holding the gray-haired head of his beautiful wife, who had spent eight difficult and painful months in prison as a widow.",6.926,5.395,"The French soil had been stripped of pause, piety, compassion, peace, rest, tranquility, and the measurement of time. Days and nights followed one another as always, it is true; night was followed by morning and a new day began, but the reckoning of time went no further, for its perception had been lost in the devouring fever of a nation, just as it is lost by an individual in their personal fever. Today, the supernatural silence of an entire city was interrupted by the executioner, showing the people the head of the King, and another day he presented the head of a Queen famous for her beauty, who needed no more than eight months of widowhood and misery for her hair to turn from blonde to snow-white.",16.469,15.565
2366,"And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected, which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old. Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from the foundations of the world—the figure of the sharp female called La Guillotine.","And considering the many conflicting laws in every such trial, time drags on while reality still rushes by.

Above all, a figure increasingly familiar as if it had stood before our eyes since time immemorial—the sharp figure named La Guillotine: the guillotine.",19.318,18.664,"Thus, in accordance with the law of contrasts that is inevitable in such situations, a long time passed, and the fire quickly engulfed everything. In the capital, a revolutionary court was established, and nearly fifty thousand revolutionary committees were set up across the country; the law that was enacted for suspects endangered both freedoms and lives; as a result, good and innocent people were falling into the hands of bad and guilty individuals; prisons were crammed with people who had no sin and were not given a chance to defend themselves; this was the new order, and this was how things were functioning, and only a few weeks had passed, yet it was already seen as a long-standing tradition. The worst part was a disgusting figure that had become so familiar to the people as if it had existed since the world began – the stern lady, the guillotine itself.",10.954,10.059,"However, once again fulfilling the strange law of contradictions, time, despite flying with dizzying speed, seemed to drag on with exasperating slowness.

It was the sign of the regeneration of the human race. It superseded the Cross.

The guillotine is the symbol of the rebirth of humanity. The guillotine replaced the Cross. Guillotine images were worn on the chest where the Cross had been discarded, and people bowed their heads to worship the guillotine when the Cross had been renounced.",23.179,22.403,"There were a lot of jokes about it; it was said to be good for headaches, to prevent hair from graying, to give a special elegance to the skin, it was even called the ""national razor"" that shaves very cleanly; those who kissed the lady guillotine, after looking through the small window, would sneeze into the sack. This had become the symbol of the renewal of the human race. In a way, it had taken the place of the cross. Various models of guillotines now hung on people's chests where the cross used to be, and wherever the cross was denied, people bowed before this and believed in it.",15.192,14.053,"The town had turned her into an inexhaustible source of jokes. She was the most effective remedy for curing headaches, the most infallible preventive against gray hair and baldness, gave the skin a special delicacy, was the National Barber Razor that shaved best, the one who was lucky enough to kiss the Guillotine, looked through a little hole and sneezed into a basket; she was the sign of the regeneration of the human race and had eclipsed the Cross.

Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes. The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God’s own Temple every day.","The guillotine had beheaded so many people that it and the ground around it were soaked with the stench of blood. It was dismantled like a devil's puzzle toy and reassembled when needed. It silenced the orators, brought down the powerful, and destroyed the virtuous. In just twenty-two minutes one morning, it beheaded twenty-two notable individuals - twenty-one living and one already dead.

Twenty-two friends who had become public figures, twenty-one alive, one dead, and then one morning, all their heads were severed in succession.

2369,"Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his end, never doubting that he would save Lucie’s husband at last. Yet the current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month, that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among the terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and victims, he was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all other men. He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were a Spirit moving among mortals.","Amidst this horror and the surrounding threats, Dr. Manette calmly walked, confident in his abilities, cautiously pursuing his goal, always firmly believing that he would ultimately save Lucie's husband. But time passed quickly, tumultuously, and fiercely, and in the blink of an eye, Charles had been imprisoned for a year and three months while the doctor remained calm and confident as ever. In December of that year, the Revolution had become so brutal and insane that the rivers in the south were littered with the bodies of those barbarically drowned at night and the corpses of prisoners shot en masse under the winter sun. Nevertheless, the doctor continued to walk calmly amidst the horror. Silent, kind, always relied upon in hospitals and prisons, using his expertise to heal without distinguishing between victim or murderer, he stands outside of violence. In him, while treating patients, his demeanor and the story of once being imprisoned in the Bastille have given him a unique position. He is neither suspected nor questioned, as if he truly had come back to life from the dead more than eighteen years ago, or is a ghost wandering among the living.",9.848,8.979,"Amidst all this horror and its consequences, the Doctor continued to walk with his head held high. Confident in his power, advancing with cautious steps, he had no doubt that he would ultimately save Lucie's husband. However, time was flowing so powerfully and deeply, and everything was happening so quickly, that during the days when the Doctor was still advancing with firm and confident steps, Charles had been in prison for a year and three months. In December, the revolution had become so cruel and insane that the southern rivers were impassable at night due to the bodies of those who had drowned and died horribly, and prisoners were being executed en masse under the southern winter sun. But the Doctor was still advancing with his head held high amidst all this savagery. In those days, everyone in Paris knew him; he was different from everyone else. Silent, humane, at the doors of both hospitals and prisons, practicing his profession equally for both killers and victims, he was a completely different person. His demeanor while working and the story of his imprisonment in the Bastille set him apart from everyone else.

However, the current of time was so impetuous, the waters so deep, it flew with such tremendous fury, that Charles continued rotting in prison fifteen months after entering it without the robust confidence of the doctor being shaken. During the month of December, the Revolution raged in such a way in its furies that the rivers of the South could barely run through their spacious channels, filled with heaps of corpses of those who were violently drowned in their waters during the night. The prisoners were shot by dozens, by hundreds, by thousands; but the doctor continued advancing among so many horrors with a firm step and a solid head. In Paris, there was no man more known than him nor one in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable in hospitals and prisons, providing the aid of science to both murderers and victims, it can be said that he was a man apart.

To deceive herself into believing that the family would soon be reunited, she used many little tricks, such as arranging Charles's books and chair separately, ready as if he were about to return soon.

At such times, he would again, saying ""This doesn't concern me!"" desperately continue to cut the wood.",13.978,12.426,"The sawyer was an extremely curious individual.

Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not for a week or a fortnight together.

It was a day of some wild rejoicing, and a festival. She had seen the houses, as she came along, decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them; also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription (tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!","She kept coming to that corner regularly until December, while her father calmly walked through the scene of horror. On a lightly snowy afternoon, she came to her usual spot again. That day was a chaotic celebration.

Liberty, Equality, Fraternity or Death!""",17.142,16.065,"December arrived. Her father continued walking among dreadful horrors, always with a firm step, always with a solid head. One cold and rainy afternoon, Lucía arrived at the usual little corner. It was a day of general rejoicing.

Liberty, Equality, Fraternity or Death.""",23.824,22.955
2402,"The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in with most inappropriate difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed pike and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his “Little Sainte Guillotine”—for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut and he was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.","The shabby shop of the sawyer was so small that there wasn't enough space to write the entire slogan. He had asked someone to hastily write that phrase on the door, and this person had a hard time fitting in the last word ""Death"". On the roof, he erected a spear with a hat on it as every good Citizen should do, and in the window, he displayed his saw with the words ""Little Saint Guillotine"" - because by that time, the sharp lady had been canonized by the people. His shop was closed and he had gone somewhere; seeing this, Lucie felt relieved to be standing alone.",10.226,8.309,"The wretched shop of the sawyer was so small that its facade was not enough to bear this inscription. But then he had found someone who could barely squeeze the word death into it. As a duty of being a good citizen, he had placed a spear and a hat on top of the shop and had put his saw, which he called ""Little Saint Guillotine,"" in one of the windows – after all, this sharp lady was now known by everyone at that time. The shop was closed, and the sawyer was not there; thus, Lucie was left alone and took a deep breath.",7.411,5.852,"So miserable and cramped was the sawyer's workshop that its entire surface was almost insufficient for the copied inscription. The house was topped with its corresponding spear equipped with its indispensable red cap, as befitted any citizen who considered himself good, and in a window, he had placed his saw, under which the following inscription could be read: ""The Holy Guillotine."" The workshop was closed, the sawyer was absent, and Lucía could savor the pleasure of being completely alone. However, the sawyer was not very far away.",9.253,7.831
2403,"But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. A moment afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution song, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison. Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They advanced, retreated, struck at one another’s hands, clutched at one another’s heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke, and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport—a something, once innocent, delivered over to all devilry—a healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maidenly bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child’s head thus distracted, the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of the disjointed time.","But he was not far away, because immediately afterward Lucie was terrified when she heard the noisy footsteps and the shouts of people approaching. Shortly after, a crowd of people passed by the corner near the prison, with the sawyer holding the hand of the Goddess of Revenge in the middle. The crowd, which must have been up to five hundred people, danced enthusiastically like five thousand demons. There was no other music than their singing. They danced to their favorite Revolutionary song, keeping a fierce rhythm as if they were collectively grinding their teeth. Men danced with women; women danced with each other; men danced with each other; they danced with anyone they could pair up with randomly. At first, they were just a whirlwind of tattered red hats and ragged coats; but as they flooded this corner and began to dance around Lucie, some went mad like horrifying ghosts. They moved forward, backward, clapped each other's hands, grabbed each other's heads, spun alone, seized anyone, and twirled together until many pairs collapsed. Those who did not fall held hands in a circle and spun, then the circle broke into smaller circles of two or four people, and these circles kept spinning, kept spinning until all suddenly stopped, started again, clapped, grabbed, separated, then reversed the spin, all spinning in the opposite direction. Suddenly, they stopped, rested, started again, forming lines that took up the entire width of the street, then, heads bowed low, hands raised high, they ran off while screaming. No battle scene was half as terrifying as this dance. It was entirely a corrupt amusement - an innocent game turned malevolent - a healthy pastime turned into something that stirred up angry blood, paralyzed consciousness, and froze the heart. If any movements reveal a bit of beauty, the horror increases even more as everything that was once good now becomes distorted and lost. The maiden's bare breasts exposed to the dance, or the innocent pretty head frantically moving to the rhythm, the nimble feet tiptoeing high in this blood-soaked mud, these are the epitomes of a chaotic era.",15.182,14.894,"But the sawyer was not far away, soon there was some commotion and Luice heard approaching shouts; she was filled with great fear. Before long, a large group of people, with Vengeance and the Sawyer in the very middle, hand in hand, flowed like a torrent from the corner of the prison wall. There were roughly five hundred people, and they danced as if they were five thousand demons. There was no music other than the songs they sang themselves. They danced to the popular song of the Revolution, keeping a cruel tempo that resembled the grinding of teeth. Men and women danced together; sometimes only women, sometimes only men, as if this calamity had brought them together. At first, they were a storm of rough red caps and coarse woolen clothes; but when they filled the street and stopped to dance around Lucie, the spirit of a terrible creature that danced in a frenzy awoke within them all. They moved forward and backward, slapped each other's hands, then grabbed each other by the heads and spun alone, then held onto each other again and spun in pairs until many of them collapsed to the ground. While they were on the ground, the others held hands and spun in a circle together; then the circle broke up again, and after spinning in pairs and fours, they all stopped together, then started again, slapped each other again, grabbed each other by the heads and broke up, then turned in the opposite direction, and then all began to turn in different directions. Suddenly they stopped again, waited, and as if turning back time, lined up along the road in rows and advanced with their heads down and fists in the air, shouting. No fight could be as terrifying as this dance. It was such a strange thing – once innocent but now containing devilry – a healthy amusement that had turned into an event that ignited people's blood, upset their emotions, and hardened their hearts. The visible measure of finesse it contained made this dance even uglier, showing how everything good could be twisted and corrupted. The bare flanks of young girls, the wildly swaying beautiful heads almost childlike in age, and the delicate feet advancing through this swamp of blood and filth were all part of this maddened moment.",20.01,19.761,"Lucía's wait lasted only a few minutes when loud shouts echoed in the street, filling her with terror. Seconds later, compact crowds turned the corner of the prison, with the sawyer in the center holding hands with La Venganza. There would be no fewer than five hundred people, dancing as if they were five hundred thousand demons. Nor did they have music, for their devilish dances were sufficiently accompanied by the hoarse and discordant shouting from their throats. They sang the popular hymn of the Revolution, accompanied by a fierce clashing of teeth. They danced a fierce dance, which we will not describe, for it suffices to say that the prevailing savagery had turned an innocent distraction into an effective means of igniting the blood, dulling the senses, and hardening the heart.",2.1,1.934

The list was read, in the vaulted chamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the scaffold.","The fat prison guard wearing glasses to read the list glanced over the prisoners to make sure Darnay had stepped out, then continued reading, pausing after each name to glance up like that. The list had twenty-three names but only twenty people stepped out; because one prisoner on the list had died in prison and no one remembered, plus two had gone to the guillotine and no one remembered.

2430,"There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was soon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed tears there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the disease—a terrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke them.","The hurried and tender farewells echoed, but the parting quickly came to an end. It was a daily occurrence, and the prisoners at La Force that night were busy preparing for some reward and punishment games along with a small concert. They huddled together and shed tears at the barred windows, watching the number of people being called away; but the planned amusements were short by twenty people who needed to be replaced, and time was pressing, nearly time to return to the cells, the hour when the common rooms and corridors would be entrusted to large guard dogs for the night. The prisoners were not insensitive or indifferent; it was this prison environment that made them behave that way. This same environment also gave rise to another more puzzling phenomenon: the wild attitudes that surely led many to face the guillotine unnecessarily and lose their lives unjustly - it was not arrogance but a kind of epidemic that seemed to have spread from the madness of the populace. In times of epidemic, many of us also silently suffer from this condition - a most dreadful temporary tendency to want to die from the epidemic. We all harbor strange desires within us, just waiting for the right conditions to erupt.",13.142,12.568,"After the hasty farewell words and good wishes they exchanged, they quickly parted ways. This was a daily occurrence, and then the La Force community plunged into preparations for the evening's games to be held for the losses of the day, and a small concert. They gathered in front of the bars and wept; but the twenty people who left for the evening's entertainment needed to be replaced, and there was little time left until the doors were locked; the large dogs were handed over to guard the common rooms and corridors throughout the night. The prisoners were not insensitive or callous; they were merely acting in the manner required by the times. Similarly, albeit with a subtle difference, a kind of exhilaration or intoxication undoubtedly gave some of them unnecessary courage as they went to the guillotine, and because of this, dying was not only something to be proud of but also like a dreadful infection spreading from the frenzied minds of the public. Like the desire some had to contract the disease during the plague – strangely, they wanted to die from it. In fact, there are such oddities hidden within all of us, waiting for certain conditions to emerge.",13.073,12.446,"Some farewell and encouraging phrases were exchanged between those who were leaving and those who were staying, not many, as aside from being an incident that repeated every day, the society of La Force had planned for that night the celebration of some games, and they needed to make the most of the time to finalize the program. Those who stayed accompanied those who were leaving to the exit gate of the room, shed some tears, and turned back, as it was necessary to fill the twenty gaps left vacant by the absentees if they did not want to forgo the evening's entertainments, and this had to be done before the hour of silence, when the establishment's vigilance was entrusted to armies of ferocious mastiffs that filled the corridors and adjoining rooms. And it is not that the prisoners were insensitive or hard-hearted; but in their character, in their way of being, the condition of the era inevitably had an influence. Just as those saw their unfortunate companions leave almost impassively, there were many who, intoxicated, undoubtedly yielding to a kind of fervor that is barely understood today but was very natural at that time, challenged the people without any need and spontaneously ran in search of the caresses of the guillotine, without their act being influenced much or little by boastfulness, but by the general infection consequent to the brutal shaking of the public soul. In times of pestilence, one sees people who are mysteriously attracted to the contagion, people who would wish to die from it. And it is that we all carry within the depths of our souls dormant oddities that need only the concurrence of certain circumstances to awaken.",7.967,7.263

Looking at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving, anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men, the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette, in his usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr. Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the Carmagnole.","The judges sat on the bench wearing hats adorned with feathers; but the courtroom was filled with tattered red hats bearing the tricolor emblem. Looking at the jury and the chaotic crowd, Darnay felt as if the normal order had been overturned, with criminals now judging the honest people. The lowest, most vicious, and most vile class of a city teeming with the lowest, most vicious, and most vile people, was conducting the trial: commenting, applauding, objecting, anticipating, and urging the outcome, noisily and incessantly. The men mostly carried various weapons; the women, some held knives, some held swords, others ate and drank while watching the trial, and many were knitting. Among those knitting was one who never stopped with a distinctive pattern. The woman sat in the front row, next to a man whose face Darnay had not seen since he arrived at the gates of Paris, but he clearly remembered the man as Defarge. He noticed that a few times the woman whispered into Defarge's ear and seemed to be his wife; but what he noticed most about these two was that although they sat very close to him, they never looked in his direction. It seemed they were waiting for something very persistently, and they did not take their eyes off the jury. Sitting below the Judge was Dr. Manette, in his usual simple attire. Darnay clearly saw that, apart from the officials, Mr. Manette and Mr. Lorry were the only ones there dressed in ordinary clothes, not in the Carmagnole dance attire.",19.15,18.814,"The jurors were sitting with furry hats; but many others had coarse red hats and tricolor rosettes. When Charles Darnay looked at the jury and the noisy crowd, he perhaps thought that everything had turned upside down and that criminals were judging honest people. The lowest, most cruel, and most vile segment of the city, with their not at all low and vile numbers, was directing the spirit of the hall; they were loudly expressing opinions, applauding, opposing, speculating, and making the jury decide in an instant. Most of the men had various kinds of weapons; the women were carrying knives or daggers, and while some were following the trial by eating and drinking, many were knitting. Among those knitting was a woman who, besides her knitting, had an empty bottle tucked under her arm. She was in the front row, next to Defarge, whom Charles had not seen since the first day he reached the barrier but recognized immediately upon seeing. He saw the woman whispering something into the man's ear a few times and thought she was his wife; but what caught his attention the most while looking at these two was that, despite standing so close to him, they never looked at him. It was as if they were waiting for something with stubborn determination and never took their eyes off the jury for even a moment. In front of the president, in his usual plain attire, sat Doctor Manette.

A mere glance at the Tribunal was enough to suspect that the natural order of things had been inverted and that criminals were judging honorable men. The sentences were inspired by the vilest, most cruel, most criminal mob in the city, and they inspired them by injecting immense amounts of baseness, cruelty, and wickedness into their inspirations, sometimes commenting loudly, sometimes applauding, sometimes anticipating and precipitating the outcome of the deliberations. All the men filling the room were armed to the teeth; all the women carried knives and daggers, some were eating, others drinking, others knitting. Among the latter, there was one who stood out for her industriousness. She was seated in one of the front rows next to a man whom Charles had not seen since the day he arrived at the Barrier of Paris, but who reminded him of Defarge. He observed that the woman spoke two or three times in a very low voice to her neighbor, which led him to suppose that she was his wife, but what most powerfully caught his attention was that despite being as close as possible to him, they did not look at him even once. They frequently turned their eyes to the judges, as if expecting something, but nothing more. Near the President of the Tribunal sat Doctor Manette, calm as always and dressed as always.

2456,"The Doctor had taken care that it should be there—had assured him that it would be there—and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye—in fact, had rather passed out of the Tribunal’s patriotic remembrance—until three days ago; when he had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury’s declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evrémonde, called Darnay.","Dr. Manette had arranged for the letter to be there - he assured Charles that it would be there - and at this point, the letter was taken out and read. Citizen Gabelle was called out to verify, and he confirmed that truth.

The President found it effortlessly and read it aloud. Next, Gabelle was called to confirm the statements of the accused and to declare himself the author of the letter, which he did with great precision and a tone of truth. Citizen Gabelle delicately and tactfully suggested that the Tribunal, short on time due to the countless enemies of the Republic demanding all its attention, had left him in the Abbey prison until three days prior, an insignificant and very natural oversight; and that, when he appeared before the Tribunal, he was declared innocent and set free, having satisfactorily dispelled the accusations against him.",11.815,10.801
2457,"Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity, and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as the foe of England and friend of the United States—as he brought these circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself, had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that they were ready with their votes if the President were content to receive them.","The next person to be questioned was Dr. Manette. His personal credibility and clear answers made a strong impression; however, he continued to testify that the defendant was his first friend when he was freed after a long period of imprisonment; that the defendant had stayed in England, always faithful and devoted to him and his daughter during their exile; that, not only was he not favored by the aristocratic government in England, but this defendant had actually been sentenced to death there for the crime of opposing England and sympathizing with the United States. As he presented these circumstances, with utmost caution and sincere, straightforward persuasiveness, the jury and the crowd watching the trial unanimously expressed their agreement. Finally, when he mentioned Mr. Lorry, an English gentleman currently present in court, who, like him, had been a witness in the trial of this defendant in England and could corroborate his testimony, the jury declared that they had heard enough and were ready to vote if the Judge agreed.",24.828,24.373,"The next person to be questioned was Doctor Manette. His beloved personality and the clarity of his answers had a great impact on the people; but when he continued speaking and said that the first friend he made after being freed from his long imprisonment was this defendant, and when he stated that during the defendant's years of exile in England, he had always been loyal and devoted to his daughter and himself, that he had no connection with the aristocratic government there, and that he was even judged for being an enemy of England and a friend of America – when he revealed all these details with all his common sense, reality, and sincerity, the jury agreed with the public. Finally, when Doctor Manette said that the English gentleman named Mr. Lorry, who was present there, had testified just like him in the court in England and could confirm what he had just said, the jury stated that this was sufficient and that they could announce their decision if it was also suitable for the President.",13.686,12.861,"The next person to be questioned was Dr. Manette. His great personal popularity and the clarity and precision of his answers created an indescribable impression on the audience; but when he demonstrated that the accused was the one who most effectively contributed to freeing him from his eternal captivity, when he stated that the accused remained in England, surrounding not only his daughter but also himself with tender care and devoted affection, affection and care that made their exile sweet, when he added that far from being a supporter and defender of the aristocratic government of the country where he lived, he was prosecuted and almost condemned to death as an enemy of England and a friend of the United States. After he made a clear and eloquent exposition of all these circumstances, the Tribunal and the audience identified with him. So much so, that when he invoked the testimony of Mr. Lorry, an English gentleman present there, a witness, like him, of the trial held in England against Darnay, and ready to corroborate all his statements, the judges replied that they were satisfied with what they had heard, and that they would gladly vote if the President was willing to receive the votes.",13.612,12.901
2458,"At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner’s favour, and the President declared him free.","Each verdict was loudly announced by each juror, and the crowd in the courtroom cheered and clapped. All the verdicts were favorable for the prisoner, and the Judge declared that Charles Darnay was free.",11.497,8.58,"In each vote, the Jury members were announcing their votes one by one, out loud, and the crowd was applauding with great enthusiasm. They had all voted in favor of the defendant, and the President announced that he was acquitted.",10.504,7.676,"As the judges voted (doing so individually and aloud), the audience burst into frenzied applause. Unanimously, they declared the prisoner innocent, and as a result, the President declared him free.",22.625,20.001
2459,"Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable, to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets.","Then began a strange spectacle of the people in the court, similar to when the crowd sometimes wants to satisfy its own inconsistency or indulge in feelings of kindness and generosity, or perhaps it is a way for them to make amends for a past full of violent rage. At this moment, no one could determine what motive this strange spectacle stemmed from; it could be a combination of all three motives, but the feelings of kindness and generosity were more overwhelming. As soon as the acquittal order was issued, tears flowed abundantly like blood at other times, with both men and women rushing to Charles, embracing him with such fervent affection that he felt faint from exhaustion after a long period of miserable imprisonment; however, he knew very well that these same people, driven by the tides of the times, would also rush at him with the same fervor to tear him apart and throw his remains into the street.",8.0,6.897,"Then one of those strange scenes began to unfold, revealing how fickle a crowd can be, or how impulses can turn into generosity and compassion, or how a swelling cruel rage can come to an end. No one could say which of these strange scenes was the main reason; perhaps it was a mixture of all of them, especially the second one. Not long after the blood had been shed, the courtroom was flooded with tears due to the acquittal, and so many men and women ran to him at once, embracing him with brotherly feelings, that Darnay, after that tedious and long imprisonment, felt he might collapse from exhaustion; on the other hand, he knew very well that the same crowd, if swept by a different current, would have rushed at him with the same intensity to tear him to pieces and scatter him in the streets.",15.449,14.724,"Then followed one of those extraordinary scenes that highlight the fickleness of the mob, or the impulses towards generosity and pity, dormant in the depths of their soul, or what they consider to be a demonstration that they are not carried away by the explosive force of cruel rage. It is impossible to determine which of these three motives decisively influenced the extraordinary scenes that followed; probably all three influenced, with the second one predominating. The fact is that, as soon as the acquittal was pronounced, tears flowed as abundantly as blood had on other occasions, and the prisoner received so many and such tight embraces from everyone, regardless of gender, that he was in real danger of his prolonged captivity ending in a full-blown suffocation; it is noteworthy that these embraces were given by the same people who, driven by a different current, would have pounced on him with the same intensity to tear him apart with their nails and drag his palpitating remains through the streets.",14.653,13.86
2460,"His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried, rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four hours. The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign of Death—a raised finger—and they all added in words, “Long live the Republic!”","He temporarily escaped from those tight embraces as he had to make way for other defendants to be tried. After that, five people were tried for the same crime of being enemies of the Republic, because they did not support it by word or deed. Having missed the opportunity to execute Charles Darnay, the court compensated itself and the nation with another opportunity that came so quickly that before he left the court, the five new defendants had been sentenced to death within twenty-four hours. The first in this group let him know by raising one finger - the familiar prison sign for death - and all five exclaimed, ""Long live the Republic!"".",23.029,22.303,"When they took Darnay out to make room for the other prisoners to be tried, he was freed from all those embraces. The next five people were to be tried collectively as enemies of the Republic, for they had neither supported the Republic in word nor in deed. The court, as if eager to quickly make up for the gap and this national loss, decided that these five men, who were brought in before Darnay even left the hall, would be executed within twenty-four hours. The foremost prisoner conveyed this decision to Darnay with the death sign that had become customary in the prisons – by raising his finger – and they all shouted together, ""Long live the Republic!""",17.726,16.876,"Thanks to having to leave the room to make way for other defendants awaiting sentencing, he was able to escape for the moment from that overwhelming torrent of caresses. Next, five accused individuals appeared together, who were charged with being enemies of the Republic, not because they had worked against it, but because they had done nothing, neither in word nor deed, in its favor. The Tribunal hurried to compensate the nation for the freedom granted to one accused, so much so that he had not yet left the room when the death sentence already weighed upon the five unfortunate ones, to be executed within twenty-four hours. The first of the condemned indicated to Darnay the fate that awaited him by raising a finger, a symbol of death among the prisoners, and his companions shouted in unison with a sarcastic tone: —Long live the Republic!",15.737,15.034
2461,"The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings, for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in Court—except two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out, the concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the shore.","In reality, there were no more spectators left to prolong the judgment, because when Charles and Dr. Manette exited the gate, they saw a dense crowd that seemed to include every face he had seen in the court - except for two faces he kept searching for but couldn't find. Seeing him come out, the crowd showered him with tears, embraces, and shouts, individually or in unison, to the point that the waters of the river next to the court seemed to go mad just like the people on the shore.",16.624,15.695,"In truth, these five people no longer had any spectators to prolong their trials, because the moment Darnay and Doctor Manette stepped out the door, a huge crowd accompanied them, and they were all the types seen in the courtroom – except for the two people Darnay had looked for in vain. As soon as they stepped outside, the crowd, with tearful eyes and shouting, surrounded them again, until the waters of the river, where this mad scene took place, swelled and overflowed, they pounced on them sometimes one by one, sometimes in groups.",7.467,5.938,"It is true that Darnay did not have more time to listen to the explanations that the condemned could or wished to give him, for no sooner had he stepped out into the street in the company of Doctor Manette than he found himself surrounded by a dense crowd, in which he saw almost all the faces he had seen before in the courtroom, with the exception of two, which he searched for in vain with his eyes. Once again, he was enveloped by the furious whirlwind that had earlier nearly suffocated him, as they kissed him, embraced him, cried, shouted, and gave themselves over to other outbursts more fitting for madmen than for sane people.",5.799,4.474
2462,"They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages. Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not even the Doctor’s entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home on men’s shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him, and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.","They placed him on a large armchair in the midst of the crowd, the chair they had taken from the courtroom, or from a room or hallway of the court. On the chair, they had draped a red flag, and behind the chair, they had tied a spear with a red cap on it. Despite the doctor's pleas, the crowd still carried Charles shoulder-high on this triumphal chair, surrounded by a chaotic sea of red caps surging like wild waves, throwing into his view drifting faces, making him several times feel as if he too had lost his mind and was being taken on a cart to meet La Guillotine.",14.956,14.056,"They seated Darnay on a rather large chair that must have been found either in the courtroom, one of the rooms of the courthouse, or one of its corridors.

While he was on this triumphal chariot, not even the Doctor's pleas could prevent him from being carried on shoulders all the way to his home, and when he saw those excited faces rising from the depths and reaching a crescendo in the sea of red caps swirling around him, Darnay's mind became confused and disoriented, and he felt as though he were in an execution cart on the way to the guillotine.",20.572,19.747,"They forcefully sat him down in a large armchair that they had either taken from the Tribunal's hall or from one of the nearby houses. They adorned the armchair with a red flag and a spear whose iron tip displayed a red cap.

2463,"In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her father had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.","In that nightmarish procession, the crowd carried Charles and embraced anyone they met on the way, pointing towards him. The snow-covered streets were filled with the red of the Republic, as if stained with blood, as the winding procession marched on, carrying Darnay all the way to the courtyard of the family house. Dr. Manette had gone ahead to inform Lucie, and when her husband stepped down to stand on the ground, she fainted in his arms.",14.651,13.315,"They continued this dreamlike wild procession, hugging everyone they encountered and showing them Darnay. They wound their way through those snowy streets, which they had previously painted a deep red, and this time carried him to the courtyard of the house where he lived, painting everything in the color of the Republic.

Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river’s bank, and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away.","While Charles held his wife tightly in his arms and turned her face towards him so that no one could see his tears and their lips met, a few people in the crowd began to dance.

With that thought, how could her heart ease this fear? The winter evening darkness had begun to fall, and even now, the terrifying carriages were still rolling through the streets.

Due in part to the aforementioned reasons, and in part to avoid the danger of being spied on within their own home, they had no servants.

Although Miss Pross, through her long association with a French family, might have known as much of their language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that direction; consequently she knew no more of that “nonsense” (as she was pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She always made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price, one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.","For the past few months, Miss Pross and Cruncher have been entrusted with shopping; Miss Pross carries the money; Cruncher carries the basket. Every afternoon when the streetlights are lit, they go out to perform their duty and bring home such essential goods.

Therefore, her way of shopping was to throw the name of the item at the shopkeeper's head, regardless of the masculine or feminine article that should precede it, and if it was not the name of the item she needed, she would look around for it, grab it, and hold onto it until the price was settled.

Therefore, upon entering the shop, she had developed a way of shopping where she would say the first word that came to mind without knowing what it meant; if that thing wasn't what she wanted, she would look around with this item in her hand and not put it down until the bargaining was over.

As a result, her commercial system consisted of firing a noun point-blank as soon as she faced the shopkeeper, and if the noun didn't match the item she needed, as was almost always the case, she would look around, grab the item, and not let go until the deal was closed.

2613,"It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his honourable employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing there—not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern date—he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint Antoine and Defarge’s wine-shop; had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette’s imprisonment, release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved. He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.","The cards are weaker than he thought.” Barsad saw the losing cards that Sydney Carton was unaware of. Having been expelled from his prestigious job in England after too many unsuccessful false testimonies—not because he was no longer needed there; England at that time, as now, boasted of its superiority in scheming and spying—he knew he had voluntarily crossed the English Channel to take up work in France; initially, he baited and eavesdropped on the expatriates there, then gradually baited and eavesdropped on the locals. He knew that under the overthrown regime, he had been a spy in the Saint Antoine area and at Defarge’s wine shop; he had once been provided with information by the keen-nosed police about Dr. Manette's imprisonment, release, and his background. He had used that information to strike up an acquaintance with the Defarges and tried to exploit Madame Defarge but failed miserably. He always trembled with fear remembering that while he was striking up a conversation, that dreadful woman had looked at him in a terrifying way while her fingers deftly knitted. Since then, he had encountered her many times in the Saint Antoine district, always holding out a list knitted into the fabric and denouncing many people, who would surely meet their fate at the guillotine. He knew, just like many others recruited for this kind of work, that his life would never be safe; escape was impossible; he would always be under the shadow of death; and despite having switched sides to serve this reigning terror, a single word could put him in danger. Once accused, with the serious crimes he just reviewed in his mind, he foresaw that the dreadful woman with the cruel personality he had witnessed many times would surely bring out that deadly list to accuse him and extinguish his last chance of survival. Furthermore, all those who live secret lives are easily panicked, and the cards in his hand were unlucky enough to prove the increasingly livid look on his face due to anger.",15.004,14.671,"Barsad's hand was worse than he had anticipated. Mr. Barsad saw that he was losing the cards in this hand, about which Sydney Carton knew nothing, one by one. He had been dismissed from his honorable job in England—not because he was unwanted there, but because our pride in secrecy and espionage coincides with recent times—due to too much perjury, and he had crossed the Channel to accept the job in France. At first, he had engaged in incitement and spying among his own citizens, and then gradually tried the same activities among the French. Carton knew that he had been spying in the St. Antoine district and in Defarge's wine shop under the orders of the overthrown government; to establish dialogue with the Defarges, he had gathered information about Dr. Manette's imprisonment, release, and life from vigilant police officers, then used this information against Madame Defarge but had achieved nothing. He shuddered with fear, recalling how the dreadful woman always knitted while talking to him and how she glared at him menacingly as her fingers moved. He had seen her many times later in St. Antoine, the woman constantly reading the names she knitted into her work, and the lives of these people she denounced soon ended at the guillotine. As everyone involved in these matters knew, he was never safe; escape was impossible; he was tightly bound under the shadow of the blade, and despite all the treachery and betrayal he had committed to contribute to the surrounding savagery, a single word could cause that blade to fall on his head. With things in this state, once a denunciation was made, that dreadful woman, whose ruthlessness he had witnessed many times, could bring out her deadly records and ruin his life. Moreover, men involved in such secret affairs are quickly terrified, and there were cards in this hand that, when revealed, would inevitably cause the holder to turn pale.",14.782,14.437,"Barsad was a weaker adversary than Carton had supposed. To tell the truth, he had very bad cards in his game, and he knew it, although Carton did not. He knew, for example, that, dismissed from his honorable position in England as a result of unforgivable blunders committed in the exercise of it, he crossed the Channel and offered his services in France, where they were accepted, at first, to tempt and extract information from his compatriots, and later, to tempt and extract information from the French. He knew that, during the overthrown government, he was in charge of monitoring the Saint Antoine district and Defarge's tavern; that he received from the police the necessary data about the captivity, freedom, and history of Dr. Manette, thanks to which he believed he would manage to become a confidential friend of the Defarges, although he soon had to convince himself that, on some occasions, those who seek wool come back shorn. He always remembered with terror that that terrible tavern keeper had been knitting while he tried to extract information from her, and he would tremble every time he recalled that she looked at him with a somber expression while her fingers moved swiftly. He had seen her countless times since then in the Saint Antoine district, armed with her knitting records and denouncing people whose heads were soon severed by the guillotine. He knew, as all those who hold jobs like his do, that the storm raged over his head at all hours; that his head was in danger, that escape was impossible, that with each moment he brought his neck closer to the blade, and that, despite the services rendered to the cause of the reigning terror, a single word was enough to send him to the scaffold. No sooner had he been denounced, with all or part of the grave charges just insinuated against him, than he understood that that formidable woman, of whose implacable character he had seen ample proof, would exhibit the fatal record that would dispel the last possibility of salvation. Add to this the law, proven a thousand times, that all informers, all secret informers, are cowards by temperament, men who are easily frightened, and one can understand the state of mind in which Barsad was left.",10.343,9.952

And which it is to be took into account that if it wos, it wouldn’t, even then, be all o’ one side. There’d be two sides to it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman don’t pick up his fardens—fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens—half fardens! no, nor yet his quarter—a banking away like smoke at Tellson’s, and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going out to their own carriages—ah! equally like smoke, if not more so. Well, that ’ud be imposing, too, on Tellson’s. For you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander. And here’s Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos in the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given, a floppin’ again the business to that degree as is ruinating—stark ruinating! Whereas them medical doctors’ wives don’t flop—catch ’em at it! Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients, and how can you rightly have one without t’other? Then, wot with undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn’t get much by it, even if it wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never prosper with him, Mr. Lorry. He’d never have no good of it; he’d want all along to be out of the line, if he, could see his way out, being once in—even if it wos so.”","− Sir, - Cruncher pleaded nervously, - a noble person like you, whom I have been fortunate to do small tasks for until now, please don't harm me hastily, even if it is true... I'm not saying you are right, but let's suppose it is. And you must think that even if you are right, it's not just me. It's due to both sides. At this moment, there are doctors making a lot of money while an honest worker finds it very difficult to earn a few pennies... Pennies! No, not even half a penny... Half a penny! No, earning a quarter of a penny is already hard... Those doctors just borrow carriages to go to Tellson's as fast as smoke or even faster, secretly winking at the worker... Well, that's also taking advantage of Tellson's, sir. You can't treat people differently based on their appearance. And then there's my wife, Mrs. Cruncher, not now but at least back in England and probably in the future too, she just sits down and curses, so I can't do any business... always unlucky! At that time, the wives of those doctors didn't curse their husbands... they took everything! And if they did sit down, they cursed so that many people would get sick, so their husbands would have more work, is it wrong for me but right for them? Then there's the bribes to the undertakers, the parish overseers, the grave diggers, the cemetery keepers, all of them are equally greedy, so how much is left for the worker, even if it is true. If you earn a little, it's not enough to get by, Mr. Lorry. It's not enjoyable work, sir; anyone who falls into that job just wants to leave if they have the chance to change... the job you mentioned.",7.029,6.548,"Mr. Cruncher, whose face turned red with shame, began to plead, ""I hope, sir,"" he said, ""that a gentleman like you, whom I have had the honor of working for until my hair turned gray, would think twice before harming me, even if I did such a thing, not that I am saying I did, but if I had."" And if I had done it, there would be an explanation for it. One must look at it from both sides. Right now, while doctors are filling their pockets with guineas, an honest tradesman might be shooting at a penny –not a single penny going into his pocket! Nothing at all, not even half a penny –penniless men! No, not even a quarter penny –while those men are slipping in and out of Tellson's like they are looting from a fire, giving the honest tradesman a sidelong glance as they pass by, getting into their carriages, getting out of their carriages –ah! just like looting from a fire. Aren't they using Tellson's too? These things should not be overlooked. I have a wife, I mean I had one when I was in England, and I hope I will have one in the future, a woman who prays morning and night, to the point of being tiresome –and what prayers! But they, they don't even compare to the doctors' wives –have you ever seen them? Or if they do pray, it's for more patients to come, so how can you fully understand one side without looking at the other? Then even if that were the case, among all those undertakers, church clerks, gravediggers, and private guards (by the way, they are all greedy and all involved in it), what falls to men like us? So even if a person deals with such things, he doesn't get much out of it, Mr. Lorry.

I am not saying that it is; but if it were, I would always trust that you would not treat me so badly. Assuming that it were what you fear, even then the matter would have to be studied from two points of view, since it does not have just one, but two. There are doctors in medicine, and not a few, who find gold guineas where an honest tradesman finds nothing but miserable pennies... Not even pennies! Half pennies... And not even half pennies; quarter pennies... and that's generous. And what do you say about those who enter and leave Tellson's Bank, passing by the honest tradesman who is sitting by the door on an old stool, while they ride in luxurious carriages? Isn't it a sight to awaken the most dormant appetite? Add to all that the presence in England of a Mrs. Lapa who spends day and night on her knees praying to ruin all her husband's business, while the wives of the doctors and those who ride in luxurious carriages pray for the prosperity of their respective households.

Among them were many individuals, ranging from the seventy-year-old landowner whose immense wealth was not enough to buy his own life, to the twenty-year-old seamstress whose poverty and invisibility were not enough to save her.

3047,"Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded, this was closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts, a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against resignation. If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and child who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing.","However, he did not easily accept the fate awaiting him as the image of his beloved wife's face remained vividly imprinted in his mind. He clung tightly to life, finding it very difficult, very difficult to let go; if one hand grew weary and lost its grip slightly, the other hand would cling even tighter; and when one hand, having exerted all its strength to hold on to life, loosened its grip, the other hand would hold on firmly. Thoughts surged through his mind, and the fervent beating of his heart did not allow him to give in to death. If at any moment he felt discouraged by the thought of his wife becoming a widow and his children becoming orphans, he would see giving up as selfish and continue to resist.",5.851,4.602,"On the other hand, enduring all this was not easy while the face of his beloved wife was on his mind. He was tightly bound to life, and loosening this bond was difficult; if he tried to loosen it slightly from one point, it would strengthen even more at another point; even if he managed to break it with all his might, it would soon reattach. There was also an urgency in his thoughts, his heart was beating with great excitement and anger, resisting to not submit to his fate. If for a moment he seemed to submit to his fate, his wife and child, who would be left behind, would object, pointing out how selfish this situation was.",12.877,11.846,"It was not, however, an easy task to resign oneself to dying, for someone like him who still kept the image of his beloved wife fresh in his mind. Very strong ties bound him to life, and it was hard, very hard, to see so closely the blade that would cut them forever. His thoughts tumbled over each other, agitated tumultuously in his chest, fought fierce battles among themselves, and in the end, they joined forces to contend against resignation. If he momentarily managed to calm them, the image of his wife immediately surfaced, the image of his tender daughter, he remembered that he was leaving them in the world, and he protested against it with all the strength of his soul, no less than if the sharpest selfishness were encouraging him in his chest.",12.781,11.964
3048,"But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate him. Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So, by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.","But that was only at the beginning. Soon after, he realized that the death he had to face was not shameful at all, and he felt more encouraged when he thought about how many people had walked that unjust path daily, and they still bravely trampled over death. Then he thought that it was his calm resilience that would help his loved ones live peacefully in the future. So gradually, he felt more at ease and could think about happier things for peace of mind.",5.547,3.852,"But all these were his initial feelings. Soon, the idea that the fate awaiting him was not something to be ashamed of, that many people were driven to this unjust path every day and faced it bravely, gave him strength. What followed was the thought that the inner peace and comfort of his loved ones depended on his own calm composure. Thus, as a result of these positive thoughts, Charles was able to gradually relax and calm down a bit.",5.937,4.401,"It is true that these struggles did not last long. It wasn't long before the consideration that the death awaiting him did not carry the appendage of dishonor acted as a powerful stimulant, and the thought that many, as innocent as he, walked the same painful path he had to walk every day and with firm steps. He then thought of the future peace of mind that, after the initial moments, his loved ones left in the world would enjoy if they saw him accept death with manly fortitude, and in this way, little by little and by degrees, he began to regain his calm and immerse himself in reflections of a higher nature.",9.943,8.814

Being allowed to purchase the means of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished.","Before nightfall on the day he was sentenced to death, Darnay was in that calm state of mind. Allowed to buy paper, pen, and a lamp, he sat down to write letters until the prison required the lights to be extinguished.",19.177,17.111,"These were the last thoughts wandering in his mind before night fell and everything turned dark, following his conviction.

3050,"He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing of her father’s imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself, and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father’s and uncle’s responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished, was the one condition—fully intelligible now—that her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her, for her father’s sake, never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He besought her—though he added that he knew it was needless—to console her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her father.","He wrote a long letter to Lucie, expressing that he had no knowledge of her father's imprisonment until he heard it from her, and that neither he nor she knew that the ones causing this suffering were his own father and uncle until they heard the court read those papers. He explained to her that hiding his forsaken name from her was a condition - now clear - that her father had attached to his daughter's marriage contract, and it was a promise he had fulfilled on the morning of the wedding. He begged her, for Dr. Manette's sake, never to seek whether her father had forgotten the existence of that testament, or had been reminded of it (temporarily or permanently) by the story of the Tower of London prison he had told one Sunday afternoon under the plane tree in the garden. If Dr. Manette remembered anything about that testament, he would surely believe it had been destroyed along with the Bastille prison, as he had never heard mention of those papers among the remnants of the prisoners that the crowd had found and displayed to the world. He implored - though he added that he knew this was unnecessary - that she comfort Dr. Manette with all the affection she could give her father, because he had done nothing to blame himself for, and in fact, he had only selflessly united her and him. At the end of the letter, after thanking her for giving him all her love and happiness, and advising her to overcome her sorrow to care for their beloved child, he asked her to think of the day they would meet again in Heaven to console her old father.",20.792,20.429,"He wrote a long letter to Lucie, explaining that until he heard from her, he knew nothing about his father's imprisonment, just like her, he was unaware of his father's and uncle's involvement in this disaster, and he learned about it when the paper was read. He had already explained to her that the reason he hid the name he had stopped using was because it was a condition set by his father before their engagement – the reason for this was now understood – and that he still insisted on this on the morning of their wedding. For the sake of his father, he begged his wife never to ask his father whether he had forgotten about the existence of this paper or whether he remembered it during the story of the tower told under that beautiful old plane tree in the garden on a Sunday. Even if it had occurred to him, he undoubtedly assumed it had been destroyed along with the Bastille, because among the belongings of the prisoners that the public disclosed, there was no mention of this writing. Using every conceivable means, he asked his wife to comfort his father by reiterating that there was no need for him to blame himself, only that he had forgotten himself for their well-being and unity – adding that there was no need to say this. Then he begged her not to forget how much he loved her and how grateful he was to her, to bury her sorrow and dedicate herself to their beloved children and to comforting his father, saying that they would one day be reunited in heaven.",16.653,16.285,"He wrote a very lengthy letter to Lucía, demonstrating to her that he had never had any news of her father's eternal captivity until he heard it from the man's own lips, and that, prior to reading the document found in the Bastille, he was as ignorant as she was of the direct culpability of her father and uncle in that sad event. He had already explained to her that, if he had concealed his true surname, a surname he had renounced, it was to fulfill a condition, whose reason he now perfectly understood, imposed by the doctor when giving his consent to the romantic relationship with his daughter, and ratified on the morning of their wedding. He earnestly begged her that, for the love of her father, she should never attempt to find out whether he had forgotten the existence of the document, or whether the story of the Tower of London told under the plane tree in the garden that summer night had reminded him of it. If he retained any memory of the document in question, he undoubtedly assumed it had been destroyed with the Bastille, seeing that it was not among the relics of the prisoners found by the mob and made so public that the entire world knew of them. He urged her—though adding that he already knew the recommendation was futile—to console her father, convincing him, by all imaginable means, that not only had he done nothing reprehensible, nothing that would have caused his misfortune, but that, on the contrary, he had always sacrificed himself for the happiness of his daughter and his daughter's husband. He ended by recommending that she try to overcome her sorrow, devote herself to her beloved daughter, and above all, that through sheer tenderness she console her father.",16.861,16.472
3051,"To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. And he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending.","The letter to Dr. Manette, he also wrote with that intention, but he entrusted his wife and children to the doctor's care. He wrote very strong words asking for the doctor's help, hoping that his father-in-law would escape all the dreary and dangerous recollections of the past, which he foresaw would inevitably trouble him.",8.598,6.399,He wrote a letter to Lucie's father in the same tone and expressed that he particularly entrusted his wife and child to him. The reason he emphasized this so much was his hope to keep him away from a potential state of despair and negative thoughts about the past.,12.841,10.818,"He wrote another letter to the doctor inspired by the same thoughts, telling him that he entrusted his wife and daughter to his care. With vibrant phrasing, he made this request, not because he considered it necessary, but rather to lift his spirits and drive away retrospective thoughts, which he assumed would arise more strongly than ever.",11.334,8.765

Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and he had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there was no difference in him.

Free and happy, he was back in the old house in Soho (though nothing inside matched the reality), with an incredible sense of peace and relief, he was with Lucie again, and his wife was telling him that it had all been a dream and that he hadn't gone anywhere. A sleep interval where he remembered nothing, then he saw the pains he had endured and returned to his wife's side, dead but peaceful, and there was no difference in between. Then another interval where he remembered nothing, and then he opened his eyes to a gloomy morning, unable to understand where he was or what he was for a moment, until that thought flashed in his mind, ""Today is my execution day!""",24.019,23.455,"However, he resurfaced during his sleep, and he resurfaced brilliant, charming. He found himself again in the quiet little corner of Soho, free, happy, content, in the company of his Lucia, who assured him that it had all been a dream, a nightmare, that they had never left England, that he had never been separated from her. This dream was followed by a pause of complete forgetfulness, after which he imagined that he lived with his wife, but dead, decapitated. Another pause of forgetfulness ensued, and he finally woke up in the morning, without realizing where he was or remembering what had happened the day before, until these words sprang into his mind in fiery characters: ""Today is the day of your death.""",14.532,13.492

Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no fear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.","He had never seen the instrument that would end his life.

Since they had no luggage, they would catch up with them shortly, or even get ahead to prepare the horses in advance, and while everyone was in fear of being late, they would have made this journey in the valuable hours of the night much easier.",18.336,17.765,"It will be necessary for us to make a small digression in order to clarify some points that the reader might find obscure. The previous night, when Lorry was finalizing the preparations for the fugitives' journey, the difficulty of bringing Miss Pross with him was a source of great concern for him. Not only was it highly desirable to avoid excess baggage that might hinder their progress, but also to minimize the time spent at the Barrier for examining documents and identifying travelers, as the salvation of all could depend on taking advantage of or losing mere seconds of time. After long considerations, and not without carefully weighing the disadvantages and advantages, he had proposed leaving Miss Pross and Jeremiah Lapa, who could leave the city whenever it suited them, with orders to start their journey at three in the morning, using one of the lightest carriages then known. Free from the encumbrance of luggage, they would soon catch up with the gentlemen, and might even leave them behind.",11.003,10.14
3226,"Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge, taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.","Seeing that this arrangement had the potential to help the urgent situation, Miss Pross gladly accepted. She and Jerry had seen Mr. Lorry's carriage depart, knew who Solomon had brought, endured ten tense and miserable minutes, and were now making final preparations to follow the previous carriage.

Together with Jerry, they had seen the departure of the carriage, understood who the person brought by Solomon was, and after writhing in curiosity for about ten minutes, they had followed the carriage as the final stage of the plan. Meanwhile, Madam Defarge, advancing through the streets, was getting closer to the deserted house where all those plans were made.",9.505,7.48,"Miss Pross gladly accepted a proposition that offered her the opportunity to render some important service to her loved ones. She and Jeremiah had met the person whom her brother Solomon had brought in a fainting state in a carriage, had seen off the travelers, had spent ten minutes in terrible anxiety, and were making the final preparations to set off and catch up with the carriage at the moment when the tavern keeper Defarge was approaching the house, with intentions that the readers know perfectly well.",6.769,5.202
