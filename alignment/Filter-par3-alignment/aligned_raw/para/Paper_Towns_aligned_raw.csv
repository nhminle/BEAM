But I increasingly felt that perhaps the joy of departure had captivated Margo to the extent that she didn't really care to leave a complete trail of breadcrumbs. If that were the case, the map Margo didn't intend for us to discover might be the best chance to find her. But no location on the map was precise enough. Even Catskill Park, which caught my attention because it was the only place not in or near a major city, was still too vast, too crowded to search for a single individual. ""Song of Myself"" led to places in New York City, but there were too many locations to track. How could one pinpoint a location on the map when that point seemed to always be moving from one city to another?",37.106,36.752,"All Wednesday night and Thursday, I tried to use my new understanding to find a connection between the clues I had, the travel guides, and the map; or between Whitman and the map, to understand his journey.

And if that was the case, the map he never planned for us to see might be our best chance to find him. But none of the locations on the map were clear enough. Even the point of interest, Catskill Park, which caught my attention because it was the only place not in or near a big city, was too large and crowded to find a single person.

And if that was the case, the map she hadn't intended for us to see could be our best bet to find her. But the markings on the map weren't concrete enough. Even the Catskill Park, which interested me because it was the only spot not in a big city, not even close, was too large and had too many inhabitants to find one person.
