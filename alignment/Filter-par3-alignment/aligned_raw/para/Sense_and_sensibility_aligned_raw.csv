1,"The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and their children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent. His attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence.","The Dashwood family had long been settled in Sussex. They had a large estate, their residence located at Norland Park, amidst the land they owned, where many generations had lived in a respectable manner, earning the goodwill of the surrounding families. The owner of this estate was a single man, who lived to a fairly old age, and for many years had his sister living with him to keep him company and manage his household. But this sister had died ten years before he passed away, bringing profound changes to his home; to compensate for the loss, he invited the family of his nephew, Henry Dashwood, to live with him. Henry was the heir to the Norland estate by law, and also the person he intended to bequeath it to. With the presence of his nephew's family, including his wife and children, the old man's final days were comfortable. He grew increasingly fond of them. Henry Dashwood and his wife attended to all the old man's wishes, not merely out of self-interest, but also out of a genuine desire to provide him with all the comfort his advanced age could receive; and the lively children added joy to his life. G",24.986,24.585,"The Dashwood family had settled in Sussex a long time ago. They were large landowners; their house was at Norland Park in the middle of the estate, and for generations, they had lived there in a very respectable manner, earning the respect of the people around them. The last owner of the estate was an unmarried man who had reached a very advanced age and had kept his sister as his companion and housekeeper for most of his life. But the death of his sister ten years ago had created a great change in his home; to fill the void left by his sister, he invited and accepted into his home the family of his nephew, Mr. Henry Dashwood, who was the legal heir to the Norland estate and whom he also intended to leave the estate to. In the company of his nephew, his nephew's wife, and their children, the old gentleman's last days were comfortable. His attachment to all of them increased. The continuous care that Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood showed him, which stemmed not so much from self-interest but from good-heartedness, provided him with every comfort that his age could enjoy; the children's cheerfulness also added a special joy to his life.",24.093,23.653,"The Dashwood family had long been settled in Sussex. Their property was of good size, and at its center was the residence, Norland Park, where the dignified manner in which they had lived for many generations earned them the respect of all the local acquaintances. The last owner of this property had been a bachelor who reached a very advanced age and who, for much of his life, had his sister as a faithful companion and housekeeper. But her death, which occurred ten years before his own, caused great changes in his household. To compensate for such a loss, he invited and received into his home the family of his nephew, Mr. Henry Dashwood, the rightful heir to the Norland estate and the person to whom he intended to leave it in his will. In the company of his nephew and niece, and their children, life passed comfortably for the elderly gentleman. His attachment to all of them grew over time. The constant attention that Mr. Henry Dashwood and his wife paid to his wishes, born not of mere interest but of the goodness of their hearts, made his life comfortable in all that, due to his age, could suit him; and the joy of the children added new delights to his existence.",35.694,35.372
2,"By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large, and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his wealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her child, and he had only a life–interest in it.","Mr. Henry Daswood had one son from his first marriage and three daughters from his second marriage. The young man had a steady temperament and was well-respected, being adequately provided for by his mother's substantial estate, half of which was allocated to him upon reaching adulthood. Likewise, through his marriage shortly after reaching adulthood, his estate was further increased. Therefore, inheriting the Norland estate was not as crucial for him as it was for his half-sisters; for they only inherited a small portion from their father. Their mother had no estate, and their father only had £7000; because the remaining small portion of the first wife's estate was reserved for her son, while he only enjoyed the income generated from this amount.",13.284,12.413,"Mr. Henry Dashwood had a son from his previous marriage and three daughters from his current wife. His son, a sensible and respectable young man, had a reasonable income from the large fortune that his mother had left him half of when he came of age. His own marriage, which took place shortly after, also significantly increased his wealth. Therefore, the ownership of the Norland estate was not as crucial to him as it was to his sisters; because aside from the share they might receive from their father's inheritance of that estate, the girls would not have much of a dowry. Their mother had nothing; their father had only seven thousand pounds, as the fortune of his first wife was tied up for her child, leaving him only a lifetime interest income.",21.603,20.925,"From a previous marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had a son; and from his current wife, three daughters. The son, a serious and respectable young man, had his future secured by his mother's fortune, which was considerable, and of which he had come into possession of half upon reaching the age of majority. Moreover, his own marriage, which occurred shortly after, made him even wealthier. For him, then, the inheritance of the Norland estate was not truly as important as it was for his sisters; for they, regardless of what might come to them if their father inherited that property, were of a fortune that can only be considered meager. Their mother had nothing, and the father could only dispose of seven thousand pounds, because the son was also a beneficiary of the remaining half of his first wife's fortune, and he only had the right to the usufruct of that patrimony while he lived.",26.04,25.527
3,"The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;—but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son;—but to his son, and his son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received from his niece and her daughters. He meant not to be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a–piece.","When the old man passed away, his will was opened and read, and, like most other wills, it created both disappointment and joy. He was neither biased nor ungrateful, withholding the portion of the estate that the grandchild deserved; but he left the grandchild to inherit through provisions that reduced the inheritance value by half. Mr. Henry Daswood had wished for more for his wife and three daughters and less for himself or his son. This son, along with his four-year-old child, inherited in such a way that he no longer had any authority to provide for those dearest to him—those who needed provision the most through portions of the estate or through the sale of valuable timber on his land. Everything was allocated to that child, who had won the affection of his grandfather through visits to his parents in Norland, affections that were nothing unusual for a two or three-year-old child: innocent speech, a lively temperament wanting to have his own way, many amusing antics and much noise, as if overshadowing all the value of the care and attention that the old man had received for many years from his granddaughter and her three daughters. However, the old man was not mean-spirited, and to show his affection for the three girls, he left 1000 pounds to each of them.",16.167,15.738,"The old gentleman died; his will was read, and like almost every will, it caused both joy and disappointment. He had not been so unjust or ungrateful as to leave his property to anyone other than his nephew; -but he had left the property to his nephew under such conditions that half of its value was lost. Mr. Dashwood had wanted the inheritance more for his wife and daughters than for himself or his son: -but the inheritance was mortgaged to his son and his son's four-year-old son, moreover, without leaving him the possibility to take care of those closest to him and most in need of income by renting out the land or selling its valuable forests. Everything was given to the possession of this child who, during his rare visits to Norland with his father and mother, had won his uncle's affection to such an extent that it diminished the value of all the affection he had received for years from his nephew and daughters, with his captivating qualities unusual in two or three-year-old children, his half-spoken words, his desire to do as he pleased, his cunning tricks, and his noise and clamor. However, he did not want to be heartless and, as a sign of the affection he felt for the three girls, he left them one thousand pounds each.",22.688,22.364,"The elderly gentleman passed away, his will was read, and, like almost all wills, it brought both disappointments and joys. In his last will, he was neither so unjust nor so ungrateful as to deprive his nephew of the lands, but he left them under such terms that they destroyed half the value of the legacy. Mr. Dashwood had desired these properties more for the well-being of his wife and daughters than for himself and his son; however, the inheritance was assigned to his son, and to his son's son, a four-year-old child, in such a way that it deprived him of any possibility to care for those dearest to him and who most needed support, whether through an eventual mortgage on the properties or the sale of their valuable forests. Necessary provisions had been made to ensure that everything would benefit this child, who, during his occasional visits to Norland with his father and mother, had won his uncle's affection with those charming traits that are not uncommon in children of two or three years old: imperfect pronunciation, the unwavering desire to always have his way, countless pranks and tricks, and lots of noise, charms that ultimately ended up outweighing the value of all the attentions that the gentleman had received for years from his niece and her daughters. It was not his intention, however, to lack kindness, and as a sign of his affection for the three girls, he left a thousand pounds to each of them.",32.025,31.744
4,"Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for his widow and daughters.","Mr. Daswood was initially deeply disappointed but appeared cheerful and confident: he had reason to hope to live many more years, and if he lived frugally, he could build up a considerable amount from the extensive and profitable land, which almost immediately had the potential to improve the situation. But because it was created too late, the estate lasted only 12 months. He only outlived his uncle by such a short time, and his widow and daughters were left with only 10,000 pounds, including future inheritances.",12.003,10.385,"Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was severe at first; but his temperament was cheerful and optimistic; he could naturally expect to live many more years, and by living frugally, he could set aside a considerable amount from the produce income of an already extensive estate that was almost immediately ready to be operated. But the fortune, which was quite delayed in arriving, became his income for only one year. He did not live long after his uncle; including the last inheritances, only ten thousand pounds remained for his widow and daughters.",28.045,27.127,"At first, Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was profound; but he was of a cheerful and trusting temperament; he could reasonably expect to live many years and, by living frugally, save a considerable sum from the income of an already sizable estate, and one capable of almost immediate increase. But the fortune, which had taken so long to arrive, was his for only a year. He survived his uncle by no more than that, and ten thousand pounds, including the last legacies, was all that remained for his widow and daughters.",43.025,42.41
5,"His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness could command, the interest of his mother–in–law and sisters.","The son of the man was summoned immediately when he recognized the perilous state of his condition and, with all the strength and urgency that his severe illness allowed, Mr. Daswood urged him regarding the rights of his stepmother and his three half-sisters.",18.985,16.934,"When his life-threatening condition was discovered, his son was immediately summoned; Mr. Dashwood, with all the strength and insistence his illness allowed, bequeathed the care of his stepmother and sisters to his son.",24.153,21.59,"As soon as it was known that Mr. Dashwood's life was in danger, they sent for his son, and the father entrusted him, with the intensity and urgency that the illness necessitated, with the well-being of his stepmother and sisters.",12.818,9.709
6,"Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an assurance, and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them.","Mr. John Dashwood did not have any close emotional ties with the remaining members of the family; but he was influenced by the suggestion made in such a manner and under such circumstances, and he promised to do everything within his power to ensure they lived comfortably. The father felt relieved by this promise, and Mr. John Dashwood had ample time to calculate how he could exercise his abilities prudently to take care of them.",28.185,27.21,Mr. John Dashwood did not possess the strong emotions of the other family members; but he was affected by such a will conversation at such a time and promised to do his best to comfort them. This assurance relieved his father; then Mr. John Dashwood found time to consider what he could do for them within the bounds of reason.,22.299,21.069,"Mr. John Dashwood did not have the depth of feelings of the rest of the family, but he was affected by such a recommendation at a moment like that, and he promised to do everything possible for the well-being of his relatives. The father felt reassured by such a promise, and Mr. John Dashwood then took his time to consider how much he could prudently do for them.",35.647,34.784
7,"He was not an ill–disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill–disposed: but he was, in general, well respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties. Had he married a more amiable woman, he might have been made still more respectable than he was:—he might even have been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and very fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;—more narrow–minded and selfish.","He was not a callous young man; it was merely his indifference and considerable selfishness that made him appear so. Generally, he was respected because he was conscious of properly fulfilling his usual obligations. If he had married a more compassionate wife, he might have been more esteemed, and he himself might have become more amiable; all because he married at a young age and deeply loved his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood turned out to be a caricature of him: narrower-minded and more selfish.",17.819,16.825,"He was not a heartless young man, if being a little insensitive, even selfish, does not count as heartlessness: but he was generally respected, because he conducted his daily affairs with a sense of propriety and decorum. He might have become even more esteemed had he married a more charming woman: -he was very young when he married and was very fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of her husband; -narrower-minded and more selfish.",30.581,29.948,"John Dashwood was not an ill-disposed young man, unless being somewhat cold-hearted and a little selfish counts as ill-disposed; but in general, he was respected because he behaved correctly in the performance of his everyday duties. Had he married a kinder woman, he might have become more respectable than he was —he might even have turned into a kind person himself— because he was very young when he married and was very fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a harsh caricature of her husband, narrower-minded and more selfish than he was.",37.565,36.957
8,"When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a–piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. The prospect of four thousand a–year, in addition to his present income, besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, warmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.— ""Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would be enough to make them completely easy. Three thousand pounds! he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.""— He thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did not repent.","When he promised his father, he planned to increase the inheritance of each half-sister by 1000 pounds. At that time, he thought he was truly capable of doing this. The prospect of 4000 pounds per year added to his current income, not to mention half of his late mother's estate, warmed his heart and made him feel generous. ""Yes, he would give the three sisters 3000 pounds, a generous and seemingly significant amount. Enough to help the three sisters live comfortably. 3000 pounds! He could allocate such a large sum without much effort."" He thought about this all day, and for many days afterwards he did not regret it.",20.949,20.202,"When he promised his father, he deliberated within himself and thought of increasing his sisters' fortunes by giving them a gift of a thousand pounds each. Then he decided that he could indeed manage this much. Thinking about an additional four thousand pounds a year to his current income, plus the remaining half of his mother's fortune, warmed his heart and made him feel that he had the power to be generous. ""Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would be generous and grand! This would be enough to make them quite comfortable. Three thousand pounds! He could set aside such a significant amount without much trouble."" -He thought about this all day, then for many days in a row, and he did not regret it.",34.546,34.052,"When making the promise to his father, he had internally weighed the possibility of increasing his sisters' fortune by gifting them a thousand pounds each. At that moment, he truly felt up to such a task. The prospect of increasing his current income by four thousand pounds annually, which would be added to the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, gladdened his heart and made him feel very generous. “Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: What a splendid and generous gesture! It would be enough to leave them in complete comfort. Three thousand pounds! He could part with such a considerable sum with almost no inconvenience.” He thought about it all day, and for many successive days, and he did not regret it.",34.667,34.16
9,"No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her mother–in–law, arrived with her child and their attendants. No one could dispute her right to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of his father's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;—but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of immovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband's family; but she had had no opportunity, till the present, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it.","Immediately after her husband's father's funeral was over, John Daswood's wife, along with her child and servants, moved in without informing her husband's stepmother. No one could question her right to move in: the estate had belonged to her husband since the moment the old man passed away, but what was notable was her lack of tact. For a woman in Mrs. Daswood's situation, even ordinary feelings would be enough to cause discomfort; moreover, her sense of honor, a notion so encompassing it bordered on the romantic, made any offense caused or received by anyone a source of unshakable disgust for her. John Daswood's wife had never been liked by anyone in her husband's family, and this was even before she had the chance to show them her insensitivity to others' feelings in such a delicate situation.",11.954,11.056,"As soon as her father's funeral was over, Mrs. John Dashwood arrived with her child and helpers without informing her stepmother of her intentions. No one could dispute her right to come; from the moment her father died, the house belonged to her husband; but the rudeness of her behavior was significant, and it would have been quite distressing for any woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, even if she had only ordinary feelings. However, Mrs. Dashwood possessed such a strong sense of honor, such passionate nobility, that any insult, no matter who it came from or who it was directed at, was a source of profound disgust for her. Mrs. John Dashwood was not someone anyone in her husband's family liked; but until now, she had never had the opportunity to show them how little concern she could act with for the welfare of others when the situation demanded it.",23.973,23.407,"No sooner had the funeral of his father ended when John Dashwood's wife, without having given any notice of her intentions to her mother-in-law, arrived with her son and her servants. No one could dispute her right to come: the house belonged to her husband from the very moment of his father's death. But that very fact aggravated the lack of delicacy in her conduct, and no special sensitivity was needed for any woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation to feel greatly wronged by it; in her, however, there was such a high sense of honor, such a romantic generosity, that any offense of this kind, whether exercised or received by anyone, became a source of indelible displeasure. Mrs. John Dashwood had never counted on the special favor of anyone in her husband's family; but, until now, she had not had the opportunity to show them how little consideration for the well-being of others she could act with when the occasion required it.",25.504,24.975
10,"So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her daughter–in–law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother.","Mrs. Daswood deeply recognized this rude behavior and despised her daughter-in-law terribly, to the point that when she came, she could have moved elsewhere, if not for her eldest daughter advising her to reconsider. Then, her love for her three daughters made her decide to stay; and also for their sake, she wanted to avoid a rift in the relationship with their brother.",8.412,6.321,"Mrs. Dashwood felt this vulgar behavior so acutely and resented her daughter-in-law so much for it that, had it not been for her eldest daughter's advice making her consider whether it was appropriate to leave, and then her deep love for her three children convincing her to stay and avoid conflict with their brother, she would have permanently left the house when her daughter-in-law arrived.",11.434,9.163,"Mrs. Dashwood felt this discourteous behavior so acutely, and it produced such intense disdain towards her daughter-in-law, that upon the latter's arrival she would have left the house forever had it not been for, first, her eldest daughter's plea which led her to reflect on the advisability of doing so; and later, the tender love she felt for her three daughters, which decided her to stay and for their sake avoid a rupture with their brother.",15.383,13.408
11,"Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence. She had an excellent heart;—her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.","Elinor, the eldest daughter with very useful advice, has a strong quality through her empathy and calmness in judgment. Therefore, despite being only 19 years old, she has become an advisor to her mother, thereby helping everyone as she counterbalances Mrs. Dashwood's often imprudent exuberance. She has a kind heart; affectionate temperament and resolute spirit, but she knows how to restrain herself. This is an awareness that her mother has yet to grasp and her younger sisters still do not wish to be taught.",7.315,5.678,"Her eldest daughter Elinor, whose advice was quite effective, possessed a strong understanding and calm judgment; even though she was only nineteen years old, these qualities made her the counselor of her mother and often gave her the chance to balance Mrs. Dashwood's often imprudent hastiness in a way that benefited them all. She had a wonderful heart; her manners were affectionate; her feelings were strong, but she also knew how to manage them: a knowledge that her mother had not yet learned and one of her sisters was determined never to learn.",15.009,13.655,"Elinor, this eldest daughter whose recommendation had been so effective, possessed a solidity of understanding and serenity of judgment that qualified her, even at only nineteen years old, to advise her mother, and often allowed her to counteract, for the benefit of the whole family, that vehemence of spirit in Mrs. Dashwood that so often could lead her to imprudence. She was of great heart, affectionate character, and deep feelings. But she knew how to govern them: something her mother had yet to learn, and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.",36.275,35.691
12,"Marianne's abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor's. She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have no moderation. She was generous, amiable, interesting: she was everything but prudent. The resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great.","The abilities of her stepsister Marianne are quite similar to Elinor in many aspects. She is sensitive, intelligent, but passionate in everything: her sorrows and joys have no bounds. She is generous, likable, and attentive; she possesses many virtues except for a lack of caution. She is very much like her mother in this regard.",12.645,10.507,"Marianne's abilities were in many ways not inferior to Elinor's. She was intelligent and clever, but hasty in everything; her sorrow and her joy knew no bounds. Generous, charming, and engaging: her only deficiency was common sense. There was a striking resemblance between her and her mother.",22.564,20.904,"Marianne's qualities were, in many respects, on par with Elinor's. She had intelligence and good judgment, but she was vehement in everything; neither her sorrows nor her joys knew moderation. She was generous, kind, attractive: she was everything, except prudent. The resemblance between her and her mother was remarkable.",41.288,40.219
13,"Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister's sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction. The agony of grief which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought for, was created again and again. They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future. Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could struggle, she could exert herself. She could consult with her brother, could receive her sister–in–law on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.","Elinor worriedly realized that her sister was overly sensitive, but in their mother's eyes, this was something to be valued and praised. The mother and daughter encouraged each other in the way they were closely bonded. The concerns that initially troubled them were later cherished, and they sought more pain, continually creating more pain. They completely indulged in their sorrow, tormented further by sorrowful thoughts, and refused to accept anyone's advice. Elinor was also deeply affected, but she still resisted and was able to overcome it on her own. She could consult her brother, welcome her sister-in-law and treat her kindly, and try to encourage her mother to do the same, urging her to endure as she did.",8.801,7.126,"Elinor watched her sister's passionate excesses with concern; but Mrs. Dashwood valued and supported them. They were now encouraging each other regarding the severity of the disaster that had befallen them. The grief that initially rendered them powerless was voluntarily renewed, sought after, and recreated repeatedly. They gave themselves entirely to their sorrow; they tried to amplify the feeling of misery as much as possible with every thought and stubbornly resisted the idea that there could be consolation in the future. Elinor was also in deep sorrow; but she could still struggle and assert herself. She could talk to her brother, greet her sister-in-law when she arrived and show her proper attention, and she tried to persuade her mother to come forward and be equally resilient.",12.801,11.633,"Elinor was worried about her sister's excessive sensitivity, the same that Mrs. Dashwood valued and appreciated. In the current circumstances, they incited each other to live their grief without allowing its intensity to diminish. They voluntarily renewed, sought, and recreated over and over again the agony of sorrow that had overwhelmed them at the beginning. They completely surrendered to their grief, seeking to increase their misery with every image capable of reflecting it, and decided never to admit consolation in the future.

Giving fifty pounds occasionally prevents them from running out of money and certainly fulfills the promise I made to my father.""",18.248,17.325,"—I think you're right, my love; it would be better if there were no annual allowance in this case; whatever I can give them occasionally will be of much greater help than an annual allowance, because if they felt secure with a higher income, they would only elevate their lifestyle, and thus they would not be a penny richer at the end of the year. Anyway, it will be for the best. A gift of fifty pounds from time to time will prevent them from worrying about money matters, and I think it will fully settle the promise made to my father.",27.176,26.382
39,"""To be sure it will. Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all. The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might be reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things, and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they are in season. I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed, it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did. Do but consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother–in–law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds, besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which brings them in fifty pounds a year a–piece, and, of course, they will pay their mother for their board out of it. Altogether, they will have five hundred a–year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want for more than that?—They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all. They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly any servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of any kind! Only conceive how comfortable they will be! Five hundred a year! I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it. They will be much more able to give YOU something.""","-I'm sure of it. In fact, I firmly believe that your father never intended for you to give them money. I am certain that the support he had in mind was only to a certain extent; for example, finding them a small, comfortable house, helping them move, giving them fish you caught or game you hunted, depending on the season. I am sure that the old man had no other intentions; in fact, if he did, it would be strange and unreasonable. ""Dear Mr. Daswood, please consider how comfortably your stepmother and her daughters can live on the interest from £7000, plus £1000 for each daughter, giving each daughter £50, which they would naturally use to pay for their mother's housing. All together, they would have £500 per year; what more could four women want? They would live with very low expenses! House maintenance costs would be negligible. They would not have a carriage, no horses, scarcely any servants, no relatives living with them, and no such expenses at all! Just think about how comfortably they would live! £500 per year! I cannot imagine how they would spend even half of that amount; and then you give them more, it's truly absurd. They have more than enough to give you a portion.""",11.411,10.85,"And how!

I swear he didn't mean anything more; because it would be strange and unreasonable if he did. Just think, Mr. Dashwood, darling, with the interest from seven thousand pounds, your stepmother and her daughters would live in such great comfort, plus each girl has her own thousand pounds, from which they get fifty pounds each and of course give it to their mother for kitchen expenses. If you add it up, they have five hundred pounds a year; I mean, really, what more could four women do with that? -They will live very cheaply! What is it to run a house? They have no carriages, no horses, no proper servants; there's no one with them; they can't spend a penny! Look how comfortable they will be! Five hundred a year! I don't think they could even spend half of it; as for you giving them more, it's ridiculous to even think about it. They should be giving to you instead.""",17.779,17.42,"—Of course he will.

I would bet my life that he was thinking of no more than that; indeed, it would be quite odd and improper if he had intended anything else. If not, think, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how comfortably your mother and her daughters can live on the interest of seven thousand pounds, plus the thousand pounds each of the girls have, which brings them fifty pounds annually per person; and, of course, from there they will pay their mother for her lodging. Altogether they will have five hundred pounds annually, and what more could four women possibly need? It will be so cheap for them to live! The maintenance of the house will be nothing. They will have no carriages or horses, and almost no servants; they will not receive visitors, and what expenses will they have! Just think how well off they will be! Five hundred annually!

His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence. And besides all this, I am afraid, Mama, he has no real taste.

I thought so at the time; but you WOULD give him Cowper.""","Marianne replied: - Perhaps so, you might look at this without much surprise. Edward is a very likable person; you have a deep affection for him. However, he is not the type of young man- lacking something, his appearance is not outstanding- he does not have the elegance that you would expect from someone seriously committed to your sister. His eyes lack the soul, the fire that radiates virtue and intelligence. ""And mom, besides these things, I'm afraid he doesn't have a genuine sense of aesthetics. It seems he doesn't like music, and although he really likes Elinor's paintings, that's not the way of appreciating them by someone who understands their value.

He lacks that spirit, that fire in his eyes that express virtue and intelligence. Moreover, I fear, my dear mother, he is a tasteless person. He doesn't seem to have an interest in music; although he likes Elinor's paintings very much, it's not the appreciation of someone who can understand the value of the paintings. Even though he often shows interest while Elinor is painting, it's clear he doesn't understand the subject. He likes her as a lover, not as an expert. For me to be satisfied, these qualities must be combined. I cannot be happy with a man who doesn't share the same taste in everything with me.

She said:",16.534,15.407,"Elinor was surprised by this explanation and regretted the warm feelings she had revealed when talking about the young man. She realized that she cared deeply for Edward. She believed that this care was mutual; but she needed more assurance to find Marianne's belief in their closeness reasonable.

She tried to explain the true nature of the matter to her sister.",32.431,31.793,"Elinor was startled by this declaration and regretted having allowed herself to be betrayed by the heat of her words. She felt that Edward held a very high place in her affections. She believed that the interest was mutual, but required greater certainty in this regard to accept Marianne's conviction about their relationship with pleasure. She knew that a conjecture Marianne and her mother made at one moment would turn into certainty the next; that, with them, desire was hope and hope was expectation. She tried to explain to her sister the true state of the situation.",21.58,20.422

There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by believing or calling it more than it is.

We do not know what his mother thinks; but judging by the way Fanny occasionally comments on her attitude and opinions, we should not assume she is a pleasant person.

84,"Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister. She could not consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it. There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost as unpromising. A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need not give him more than inquietude. It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him. A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection. She knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement. With such a knowledge as this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject. She was far from depending on that result of his preference of her, which her mother and sister still considered as certain. Nay, the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more than friendship.","Elinor told her sister her true opinion. She could not indulge her feelings for Edward to the passionate extent that Marianne believed she should. Sometimes, she did not see him express clear feelings, which made her think that if it was not indifference, it seemed almost like a lack of promise. Even if he was uncertain about her feelings, he should not have become more silent because of it. That thought could hardly make him as withdrawn as she often observed. Rather, it was probably because he was not independent, so he could not live according to his feelings. She knew that at this time, his mother did not make his life comfortable at his home and did not promise to help him establish a home of his own, as she still wanted to impose her will to elevate his status. In such an understanding, Elinor could not feel comfortable. She could not rely solely on his feelings for her, which her mother and sister firmly believed in. No, the closer they got, the more uncertain she became about his thoughts. At times, in moments of sadness, she believed that there was nothing more than friendship.",11.786,11.17,"Elinor had revealed her true opinion to her sister. She did not think her relationship with Edward was as rosy as Marianne believed. From time to time, the young man had a mood of unease which, if it did not indicate indifference, spoke of something almost as troubling. If he had any doubts about Elinor's feelings, it should have caused him nothing but discomfort. It was unlikely to be the cause of that frequent absent-mindedness that settled over him. A more plausible reason could be found in the reality of a dependency that forbade him from giving in to his feelings. She knew that unless he strictly adhered to his mother's views about his future, she neither treated him in a way that would make him comfortable at home nor gave him the confidence to establish a home of his own. After having such knowledge, it was impossible for Elinor to feel at ease about this matter. Even though her mother and sister were certain, she could not trust the outcome of Edward's interest in her. In fact, the longer they spent together, the more doubtful the nature of his interest seemed; sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it was nothing more than friendship.",26.229,25.856,"Elinor had given her true opinion to her sister. She could not consider her inclination for Edward under the favorable prospects that Marianne had supposed. There was, at times, a lack of spirit in him that, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost equally unpromising. If he had doubts about the affection she professed for him, assuming he had them, it should cause him nothing but uneasiness. It did not seem possible that they caused that dejection of spirit that often overcame him. A more reasonable cause could be found in his situation of dependency, which barred him from giving himself to his affections. She knew that the treatment his mother gave him did not provide him with a comfortable home at present nor gave him any assurance that he could form a home of his own, unless he strictly adhered to the ideas she held about the importance he should achieve. Knowing this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel at ease. She was far from trusting in that outcome of Edward's preferences that his mother and sister took for granted. No, the more time they spent together, the more doubtful the nature of his affection seemed to her; and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it was nothing more than simple friendship.",34.403,34.107
85,"But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, (which was still more common,) to make her uncivil. She took the first opportunity of affronting her mother–in–law on the occasion, talking to her so expressively of her brother's great expectations, of Mrs. Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm. She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations.","However, even if there truly were any limits, his sister still felt at the end of her tether upon realizing the situation, which made her frustrated, and at the same time (even more frequently) made her become impolite. Whenever she had the chance, she confronted her mother-in-law, speaking eloquently about his ambitions, about Mrs. Ferras' intention that both her sons should marry into nobility, and about the lurking danger from any girl trying to seduce him. She even accused Mrs. Daswood of being unable to pretend ignorance or maintain a calm demeanor. The mother-in-law gave her a response that clearly showed her contempt, then immediately left the room, determined that her beloved Elinor should not have to endure any more of these insinuations for even another week, no matter how difficult or costly it might be to leave.",15.774,15.046,"Nevertheless, whatever the real boundaries were, it was enough to disturb, even (more so) irritate Edward when noticed by his sister. At the first opportunity, she would torment her mother-in-law by elaborately describing her brother's great hopes, Mrs. Ferrars' determination to secure good marriages for both of her sons, and the dangers awaiting any young woman who might attempt to win him over, to such an extent that Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unaware nor try to remain calm. She would give a response showing her disgust and leave the room at that moment, deciding to leave immediately, no matter the cost, to avoid subjecting her dear Elinor to those insults for another week.",15.676,14.948,"But, whatever its actual limits were, that affection was sufficient, as soon as Edward's sister perceived it, to unsettle her; —and at the same time (which was even more usual), to bring out her bad manners.

She gave a response that revealed her disdain and immediately left the room, while making the decision that whatever the inconveniences or expenses of such a sudden departure, her dearly beloved Elinor should not be exposed to such insinuations for even one more week.",20.251,19.567
86,"In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from the post, which contained a proposal particularly well timed. It was the offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of her own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire. The letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation. He understood that she was in need of a dwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage, he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary, if the situation pleased her. He earnestly pressed her, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come with her daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from whence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houses were in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortable to her. He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections. She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry. Her resolution was formed as she read. The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first recommendation. To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter–in–law's guest; and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress. She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal; and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters, that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent.","In such a state of mind, Mrs. Daswood received a letter via post, presenting a particularly timely proposal. The letter was from a relative of hers, who held a position and considerable property in Devonshire, inviting her to move to a small house with favorable rental conditions. This gentleman wrote the letter in a spirit of genuine friendliness. He had learned that she was in need of a new residence; and although the house was merely a vacation home, he promised to do everything she needed, if she wished. He provided details about Barton Cottage and the garden within his parish, earnestly inviting her and her daughters to come to Barton Park, where he resided, so they could see for themselves how to make the house comfortable enough for them. It seemed that he was eager to receive them, and the letter expressing friendliness made his cousin particularly pleased, especially at a time when she was suffering from the cold and indifferent attitudes of those around her. She did not want to waste time thinking or inquiring. As soon as she read the letter, her mind was made up. If just a few hours earlier, the location of Barton Cottage in the countryside far from Devonshire had made her indifferent, now she accepted it. She no longer regretted leaving Devonshire; on the contrary, she desired to go far away. This was fortunate compared to the unpleasant situation of being a guest of her daughter-in-law. She immediately replied to thank Sir John Middleton for his kindness and accepted his invitation; then hurriedly showed both letters to her daughters, as she wanted them to agree with her decision before she sent the response.",11.358,10.996,"In this state of mind, a letter arrived for her in the mail; it contained a very well-timed offer. It was an offer for a small house under very comfortable conditions; the house belonged to a relative of importance and property in Devonshire. The letter came directly from the gentleman himself and was written in a spirit of genuine friendship and benevolence. The gentleman had learned that she needed a house, and although the house he was offering was just a cottage, he assured her that everything necessary would be done as long as she liked the environment. After providing details of the house and garden, he insisted that she come to his residence, Barton Park, with her daughters; she could decide from there whether Barton Cottage, located in the same village, could be made comfortable for her with some modifications. He seemed genuinely eager to help them; the entire letter was written in such a friendly manner that it did not fail to please her cousin, especially at a time when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behavior of her closer relatives. She did not need time to think or investigate. She made her decision while reading. The location of Barton, in a county as far from Sussex as Devonshire, which until a few hours ago would have been a sufficient reason to invalidate all possible advantages of the place, now became its most important feature. Leaving the Norland area no longer seemed bad; it had become desirable; compared to the ongoing misery of her daughter-in-law's hospitality, it was a blessing; leaving that beloved place forever would be less painful than staying there or visiting it as long as such a woman was its mistress. She immediately wrote to Sir John Middleton, expressing her appreciation for his kindness and accepting his offer; then, in a rush, she showed both letters to her daughters to get their approval before sending her response.",24.053,23.819,"In this state of mind, she received a letter by mail with a particularly timely proposal. A distinguished gentleman and owner of important properties in Devonshire, a relative of hers, offered her a small house on very convenient terms. The letter, signed by him, was written in a friendly and helpful tone. He understood that she needed accommodation, and although what he was now offering her was a simple country house, a cottage of his own, he assured her that everything she thought necessary would be done if she liked the location. He urged her insistently, after describing the house and garden in detail, to go to Barton Park, where his own residence was, and from where she could judge for herself if the cottage at Barton—because both houses belonged to the same parish—could be arranged to her convenience. He seemed genuinely anxious to accommodate them, and his entire letter was written in such a friendly style that it could not help but please his cousin, especially at a time when she was suffering from the cold and insensitive behavior of her closest relatives. She needed no time for deliberations or consultations. Along with reading the letter, she made her decision. The location of Barton in a county as distant from Sussex as Devonshire, something that just a few hours earlier would have been a sufficient objection to counteract all the possible merits of the place, was now its main advantage. Leaving the neighborhood of Norland no longer seemed a bad thing; it was an object of desire, a blessing compared to the misery of continuing to be a guest of her daughter-in-law. And moving away forever from that beloved place was going to be less painful than living in it or visiting it while that woman was its mistress and lady. She immediately wrote to Sir John Middleton expressing her gratitude for his kindness and accepting his proposal; then she hurried to show both letters to her daughters, ensuring their approval before sending them.",23.573,23.32
87,"Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present acquaintance. On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose her mother's intention of removing into Devonshire. The house, too, as described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either point; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence.","Elinor had always thought it was better to be cautious and stable at a distance from Norland, rather than living among the current relationships. Therefore, in this direction, she had no reason to oppose her mother's intention to move to Devonshire. Moreover, according to Sir John, the house was compact and the rent was low, so she had no grounds to object based on these two criteria. Thus, she did not hinder her mother from accepting the offer, although in another direction, it was not the plan she had dreamed of, even though moving completely away from the vicinity of Norland was against her wishes.",18.287,17.458,"Elinor had always thought it would be wiser for them to settle a little farther from Norland rather than being among those people all the time.

92,"Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture. He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.— The furniture was all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's. Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own, she should have any handsome article of furniture.","Mr. John Dashwood repeatedly expressed to her that he deeply regretted she had chosen a place so far from Norland, making it impossible for him to help her move the furniture. He was genuinely troubled by this, as it made it difficult for him to fulfill his promise to his father on his deathbed. All the furniture had to be transported by sea. These items included bedding, dishes, books, along with Marianne's piano. Mrs. John Dashwood sighed as she watched the furniture being taken away: she couldn't shake off the thought that, given Mrs. Dashwood's income would be so much lower than hers, she ought to have been the one to own such luxurious items.",15.977,15.25,"Mr. John Dashwood repeatedly expressed how sorry he was that he had taken a house too far away to help with the transportation of the furniture from Norland. The situation really troubled his conscience; because the action that defined the scope of the promise he made to his father became practically impossible in this case. The furniture was sent by sea. It consisted of bedding, dishes, porcelain, and books; there was also Marianne's beautiful piano. Mrs. John Dashwood watched the departure of the packages with a sigh: despite their own income being far greater than Mrs. Dashwood's, she couldn't help but resent that Mrs. Dashwood had such beautiful furniture.",15.318,14.479,"Mr. John Dashwood repeatedly told his mother how deeply he regretted that she had taken a house at such a great distance from Norland, which would prevent him from offering his services for the transportation of her furniture. He was truly annoyed by the situation because it made impracticable that effort to which he had limited the fulfillment of his promise to his father. The belongings were sent by sea. They consisted mainly of linens, cutlery, crockery, and books, along with a beautiful piano belonging to Marianne. Mrs. John Dashwood watched the packages depart with a sigh; she couldn't help feeling that since Mrs. Dashwood's rent was going to be so insignificant compared to hers, she deserved to have any piece of furniture that was beautiful.",28.415,27.861
93,"Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished, and she might have immediate possession. No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before she set off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her, was soon done.—The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter. For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed. HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland.","The furnishing of the new residence was complete, and Mrs. Daswood could move in immediately. There were no issues between the landlord and the tenant. She only had to liquidate the furniture at Norland, arrange the new living quarters, and she completed these tasks very quickly. A short time after her husband's death, she had sold the horses he left behind, and now, having the opportunity to liquidate the carriage, she also agreed to do so following the earnest advice of her eldest daughter. If she had her way, she might have kept the carriage for the convenience of her daughters; but Elinor's opinion was decisive. Her prudent calculations also limited the number of servants to three: two maids and a butler who had been with the family since they settled at Norland.",13.8,13.127,"Mrs. Dashwood rented it for twelve months; the house was well-maintained and could be moved into immediately. There were no difficulties on either side regarding the contract; she only waited for her belongings to be cleared out of Norland before setting off westward to establish her new home, which was quickly done as she was extremely swift in attending to everything that concerned her. The horses her husband had left her were sold immediately after his death; now, upon receiving an offer to sell her carriage, she agreed to do so following the persistent advice of her eldest daughter. If it were up to her, she would have kept the carriage for the comfort of her children; but Elinor's decision prevailed. Again, it was her wisdom that limited the number of servants in their household to three; two maids and a footman, quickly chosen from among those who had formed their establishment at Norland.",25.743,25.273,"Mrs. Dashwood rented the house for a year; it was already furnished, and she could take possession of it immediately. None of the interested parties raised any objections to the agreement, and she only awaited the dispatch of her effects from Norland and the decision on her future domestic service before heading west; and this, given the extreme speed with which she carried out everything that interested her, was very soon accomplished. The horses her husband had left her had been sold after his death, and now having an opportunity to dispose of her carriage, she agreed to sell it at the urging of her eldest daughter. If it had depended on her own wishes, she would have kept it, for the greater comfort of her daughters; but Elinor's good judgment prevailed. It was also her wisdom that limited the number of servants to three, two maids and one man, promptly selected from those who had been part of her service at Norland.",30.131,29.659
94,"The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress's arrival; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house, as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own. Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter–in–law in the prospect of her removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure. Now was the time when her son–in–law's promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled. Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment. But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced, from the general drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland. He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away.","The butler and one of the two maids were immediately sent to Devonshire to prepare the house before everyone moved in, as Mrs. Daswood was completely unfamiliar with Lady Middleton and preferred to move straight to the new house rather than stay as a guest at Braton Park for a while. She had no doubts about Sir John's description of the house, so she was not curious to inspect it before moving in. Her eagerness to leave Norland did not fade with the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law upon seeing her about to leave; a satisfaction that could hardly be concealed by the cold words inviting her to stay longer. Now is the time the son can keep his promise to his late father. But soon Mrs. Daswood lost all hope in this matter: from his procrastination, she was convinced that his support would not extend beyond allowing them to stay at Norland for six months. He often spoke of the increasing household expenses and the endless demands on his finances more than any other man of status in the world, so much so that it seemed he needed more money rather than being able to provide financial assistance.",11.948,11.469,"One of the servants was immediately sent to Devonshire to prepare the house for their mistresses' arrival; because Mrs. Dashwood, not knowing Lady Middleton, preferred to go directly to the cottage rather than be a guest at Barton Park; she trusted Sir John's directions to the house so unquestioningly that she did not even feel the desire to take a closer look until she set foot in it as her own home. Her desire to leave Norland was not diminished at all by her daughter-in-law's obvious satisfaction at her departure - a satisfaction that was only lightly veiled under a cold invitation to delay her departure. Now was the time for her stepson to fulfill the promise he had made to his father in due form. Since he had neglected to do this when he first arrived at the mansion, their departure could be seen as the most appropriate time to fulfill the promise. But Mrs. Dashwood soon began to give up all such hopes and to understand from the general flow of his conversation that the help he would provide would not extend beyond sustaining their six-month stay at Norland. He spoke so often of the increase in household expenses and the endless, countless demands on his purse that, far from giving money, he himself seemed to be in need of it.",19.142,18.766,"The man and one of the maids immediately set off to Devonshire to prepare the house for the arrival of their mistress, for since Mrs. Dashwood was completely unfamiliar with Lady Middleton, she preferred to go directly to the cottage rather than stay at Barton Park; and she trusted so much in the description that Sir John had given of the house that she did not feel curious to examine it for herself until she entered it as its owner. The evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law at the prospect of her departure, barely concealed behind a cold invitation to stay a while longer, kept her anxiety to leave Norland intact. Now was the moment when John Dashwood's promise to his father could have been fulfilled with particular appropriateness. As he had neglected to do so upon arriving at the house, the moment when they were leaving it seemed the most suitable for it. But very soon Mrs. Dashwood abandoned all hope in this regard and began to convince herself, by the general sense of his words, that his help would go no further than having kept them at Norland for six months. So often did he refer to the increasing household expenses and the constant and incalculable monetary demands to which any gentleman of some importance was exposed, that he seemed more in need of money than willing to give it.",21.168,20.783
95,"In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton's first letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey.","A few weeks after Sir John Middleton's letter arrived at Norland, everything was settled for Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey.",29.4,28.217,"Just a few weeks after Sir John Middleton's first letter arrived at Norland, everything in their future home was prepared in a way that allowed Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to start their journey.",32.888,31.112,"Very few weeks after the day that brought the first letter from Sir John Middleton to Norland, all the arrangements for their future accommodation were so advanced that Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were able to begin their journey.",31.975,29.882
96,"Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved. ""Dear, dear Norland!"" said Marianne, as she wandered alone before the house, on the last evening of their being there; ""when shall I cease to regret you!—when learn to feel a home elsewhere!—Oh! happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!—And you, ye well–known trees!—but you will continue the same.—No leaf will decay because we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!—No; you will continue the same; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade!—But who will remain to enjoy you?""","Many tears fell during the final parting with the beloved place. As she walked around the house alone on the last evening, Marianne lamented: - Oh dear Norland! I wonder when I will stop longing for you? Is it when I have accepted a new home elsewhere? Oh, happy house, do you know that I am in pain looking at you here, from now on perhaps I will not be able to see you anymore! The trees are still here, but you will continue to live like that. No leaf will rot because I have to leave, no branch will die even though I can no longer see you! No, all of you will be as before; indifferent to the joys and sorrows you have caused, indifferent to any changes in those who walk under your shade! But who is left here to enjoy you?",14.104,13.339,"They shed many tears as they bid their final farewell to a place they loved so much. ""Dear Norland!"" said Marianne, wandering alone in front of the house on the last evening of their life there, ""when will I stop missing you! -to feel another place like my home! -Oh, happy home, can you imagine how it pains me to look at you from here now, knowing I won't be able to look from this point again! -And you, oh dear trees! -but you will continue this life. Not a single leaf will fall because we are gone, not a single branch will stop swaying because we can no longer look at you! -No; you will continue this life; indifferent to the pleasure or pain of what has happened, not caring who walks in your shade! -But who will be left to enjoy you?""",18.985,18.29,"Many were the tears they shed in their final farewells to a place they had loved so much. —Dear, dear Norland! —repeated Marianne as she wandered alone in front of the house the last evening they were there—. When will I stop missing you?; when will I learn to feel any other place as home? Ah, blessed house! How could you know what I suffer seeing you now from this place, from where I may never see you again! And you, trees that are so familiar to me! But you, you will remain the same. No leaf will wither because we leave, no branch will stop swaying even if we can no longer see them. No, you will remain the same, unaware of the pleasure or pain you cause and insensitive to any change in those who walk under your shadows. And, who will be left to enjoy you?",22.044,21.411

It was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture. After winding along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house.

Four bed–rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house. It had not been built many years and was in good repair.

A narrow corridor runs through the house, leading straight to the backyard garden. On each side of the entrance is a very narrow living room, next to which is a study and a staircase.

""As for the house itself, to be sure,"" said she, ""it is too small for our family, but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as it is too late in the year for improvements. Perhaps in the spring, if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think about building. These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this, with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed–chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage.

I shall see how much I am before–hand with the world in the spring, and we will plan our improvements accordingly.""","Mrs. Daswood was pleased with the structure and interior of the house; for although her previous living situation made it very necessary to have many more things in this place, adding and improving was a pleasure in itself for her. At this time, she had enough money to buy everything she wanted to add more elegance to the house. She said: -With this house, it is certainly too small for our entire family, but for now, we should arrange ourselves to be comfortable, because it is too late in the year to worry about renovations. Perhaps we can wait until spring, if mother has more money, as she is quite sure, we can think about expanding. These front rooms are too small to host the family friends as mother wishes. Mother intends to connect one part of the two corridors together, using the other part as an entrance; thus, there will be a cozy house with a tea room added to the bedroom and an attic above.

His kindness was not limited to words, for within an hour of his departure, a large basket of vegetables and fruits arrived from the estate, followed before the end of the day by a gift of game animals. Moreover, he insisted on taking all their letters to the post and bringing those that arrived for them, and he refused to be deprived of the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper daily.",34.83,34.55

In every formal visit, the child had to be the focal point of the gathering, serving as a topic for everyone to comment on and speculate about.

Hospitality was the character of the husband; elegance was the trait of the Lady. They rarely lacked a few friends staying with them in the residence; they entertained a more diverse range of people than any other family in the area. This was necessary for both spouses to be happy; for although they had different temperaments and manners, they were very similar in their lack of talent and appreciation, which limited their interactions, regardless of their social class. Sir John enjoyed sports; Lady Middleton had the role of a mother. He went hunting; she was content with her children, finding joy only in them.

The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate. In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor.","He always took pleasure when a family had just moved into the area; and in every respect, he was attracted to the residents he had newly welcomed into his cottage at Barton. The Dashwood sisters were all young, pretty, and unpretentious. That was enough for him to have a good impression, as a pretty young woman only needs to appear unpretentious to become appealing.

Sir John's friendly disposition made him happy to provide shelter for these people whose circumstances could be considered unfortunate compared to the past. Therefore, he felt genuine satisfaction in showing kindness to his cousins; he also felt all the satisfaction a hunter could feel by placing a family consisting only of ladies in his cottage; because although a hunter only respects his fellow hunters, he is not very keen on encouraging their pleasures by allowing them to reside in his own village.",12.454,11.539,"The arrival of a new family in the region was always a cause for joy for him, and from every point of view, he was delighted with the tenants he had secured for his cottage in Barton.

Thus, his acts of kindness towards his cousins satisfied his good heart; and by establishing a family composed solely of women in the Barton cottage, he obtained all the pleasures of a sportsman; because a sportsman, although he only esteems the representatives of his sex who are also sportsmen, is rarely eager to foster their tastes by lodging them in his own preserve.",28.35,27.864

The pleasure that the Colonel had shown towards the music, although it did not reach that ecstasy which, to the exclusion of any other, she considered compatible with her own delight, was worthy of appreciation in the face of the horrible insensitivity of the rest; and she was sensible enough to concede that a man of thirty-five years could well have left behind in his life all sharpness of feelings and every exquisite faculty of enjoyment.

139,"Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in spite of Sir John's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame the wish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk. There were but few who could be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable. About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a little of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it. But they learnt, on enquiry, that its possessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.","They did not have many visitors except for those from Barton Park; for although Sir John had encouraged them to socialize more in the area, repeatedly stating that his carriage was always at their disposal, Mrs. Dashwood's independent spirit suppressed her children's desire for social interaction, and she resolutely refused to visit any family that was farther than a walking distance. There were only a few families living within such a short distance; not all of them were suitable for socializing. During one walk, the girls found a respectable-looking mansion a mile and a half from their home, along the narrow winding Allenham valley branching off from Barton. The mansion reminded them a little of Norland, stimulating their imagination and making them want to learn more about the place. But after inquiring, they learned that the owner was an elderly lady of good character, but unable to communicate with the outside world due to her frailty, never stepping out of the house.",18.27,17.72,"They had few visitors outside the residents of Barton Park; because despite Sir John's persistent exhortations for them to mingle more with the neighbors and his repeated assurances that his carriage was at their disposal, Mrs. Dashwood's spirit of independence outweighed her need for society for her children; she resolutely refused every family visit beyond walking distance. And there were only a few families that could be so classified, and not all of them were accessible. About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow, winding Allenham valley that branched off from the previously described Barton valley, the girls had discovered an old, dignified-looking mansion on one of their first walks, which, reminding them a bit of Norland, captivated their imaginations and sparked a desire to know it better. But upon inquiry, they had learned that its owner, a very kind-hearted old lady, was unfortunately too ill to engage with the world and never left the house.",21.644,21.142,"Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many.

There were few that met such a requirement, and not all of them were accessible. Approximately a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow and winding Allenham valley, which branched off from Barton as already described, in one of their early walks, the girls had discovered a respectable-looking mansion that, reminding them a bit of Norland, sparked interest in their imaginations and made them wish to know it better.

Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker, and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse. She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been equal to her means of improvement, she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings's last illness, and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died. Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent. Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do. Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired. She had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before. Her insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were always the same; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her, she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home;—and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their conversation, that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.","Elinor was not as happy as her sister. Her heart was not as tranquil, and she did not find satisfaction in the pleasures of others. Among them, there was no one close enough to her to compensate for what she had left behind, and no one to help her think of Norland with less regret. Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings could not make her forget the previous conversations, even though Mrs. Jennings was talkative and Lady Middleton treated her kindly enough to engage her in most of the conversations. She had recounted to her three or four times the history of her life; and if Elinor's memory matched her use of it, from the very beginning of their acquaintance, she would have known every detail of Mr. Jennings's final illness and what he had said to her before he died. Mrs. Middleton was only more agreeable than her mother in that she kept silent more often. Without needing much observation, Elinor also knew that Mrs. Middleton's reserve was merely a calm demeanor, unrelated to any depth of perception. The way Mrs. Middleton treated her husband and mother was the same as how she treated guests, so there was no need to seek or expect any intimacy. Mrs. Middleton often repeated things she had said before. She was always dull, for even her spirit was consistently the same. Although Mrs. Middleton did not oppose her husband organizing gatherings as long as they were proper and their two eldest children attended, it seemed she never enjoyed them more than staying at home. Her presence did not add much to the enjoyment of others, to the extent that only when she showed interest in her troublesome sons did people remember she was there.",17.833,17.476,"Elinor's happiness was not so great. She was not at ease; she did not derive pure joy from their entertainments. They could not provide her with a friend who could replace what she had left behind or teach her to think of Norland with less sorrow than before. Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could offer her the conversations she longed for; although Mrs. Jennings was an incessant talker and had shown her the courtesy of making her the recipient of a large part of her conversation from the very beginning. She had repeated her own life story to Elinor three or four times; if Elinor's memory were as strong as her ability to think, she could have learned all the details of Mr. Jennings' last illness and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died at the very beginning of their acquaintance. Lady Middleton was more reasonable than her mother, simply because she was quieter. Elinor needed very little observation to realize that her measured demeanor was a calmness of behavior without any share of intellect. She was the same towards her husband and mother as she was towards them; thus, intimacy was neither to be sought nor expected. Let her say something one day that she didn't say the day before! Her dullness was constant, for even her mood was always the same; she did not object to the parties arranged by her husband, ensured that everything was conducted properly, and although her two eldest children accompanied her, she did not seem to derive more pleasure from them than from staying at home; -her own presence did not contribute much to the enjoyment of others, as she did not participate in their conversations, so much so that sometimes her presence among them was only remembered when she started complaining about her mischievous sons.",29.481,29.223,"Elinor's happiness did not reach such heights. Her heart was not so much at peace, nor was her satisfaction as complete with the amusements they participated in. They had not provided her with any company capable of compensating for what she had left behind, or of making her remember Norland with less longing. Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could offer her the type of conversation she needed, although the latter was an indefatigable talker and the cordiality with which she had welcomed her from the beginning ensured that a large part of her comments were directed at her. She had already repeated her own story to Elinor three or four times; and if Elinor's memory had been up to the means Mrs. Jennings employed to enhance it, she could have known from the very first moments of their acquaintance all the details of Mr. Jennings' last illness and what he said to his wife minutes before he died. Lady Middleton was more pleasant than her mother only in that she was quieter. Elinor needed very little observation to realize that her reserve was merely a placidity in all her manners that had nothing to do with good judgment. With her husband and her mother, she was the same as with her and her sister; consequently, intimacy was neither desired nor sought. She never had anything to say that she hadn't already said the day before. Her insipidity was unalterable, for even her mood always remained the same; and although she did not oppose the gatherings her husband organized, provided that everything was conducted with distinction and her two eldest children accompanied her, those occasions did not seem to offer her more pleasure than she would experience staying at home; and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of others through any participation in the conversations, that sometimes the only thing that reminded them she was among them were the efforts she made around her bothersome children.",33.022,32.804

Then they brought the carriages; Willoughby's was the first, and Marianne had never seemed happier than when she got into it. Willoughby drove at great speed through the estate, and very soon they were out of sight; and nothing more was seen of them until their return, which did not occur until after everyone else had arrived.

524,"Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother's account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son. Disappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications, which had been rather more painfully extorted from her, for Willoughby's service, by her mother. His want of spirits, of openness, and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want of independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition and designs.

Fortunately for her, she understood his mother very well, who was the reason for all the peculiarities in her son. Despite being disappointed and frustrated, sometimes annoyed by his ambiguous attitude, she still wanted to think well of his actions.

His weak spirit, lack of openness and consistency, were largely due to his inability to be independent, and he knew better than anyone about Mrs. Ferrars' attitudes and intentions. The short visit, insisting on leaving, all stemmed from the same tendency to submit to necessary constraints to appease his mother. The long-standing complaint about duty conflicting with desire, parents conflicting with children, was the cause of it all. She would be glad to know when these difficulties would end, the opposition would yield, - when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed and her son would be free to seek his own happiness. But from such hopeless desires, she was compelled to seek solace in the restoration of her faith in Edward's affection, in the recollection of every glance or word of his during his stay here, and above all, in the evidence of that honor which he often wore on his finger.",14.771,14.352,"Elinor attributed such surprising behaviors to his mother; having a mother whose character she knew very little about was convenient for Elinor, because his mother became the general excuse for every peculiarity of her son.

The brevity of his visit and the definitiveness of his intention to leave them again stemmed from that same compelling inclination, that same necessity to comply with his mother's wishes.

Elinor dearly wished to know when these difficulties would end, when this opposition would cease, when Mrs. Ferrars would change, and when her son would have the freedom to be happy.

It has been, and is, and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing like independence. But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of my friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being. We never could agree in our choice of a profession. I always preferred the church, as I still do. But that was not smart enough for my family. They recommended the army. That was a great deal too smart for me. The law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs. But I had no inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family approved. As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it—and, at length, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing. I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since.""","He answered: - Please believe that I have long thought about this matter. From before, now, and perhaps forever after, I have been severely unhappy without a job, without a profession to keep me busy, or to create something for me like an independent position. But unfortunately, my delicacy, and the delicacy of my relatives, have made me the person I am now: idle, useless. We never agreed with each other when choosing a profession for me. I always liked working for the church, and I still do. But my family thought that was not prestigious enough. They advised me to join the military. But that was too high for me. The legal profession creates moderately affluent people: many young men have succeeded, with very impressive styles in the upper class, driving around the city in two-wheeled carriages looking very dashing. But I was not enthusiastic about the law profession even in this not very difficult field, though my family accepted it. As for the navy, that branch creates style, but when I thought about it, I was already too old. And, finally, I was not compelled to have any profession at all. Without needing to wear a red coat, I could still be dashing and affluent like an idle person, and an eighteen-year-old young man not eager to be busy. Therefore, I attended Oxford University and have been idle since then.",14.275,13.846,"""Rest assured,"" replied Edward, ""like you, I have also thought long and hard about this matter. The fact that I do not have a job to occupy me, a profession to guide me or make me independent, has been a heavy misfortune for me, it still is, and it probably always will be. But unfortunately, my fondness for comfort and my family's fondness for comfort made me this way, that is, an idle, helpless person. We never reached a consensus in our choice of profession. I always wanted the church, and I still do. But this did not seem bright enough to my family. They recommended the army. That was too bright for me. Law was considered a sufficiently respectable profession; many young men with offices in the Judiciary made very good progress in high circles, delivering quite wise speeches as they roamed the city. But I had no inclination towards law, not even towards this less complicated education that my family approved of. As for the navy, it was quite fashionable, but by the time the subject came up, I was quite old - in the end, since I was not obliged to take up a job, and because I could live stylishly and expensively without a red uniform on my back, idleness ultimately seemed the most comfortable and respectable path; after all, an eighteen-year-old boy is not eager enough to take up a job to resist the advice of his friends who do nothing. I entered Oxford again; and since then, I have been idling away nicely.""",20.783,20.432,"—I assure you —he replied— that I have thought a lot about this point in the same way you are doing now. It has been, is, and probably always will be a great misfortune for me not to have had any occupation to which I was obliged to dedicate myself, no profession that gives me employment or offers me something in the line of independence. But, unfortunately, my own ability to behave in a genteel manner, and the gentility of my friends, have made me what I am: an idle, incompetent being. We could never agree on the choice of a profession. I always preferred the church, as I still do. But that was not elegant enough for my family. They recommended a military career. That was too, too elegant for me. As for the practice of law, they graciously considered it a fairly respectable profession; many young men with offices in some London Inns of Court have achieved a very good entry into the most important circles, and stroll around the city driving very fashionable carriages. But I had no inclination for the law, not even in this much less abstruse form of it that my family approved of. As for the navy, it had the advantage of being in good taste, but I was already too old to join it when the subject was first discussed; and, in the end, since there was no real need for me to have a profession, given that I could be just as dashing and extravagant with a red coat on my shoulders or without it, it was decided that idleness was the most advantageous and honorable; and at eighteen young men are generally not so eager to have an occupation as to resist the invitations of their friends to do nothing. I therefore entered Oxford, and since then I have been idle, just as one should be.",31.256,31.026

With her children they were in continual raptures, extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing, or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight. Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or distrust. She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted. She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their work–bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment. It suggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by, without claiming a share in what was passing.","Through the visit to Barton Park as promised and subsequently being introduced to two young women, the Dashwood sisters found in the elder, nearly thirty, a plain and insensitive appearance, nothing worth admiring. But in the other, no more than twenty-two or twenty-three, they recognized considerable beauty; her features were very pretty, and she had bright eyes, an elegant demeanor, though not showing refinement or grace, she still formed a unique type. Their manners were particularly polite, and soon Elinor found herself praising their perception, as she saw them endearing themselves to Lady Middleton through their constant and clever attentions. Towards Lady Middleton's children, they were always enthusiastic, praising the charms of childhood, engaging the children, and playfully teasing their whims. The remaining time was for the pressing demands of courtesy, which the two ladies spent praising the Lady whenever she did anything, or asking for dress patterns of the elegant outfits the Lady had worn before, which they endlessly admired. Fortunate for those who wish to win favor through these weaknesses, a mother who loves her children is often the most gullible, even if she is among the most eager in seeking praise for her children. Her demands were excessive, but she would accept anything; thus, Lady Middleton was neither surprised nor suspicious of the Steele sisters' excessive affection and endurance towards her children. Through maternal indulgence, she overlooked the blatant intrusions and mischief that the two sisters had to endure. She saw their belts being untied, their hair being pulled around their ears, their pockets being rummaged through, their knives and forks being secretly taken, yet believed these were amusements for all parties involved. She found nothing surprising except for Elinor and Marianne sitting solemnly, unwilling to participate in what was happening.",13.292,12.929,"When the promised visit to the Park and the subsequent introductions to those young ladies took place, they found almost nothing to admire in the appearance of the elder, who was nearly thirty, very ordinary, and vacant-faced; but they acknowledged that the other, who was at most twenty-two or twenty-three, possessed considerable beauty; her features were very pleasing, she had a sharp, quick eye and a bright demeanor, which, even if it did not bestow true elegance or nobility, certainly added a touch of distinction. Their manners were quite refined; Elinor soon conceded that they possessed a certain intelligence when she observed the steady and skillful attention with which they ingratiated themselves with Lady Middleton. They were constantly cheerful with the children, praising their beauty, attracting their attention, and yielding to all their whims; the time they could spare from these persistent demands of politeness was spent either admiring whatever Lady Middleton happened to be doing or replicating the pattern of an elegant new dress she had worn the previous day, which had given them immense delight. Fortunately for those who display their flattery through such weaknesses, a doting mother, eager for her children to be admired, is also the most gullible of people; her demands are excessive, but she swallows everything; and thus the exceptional affection and patience Miss Steeles showed towards her children were met by Lady Middleton without the slightest surprise or suspicion. She watched with maternal tranquility all the insolent intrusions and deceitful tricks to which her cousins submitted. She saw their sashes being pulled, their hair being scattered over their ears, their workbags being ransacked, and their knives and scissors being stolen, and she never doubted that it was all a shared amusement. The truly surprising thing was that Elinor and Marianne sat quietly on the sidelines, wanting no part in what was happening.",24.192,23.944,"When they fulfilled the promised visit to the estate and were introduced to the young ladies, they found nothing to admire in the appearance of the elder, who was nearly thirty and had an unattractive and dull face; but in the other, who was no more than twenty-two or twenty-three years old, they found ample beauty; her features were pretty, she had a sharp and keen look, and a certain gracefulness in her appearance that, although it did not give her true elegance, did make her stand out. The manners of both were especially courteous, and soon Elinor had to acknowledge some good judgment in them, seeing the constant and timely attentions with which they endeared themselves to Lady Middleton. With the children, they showed continuous rapture, praising their beauty, attracting their attention, and indulging their every whim; and the little time they could spare from the untimely demands to which their gentleness exposed them, they dedicated to admiring whatever her ladyship was doing, if she was doing anything, or to copying the model of some new elegant dress that, having seen her wear the day before, had sent them into endless ecstasy. Fortunately for those who seek to flatter by touching on such weak points, a loving mother, although the most voracious of human beings when it comes to hunting for praises for her children, is also the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant, but she swallows anything; and thus, Lady Middleton accepted without the slightest surprise or distrust the exaggerated displays of affection and the patience of the Misses Steele towards her children. She viewed with maternal complacency all the mischief and impertinent pranks to which her cousins subjected themselves. She observed how they untied their belts, pulled their hair that hung loose around their ears, rummaged through their sewing kits and took out their penknives and scissors, and had no doubt that the pleasure was mutual. It seemed to indicate that the only thing that surprised her was that Elinor and Marianne were sitting there, so composed, without asking to be allowed to join in what was happening.",22.93,22.671
637,"""John is in such spirits today!"" said she, on his taking Miss Steeles's pocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window—""He is full of monkey tricks.""","When the boy snatched Ms. Steele's handkerchief and threw it out the window, she said: - John is really hyperactive today! He's doing all sorts of monkey business.",8.444,4.863,"""John is very cheerful today!"" she said, when the boy took Miss Steele's handkerchief and threw it out the window, ""He sure knows a lot of games.""",13.67,10.274,"—John is so excited today! —she said, seeing how he took Miss Steele's handkerchief and threw it out the window—. He doesn't stop causing mischief.",7.196,3.973
638,"And soon afterwards, on the second boy's violently pinching one of the same lady's fingers, she fondly observed, ""How playful William is!""","Not long after, when the second child pinched her finger hard, she affectionately remarked: - Williams seems unusually happy!",7.454,4.147,"Immediately after, when the second boy pinched the same lady's finger, she lovingly said, ""William is so playful!""",14.339,10.139,"And shortly after, when her second child violently pinched the same young lady on the finger, she commented lovingly: —How playful William is!",18.086,13.618

This little girl is always calm and quiet - never has there been anyone as quiet as her.",8.909,6.238,"""Ah, here is my one and only Annamaria,"" he added, tenderly stroking his three-year-old daughter who had been silent for the last two minutes; ""She is always so delicate and well-behaved -Such a well-behaved little one has never been seen in life!""",26.653,24.907,"And here is my sweet Annamaria —he added, tenderly caressing a little girl of three who had remained silent for the last two minutes—. She is always so gentle and calm; there has never been a little girl so calm!",37.433,36.358
640,"But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship's head dress slightly scratching the child's neck, produced from this pattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly noisy. The mother's consternation was excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and every thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer. She was seated in her mother's lap, covered with kisses, her wound bathed with lavender–water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was on her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other. With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise to cease crying. She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.— She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother's arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boys chose to follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind, the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours.","Unfortunately, while bestowing these kisses, a pin in Lady Middleton's hair lightly scratched the child's neck; from this gentle mishap arose loud screams, no less noisy than any other creature claiming to be loud. The mother was extremely worried, but could not surpass the frantic attitude of the Steele sisters; and in such a tense emergency, all three did everything they could to soothe the young victim's pain. The mother held the little girl on her lap, covering her with kisses; one of the Steele sisters knelt on the floor, washing the wound with lavender water; the other stuffed some sugar candies into the girl's mouth. Through such tearful rewards, the little girl was smart enough to understand that she should continue crying. She kept screaming and sobbing eagerly, kicking her two brothers who wanted to touch their sister. All collaborative efforts to soothe her were ineffective until Lady Middleton luckily remembered that in a similar dire situation the previous week, peach jam had been effective when applied to a bruised temple. Thus, the peach jam remedy was eagerly suggested for this unfortunate scratch, and the girl's intermittent screams upon hearing it indicated that she did not seem to oppose the idea. So the girl was carried out of the room in her mother's arms to search for the remedy, and since her two brothers still wanted to follow despite their mother's pleas for them to stay, the four young ladies enjoyed a peaceful atmosphere they hadn't had for many hours.",15.061,14.614,"But alas, while bestowing these embraces, a pin in the lady's hair ornament lightly scratched the child's neck, causing such intense screams from that epitome of delicacy that even someone notorious for being noisy would pale in comparison. The mother's horror was great, but what was it compared to the panic of the Miss Steeles; in such a critical emergency, the three of them did everything together; they tried every possibility that could alleviate the little one's suffering. He was seated on his mother's lap, showered with kisses, his wound washed with lavender water by a kneeling Miss Steele attending to him, and his mouth filled with plum sugar by the other Miss Steele. Receiving such a reward in exchange for his tears, the child was smart enough not to stop crying. He continued to cry loudly, kicked his two brothers who attempted to touch him; despite all efforts to soothe him, it was in vain, until Lady Middleton suddenly remembered that a bit of apricot marmalade had been successfully applied to a bruised temple in a similar distressing situation last week, and the same remedy was fervently recommended for this unfortunate scratch; hearing this, the young lady's screams paused slightly, giving them hope that it would not be rejected. Thereupon, he was carried out of the room in his mother's arms in pursuit of that remedy; although their mother begged them to stay in the room, the two boys followed behind, and the four young ladies were left in a silence the room had not seen for hours.",22.86,22.525,"But unfortunately, when she was filled with hugs, a pin from her ladyship's headdress slightly scratched the girl on the neck, causing in this model of gentleness such violent screams that they could hardly have been surpassed by any creature known for being noisy. The consternation of her mother was enormous, but it could not surpass the alarm of the Misses Steele, and among the three of them, they did everything that affection indicated should be done in such a critical emergency to mitigate the agonies of the little sufferer. They sat her on her mother's lap, covered her with kisses; one of the Misses Steele, kneeling to attend to her, dabbed her wound with lavender water, and the other filled her mouth with candied plums. With such rewards for her tears, the girl had the wisdom not to stop crying. She continued to scream and sob vigorously, kicked her two brothers when they tried to touch her, and nothing they did to calm her had the slightest effect, until fortunately Lady Middleton remembered that in a similar scene of distress the previous week, they had applied a bit of apricot jam to a bruised temple; she insistently proposed the same remedy for this unfortunate scratch, and the slight pause in the young girl's screams upon hearing it gave them reason to hope it would not be rejected.

Sir John could do no more; but he did not know that any more was required: to be together was, in his opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being established friends.","The two Steele sisters were not like that.

And consequently, Elinor soon discovered that getting to know them better was her inevitable fate; as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Misses Steele, his side was going to be too strong to present any opposition, and they were going to have to submit to that kind of intimacy which consists of sitting all together in the same room for one or two hours almost daily.

729,"However small Elinor's general dependence on Lucy's veracity might be, it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description. What Lucy had asserted to be true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt; supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs, and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes. Their opportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit near Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own prospects, his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which had often surprised her, the picture, the letter, the ring, formed altogether such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partiality could set aside, his ill–treatment of herself.—Her resentment of such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe, for a short time made her feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations, soon arose. Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her? Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel? Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart? No; whatever it might once have been, she could not believe it such at present. His affection was all her own. She could not be deceived in that. Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not an illusion of her own vanity. He certainly loved her. What a softener of the heart was this persuasion! How much could it not tempt her to forgive! He had been blamable, highly blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be. In that, he could not be defended; but if he had injured her, how much more had he injured himself; if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless. His imprudence had made her miserable for a while; but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise. She might in time regain tranquillity; but HE, what had he to look forward to? Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he, were his affection for herself out of the question, with his integrity, his delicacy, and well–informed mind, be satisfied with a wife like her—illiterate, artful, and selfish?","Although Elinor did not quite believe Lucy's words, after serious contemplation, she found it impossible to doubt, as she could not explain the madness if it were fabricated. Therefore, Elinor could not doubt and no longer dared to doubt what Lucy recounted; especially since there was evidence for each situation that no one could deny except her own desire to deny it. The opportunity for the two to meet at Mr. Pratt's house was the origin of subsequent events, which could not be denied and was a worrying situation. Then there was Edward's visit near Plymouth, his melancholic state, dissatisfaction with his own future, his indecisive attitude towards her, and the Steele sisters' intimate knowledge of Norland and their family connections, which often surprised her. Then there was the miniature portrait, the letter, the ring, all evidence that helped overcome any hesitation to unjustly condemn him, and confirmed a fact - which fairness could not dismiss - showing that he had treated her poorly. T In a short time, she only felt for herself: resentment for such behavior, indignation for being deceived. Soon, other thoughts and considerations arose. Did Edward intentionally deceive her? Did he fake feelings for her that he did not feel? Did he promise himself to Lucy from the heart? No; at present, she could not believe it, regardless of what had happened in the past. His feelings were all for her. She could not be deceived about this. Her mother, her two sisters, Fanny, all had recognized his affection for her while at Norland; this was not an illusion born of vanity. Surely he loves her. How serene it is in the soul to cherish such a belief! And it makes it easier for her to forgive him! He is to blame, very much to blame, for staying at Norland after the first time he felt her influence on him was stronger than usual. In fact, you cannot be excused; but if you hurt her, how much more hurt will you be? If her situation is pitiful, yours is desperate! Your lack of caution caused her suffering for a time, but it seems to have deprived you of every opportunity for a different life. She will eventually find peace again; but as for you, what do you hope for? Can you be happy, even relatively, with Lucy Steele? Even if you do not love her, with your sense of integrity, delicate manners, and understanding mind, can you be satisfied with a wife like her - ignorant, cunning, and selfish?",19.222,18.998,"Although she did not have much faith in Lucy's honesty, when she thought it through thoroughly, it seemed impossible to doubt her honesty in this matter; no motive could justify the effort to find a lie in such a story. Therefore, Elinor did not attempt to doubt what Lucy claimed to be true: it was supported by possibilities and evidence from all sides and contradicted nothing except Elinor's wishes. The opportunity to meet at Mr. Pratt's house formed an undeniable and alarming basis for the rest; Edward's trip around Plymouth, his melancholic mood, his insecurity about his own abilities, his indecisive behavior towards Elinor, the Miss Steeles' surprisingly detailed knowledge about Norland and their relatives, the picture, the letter, the ring all together formed such a body of evidence that it erased the fear of unjustly condemning Edward and confirmed the fact that he had deceived Elinor, a truth that no effort to protect could conceal. Elinor's resentment in the face of this behavior, the anger she felt at being deceived, led her to think only of herself for a short time; but soon other thoughts, other concerns emerged. Was Edward deceiving her knowingly? Was he pretending to love her while he did not? Was the promise he made to Lucy a heartfelt one? Was it? No; whatever might have happened in the past, Elinor could not now believe that such a word could exist. His love belonged to Elinor. She could not be mistaken about this. Her mother, her sisters, Fanny, they had all felt his closeness to Elinor at Norland; this was not an illusion created by her own vanity. It was clear that he loved her. How much peace this belief brought to her heart! Could it be possible that this did not make her forgive him! Edward was guilty, quite guilty for staying at Norland even after he first felt that Elinor had too much influence over him. In this respect, he was indefensible; but if Edward had hurt her, he must have hurt himself much more; if Elinor's situation was pitiable, his was utterly hopeless. His lack of judgment had made Elinor unhappy for a while; but it seemed to have deprived him of all other possibilities. Elinor might regain her composure over time; but what could he expect? Could he be more or less happy with Lucy Steele; even if his love for Elinor were not in question, could he, as a moral, sensitive, and educated person, be content with such a woman - an illiterate, deceitful, and selfish woman?",17.905,17.662,"No matter how little confidence Elinor had in Lucy's veracity, it was impossible for her, when thinking seriously, to suspect her under the current circumstances, where hardly anything could induce her to invent lies like the previous ones. In the face of what Lucy claimed to be true, therefore, Elinor could not, would not dare to continue doubting, as it was so absolutely backed by so many probabilities and proofs, and impugned only by her own desires. Having had the opportunity to meet at Mr. Pratt's house was the basis for everything else, a basis both indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit to somewhere near Plymouth, his melancholy, his dissatisfaction with the prospects before him, the intimate knowledge the Misses Steele showed of Norland and its family relations, which had often surprised her; the portrait, the letter, the ring, all together constituted such a solid body of evidence that it nullified any fear of condemning Edward unjustly and confirmed as a fact that no partiality for him could overlook his disregard for her. Her resentment at such conduct, her indignation at having been a victim of it, for a brief moment made her focus only on her own feelings; but soon other thoughts, other considerations broke through. Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her? Had he feigned an affection for her that he did not feel? Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart? No; no matter what it might once have been, she could not believe such a thing now. Edward's affection belonged to her. She could not deceive herself in that. Her mother, her sisters, Fanny, all had noticed the interest he had shown in her at Norland; it was not an illusion of her own vanity. Surely, he loved her. How this conviction soothed her heart! How many more things it tempted her to forgive! He had been guilty, enormously guilty of staying at Norland after he first felt that her influence over him was greater than it should be. In that, he could not be defended; but if he had hurt her, how much more had he hurt himself! If her case was worthy of compassion, his was hopeless. If for a time his imprudence had made her unhappy, it seemed to have deprived him of any possibility of being otherwise. In the long run, she might regain her tranquility; but he, what could he place his hopes in? Could he ever achieve a passable happiness with Lucy Steele? If affection for her was impossible, could he, with his integrity, his delicacy, and cultivated intelligence, feel satisfied with such a wife: uneducated, cunning, and selfish?",39.036,38.905

731,"If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his difficulties from his mother had seemed great, how much greater were they now likely to be, when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself. These difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated from Lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience; but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness, could be felt as a relief!","If the promotion of marriage with her seems difficult from the mother's side, how much greater will the difficulty be when compared to her, his object of affection is certainly inferior in family background, perhaps also inferior in wealth! In fact, with a heart that has distanced itself from Lucy, the difficulties may not exert pressure but rather foster patience; yet he remains melancholic, hoping for family opposition and cruelty so that he may feel relieved!",11.234,9.698,"If the difficulties that Edward's mother would raise in the event of his wanting to marry Elinor seemed great, now that his fiancée was undoubtedly from a family of lower status than Elinor's and presumably with a smaller dowry, these difficulties would obviously be much greater. These difficulties might not strain Edward's patience too much, given his heart had grown so cold towards Lucy; but the expectation of family opposition and lack of understanding could have a refreshing effect on his sorrowful state of mind!",13.379,11.918,"If when it was supposed that it was Elinor he wanted to marry, the obstacles put forth by his mother had seemed great, how much greater must they be now, when the person he was engaged to was undoubtedly inferior to her in connections and, in all probability, inferior in fortune! Indeed, with Edward's heart so detached from Lucy, perhaps the demands on his patience were not too great; but melancholy can only be the natural state of a person who feels relieved at the expectations of opposition and harshness from the family!",20.099,18.952
732,"As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she wept for him, more than for herself. Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she thought she could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow, command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters. And so well was she able to answer her own expectations, that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house.","These thoughts sequentially passed through her mind in anguish. She cried for him more than for herself. After the initial shock, she believed she had done nothing to deserve such suffering, consoling herself that Edward had done nothing to lose her esteem, so she thought she should restrain herself so that her mother and two sisters would not suspect anything. She could meet her own expectations so satisfactorily that when she sat down with them at the table just two hours after she had been in torment because all hope had vanished, no one could tell from the outward appearance of the two sisters that Elinor was silently mourning the eternal obstacles separating her from the man she loved; and that Marianne was dreaming of the perfections of a young man whose heart she believed she had wholly won, and whom she expected to see in every carriage that passed by their house.",22.633,22.127,"While these thoughts passed through his mind in a painful continuity, he cried more for her than for himself. Strengthened by the belief that he had done nothing to deserve his current unhappiness, and consoled by the belief that Edvvard had done nothing to forgo her love, he now felt that he could control himself enough to hide every doubt about the truth from his mother and sisters, even under the initial pain of the heavy blow. He managed to meet his own expectations so well that when he joined them for dinner just two hours after enduring the complete extinguishment of his most private hopes, no one could have guessed from the sight of the sisters that Elinor was secretly mourning the barriers that forever separated her from her love, and that Marianne, who felt she possessed his whole heart, was inwardly dreaming about the superior qualities of a man she expected to see in every carriage passing near their home.",22.093,21.545,"As these thoughts painfully succeeded one another in her mind, she wept for him more than for herself. Relying on the conviction that she had done nothing to deserve her current misery, and comforted by the belief that Edward had done nothing to alienate her affection, Elinor thought that even now, in the midst of the sharp pain following the harsh blow she had received, she could control herself enough to hide from her mother and sisters any suspicion of the truth. And she fulfilled her own expectations so well that when she joined them at dinner just two hours after witnessing the death of her dearest hopes, no one could have suspected, from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was living with a secret grief against the barriers that would forever separate her from the object of her love, and that Marianne was delighting inwardly in the perfections of a man whose heart she felt entirely captive, and whom she hoped to see in every carriage that approached their house.",39.729,39.369
733,"The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne, what had been entrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her to unceasing exertion, was no aggravation of Elinor's distress. On the contrary it was a relief to her, to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself, and which was more than she felt equal to support.","Even though she had to conceal from her mother and Marianne the secret she had been trusted to hear, Elinor did not suffer further. On the contrary, she felt relieved because she did not have to break the news that would sadden them, nor did she have to listen to the condemnation of Edward that would pour out from their exaggerated affection for her, making it difficult for her to defend him.",12.193,10.849,"Although the necessity of keeping something entrusted to her own confidentiality from her mother and Marianne caused her to exert continuous effort, it did not increase Elinor's sorrow. On the contrary, it relieved her, as it prevented her from giving them information that would upset them; moreover, from their excessive partiality towards her, they would probably have scolded Edward a lot, which she did not have to hear, and she did not think she could have endured it anyway.",12.407,11.026,"The need to hide from her mother and Marianne what had been entrusted to her as a secret, although it required her to make an incessant effort, did not aggravate Elinor's pain. On the contrary, it was a relief for her to spare herself from having to communicate something that would have distressed them so much, and at the same time free herself from listening to how their excessive and affectionate partiality for her would probably have unleashed in condemnations of Edward, something that was more than she felt capable of bearing.",20.138,19.063
734,"From their counsel, or their conversation, she knew she could receive no assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress, while her self–command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise. She was stronger alone, and her own good sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken, her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so poignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.","She knew that the two people could not support her through advice or conversation. Their love and sorrow would only make her more miserable, while they would neither encourage nor praise her self-restraint. Through the bitter and still fresh regrets, she grew stronger alone; and her sound judgment positively supported her, so much so that her firmness was steadfast, and her outward cheerfulness was maintained.",9.884,7.798,"He knew that he could not get any help from their advice or conversations; their affection and sorrow would only increase his distress; moreover, his calmness would not be encouraged by either their example or their praise. He was stronger on his own; his own common sense kept him so well that the more intense and fresh his pains were, the more unshakable his determination and the more unchanging his cheerful appearance.",5.567,3.86,"Elinor knew that she could not receive any help from the advice or conversation of her family; the tenderness and sorrow they would show would only increase the pain she felt, while her self-control would receive no encouragement from either their example or their praise. Solitude made her stronger and her own good judgment offered her such good support that her firmness remained unshaken and her appearance of cheerfulness as constant as it could be amidst such sharp and recent sufferings.",16.166,14.606
735,"Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the subject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for more reasons than one. She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least doubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise, not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so confessedly and evidently important. And even Sir John's joking intelligence must have had some weight. But indeed, while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very confidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in future? She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival's intentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was unwounded. And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust her own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure.","Although she was distressed by the first conversation with Lucy, she soon eagerly wanted to exchange more, for many reasons. She wanted to hear again the details of the engagement between the two, she wanted to understand more clearly Lucy's true feelings for Edward, and whether she was sincere when expressing her feelings for him. Especially, through further conversation and keeping calm while talking, she wanted to convince Lucy that she was not interested in anything other than in the capacity of a friend. She feared that when she was emotional in the morning, her friend at least had doubts. It was very likely that Lucy was easily jealous of her: it was clear that Edward always praised her, and this was not only confirmed by Lucy, but also because shortly after getting to know each other, she had trusted her enough to reveal an important secret. And even the news spread through Sir John's jesting carried some weight. Indeed, while Elinor remained firmly convinced in her heart that Edward truly loved her, it was natural for Lucy to be jealous; and if that was the case, her confidence was evidence. What other reason could justify her revelation, except to inform Elinor that Lucy had completely captured Edward's affections, and that she should avoid him in the future? Therefore, it was not difficult for her to understand the intentions of her rival. While she was determined to act according to the principles of honor and fidelity, resisting her personal feelings for Edward and meeting him as little as possible; she still wanted to persuade Lucy that her heart was not hurt. And since now there was nothing more painful to hear about the matter than what had already been heard, she did not doubt her ability to remain calm while recounting the details.",16.611,16.289,"Although she had suffered greatly during her first conversation with Lucy on the subject, she soon felt a strong desire to repeat the conversation, and for more than one reason. She wanted to hear again many details of their engagement, to better understand what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there was any sincerity in her declaration of love for him, and particularly to convince Lucy, through her willingness to re-enter the subject and her ease in discussing it, that she was only interested in the matter as a friend, because she feared greatly that her involuntary agitation during the morning conversation had appeared at least suspicious. It seemed very likely that Lucy was inclined to be jealous of her; it was clear that Edward had spoken highly of her, not only from what Lucy had said, but also because he had dared to trust her with a secret that seemed quite important given their short acquaintance. Even Sir John's playful remarks must have had an effect. But as long as Elinor was confident within herself that Edward truly loved her, she did not need to consider any other possibility that would naturally make Lucy jealous; the proof of this was that he had revealed his secret to her. What other reason could there be for the disclosure of the matter, other than to inform Elinor that Lucy had a greater claim on Edward and to ask her to keep her distance from him in the future? She had no difficulty in understanding so much of her rival's intentions; although she had decided to act towards her as honor and principles of honesty dictated, to struggle with her feelings for Edward, and to see him as little as possible, she did not consider it too much to attempt to convince Lucy that her heart was unscathed. And now, since she could not hear anything more painful than what had already been said on the subject, she did not doubt her ability to maintain her composure while going over the details again.",27.008,26.772,"Despite how much she had suffered in her first conversation with Lucy on the subject, she soon felt a strong desire to resume it, and this for more than one reason. She wanted to hear again many details of her engagement; she wanted to understand more clearly what Lucy really felt for Edward, if she was truly sincere in her declarations of tender affection for him; and especially she wanted to convince Lucy, by her readiness to delve into the matter again and her calmness in discussing it, that she was interested only as a friend, something she feared she had at least left in doubt with her involuntary agitation during their morning conversation. That Lucy was inclined to feel jealous of her seemed quite probable; it was evident that Edward had always praised her a lot, and evident not only by what Lucy said, but by her daring to confide in her, after so little time of knowing each other in person, such a well-known and obviously important secret. And even the jocular comments of Sir John might have weighed in on it. But, indeed, as long as Elinor continued to feel so secure within herself that Edward truly loved her, no further calculations of probabilities were needed to consider it natural that Lucy felt jealous; and of her jealousy, her very confidence was sufficient proof. What other reason could there be to reveal her story, but that Elinor should know of the greater rights that Lucy had over Edward and learn to avoid him in the future? It did not take much for her to understand up to this point the intentions of her rival, and while she was firmly determined to act as all principles of honor and honesty required to fight against her own affection for Edward and see him as little as possible, she could not deny herself the comfort of trying to convince Lucy that her heart was unscathed. And as nothing could add more pain on the subject than what had already been heard, she did not doubt her own ability to calmly endure a repetition of the details.",31.189,30.97
736,"But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be commanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fine enough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most easily separate themselves from the others; and though they met at least every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly at the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation. Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady Middleton's head; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for a general chat, and none at all for particular discourse. They met for the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards, or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.","But at the moment she couldn't create such an opportunity, even though Lucy was as ready as she was to take advantage of it, because the weather didn't allow them to walk together in places where they could easily avoid others. Although the two met every other day, usually at the cottage but sometimes at Barton Park, they couldn't have private conversations. Sir John or Lady Middleton didn't notice such intentions, so they didn't create opportunities for them to talk, especially to talk in private. The two ladies only met to eat and laugh together, play cards, or participate in some noisy game.",8.631,7.725,"But this opportunity was not immediately created, even though Lucy was as eager for it as he was; the weather was generally not good enough to allow them to separate from others and go for a walk together; even though they gathered at least every other evening either in the Park or in the club, mostly in the Park, it was not expected for them to come together for the sake of conversation. Such a thought would not occur to either Sir John or Lady Middleton; therefore, very little time was allocated to general conversation, and no time at all to private conversation. They gathered for the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing cards or storytelling or some other sufficiently noisy game.",28.33,27.839,"But the opportunity to carry out the plan took a while to arrive, although Lucy was as well-disposed as she was to take advantage of any occasion that presented itself, for a rather variable climate prevented them from going out for walks, an activity that would have easily allowed them to separate from the others; and although they met at least every other day at the estate or the cabin, especially at the former, it was not supposed that the purpose of meeting was to converse. Such an idea would never cross the minds of either Sir John or Lady Middleton, and thus they left very little time for a conversation in which everyone participated, and none at all for personal dialogues. They gathered to eat, drink, and laugh together, to play cards or guessing games or any other entertainment that produced enough uproar.",21.092,20.447
737,"One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at the cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone, except her mother and the two Miss Steeles. Elinor, who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this was likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well–bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her mother's permission, was equally compliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their parties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.","After one or two such meetings were organized without giving Elinor any privacy with Lucy, Sir John visited the cottage one morning to compassionately invite the ladies to dine with Lady Middleton because he was busy attending the club in Exeter and she would be quite lonely with only her mother and the two Steele sisters. Elinor anticipated an opportunity for her existing purpose, feeling more at ease with the less talkative and more genteel Lady Middleton than her husband who enjoyed gathering them in noisy company, so she immediately accepted the invitation. Margaret also accepted, with her mother's approval. As for Marianne, though she was not keen on joining, she was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to see her seclude herself from all social activities, so she went as well.",19.405,18.912,"There had been one or two such meetings, but they did not give Elinor the opportunity to pull Lucy aside; Sir John called at the cottage one morning and, as he had to go to the cottage in Exeter, he requested, in the name of humanity, that they dine together with Lady Middleton that evening, otherwise he would be completely alone, except for his mother and the two Miss Steeles. Seeing an opportunity to implement her plan in an environment where they could be more at ease under Lady Middleton's calm and courteous management, as opposed to when her husband brought them together for noisy purposes, Elinor immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret promptly followed suit with her mother's permission, and Marianne, who was always reluctant to join their parties, was persuaded to go by her mother, who could not bear to see her deprive herself of every chance of enjoyment.",28.577,28.147,"One or two of such meetings had already passed without giving Elinor any opportunity to meet with Lucy in private, when one morning Sir John appeared at the house to earnestly beg them to dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he had to attend the club in Exeter and she might be left completely alone, except for her mother and the two Miss Steeles. Elinor, who foresaw that a good opportunity for the matter she had in mind was being offered in a gathering like this, where they would be more at ease under the calm and well-mannered direction of Lady Middleton than on the occasions when her husband brought them together for his noisy gatherings, immediately accepted the invitation. Margaret, with her mother's permission, also accepted, and Marianne, although always reluctant to attend these meetings, was convinced by her mother to do the same, as she could not bear to see her isolate herself from every opportunity for enjoyment.",30.749,30.321
738,"The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her. The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one novelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and while they remained there, she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy's attention to attempt it. They quitted it only with the removal of the tea–things. The card–table was then placed, and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park. They all rose up in preparation for a round game.","The three girls arrived, and Mrs. Middleton was delighted to escape the dreadful solitude that had threatened her. The meeting was as dull as Elinor had anticipated, with no new thoughts or statements, nothing more tedious than the speeches that dragged on from the dining room to the family room where the children joined in, and while everyone was there, she couldn't manage to talk to Lucy. The children only left when it was time to clear the table for tea. They set up the card table, and Elinor began to wonder how she could find time to converse. They all stood up to prepare for the card game.",13.571,12.681,"The young ladies left, and Lady Middleton was sweetly spared from the terrifying loneliness that threatened her.

It will only mean sending Betty in the post coach, and I trust that I can afford that. The three of us will be very comfortable in my chaise; and when we are in the city, if you do not wish to go where I go, that's perfectly fine, you can always go out with one of my daughters. I am sure that your mother will not oppose it, for I have been so lucky in getting my children off my hands, that she will consider me a very suitable person to be in charge of you; and if I do not manage to marry off at least one of you before concluding the matter, it will not be my fault.

Nothing could induce me to leave her. This cannot mean, must not mean a conflict.",24.072,23.228
802,"Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare them perfectly well; and Elinor, who now understood her sister, and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her mother's decision, from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit, which she could not approve of for Marianne, and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid. Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her mother would be eager to promote—she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust; and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London. That Marianne, fastidious as she was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings' manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook every inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object, was such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that object to her, as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to witness.","Mrs. Jennings reassured that Mrs. Dashwood could let the two girls go without any consequences. Elinor now understood her sister's intention, realizing that beyond the indifferent appearance was an eagerness to meet Willoughby again. Therefore, she no longer refused to follow the plan but instead suggested waiting for their mother's decision, though she did not expect her mother to support her in declining the trip, which she herself could not agree to on Marianne's behalf. Elinor also had her own reasons to avoid the trip. Whenever Marianne wanted something, their mother was always eager to support her—Elinor did not expect to influence her mother regarding caution in matters of the heart because she could never convey her doubts to her; and she did not dare to explain the motives behind her refusal to go to London. As for Marianne, although she was difficult to please and had long been accustomed to Mrs. Jennings' ways, which she often despised, she now ignored all the troubles caused by Mrs. Jennings and disregarded anything that might hurt her sister while pursuing her own goals. This was clear evidence that she considered this goal extremely important. Despite everything that had happened, Elinor still could not mentally prepare herself to cope.",9.53,8.695,"Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood would manage perfectly well without them; Elinor, who had now understood her sister and seen that she had given herself over to the desire to be with Willoughby again, no longer directly opposed the plan and left the matter solely to her mother's decision; however, she did not expect much support from her mother in preventing the trip, which she did not find right for Marianne and had certain reasons to avoid for herself. Whatever Marianne wanted, her mother wanted to give - she did not expect to persuade her mother to be cautious in a matter where she could not make her approach it with suspicion; therefore, she did not dare to explain the reason behind her reluctance to go to London. Although Marianne, being a very meticulous person, was well aware of and displeased with Mrs. Jennings' behaviors, the fact that she would overlook every such discomfort and disregard the things that would most hurt her sensitive feelings in pursuit of a certain goal was such a strong, complete proof of the importance of that goal to her that Elinor was not ready to witness it despite everything that had happened.",18.236,17.785,"Mrs. Jennings repeated once again how sure she was that Mrs. Dashwood could get along very well without them; and Elinor, who now understood her sister and saw how indifferent to almost everything else her anxiety to see Willoughby again made her, did not raise any further direct objection to the plan; she simply referred it to her mother's will, from whom, however, she did not expect much support in her effort to prevent a visit that seemed so inconvenient for Marianne, and which she also had a special interest in avoiding for her own sake. In everything Marianne desired, her mother was eager to please her; she could not hope to induce the latter to behave cautiously in a matter regarding which she had never been able to inspire distrust, and she did not dare to explain the cause of her own reluctance to go to London. That Marianne, fussy as she was, perfectly aware of Mrs. Jennings' behavior which so displeased her, in her efforts to achieve her goal was willing to overlook all such annoyances and ignore what most irritated her sensitivity, was such a strong, full proof of the importance she attached to that goal, that despite everything that had happened, it surprised Elinor, as if nothing had prepared her to witness it.",25.4,25.002

Her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness; and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive. Her mother's affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one of the three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal.","Marianne's joy was almost beyond happiness, as immense as the turmoil in her mind and the restlessness of setting off. She only calmed down when she lingered with her mother, and at the moment of parting, her sorrow became excessive. Her mother's sorrow was not necessarily less, while Elinor was the only one among the three who did not view the separation as a permanent farewell.",22.873,21.713,"Marianne's joy was almost beyond happiness; her excitement and impatience to leave were at their peak.

820,"Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and beginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest, without wondering at her own situation, so short had their acquaintance with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition, and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before! But these objections had all, with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby's constancy, could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect, how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison, and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne's situation to have the same animating object in view, the same possibility of hope. A short, a very short time however must now decide what Willoughby's intentions were; in all probability he was already in town. Marianne's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her, but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place. Should the result of her observations be unfavourable, she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions would be of a different nature—she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.","When starting the journey under the care of Mrs. Jennings, who was also her host, sharing the carriage with her, Elinor thought about herself and was surprised at her current situation: having known her for only a short time, completely mismatched in age and temperament, and having opposed this plan so much just a few days ago! But through the exuberance in the happiness of youth that Marianne and their mother shared, these objections had been overshadowed or ignored. Although sometimes doubting Willoughby's fidelity, Elinor witnessed the outburst of longing filling Marianne's soul and radiating in her eyes, and felt that compared to her sister, her own prospects were empty, her own mood was insipid. She wished to be in Marianne's situation to have the same lively purpose ahead, cherishing the same possible hope. K However, now, in a short time, very short, it will be enough to recognize what Willoughby's intentions are; it is very likely that he has gone to the city. The younger sister's eagerness about the trip indicates that she is looking forward to meeting him there. Elinor intends not only to explore new aspects of his character compared to what she has observed and heard others comment on, but also to pay attention to his gestures towards her sister, in order to understand what kind of person he is and what his intentions are. If what she observes is not favorable, she is determined to open her sister's eyes. On the other hand, if the result is the opposite, she will have a different reaction - at that time she will strive not to have any selfish comparisons, putting aside any regrets that might make her less happy with her sister's happiness.",9.198,8.62,"They had known Mrs. Jennings for such a short time, and they were so mismatched both in age and spirit, and she herself had objected to such a decision so much just a few days ago, that Elinor could not believe, without being astonished at her own situation, that she was embarking on a journey to London in the same carriage with that lady, under her protection, and as her guest! Her objections had been overcome or ignored by the happy youthful passion that Marianne and her mother shared; although Elinor sometimes doubted Willoughby's fidelity, she could not watch without feeling how empty her own future was, how relatively joyless her own state of mind was, and how willingly she would share Marianne's delusions to keep alive in her mind the same life-giving fantasy, the same hope, as the happy expectation that filled Marianne's whole soul and shone in her eyes. However, it was only a short, very short time before they would see what Willoughby's intentions were; he must have already arrived in the city. Marianne's eagerness to go showed that she was sure she would find him there; Elinor was as determined to observe every new light that her own observations and the opinions of others could shed on his character, as she was to closely watch his behavior towards her sister before their meetings became frequent, to discern what his stance and intentions were. If the result of her observations was negative, her sister- He was absolutely determined to open her eyes; if not, his effort would be different - then he would have to learn to avoid selfish comparisons and to eliminate any regrets that could diminish the satisfaction he would feel from Marianne's happiness.",18.041,17.654,"Seeing herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and embarking on a journey to London under her protection and as her guest, Elinor could not help but ponder her own situation: so brief was the time they had known each other, so incompatible in age and temperament, and so many objections she had raised against this trip just a few days before! But all these objections had succumbed, overwhelmed by that happy youthful enthusiasm that both Marianne and her mother shared; and Elinor, despite her occasional doubts about Willoughby's constancy, could not contemplate the rapture of the marvelous anticipation to which Marianne was surrendered, overflowing in her soul and illuminating her eyes, without feeling how empty her own prospects were, how lacking in joy her own state of mind compared to hers, and how willingly she would live the same anxiety as Marianne if it meant having the same invigorating objective, the same possibility of hope. But now there was little, very little time left, to know Willoughby's intentions: surely he was already in the city. The eagerness to depart that Marianne displayed was a clear sign of her confidence in finding him there; and Elinor was determined not only to find out everything she could about the young man's character, whether through her own observations or what others might inform her, but also to watch his conduct towards her sister with such jealous attention that it would allow her to be sure of what he was and his intentions before they had met many times. If the result of her observations was unfavorable, she was determined to open her sister's eyes in whatever way she could; if not, the task ahead would be different: she would have to learn to avoid selfish comparisons and banish from herself any regret that might diminish her satisfaction for Marianne's happiness.",25.991,25.719
821,"They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. She sat in silence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to her sister. To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings, talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with all possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets. They reached town by three o'clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey, from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire.","Their journey lasted three days. Marianne's attitude during the trip was a vivid example for Mrs. Jennings to see how easygoing and sociable she would be in the coming days when traveling with her. Elinor was silent for most of the journey, immersed in her own thoughts, rarely initiating conversation, except when a beautiful landscape came into view, prompting her to utter words of praise directed only to her sister. Afterwards, to make amends for this attitude, Elinor immediately took on the polite role she had assigned to herself, showing care for Mrs. Jennings, talking to her, joking with her, and listening to her whenever possible. As for Mrs. Jennings, she treated both of them very kindly, always asking if they were comfortable and enjoying themselves; her only complaint was that she couldn't let them choose their own food at the inn and didn't get to hear them admit they preferred trout over mackerel, or poultry over lamb chops. They arrived in the city at three o'clock in the afternoon on Tuesday, delighted to be freed from the cramped carriage, ready to enjoy all the luxuries of a cozy fireplace.",13.364,12.666,"It had been three days since they set out, and throughout the journey, Marianne's behavior had provided Mrs. Jennings with a rather happy example of the tolerance and harmony she would show in the future. She sat almost the entire way in silence, wrapped in her own thoughts, and except for the moments when a beautiful detail of the scenery elicited a cry of delight directed specifically at her sister, she hardly spoke of her own accord. To make up for this behavior, Elinor immediately took on the duties of politeness she had assigned to herself and treated Mrs. Jennings with great interest, talking to her at every opportunity, laughing with her, and listening to her; for her part, Mrs. Jennings was as kind as possible to both of them, constantly worrying if they were comfortable and in good spirits, and was only distressed when she couldn't let them choose their own meals at the inn, unable to get them to admit that they preferred salmon to cod or boiled chicken to beef steak. On the third day, they arrived in the city around three o'clock; rejoicing at being freed from the cramped carriage after such a journey and eager to enjoy the luxury of a well-lit fireplace.",13.873,13.158,"The journey lasted three days, and Marianne's behavior throughout the trip provided a good indication of what could be expected in the future regarding her deference and affability towards Mrs. Jennings. She remained silent for almost the entire way, wrapped in her own thoughts and hardly ever speaking of her own accord, except when some picturesque object of beauty appeared before her eyes, eliciting some expression of joy, which she directed exclusively to her sister. To compensate for this behavior, however, Elinor immediately took on the duty of courtesy she had set for herself, was extremely attentive to Mrs. Jennings, conversed with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever possible; and Mrs. Jennings, for her part, treated them both with all imaginable kindness, constantly ensuring they were comfortable and entertained, and was only displeased by her inability to get them to choose their own dinner at the inn or to make them confess whether they preferred salmon or cod, boiled chicken or veal chops.

824,"""I am NOT going to write to my mother,"" replied Marianne, hastily, and as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry. Elinor said no more; it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby; and the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be engaged. This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her pleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity. Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be no more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with eager rapidity. Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed for her to the two–penny post.

Marianne's letter was finished within a few minutes; after all, it could not be more than a note: then it was folded, sealed, and the address was written with eager haste.

Elinor was stunned by such a conversation and couldn't utter a single word. But her sister's feelings were instantly expressed.

Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless of contributing, at present, to her ease, she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being indisposed.

But when she had enough tranquility to read it, little relief did she find in it. Every line was full of Willoughby.

1059,"""If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender recollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well in mind as person. The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits. This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me incapable of having ever felt. Hers, for me, was, I believe, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate. At seventeen she was lost to me for ever. She was married—married against her inclination to my brother. Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered. And this, I fear, is all that can be said for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian. My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her. I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at last the misery of her situation, for she experienced great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though she had promised me that nothing—but how blindly I relate! I have never told you how this was brought on. We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland. The treachery, or the folly, of my cousin's maid betrayed us. I was banished to the house of a relation far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement, till my father's point was gained. I had depended on her fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one—but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now to lament it. This however was not the case. My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her unkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural. She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned. But can we wonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she should fall? Had I remained in England, perhaps—but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that purpose had procured my exchange. The shock which her marriage had given me,"" he continued, in a voice of great agitation, ""was of trifling weight—was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years afterwards, of her divorce. It was THAT which threw this gloom,—even now the recollection of what I suffered—""","- If I am not mistaken due to uncertainties or biased by soft-hearted recollections, the two are very similar in both soul and body. With the same warm heart, the same lively spirit. This woman is one of the closest people to me, orphaned from a young age, taken under my father's care. The two of us are nearly the same age, and from our earliest years, we were playmates. I cannot remember a time when I did not love Eliza; and as we grew up, my feelings for her were such that, although, perhaps judging by the solitary and sternly joyless circumstances now, she might think I never knew how to feel. I believe her feelings for me were as fervent as her sister's for Willoughby, equally unfortunate, though for different reasons. ""At the age of seventeen, she no longer had any relationship with me. She got married - married my brother against her will. She had a large fortune, and our family's estate was heavily in debt. My brother was not worthy of her; he didn't even love her. I had hoped that her feelings for me would lift her through the difficulties, and for a time, they did. But eventually, because she endured such terrible treatment, her miserable situation extinguished all her resolve, and although she had promised me nothing, I was somehow blindly hopeful!"" ""I haven't told you how this came about. In just a few hours, we were going to elope to Scotland. Her maid betrayed us - or foolishly - revealed the news. I was sent to live with a distant relative; she was forbidden from having any freedom, any communication, any enjoyment; until my father felt that everyone had understood his warning. I had too much faith in her resilience, and the disappointment was heavy; but if only she had a happy marriage, because at that time I was young, a few months might have eased my pain, or at least now I wouldn't have to lament. However, that was not the case. My brother did not love her; his pleasures were not as normal as people thought, and from the very beginning, he treated her badly."" ""The consequences of this matter, on such a young and vibrant mind, as inexperienced as hers, are inevitable.

But with a husband like that, ultimately lacking patience, without a friend to advise or restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their wedding, and I was serving in the regiment in the East Indies), one might wonder if she could have stood firm? Perhaps, if I had stayed in England... but I intended to foster the happiness of both by staying away from her for many years.""

We were almost the same age; we played and befriended each other since we were very young. I do not remember a time when I did not love Eliza; in the years we grew up, my love for her was such that, looking at my current resentful and joyless state, you might doubt that I could have felt it. I believe her love for me was as passionate as your sister's attachment to Mr. Willoughby, though it stemmed from a different reason, but it was no less unfortunate. She left my life forever at the age of seventeen. She married - unwillingly, she married my brother. Her wealth was great, while our family estate was heavily mortgaged. This, I fear, is the only thing that can be said about the behavior of someone who was both her uncle and guardian. My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her. I was hoping that his love for me would keep him standing in any situation, and it did for a while - but in the end, because he was subjected to great rudeness, the misery of his situation destroyed all his resistance, and although he promised me, how blindly I am explaining it! I did not explain how this came about. There were only a few hours left before we eloped to Scotland. The betrayal or foolishness of my cousin gave us away. I was exiled to the house of a distant relative, and he was deprived of all freedom, people, and entertainment until my father got what he wanted. I had too much confidence in his fortitude, and the blow I received was severe - but if his marriage had been happy, being so young, I could have accepted the situation in a few months or at least I wouldn't have to mourn now. However, that was not the case. My brother did not love him; his sense of pleasure was not as it should be, and he mistreated him from the very beginning. The effect of this on someone as young, lively, and inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon was as expected. At first, she shut herself into the full misery of her situation; I wish she hadn't lived long enough to overcome the sorrows caused by remembering me. But with a husband who incites infidelity, and without a friend to advise or restrain her (my father lived only three months after they married, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies), is it possible to be surprised that she made a mistake?

My first care, when I DID arrive, was of course to seek for her; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy. I could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin. Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person. He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it, that her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief. At last, however, and after I had been six months in England, I DID find her. Regard for a former servant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit him in a spunging–house, where he was confined for debt; and there, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my unfortunate sister. So altered—so faded—worn down by acute suffering of every kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl, on whom I had once doted. What I endured in so beholding her—but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it—I have pained you too much already.

The first thing I was concerned with when I just got back was, of course, to look for her, but the search was both hopeless and miserable. I could only trace her whereabouts up to her first lover, with every reason to fear that she had left him and plunged deeper into a life of sin. The legally mandated support was not enough to provide her with an estate, nor enough for her to be comfortable, and then my brother informed me that a few months ago the right to receive the support had been transferred to another person. He guessed - and could guess calmly - that because she had spent extravagantly and then fallen into destitution, she had to transfer part of the right to receive support to get immediate assistance. ""However, finally, six months after I returned to England, I found her. Out of affection for an old servant of mine who was now in dire straits, I visited him at the debtor's prison.

I could hardly believe that the gaunt and sickly figure before me was all that remained of a lovely, vibrant, healthy young woman whom I had once adored.""

Her legal income was not suitable for her fortune, nor was it sufficient for her to live comfortably; I learned from my brother that the authority to receive this income had been transferred to another person a few months earlier. My brother thought, quite indifferently, that her extravagance and resulting distress had forced her to urgently dispose of a portion of her income. But finally, six months after coming to England, I found her. I went to the debtor's prison to see an old servant of mine who had fallen into destitution and been imprisoned for his debts; there, in the same prison, in a similar state of imprisonment, stood my unfortunate aunt.

He, her father, a well–meaning, but not a quick–sighted man, could really, I believe, give no information; for he had been generally confined to the house, while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself, of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the business.

Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible. But though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called, in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of compassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before, she did not see her less wretched. Her mind did become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection. She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits, that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them.","When Miss Dashwood recounted the details of the conversation to her sister, the effect was not entirely as she had hoped to see. It was not that Marianne appeared to doubt any part of the story, for she listened attentively in calmness and accepted it without objection or comment, not attempting to defend Willoughby, and through her tears seemed to feel that he could not be defended. Elinor saw that her sister's demeanor indicated an awareness of guilt had entered her mind, and was also pleased to see the result as her sister no longer avoided Colonel Brandon when he visited, but even voluntarily conversed with him in a respectful and sympathetic manner. Her sister's spirits were also less agitated and tormented than before. K However, Marianne did not feel any less miserable. Her mind became stable, but stable in despondency and melancholy. She felt the loss of Willoughby's character more heavily than the loss of his affection. His seduction and abandonment of Miss Williams, the poor girl's misery, and the suspicion of his intentions that might have once dominated her—all together haunted her mind to the extent that she could not express her feelings even to Elinor. Nurturing her sorrow in silence, she caused her sister more pain than if she had confessed this sorrow in the most open and frequent manner.",18.679,18.29,"When the details of this conversation were later repeated by Miss Dashwood to her sister, its effect on her was not quite as the former had hoped. It was not that Marianne did not believe any part of the accounts, for she listened to them with unbroken and docile attention, did not object, did not say anything, did not try to justify Willoughby, and as if with tears, felt it was impossible.

Her emotions settled, but they settled in a sorrowful depression. She felt the loss of Willoughby's character more heavily than the loss of her heart; his seduction and abandonment of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl, and whatever plans Willoughby might have had regarding herself, all gnawed at her mind to such an extent that she did not even want to express her feelings to Elinor; she quietly sank into her own melancholy thoughts, which grieved her sister more than if she had openly and frequently expressed her feelings.",25.618,25.324,"When Miss Dashwood disclosed this conversation in detail to her sister, as she did with great promptness, the effect it had on the latter was not entirely what the former had expected. It was not that Marianne seemed to distrust the authenticity of what was related, for she paid the most calm and docile attention to everything, did not object or comment on anything, at no point tried to justify Willoughby, and with her tears seemed to show that she felt any justification was impossible. But although her subsequent behavior gave Elinor the certainty that she had indeed managed to convince her of the young man's guilt; although she was pleased to see that, as a consequence, Marianne no longer avoided Colonel Brandon when he visited them, conversed with him, and even on her own initiative, with a kind of compassionate respect, and although she saw her in a less exasperatedly irritable mood than before, she did not see her any less unhappy. Her mind was stable, but it had settled into a gloomy despondency. She was more pained by the loss of the image she had of Willoughby than by having lost his love; that he had seduced and abandoned Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl, and the doubt about what the young man's intentions towards herself might have once been, all of this weighed on her so much that she could not bring herself to talk about her feelings even with Elinor; and with her quiet absorption in her sorrows, she made her sister suffer more than if she had opened her heart to her by speaking about them over and over again.",23.663,23.331

She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which, though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks. A variety of occupations, of objects, and of company, which could not be procured at Barton, would be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at times, into some interest beyond herself, and even into some amusement, much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her.","Although her daughter wanted to be comfortable, Mrs. Dashwood decided that it would be better for Marianne at this time to stay anywhere except Barton, where every view would most strongly and painfully remind her of the past, always putting Willoughby before her eyes, as if she constantly saw him there. Therefore, she advised her two daughters not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings' house, which was planned to last at least five or six weeks, although it was never precisely determined. Unlike Barton, there were many types of activities here, many places to visit, and many social connections, which Mrs. Dashwood hoped would, over time, distract Marianne and make her find interest, even unintentionally, or even feel joy.",17.7,17.174,"At the expense of her own personal comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had decided that anywhere outside of Barton would be better for Marianne at that time; everything she saw in Barton would remind her of Willoughby in the most powerful and unsettling way, bringing back memories of the past. Therefore, she advised her daughters not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings under any circumstances; although the duration of the visit was not firmly decided, it was generally thought that it would be no less than five or six weeks. Various activities, items, and friends that were not present in Barton would be unavoidable there, and moreover, she hoped, they might occasionally distract and even entertain Marianne with other engagements besides herself, even if she scoffed at this idea now.",19.372,18.855,"Against her own interests and convenience, Mrs. Dashwood had decided that, at that moment, it would be better for Marianne to be anywhere but Barton, where everything in sight would intensely and painfully remind her of the past by constantly bringing Willoughby to mind as she had known him there.

There, they would not be able to avoid the various activities, projects, and company that Barton could not offer them and which, she hoped, might occasionally cause Marianne, without realizing it, to take an interest in something beyond herself and even to have a bit of fun, much as she now disdainfully rejected both possibilities.",22.486,21.943

1092,"Every qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the moment, to more than its real value; and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good–breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good–nature.","For many others, each occasional comment made in various situations often exceeds the true meaning that should be conveyed. Sometimes she grew weary of their bustling condolences, leading her to value a well-mannered character - rather than a cheerful temperament - as necessary to bring comfort to her and her sister.",3.628,1.301,"Every quality is at times elevated beyond its true worth by momentary circumstances; sometimes, overwhelmed by officious condolences, Elinor too was forced to consider that propriety was more essential for peace than affability.",6.714,3.684,It often happens that the circumstances of the moment lead to attributing more value to any given trait than it actually has; and so it happened that sometimes such eager commiseration annoyed Elinor to the point of considering good manners more important for well-being than a good heart.,12.012,9.801
1093,"Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day, or twice, if the subject occurred very often, by saying, ""It is very shocking, indeed!"" and by the means of this continual though gentle vent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined (though rather against the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her card with her as soon as she married.","Mrs. Middleton expressed her feelings about the matter approximately once a day, or twice if the topic was discussed more, by saying ""It truly is shocking"". Through her continuous yet gentle venting, she could not only initially meet the Dashwood sisters without any emotion, but also meet them again without remembering a word about the matter. After having elevated the dignity of her gender and voiced her criticism of the wrongdoings of the other, she felt free to look after the interests of the people she gathered around. Therefore, she insisted (though against Sir John's wishes) that since Miss Willoughby would soon be a refined and elegant lady, she should leave her calling card for her immediately after the wedding.",11.093,10.023,"Lady Middleton expressed her opinion on the matter once a day, or if the topic came up frequently, twice a day by saying, ""Truly shocking!"" and through these gentle yet unchanging words, she not only managed to look at the Miss Dashwoods with a detached gaze at first, but also succeeded in looking at them without remembering a single word of the matter immediately after; thus, after supporting the pride of her own gender and condemning the faults of the other gender in a definitive manner, she felt free to engage with the affairs of her acquaintances, and even (despite Sir John's decision) decided to leave her card with Mrs. Willoughby as soon as she got married, since she would be a graceful and wealthy woman. Colonel Brandon's polite, measured questions never disturbed Miss Dashwood. He had more than earned the privilege of being a confidant about her sister's sorrow with his friendly efforts to alleviate the grief; they always conversed in confidence. The main reward he received for the painful burden of explaining past troubles and present shames was Marianne's pitying glances as she occasionally watched him and (though not often) her affectionate voice when she had to speak to him or forced herself to do so. These convinced Colonel Brandon that his efforts had increased her goodwill towards him; they gave Elinor hope that this goodwill would grow even more after her; but unaware of all this, Mrs. Jennings, who thought the Colonel continued with his usual seriousness and could not be persuaded to propose or appoint himself to propose, started saying two days later that they would marry in November instead of mid-summer, and a week later that they would not marry at all. The harmony between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed to declare that all the honor of the mulberry tree, the canal, and the yew grove would be transferred to her; Mrs. Jennings had completely removed Mr. Ferrars from her agenda for some time. In early February, fifteen days after receiving Willoughby's letter, Elinor informed her sister of his marriage, fulfilling a painful duty. She had made an effort to ensure that Marianne heard the news from her immediately after the ceremony, rather than discovering it in the newspapers she eagerly examined every morning. Marianne received the news with a determined maturity; she said nothing about it and did not cry at first; but shortly after, tears flowed and she spent the whole day in a state no less agonizing than when she first heard she should expect the event. As soon as the Willoughbys got married, they left the city; Elinor, now that there was no danger of encountering either of them, began to think that she could gradually persuade her sister, who had not left the house since the first blow had struck, to go out again as she used to. At that time, the two Miss Steele cousins came to their home in the Bartlett Buildings in Holborn, reintroduced themselves to their more fashionable relatives in Conduit and Berkeley streets, and were received with great kindness by them. Only Elinor was upset to see them. Their presence always caused her pain, and she struggled to respond maturely to Lucy's devastating joy at still finding her in the city. ""I would have been very upset if I hadn't found you here,"" he kept saying, placing a strong emphasis on that word. ""But I always knew I would find you. I was almost certain you wouldn't leave London for a while, although you told me in Barton that you wouldn't stay for more than a month. But at that time, I thought you would probably change your mind when the time came. It would have been a terrible shame if you had left before your brother and sister-in-law arrived. I'm sure you're not in a hurry to leave now either. I'm extremely glad you didn't keep your word."" Elinor understood him very well and had to use all her willpower to appear as if she did not. ""Oh, my dear,"" said Mrs. Jennings, ""how was your journey."""" ""It's not like a private car, of course,"" replied Miss Steele, with quick cheerfulness; ""we came all the way by stagecoach, and a very sweet young man accompanied us. Dr. Davies was coming to the city, so we boarded the stagecoach with him; he was very kind and paid ten or twelve shillings more than us."" ""Oh my!"" cried Mrs. Jennings; ""how delightful indeed! By the way, the doctor is single, just so you know."" ""Here you go,"" said Miss Steele, pretending to be offended, ""everyone laughs at me like this about the doctor, why, I don't understand. My cousins say I've stolen his heart, but I can honestly say I can't think about him for two minutes straight. 'My God, your young man is coming, Nancy,' said my cousin the other day, having seen him coming towards the house from afar. 'My young man, indeed!' I said - 'I have no idea who she meant. The doctor is nothing to me.'"" ""Come on, come on, it's always said like that at first - but it doesn't work - I think the doctor is fine, I mean."" ""Seriously, no!"" replied his cousin, pretending to be sincere, ""and I beg you to object if you hear it being talked about."" Mrs. Jennings immediately assured her that she would not object, and Miss Steele was very happy. ""When they come to the city, you will surely go and stay with your brother and sister-in-law, Miss Dashwood,"" said Lucy, resuming her attack after a pause filled with hostile insinuations. ""No, I don't think we will stay."" ""Oh yes, I think you will stay."" Elinor did not want to please him by objecting further. ""How nice of Mrs. Dashwood to allow both of you to stay for such a long time!"""" ""A long time, is it!"" Mrs. Jennings interrupted. ""Their outings have just begun!"" Lucy was thus silenced. ""We were sorry not to see your sister, Miss Dashwood,"" said Miss Steele. ""I was sorry she wasn't well."" Marianne had left the room when they arrived. ""You are very kind. My sister will be equally disappointed to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has been suffering from nervous headaches lately and cannot handle crowds or conversation."" ""Ah my beautiful, what a pity! But Lucy and I are old friends! - I think she can see us; we won't say a word, I mean."" Elinor politely declined the offer. Her sister might be lying down or in her dressing gown, so she couldn't join them. ""Hey, if this is the issue,"" shouted Miss Steele, ""let's go out and see it."" Elinor began to find such insensitivity unbearable; but Lucy's stern warning spared her the trouble of reprimanding her. Although Lucy's reaction, as was often the case, did not add grace to a sister's behavior, it was useful in correcting the behavior of the other sister. Although she protested a little, Marianne yielded to her sister's insistence and agreed to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings for half an hour one morning. However, she set the condition that she would not go on any house visits and would do no more than accompany them to Gray's shop on Sackville Street, where Elinor was negotiating to exchange some of their mother's old-fashioned jewelry. When they were standing at the door, Mrs. Jennings remembered that there was a lady she needed to visit at the other end of the street; since she had no business at Gray's, it was decided that she would make her visit while the young girls took care of their errands, and then she would join them afterwards. When they climbed the stairs and entered, the Miss Dashwoods found the place so crowded that there was no one available to attend to their orders; they had to wait. The only thing to do was to sit at the end of the counter that seemed to be moving the fastest; there was only one gentleman standing there; Elinor hoped to awaken his courtesy for a quicker shopping experience. But the gentleman's sharp eye and refined taste outweighed his courtesy. He was ordering a toothpick box for himself and, after examining and discussing all the toothpick boxes in the shop for a quarter of an hour, and until the size, shape, and decorations of the box were finally determined by his own creative imagination, he cast several very sharp glances at the two ladies. he had no time to show any interest other than wheat; although adorned with the latest fashion clothes, his gaze seemed to imprint a strong, natural, unadulterated triviality of character and face into Elinor's memory. Marianne did not have to feel annoying emotions such as contempt and anger in the face of their brazen scrutiny of her appearance and the arrogance with which they pointed out the various flaws of the various toothpick boxes presented for her inspection, because her mind was not there; she was able to shut herself off into her thoughts and ignore what was happening around her in Mr. Gray's shop just as she did in her own bedroom. Finally, the matter was decided. Ivory, gold, and pearl, all were chosen; the gentleman, who also indicated the last day he could continue without his toothpick box, put on his gloves with unhurried care, bestowed another look at the Miss Dashwoods that seemed more like a demand than admiration, and departed with an air of happy genuine affectation and false indifference. Elinor wasted no time in discussing her work and was just finishing up when another gentleman appeared beside her. Elinor turned her eyes towards his face and, somewhat surprised, saw that it was her brother. The excitement and joy they felt from the encounter were just enough to create an acceptable scene in Mr. Gray's shop. John Dashwood did not seem at all upset to see his sisters again; his sisters, on the other hand, were reasonably pleased with the encounter; his questions about their mother's health were respectful and considerate. Elinor learned that she and Fanny had been in the city for two days. ""I really wanted to stop by yesterday,"" he said, ""but it was impossible, because we had to take Harry to Exeter Exchange to see the wild animals: and the rest of the day Mrs We spent it at Ferrars'. Harry was very pleased. This morning, as soon as I had a free hour, I was definitely going to call you, but when one first arrives in the city, there are so many things to do. I came here to get a seal made for Fanny. But tomorrow, I will surely be able to stop by Berkeley Street and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings. As far as I understand, she is quite a wealthy woman. There are also the Middletons, you must introduce me to them as well. As the relatives of my stepmother, it will make me happy to pay my respects to them. From what I understand, they are excellent neighbors to you in the village."" ""Truly delicious. Their attention to our comfort, their friendship in every detail, is more than I can express."" ""I am very glad to hear that, believe me; I am truly very glad. But it should be so; because very wealthy people, you can naturally expect every kindness and comfort from them that can make your situation more pleasant. So, you have settled comfortably into your little cottage and you lack nothing! Edward gave us a very nice description of that place; he said it was the most complete example of its kind ever; and it seems you love it very much. Hearing this made us very happy, rest assured."" Elinor felt a little embarrassed by her brother; she was not at all sorry to be relieved from the necessity of replying to him when Mrs. Jennings's servant came to say that his mistress was waiting for them at the door. Mr. Dashwood accompanied them downstairs, was introduced to Mrs. Jennings at the door of his carriage, and, repeating his hope of calling on them the next day, took his leave. The visit happened as mentioned. Since their aunts couldn't come, they sent their apologies; ""but she was so busy with her mother that she really had no time to go anywhere."" However, Mrs. Jennings immediately told her that she was not at all fond of such ceremonies, that they were all cousins or something of that sort, the first cunning dog! Moreover, during their last meeting, she had offered her one of Folly's puppies! Now everything was over!"" Mrs. Palmer was equally angry in her own way. ""She was determined to end the acquaintance immediately, and was even very lucky never to have met him. With all her heart, she wished that Combe Magna was not so close to Cleveland; but it didn't matter because it was already too far to visit; she hated him so much that she was determined never to mention his name again, and she would tell everyone she saw the same, calling him such a worthless man."" Mrs. Palmer's remaining compassion manifested itself in gathering details about the approaching wedding with all her might and relaying them to Elinor. Soon, she was able to tell which coachman was making the new carriage, which painter was working on Mr. Willoughby's portrait, and in which shop Miss Grey's dresses could be seen. Lady Middleton's calm and polite indifference to the matter was a relief to Elinor, as she often felt overwhelmed by the noisy politeness of the others. It was a great comfort to be sure that at least one person in her circle of friends was not excited; knowing that there was someone she could face without them being curious about the details or worried about her sister's health was a great comfort. Every quality is occasionally elevated beyond its true value by momentary circumstances; sometimes, overwhelmed by officious condolences, Elinor too was forced to think that courtesy was more essential for peace than cordiality. Lady Middleton expressed her opinion on the matter once a day, or if the topic came up frequently, twice a day by saying, ""Truly shocking!"" and through these gentle but unchanging words, she not only managed to look at the Miss Dashwoods with an indifferent eye at first, but immediately after, succeeded in looking without remembering a single word of the matter; thus, having supported the pride of her own gender and condemned the faults of the other gender in a definitive manner, she felt free to engage with her acquaintances' matters, and even (despite Sir John's decision) decided to leave her card with Mrs. Willoughby as soon as she got married, since she would be a graceful and wealthy woman.",1.227,1.169,"Lady Middleton expressed her opinion on the matter once or twice a day, if the topic came up frequently, saying: ""What a terrible thing, indeed!"" and through this continuous yet gentle release, she was not only able to visit the Miss Dashwoods from the beginning without the slightest emotion, but very soon without even remembering a word of the whole matter; and having thus defended the dignity of her own sex and decidedly censured what was wrong in the other, she felt free to protect the interests of her group, so she decided (although somewhat against Sir John's opinion) that, as Mrs. Willoughby would be an elegant and wealthy woman at the same time, she would leave her card as soon as she was married.",28.505,27.983

One thing DID disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint. Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his sex, of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly perceive, at different times, the most striking resemblance between this baby and every one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing his father of it; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like every other baby of the same age; nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the world.","However, Mrs. Jennings was completely unaware of these jealousies and discontents, to the point that she thought it was delightful for young girls to live together; and every evening she congratulated the two young ladies for having escaped the control of a foolish old woman for such a long time!

It so happened that while her two sisters with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another of her acquaintance had dropt in—a circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her. But while the imaginations of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happiness must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance. In the present instance, this last–arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters, she immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a small musical party at her house. The consequence of which was, that Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what was still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they might not expect to go out with her a second time?

In this matter, that woman also let her imagination go too far from the truth and the possible, to the extent that upon merely hearing the names of the two Miss Dashwoods and knowing they were Mr. Dashwood's sisters, she immediately concluded that they were residing on Harley Street. This confusion was manifested one or two days later, on an invitation card sent to the two sisters and their brother-in-law, for a concert at the lady's house. As a result, Miss John Daswood was compelled to send the carriage to pick up the two sisters, but worse, she was annoyed at having to show care for the two sisters, and who could say that the two sisters would not go along a second time?

The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally concluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, the colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almost sure of being told that upon ""her word she looked vastly smart, and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests.""","Judging by her attire and appearance, Marianne seemed completely indifferent, as if she paid no attention to half the details while preparing with Miss Steele's makeup in five minutes.

She could even guess the number of ball gowns her friend had with better judgment than Marianne herself, and she couldn't help but hope to know before leaving how much her friend's weekly laundry cost and her annual expenses.

1280,"He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he was exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy. Happy had it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his own merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations! For then his brother's bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the ill–humour of his mother and sister would have begun. But while she wondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find that the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other. Why they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour's conversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education; while he himself, though probably without any particular, any material superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school, was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.","He greeted her with a relaxed politeness, tilting his head in a way that made it clear, as if in words, that he was exactly the type of dandy that Lucy had described to her. She might have been amused, if her feelings for Edward depended less on his own qualities and more on those of his closest relatives! For at this moment, the way his younger brother tilted his head in greeting must have added the final touch to the dismal picture painted by his mother and sister. But while she was pondering the differences between the two young men, she did not realize that the emptiness in the deceit of one had made her more tolerant of the humility and true worth of the other. Why they are different, Robert himself explained in a fifteen-minute conversation. Because, while talking about his brother and lamenting his brother's clumsiness which he believed prevented his brother from fitting into suitable social circles, he was candid and generous in attributing less blame to any innate defect and more to the unfortunate fate of private education. He also added that he himself, although he may not have any naturally superior qualities, only thanks to the advantages of public school, appeared well-suited to blend in with society as well as any other man.",19.966,19.52,"The young man treated her with an easy politeness; he bent his head in such a way that Elinor understood as clearly as if it were described in words that he was exactly the fop Lucy had described.

But while marveling at the difference between the two young men, she realized that the shallowness and pretentiousness of one did not at all diminish the humility and affection for the other's worth. Robert himself explained why they were different within a quarter of an hour of an hour-long conversation; for while speaking of his brother, he lamented the excessive shyness he believed prevented him from entering suitable circles, attributing it sincerely and generously not to any natural flaw but to the unfortunate circumstance of receiving a private education; whereas he, despite having no particular feature or significant personal superiority, was, perhaps due to the privilege of attending a public school, just as fit for social interaction as anyone.",17.107,16.629,"He addressed her with easy courtesy and tilted his head in a nod that made it as clear as words would have, that he was exactly the braggart Lucy had described.

For in such circumstances, her brother's nod would have given the final touch to what her mother and sister's ill temper had begun.

1304,"""That is exactly what I said, my dear. 'Lord!' says I, 'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out; and the long and the short of the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this. Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!—There's for you, my dear!—And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter, except Nancy!—Could you have believed such a thing possible?— There is no great wonder in their liking one another; but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody suspect it!—THAT is strange!—I never happened to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it out directly. Well, and so this was kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;—till this very morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well–meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out. 'Lord!' thinks she to herself, 'they are all so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;' and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at her carpet–work, little suspecting what was to come—for she had just been saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord's daughter or other, I forget who. So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride. She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams as reached your brother's ears, as he was sitting in his own dressing–room down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country. So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on. Poor soul! I pity HER. And I must say, I think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly; and your brother, he walked about the room, and said he did not know what to do. Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house, and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too, to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes. THEN she fell into hysterics again, and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar. The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says, she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad. I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her. Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it! To have his love used so scornfully! for they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may. I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest passion!—and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same. He and I had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house, for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too; and so she may, for what I care. I have no pity for either of them. I have no notion of people's making such a to–do about money and greatness. There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a–year, she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours—or a little bigger—with two maids, and two men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly.""","- I asked the same thing, ma'am. I asked: 'My God! Is Mrs. Daswood ill? Then everything became clear; every detail of the matter, everything I heard was like this. ""Mr. Edward Ferrars, the young man I often jokingly paired with you (but then, I was incredibly relieved that nothing came of it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it turns out, has been engaged for over twelve months to my cousin Lucy! There, did you hear that! - and no one knew anything about it, except Nancy!"" Can you believe this? It's not surprising if they love each other; the thing is, they kept it secret when they should have made it public, so no one knew anything at all! That's truly astonishing! I had never seen the two of them together, otherwise I surely would have known."" ""Hey, so this is a big secret, because of fear of Mrs. Ferrars; both she and her siblings didn't know a thing, until this morning, poor Nancy - as you know, she's straightforward but not very clever - blurted out everything. Imagine she thought to herself: 'My God! They all love Lucy, surely they won't cause any trouble', and so, she went to her sister-in-law who was sitting alone knitting a rug, while the sister-in-law had no idea what was about to happen; because just five minutes earlier, her sister-in-law had told her brother she planned to matchmake Edward with the daughter of some Duke, I forget who."" ""So you can imagine what a blow it was to Miss Daswood's vanity and pride. She immediately flew into a frenzy, screaming so loudly that her brother, who was sitting in the family room downstairs writing a letter to his steward in the countryside, heard her. He rushed upstairs, and a scene of horror unfolded, as Lucy, who couldn't fathom what was happening, ran in. Poor thing!"" ""I feel sorry for her. And I dare say, she was terribly mistreated; for her sister-in-law scolded her fiercely, and soon after made her faint. As for Nancy, she was kneeling on the floor, crying bitterly; and her brother was pacing around the room, not knowing what to do. Mrs. Daswood declared that she would not let them stay another minute in the house, and her husband had to kneel on the floor to persuade her to allow them to pack their clothes. At this moment, Mrs. Daswood had another fit, and he was so frightened that he sent for Mr. Donavan, who found the whole house in chaos. The carriage was ready at the gate to take my two poor nieces away, and they had just stepped into the carriage when he arrived; he said poor Lucy was in such a weak state that she could barely walk; and Nancy was almost the same. I must say, I have no patience with her sister-in-law; and with all my heart, I hope that despite her opposition, they still love each other."" ""My God! I can't imagine what poor Edward will do when he hears this news! Having a lover treated with such contempt! I wouldn't be surprised if he loves her deeply! And Mr. Donavan thinks so too. He and I have talked a lot about this; and most importantly, he will return to Harley Street, to be there as soon as Mrs. Ferrars finds out, because she was invited right after my two cousins left, as her sister believes she will also have a fit; and as for her, I don't care. I don't pity these two people. I have no prejudice about what people should do regarding money and reputation. There is no reason in the world to prevent Edward and Lucy from getting married; because I am sure Mrs. Ferrars is more than capable of providing for her son; and although Lucy has almost nothing, she knows better than anyone how to manage. I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars only gives him five hundred a year, she could make it seem like any other person with eight hundred."" ""Oh my God! How can they live so cozily together in a vacation house like hers - or a little bigger - with two maids and two butlers. I can help them with a servant, as my Betty has an unemployed sister, so that would be suitable for them.""",21.107,20.997,"""I said exactly the same, my dear. 'My God!' I said, 'Is Mrs. Dashwood ill?' Then everything became clear; the essence of the matter, as I learned, seems to be like this. Mr. Edward Ferrars, you know the young man I teased you about (but honestly, I'm terribly glad there was nothing serious), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it appears, has been engaged to my cousin Lucy for a year! -here's the news for you! -No one except Nancy knew a single thing about the matter! -Could you believe such a thing could be possible? -There's nothing surprising about them liking each other; but who would have thought they would take it this far between them! This is strange! I never saw them together, otherwise, I'm sure I would have understood immediately. They kept it secret out of fear of Mrs. Ferrars, neither she nor the brother nor the sister-in-law suspected a thing, -but this morning poor Nancy, you know, she's well-meaning, but not very bright, blurted everything out. 'My God!' she thought to herself, 'they all love Lucy so much they won't cause trouble;' so she went to the sister-in-law, who was sitting alone weaving a rug, not knowing what was about to happen to her -because she was just telling the brother, not five minutes before, that they were planning a marriage between Edward and Lord so-and-so's, I forgot who, daughter. You can imagine how her pride must have been struck. She immediately went into a violent hysterical fit, her screams reached the brother who was sitting in his room thinking about writing a letter to the steward in the village. The brother immediately got up and ran, and a terrible scene ensued, because Lucy also came to them at that moment, how could she know what had happened. Poor thing! I pity her. But I think she was treated badly; because the sister-in-law scolded her with such fury that the girl fainted. Nancy also knelt down and cried bitterly; the brother paced up and down the room saying he didn't know what to do. Mrs. Dashwood told them not to stay in the house for a moment, and the brother asked them to stay only until they packed their things. Then the sister-in-law had another hysterical fit, the brother was so scared that he called Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found the house in an uproar. The carriage was ready at the door to take my poor cousins away, and as he arrived, they were just stepping out; poor Lucy was in such a state that she could barely walk; Nancy was almost as bad. Believe me, I can't stand the sister-in-law; with all my heart, I hope they get married despite her. My God! Poor Mr. Edward will be in such a difficult situation when he hears about it! To have his beloved insulted like that! Because they say he's in love with her, which is possible. I wouldn't be surprised, even if he were madly in love! -Mr. Donavan is of the same opinion. We talked quite a bit; the good news is that he returned to Harley Street, so he can be around and listen in when the matter is explained to Mrs. Ferrars, because they called him as soon as my cousins left the house, as the sister-in-law was sure he would have a fit too; let him have it, I don't care. I don't pity either of them. I don't think it's right for people to make such a fuss over money and nobility. There is no reason in the world why Mr. Edward and Lucy shouldn't get married; because I'm sure Mrs. Ferrars has the means to support her son well; even if Lucy has almost nothing of her own, she knows how to make the best of everything better than anyone; I think if Mrs. Ferrars gave her just five hundred a year, she would manage to look as good as someone else with eight hundred. My God! How comfortably they would live in a cottage like yours -or a slightly bigger one -with two maids and two servants; I would even help them find the maids, because my Betty has an unemployed sister who would be perfect for them.""",22.312,22.209,"—It's the same thing I told you, dear. “Heavens!”, I said to her. “Is Mrs. Dashwood ill?” And there it all came to light; and in a few words, as far as I could gather, it seems to be this: Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young man with whom I used to joke with you (although, as things have turned out, I am now terribly glad that there was indeed nothing of that sort), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it appears, has been engaged for more than a year to my cousin Lucy! There you have it, dear! And without anyone knowing a word about it, except Nancy! Would you have believed it possible? It's not at all strange that they like each other, but that things progressed so far between them, and without anyone suspecting! That is indeed strange! I never saw them together, or I would surely have discovered it immediately. Well, and then they kept all this very secret for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your brother nor your sister-in-law suspected anything about the whole matter... until this very morning, poor Nancy, who, as you know, is a very well-intentioned creature, but nothing in the realm of conspiracies, blurted it all out. “Heavens!”, she thought to herself, “they are so fond of Lucy, they surely won't oppose it”; and so, she came and went to her sister-in-law, Miss Dashwood, who was alone embroidering her tapestry, without imagining what was coming... because she had just told her brother, barely five minutes ago, that she was planning to arrange a marriage for Edward with the daughter of some lord, I don't remember which. So you can imagine the blow it was to her vanity and pride. She immediately had a hysterical fit, with such screams that they even reached the ears of her brother, who was in his own study downstairs, thinking of writing a letter to his steward in the country. Then he flew upstairs and there was a terrible scene, because by then Lucy had joined them, without dreaming of what was happening. Poor creature! I pity her. And believe me, I think they behaved very harshly with her; her sister-in-law scolded her in a fury, until she fainted. Nancy, for her part, fell to her knees and cried bitterly; and her brother paced the room saying he didn't know what to do. Mrs. Dashwood said the young women could not stay a minute longer in the house, and her brother also had to kneel to convince her to let them stay at least until they had packed their clothes. And then she had another hysterical fit, and he was so scared that he sent for Mr. Donovan, and Mr. Donovan found the house all in commotion. The carriage was ready at the door to take my poor cousins away, and they were just getting in when he came out; poor Lucy, he told me, was in such bad condition that she could barely walk; and Nancy was almost as bad. Let me tell you that I have no patience with her sister-in-law; and I hope with all my heart that they get married, despite her opposition. God! How poor Mr. Edward will feel when he finds out! That they have treated his beloved so badly! Because they say he loves her immensely, with all his might. I wouldn't be surprised if he felt the greatest passion! And Mr. Donovan thinks the same. We talked a lot about this; and the best part is that he went back to Harley Street, to be on hand when they told Mrs. Ferrars, because they sent for her as soon as my cousins left the house and her sister-in-law was sure she would also become hysterical; and she well might, for all I care. I have no compassion for any of them. I have never known people who make such a fuss over money and grandeur. There is no reason in the world why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; I am sure that Mrs. Ferrars can very well afford to look after her son; and although Lucy personally has almost nothing, she knows better than anyone how to make the most of anything; and I would say that if Mrs. Ferrars assigned her even five hundred pounds a year, she could make it look the same as someone else would with eight hundred. Heavens! How comfortably they could live in a house like yours, or a little bigger, with two maids and two servants; and I think I could help them with the maids, because mine, Betty, has an unemployed sister who would suit them perfectly!",29.665,29.576

Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late often hoped might be the case) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward; and happy above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it.","At this point, Mrs. Jennings paused, and since Elinor had had enough time to gather her thoughts, she was able to respond to her and make remarks in the manner such a subject required. She was glad to see that no one suspected her of having any vested interest in the matter; that Mrs. Jennings no longer imagined she had any feelings for Edward (as she often thought the latter had such an idea). What pleased her most was that, in Marianne's absence, she could speak about the affair without being flustered, believing she could impartially judge everyone involved.",15.283,14.38,"Here Mrs. Jennings paused; Elinor, having the opportunity to gather her thoughts, would be able to give a response and make an observation as the subject might require.

But unwelcome as such a task must be, it was necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.","Her task made her miserable. She was about to take away what she believed to be her sister's chief comfort, revealing such details about Edward that she feared would entirely lose her sister's affection, and make Marianne recall her own disappointment when her vivid imagination recognized the similarity between their situations.

1309,"She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings, or to represent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the self–command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward's engagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne. Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given without emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor impetuous grief.—THAT belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne listened with horror, and cried excessively. Elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs; and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence, was readily offered.","She did not want to dwell on her own feelings or show much distress, instead striving to compose herself in the manner she had adopted since first hearing about Edward's engagement; and in doing so, she might imply to Marianne how she should act. She recounted the incident to her sister in a clear and simple voice; and although not devoid of emotion, she was neither violently agitated nor deeply distressed. This reaction belonged to the listener, for Marianne listened in horror and wept bitterly. Elinor was the one who tried to comfort others about her own sorrow, and had to console no less than when others were sorrowful. She reassured her sister that her own spirits remained steady, and she did not wish to condemn Edward for any fault except imprudence.",12.07,11.071,"She had no intention of dwelling on her own feelings, or of explaining how much she herself had suffered, except for her effort to maintain the composure she had shown since first hearing of Edward's engagement, as these could be signs Marianne might cling to. Her story was clear and simple; it was impossible to tell it without emotion, but it did not involve intense excitement or severe pain. -These were more for the listener, for Marianne listened in horror and cried uncontrollably. Elinor, while in her own sorrow, had to comfort others as much as she could; she immediately offered all the consolation she could by sincerely defending that her spirits were high and that Edward was innocent in every respect except for his lack of judgment.",15.034,14.215,"She was far from wanting to dwell too much on her own feelings or to show that she was suffering greatly, unless the self-control she had practiced since the moment she learned of Edward's engagement indicated that it would be useful in front of Marianne. Her account was clear and straightforward; and although it could not be devoid of emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation or outbursts of grief. That was more fitting for the listener, for Marianne listened to everything in horror and cried incessantly. Generally, Elinor had to console others when she was as distressed as when they were; and thus, she comforted Marianne by offering her the certainty of her own tranquility and a vigorous defense of Edward against all charges, except that of imprudence.",18.877,18.101

Edward seemed a second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she HAD loved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself! As for Lucy Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuaded at first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of Edward for her. She would not even admit it to have been natural; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which only could convince her, a better knowledge of mankind.","But for a moment Marianne did not want to believe any of it. Edward seemed to be a second Willoughby; and although she admitted, like Elinor, that her sister had loved him most sincerely, she thought her sister could still feel less than she did!

My calmness while thinking about the matter, the consolation I wanted to find for myself was possible only through continuous and painful effort; -they did not appear on their own; -they were not waiting ready to cheer me up -No Marianne.

It was told to me... somehow it was imposed on me by the very person whose oldest commitment shattered all my expectations; and it was told to me, I thought, with an air of triumph. I had, therefore, to overcome this person's suspicions by trying to appear indifferent where my interest was deepest. And it hasn't been just once; over and over again I have had to listen to their hopes and joys. I have known myself separated from Edward forever, without knowing of even one circumstance that would make me wish the union less. Nothing has made him less worthy of appreciation, nor anything that assures that I am indifferent to him. I have had to fight against his sister's ill will and his mother's insolence, and I have suffered the punishments of loving someone without enjoying its advantages. And all this has been happening at times when, as you know so well, it was not the only pain that afflicted me. If you can believe me capable of feeling at any time... you could surely suppose that I have suffered now. The calm measure with which I have now come to take what happened, the comfort I have been willing to accept, have been the product of a painful effort; they did not come by themselves; at first, I did not count on them to relieve my spirit... no, Marianne.

If she suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in THAT quarter. 'THERE, to be sure,' said she, 'I might have thought myself safe.' She was quite in an agony. We consulted together, however, as to what should be done, and at last she determined to send for Edward. He came. But I am sorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, was of no avail. Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded. I never thought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before. His mother explained to him her liberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land–tax, brings in a good thousand a–year; offered even, when matters grew desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if he still persisted in this low connection, represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match. His own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all; she would never see him again; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support, she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it.""","- It is impossible to describe how much poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered when Fanny told her. While, through the most sincere affection, she was preparing the most proper marriage for him, how could she think that he would secretly engage with someone else! This idea never crossed her mind!

However, they discussed with each other what to do, and finally she decided to call Edward over. He came. But he regretted having to tell what happened next."" ""Mrs. Ferrars only asked him to end the engagement, and he helped her by giving additional opinions as you two might guess, and Fanny also pleaded, but to no avail. Duty, affection, everything was disregarded. He had never seen Edward so obstinate and unfeeling before. Fanny's mother informed him about her generous plans in case he married Miss Morton; she told him she would transfer the Norfolk estate inheritance to him, providing a thousand a year after land taxes."" ""When the situation became desperate, she raised it to one thousand two hundred. If he still resisted and clung to such a lowly relationship, she made him clearly aware of the destitution that would accompany this marriage. She said she would only give him two thousand pounds; would never see him again; and from then on she would support him very little, to the extent that if he wanted to pursue any career, she would use all her power to hinder his advancement.""",14.497,14.103,"""The ordeal poor Mrs. Ferrars endured when Fanny first brought up the matter is indescribable.

Even if she had suspected he had a connection somewhere, that place could not have been it. 'On that front,' she said, 'I truly thought I was safe.' She was overwhelmed with agony. However, we sat down and discussed what could be done, and finally decided to summon Edward. He came. But it pains me to recount what happened next. No matter what Mrs. Ferrars said to break the engagement, no matter how much I supported her with my opinions, and Fanny with her pleas, it was to no avail. Duty, love, everything was ignored. I never knew Edward could be so stubborn, so unfeeling before. His mother explained her generous plans to him, that if he married Miss Morton, she would settle the Norfolk estate on him, an estate that, after taxes, would comfortably bring in a thousand pounds a year; she even raised the offer to twelve hundred pounds when the matter seemed hopeless; and she also explained the inevitable penalty that would result if he persisted in this lowly marriage. She told him she would take away his entire two thousand pounds, never see him again, and not give him a penny of support, and that if he took up a job for a better income, she would do everything in her power to hinder his progress in that job.""",18.897,18.559,"—What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered when Fanny told her is indescribable.

""There, I assure you,"" she said, ""I would have felt safe."" It has been a true agony for her. We then discussed among ourselves what should be done, and finally she decided to send for Edward. He came. But it is very sad for me to tell you what followed. Everything that Mrs. Ferrars could say to induce him to end the engagement, reinforced, as you can imagine, by my arguments and Fanny's pleas, proved useless. Duty, affection, he disregarded it all. I had never thought that Edward could be so obstinate, so insensitive. His mother explained to him the generous plans she had for him, in case he married Miss Morton; she told him she would transfer the Norfolk properties to him, which, after deducting contributions, yield a good thousand pounds a year; she even offered, when things became desperate, to raise it to twelve hundred; and on the contrary, if he persisted in this disadvantageous union, she described the inevitable hardships that would accompany his marriage. She insisted that the two thousand pounds he personally possesses would be all his assets; he would never see her again; and she would be so far from lending him the slightest help that if he were to take up any profession with a view to obtaining a better income, she would do everything in her power to prevent him from progressing in it.",23.733,23.441

1373,"""Oh, did not you? But it WAS said, I know, very well, and by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides that, my cousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us for three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your brother's Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him. Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that. However this morning he came just as we came home from church; and then it all came out, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and been talked to by his mother and all of them, and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he have. And how he had been so worried by what passed, that as soon as he had went away from his mother's house, he had got upon his horse, and rid into the country, some where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better of it. And after thinking it all over and over again, he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they to live upon that?—He could not bear to think of her doing no better, and so he begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the matter directly, and leave him shift for himself. I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be. And it was entirely for HER sake, and upon HER account, that he said a word about being off, and not upon his own. I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing like it. But, to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly (with a great deal about sweet and love, you know, and all that—Oh, la! one can't repeat such kind of things you know)—she told him directly, she had not the least mind in the world to be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have, she should be very glad to have it all, you know, or something of the kind. So then he was monstrous happy, and talked on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he should take orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he got a living. And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did not care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.""","- Oh, you really didn't hear? But people have said so, you know, said it many times, and more than once; because Miss Godby told Miss Sparks that no one in their right mind would think Mr. Ferrars would give up someone like Miss Morton, with a fortune of thirty thousand pounds, for Lucy Steele who has nothing at all, and I myself heard Miss Sparks say so. ""And besides that, it was my cousin Richard who said that there would come a time when he feared Mr. Ferrars would distance himself, and when Edward did not come near us for three days, I did not know what to think; and deep down I believed Lucy was in despair; because we left her brother's house on Wednesday, and heard nothing about him on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, not knowing how he was."" ""There was a moment when Lucy intended to write to him, but my sister's spirit restrained this. However, this morning he came right when we returned from church, and then we learned everything, how on Wednesday he was called to Harley Street, how his mother and everyone talked to him, and how he declared in front of them that he loved no one but Lucy and would marry no one but Lucy. And then how worried he was about what had happened, so much so that even as he left his mother's house, he jumped on his horse and rode out into the countryside, somewhere; and how he stayed at an inn all Thursday and Friday to calm himself down."" ""And he said, after much thought, he realized that now he has no assets, nothing at all, it would be cruel to keep the engagement with my sister because she would suffer losses, as he has nothing but two thousand pounds, no hope for anything else; and if he were ordained as he once thought, he would get nothing except a vicar's position, then how could they live on that income? He couldn't bear the thought that my sister wouldn't be any better off, so he pleaded, if she thought it over a bit, she would end the relationship and let him fend for himself."" ""I heard him say everything as clearly as that. It was all because of her, caring for her that he spoke words of finality, not because of himself. I can swear he never said anything about being tired of my sister, or having any intention of marrying Miss Morton, or anything like that. But, surely, Lucy didn't want to hear anything in such a manner; so my sister immediately told him (with all the romance and emotion, you know, everything like that. Oh dear! We can't repeat these things, you know) - my sister immediately told him, the girl wasn't shy at all, that she could live with him on a small allowance, and no matter how little he had, she would gladly accept it all, you know, something like that. So he was incredibly happy, they discussed for a long time what they should do, and then they agreed he should be ordained immediately, and they would wait until he received his salary."" ""And just at that moment, I couldn't hear anything more, because my cousin called up from downstairs to let me know that Mrs. Richardson had come by car to take one of us to Kensington Park; so I had to go in and interrupt to ask Lucy if she wanted to go, but she didn't want to leave Edward; so I ran upstairs, put on my silk stockings, and went out with the Richardsons.""",23.243,23.112,"""Oh, really? But it was being said, I know very well, and by quite a few people; because Miss Godby told Miss Sparks that no one in their right mind would expect Mr. Ferrars to leave a woman like Miss Morton, who has a fortune of thirty thousand pounds, for Lucy Steele, who has nothing; I heard this directly from Miss Sparks. Additionally, my cousin Richard also said that when things get serious, Mr. Ferrars would just leave; and when Edward didn't come near us for three days, I didn't know what to think; it seems to me that Lucy has given up on everything; because we left your brother's house on Wednesday and didn't see him on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, we don't know what happened to him. Once, Lucy thought of writing to him but then didn't feel like it. However, Edward came this morning, just as we were returning from church; then everything was revealed, they had called him to Harley Street on Wednesday, his mother and others talked to him, and he told them all to their faces that he loved no one but Lucy and would marry no one but Lucy. What happened upset him so much that as soon as he left his mother's house, he jumped on his horse and went to some village; he stayed at an inn all Thursday and Friday to think the matter through thoroughly. After thinking it over repeatedly, he realized that now, since he has neither wealth nor anything else, it would be inconsiderate to expect Lucy to remain engaged, because now the loss is hers, as he has nothing but two thousand pounds, no hope, nothing; even if he enters the church as planned, he can only get a curacy, and how will they live on that little? -He couldn't bear the thought of Lucy not having a better life, so he asked, if she had the slightest thought, to end the matter immediately, so he could focus on his work. I heard that he said these things in the clearest way possible. If he mentioned separation, it was entirely for Lucy's sake, for her well-being, not because he was thinking of himself. I swear he didn't say a single word about being tired of her or wanting to marry Miss Morton or anything like that. But honestly, Lucy didn't pay any attention to such words; she directly told him (there were quite a few ""my dear, my love"" phrases, you understand, such words -Well, you know, one can't repeat such things) -she directly told him that the thought of separation never crossed her mind, because she would live with him under any circumstances, no matter how little money he had, she would be happy with him in any way, and so on, like that. Then Edward became incredibly happy, they talked for a while about what they would do, and decided that Edward should enter the church as soon as possible, and to delay the wedding until he received his ordination. I couldn't hear the rest, because my cousin called from downstairs, Mrs. Richardson had come with her carriage, she was going to take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I had to go into the room and interrupt them to ask Lucy if she wanted to go, but she didn't want to leave Edward, so I ran upstairs, put on my silk stockings, and went with the Richardsons.""",21.448,21.316,"—Oh, really?

And besides, my cousin Richard also said that he feared when it came time to lay the cards on the table, Mr. Ferrars would disappear; and when Edward did not come near us for three days, I myself did not know what to believe; I thought to myself that Lucy considered him lost, for we left her brother's house on Wednesday and did not see him all Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and we did not know what had become of him. At one point Lucy thought of writing to him, but then her spirit rebelled at the idea. Nevertheless, he appeared this morning, just as we were returning from church; and there we learned everything: how on Wednesday he had been asked to go to Harley Street and his mother and everyone else had spoken to him, and how he had declared before everyone that he only loved Lucy and that no, he would marry no one but Lucy. And how he had been so worried about what had happened, that upon leaving his mother's house he had mounted his horse and headed to some unknown place in the countryside; and how he had stayed at an inn all Thursday and Friday, to think about what to do. And after thinking the whole matter over and over, he said that it seemed to him that now that he had no fortune, that he had nothing at all, it would be wrong to ask Lucy to keep the engagement, because she would lose out, given that he only had two thousand pounds and no hope of anything more; and if he were to take holy orders, as he had sometimes thought of doing, he would get nothing but a parish, and how were they to live on that? He could not bear the thought that she would not be better off in life, so he implored her, if she cared even a little, to put an end to the whole matter immediately and let him fend for himself. I heard him say all this with absolute clarity. And it was completely for her sake, and thinking of her, not himself, that he spoke of ending the engagement. I can swear that he never said a word about being tired of her or wanting to marry Miss Morton or anything of the sort. But, in any case, Lucy did not want to listen to such kind words, and so she told him immediately (with much sweetness and love, you know, all that... Oh, one cannot repeat those things, you know)... she told him immediately that she had no intention of breaking the engagement, because she could live with him on nothing, and however little he had, she would be content with that, or something like that. Then he was overjoyed, and they talked for a while about what they should do, and they agreed that he should take orders immediately and that they should postpone their wedding until he could obtain a benefice. And just at that moment I could not keep listening, because my cousin called me from downstairs to tell me that Mrs. Richardson had arrived in her carriage and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was obliged to enter the room and interrupt them to ask Lucy if she wished to go, but she did not want to leave Edward; so I ran upstairs and put on a pair of silk stockings, and went with the Richardsons.",35.0,34.903

1393,"The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town, and Marianne's impatience to be gone increased every day. She sighed for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that if any place could give her ease, Barton must do it. Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge. She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good–will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with both her friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them. This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;—but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept it with pleasure.","The two Dashwood sisters had now been in town for over two months, and every day Marianne grew more eager to return. She longed for the air, the free life, and the tranquility of the countryside; and believed that if there was any place that could bring her peace, it was Barton. Elinor was equally eager, but hesitated because she considered the difficulties of such a long journey that Marianne could not foresee. However, she began to seriously consider the possibility and mentioned their desire to their kind hostess. The lady objected with all the eloquence of good intentions, then proposed a plan that would keep them for a few more weeks, but seemed acceptable to Elinor. At the end of March, Mr. and Mrs. Palmer would go to Cleveland for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, along with her two granddaughters, received a very earnest invitation from Charlotte to join them.

Thus, she gladly accepted the invitation.",16.647,16.244,"It had been more than two months since the Miss Dashwoods had arrived in the city, and Marianne's impatience to return was growing every day. She missed the village air, the freedom, the tranquility; if there was a place that could give her peace, she thought it must be Barton. Elinor wanted to go back just as much as she did, but she was not very keen on leaving immediately, because she knew the difficulties of such a long journey and that Marianne would not want to accept these difficulties. Nevertheless, she seriously started planning their return; when she told her kind hosts about her thoughts, Mrs. Jennings objected with all the sweetness of her good intentions; when she proposed a plan that would keep them away from their home for a few more weeks, this seemed much more reasonable to Elinor than other possibilities. The Palmers were going to Cleveland for the Easter holidays at the end of March; Mrs. Jennings received a warm invitation from Charlotte to accompany them with both friends.

Elinor's anxiety was no less, whose desire to leave immediately was only less than Marianne's to the extent that she was aware of the difficulties of such a long journey, something the latter refused to admit. Nevertheless, she began to seriously consider carrying it out, and had already mentioned her wishes to her kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good will, when a possibility arose that, although it still kept them away from home for a few more weeks, seemed to Elinor on the whole much more convenient than any other plan. The Palmers would go to Cleveland around the end of March, for Easter; and Mrs. Jennings, along with her two friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to accompany them. In itself, this offer would not have been sufficient for Miss Dashwood's delicacy; but as it was backed by a very real courtesy from Mr. Palmer, and added to this was the enormous improvement in his behavior towards them since it was known that his sister was going through very unhappy times, she could accept it with great pleasure.",27.768,27.435

From Cleveland, which was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not beyond one day, though a long day's journey; and their mother's servant might easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be at home in little more than three weeks' time. As Marianne's affection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph with little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.","Elinor could not argue that her sister should behave properly and overcome such feelings; she could only try to counterbalance with other arguments.

From Cleverland, being only a few miles from Bristol, the journey to Barton would take no more than a day; and their mother's servants could easily come there to pick them up, and since there was no chance of staying at Cleverland for more than a week, the two sisters could be home in just over three weeks.

From Cleveland, which was a few miles from Bristol, the distance to Barton was no more than a day's journey, albeit a long day; and her mother's servant could easily go there to accompany them; and as they would not have to stay in Cleveland for more than a week, they could be back home in a little over three weeks from that moment.

1401,"Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui, to provoke him to make that offer, which might give himself an escape from it;—and if so, she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained; for, on Elinor's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which she was going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning, and conversed with her there for several minutes. The effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape her observation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even changed her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear, to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with agitation, and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.— Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the interval of Marianne's turning from one lesson to another, some words of the Colonel's inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house. This set the matter beyond a doubt. She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette. What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips, that she did not think THAT any material objection;—and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest. They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable, when another lucky stop in Marianne's performance brought her these words in the Colonel's calm voice,—","Through the vivid sketch of their future boredom, perhaps Mrs. Jennings hoped he would reveal his thoughts so he could escape it. If so, she soon had good reason to think her goal had been achieved; for when Elinor went to the window to measure a drawing she was going to copy for her friend, he followed her with a look that conveyed a particular meaning, then conversed with her for a few minutes. The effect of his words did not escape her observation, for although she was too honorable to intentionally eavesdrop, even when she moved to sit next to the piano where Marianne was playing with the purpose of not hearing, she still kept an eye on them and saw Elinor blushing, looking agitated, and too engrossed in his words to continue her work. Still wanting to confirm her hopes, during the time Marianne transitioned from one piece to another, a few of the Colonel's words inevitably reached her ears, from which it seemed he was apologizing for the house being too poor. This definitely determines the case. She wondered why he thought it necessary to say so, but guessed it was proper etiquette. She couldn't hear how Elinor responded, but judging by the way her lips moved, she didn't think it was a significant obstacle; and in her heart, Mrs. Jennings praised her for being so honest. Then they continued to talk for a few more minutes, during which she couldn't hear a word, and when Marianne's music stopped, she heard the Colonel's calm voice:",21.451,21.152,"Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was provoking her by harshly depicting her future troubles, thereby offering her a chance to escape from this distress; -if so, she soon had good reason to think she had achieved her goal; because when Elinor went to the window to more quickly get the dimensions of a picture she was going to copy for her friend, she followed her with a meaningful look and spoke with her there for a few minutes. The effect of her conversation on the young lady did not escape her notice; although she was too noble to eavesdrop, and even got up and moved to the seat next to the piano where Marianne was playing to avoid hearing, she couldn't help but notice that Elinor's face changed color, she became excited, and listened to what was being said with such great attention that she couldn't continue her work. What further confirmed her hopes were some words that inevitably reached the Colonel's ears during a break Marianne took between lessons: she was apologizing for the poor condition of her house. This made the matter indisputable. She was really surprised that the Colonel found it necessary to do so; -but she thought that this must be the custom. She couldn't hear what Elinor replied, but from the movement of her lips, she guessed that there was no significant objection; -and Mrs. Jennings, being so honest, congratulated Elinor inwardly. Then they spoke for a few more minutes about something she couldn't catch a single word of, then another fortunate pause in Marianne's music brought the Colonel's calm voice to her ears with these words,",17.836,17.498,"Perhaps Mrs. Jennings hoped that this expressive sketch of his future tedium would prompt him to make that proposal which would allow him to escape such a fate; and if so, shortly thereafter she had reason to think she had achieved her goal; for as Elinor approached the window to more expediently take the measurements of an engraving she was going to copy for her friend, he followed her with a particularly significant look and conversed with her for several minutes. Nor did the effect this conversation had on the young woman escape Mrs. Jennings' observation, for although she was too dignified to eavesdrop, and even moved to a place near the piano where Marianne was playing to avoid listening, she could not help but see that Elinor changed color, listened with great agitation, and was too engrossed in what he was saying to continue with her task. Confirming her hopes even more, in the interval when Marianne was switching from one lesson to another, she could not help but overhear some of the Colonel's words, with which he seemed to be apologizing for the poor state of his house. This eliminated all doubt in her. It did surprise her, it is true, that he thought it necessary, but she supposed it was the proper etiquette. She could not distinguish Elinor's response, but judging by the movement of her lips, it seemed she thought that was not a significant objection; and Mrs. Jennings praised her in her heart for her honesty.

1412,"Elinor's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand. The preferment, which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;—and SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it!—Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different cause;—but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might have a share in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence, and her gratitude for the particular friendship, which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly expressed. She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of Edward's principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another. But at the same time, she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself. It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER, she would have been very glad to be spared herself;— but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, declining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means, that she would not on any account make farther opposition. Edward, she believed, was still in town, and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele. She could undertake therefore to inform him of it, in the course of the day. After this had been settled, Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour, and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret, that the house was small and indifferent;—an evil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very light of, at least as far as regarded its size.","If the Colonel had actually proposed to her, Elinor's surprise could hardly have been greater than it was at this moment. The appointment, which just two days ago she considered hopeless for Edward, was now being offered so that he could marry. And among all the people in the world, it was she who was designated to bestow it! Mrs. Jennings had noticed her emotional state, but attributed it to a different cause. Although there were some impure and less joyful feelings mixed in with her emotions, she still deeply and warmly felt a sense of respect for the virtue and gratitude for the kind gesture of Colonel. She thanked him with all her heart, speaking of Edward's principles and temperament with the praise she knew he deserved. She promised to gladly carry out the task he entrusted to her, if he truly wanted to avoid such a pleasant duty but instead asked someone else. But at the same time, she couldn't help but think that no one could do this better than him, and she would be very happy to be excused as she did not want Edward to suffer the burden of owing her. However, Colonel Brandon refused for a delicate reason, still earnestly wanting the proposal to be passed on to her, so she had no further reason to decline. She believed Edward was still in the city, and fortunately, she had heard Miss Steele mention his address. Therefore, she could inform him on the same day. After this matter had been arranged, Colonel Brandon began to speak of his advantage in having a respectable and agreeable neighbor like this, and at this moment he expressed his regret that the house was too small and cold, a drawback that Elinor did not consider significant, at least with regard to its size. She said:",17.785,17.483,"If the Colonel had proposed to her, Elinor's astonishment could not have been greater than what she felt in the face of this task.

But on the other hand, she couldn't help but think that no one else could perform that duty as well as the Colonel. In short, because she did not want to cause Edward the pain of accepting a favor from him, she would be very happy to be excused from this duty; but for equally kind reasons, Colonel Brandon, who had declined it, still seemed to want the offer to be made through her so much that Elinor could no longer object for any reason. She thought Edward was still in town and fortunately had heard his address from Miss Steele. Thus, she could manage to inform him within the day. After this decision was made, Colonel Brandon began to talk about how lucky he was to have such a respectable and good neighbor, then added, with regret, that the house was small and ordinary - Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had guessed, did not care about this negativity, at least in terms of the house's dimensions.",24.695,24.452,"Elinor's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater if the colonel had actually been offering her marriage.

After a moment of conversation, suddenly remembering that Fanny had not been informed she was there, John Dashwood left the room to find his wife. Elinor was left to sit and improve her acquaintance with Robert. He had confirmed her worst opinions of his mind and heart through his cheerful indifference, self-satisfaction in happiness, to unjustly enjoy the affection and generosity of his mother, gained through a profligate lifestyle that harmed his brother.",11.02,10.148,"Elinor had heard enough, not enough to flatter her pride or increase her sense of importance, but enough to irritate her nerves and occupy her mind; -so she was glad to be relieved from the necessity of giving a proper response by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars, and from the danger of hearing more from his brother. After chatting for a few minutes, John Dashwood remembered that he was unaware of his sister-in-law Fanny's presence there and left the room to look for her, leaving Elinor to further her acquaintance with Robert; with his cheerful indifference and happy ease in his manners, Robert continued to confirm Elinor's most negative opinions about his mind and soul, while enjoying an undeserved share of his mother's affection and generosity, the cost of which was borne by his exiled brother, and only thanks to his own profligate lifestyle.",21.135,20.512,"Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity and elevate her self-esteem, to agitate her nerves and make her think; and she was therefore glad that Mr. Ferrars' entrance saved her from having to respond to so much and from the danger of listening further to her brother. After chatting for a few moments, John Dashwood, remembering that he had not yet informed Fanny of his sister's presence, left the room in search of her. And Elinor was left there with the task of improving her relationship with Robert, who, with his cheerful nonchalance, with the satisfied self-complacency that allowed him to enjoy such an unjust distribution of his mother's love and generosity to the detriment of his excluded brother... love and generosity that he had earned only through his own dissipated life and the integrity of that brother, confirmed Elinor in her most unfavorable opinion of his intelligence and feelings.",26.287,25.759
1509,"They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he began to speak of Edward; for he, too, had heard of the living, and was very inquisitive on the subject. Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as she had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very different, was not less striking than it had been on HIM. He laughed most immoderately. The idea of Edward's being a clergyman, and living in a small parsonage–house, diverted him beyond measure;—and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.","After just two minutes of conversation, he began to talk about Edward; for he had also heard about the clerical position, and felt very curious about the matter. Elinor repeated the details as she had told John. Robert's reaction, although quite different, was no less remarkable than the other man's. He laughed somewhat excessively. The idea of Edward becoming a clergyman and living in a small parsonage made him laugh heartily; and when he added the imagined image of Edward preaching in a white robe and officiating a wedding between some John Smith and some Mary Brown, he just found it absurd.",17.372,16.472,"It had only been two minutes since they were alone when Robert started talking about Edward; he had also heard about the church and was very curious about the subject.

The idea of Edward transformed into a clergyman and living in a small parsonage amused him endlessly; and when he added the fantastic vision of Edward reading prayers dressed in a white surplice and making the public admonitions of the marriage of John Smith and Mary Brown, he could not imagine anything more ridiculous.",26.618,25.982
1510,"Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable gravity, the conclusion of such folly, could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited. It was a look, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings, and gave no intelligence to him. He was recalled from wit to wisdom, not by any reproof of hers, but by his own sensibility.","While remaining silent and sternly motionless to await the conclusion of such mad words, Elinor could not restrain her eyes from fixing on him with a gaze that conveyed all her contempt. However, the gaze was reasonably bestowed, as it helped her release all her feelings without revealing anything to him. From jesting, he turned to wisdom not because she reproached him, but through his own perception.",18.31,16.995,"Elinor could not prevent her gaze from fixing on him with all the contempt her eyes could convey, as she waited in silence and with a grave seriousness for this foolishness to end. Nevertheless, it was a very purposeful look, because it both relieved her own feelings and did not give him any material. Robert shifted from joking to seriousness, not because of Elinor's reproachful looks, but due to his own excitement.",16.567,14.931,"Elinor, meanwhile, waited in silence and with unshakable seriousness for the end of such nonsense, unable to prevent her eyes from fixing on him with a look that showed all the contempt he inspired in her. It was a look, however, very well directed, because it relieved her feelings without conveying anything to him. When he set aside his witty comments, it was not due to any reproach from her, but because of his own sensitivity.",28.845,27.854
1511,"""We may treat it as a joke,"" said he, at last, recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment—""but, upon my soul, it is a most serious business. Poor Edward! he is ruined for ever. I am extremely sorry for it—for I know him to be a very good–hearted creature; as well–meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world. You must not judge of him, Miss Dashwood, from YOUR slight acquaintance.—Poor Edward!—His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature.—But we are not all born, you know, with the same powers,—the same address.— Poor fellow!—to see him in a circle of strangers!—to be sure it was pitiable enough!—but upon my soul, I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life, as when it all burst forth. I could not believe it.— My mother was the first person who told me of it; and I, feeling myself called on to act with resolution, immediately said to her, 'My dear madam, I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself, I must say, that if Edward does marry this young woman, I never will see him again.' That was what I said immediately.— I was most uncommonly shocked, indeed!—Poor Edward!—he has done for himself completely—shut himself out for ever from all decent society!—but, as I directly said to my mother, I am not in the least surprised at it; from his style of education, it was always to be expected. My poor mother was half frantic.""","Finally, he stopped the laughter that had prolonged the excitement, and said: - We can consider this a joke, but deep down, to me, this is a serious matter. Poor Edward! He has been ruined for life. I feel very sorry for him because I know he has a very good nature; probably as well-intentioned as anyone in the world. Miss Dashwood, you should not judge him based on your brief acquaintance. Poor Edward! His behavior certainly does not lead to the best happiness according to common sense. But you see, we are not all born with the same talents, the same qualities. ""Poor guy! Seeing him among a crowd of strangers! It truly is pitiful! But deep down, I believe he has a heart as good as anyone in this kingdom; and I assure you my aunt has never been so shocked in her life, when the incident broke out. I can't believe it."" ""My mother was the first to tell me about this; and I, feeling the need to act decisively, immediately said to her: 'Dear mother, I am not sure what you intend to do about this, but as for me, I must say, if Edward has to marry this girl, I will never see him again.' I said it right away. I was truly shocked in the most extraordinary way! Poor Edward! - he brought it all upon himself - excluding himself from respectable associations! But as I immediately told my mother, I was not surprised at all; given his upbringing, this was bound to happen. My poor mother was almost driven mad.""",20.025,19.707,"""Just kidding,"" she finally said, recovering from her fake laughter that extended the unique joy of the moment considerably -""but it really is a very serious matter.

That's exactly what I said at that moment, -I was truly exceedingly surprised! -Poor Edward! -he has ruined himself forever! -he has deprived himself of all decent people! -but as I told my mother directly, it was not a surprise to me at all; it was expected from his style of upbringing. Poor mother almost lost herself.""",14.723,14.3,"—We can joke about it —he finally said, recovering from the affected laughter that had considerably prolonged the genuine joy of the moment—, but, upon my word, it is something very serious. Poor Edward! He is ruined forever. I regret it enormously, because I know he is a creature of very good heart, as well-intentioned as anyone. You must not judge him, Miss Dashwood, based on how little you know him. Poor Edward! It is true that his manners are not the most pleasant. But it is well known that not all of us are born with the same abilities, with the same bearing. Poor boy! Imagine him among strangers! What a lamentable thing! But upon my word, he has as great a heart as the best in the kingdom; and I tell you and assure you that nothing has ever shaken me as much as what has happened. I could not believe it. My mother was the first to tell me, and I, feeling that I had to act decisively, immediately said to her: “My dear lady, I do not know what you intend to do in these circumstances, but as for me, I must tell you that if Edward marries this young woman, I will never look at him again.” That is what I said to her immediately... I felt scandalized beyond all imagination! Poor Edward! He has completely sunk! He has forever marginalized himself from all decent society!

For the rest of his character and habits, they were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life. He was nice in his eating, uncertain in his hours; fond of his child, though affecting to slight it; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been devoted to business.

His demeanor towards her during these conversations, as well as other details, his cheerful nature revealed to her after only ten days of separation, his willingness to converse with her, and his respect for her opinions - all of these convinced Mrs. Jennings that he was in love with her.

But in truth, that thought never crossed her mind until Mrs. Jennings made her comment. However, she still believed that between the two of them, she was the better observer: she watched his eyes while Mrs. Jennings only considered his gestures.

But such a thought had never crossed her mind outside of Mrs. Jennings' insinuations; -while Mrs. Jennings only considered his behavior, she was watching his eyes; -his anxious, affectionate gaze in response to Marianne feeling the onset of a severe cold in her head and throat, because it was not expressed in words, completely escaped the lady's notice; but Elinor could see in those eyes the swift emotions and unnecessary anxiety of a lover.",12.452,11.878,"In those days, Elinor received news of Edward, or at least of some events related to his interests, through Colonel Brandon, who had recently been in Dorsetshire and who, addressing her at the same time as an unselfish friend of Mr. Ferrars and her gentle confidant, spoke to her at length about the rectory of Delaford, describing its deficiencies and—telling her what he planned to do to solve them. His behavior towards her in this, as in everything else; his sincere pleasure in seeing her after an absence of only ten days; his willingness to converse with her and his respect for her opinions, could well justify Mrs. Jennings's conviction that he was in love with her, and perhaps would have been enough for Elinor to suspect it too if she did not believe, as she had from the beginning, that Marianne remained his true preference.

Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne's complaint more serious than Elinor, now looked very grave on Mr. Harris's report, and confirming Charlotte's fears and caution, urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood. Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and within an hour after Mr. Harris's arrival, she set off, with her little boy and his nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer's, who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised, at her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her. Mrs. Jennings, however, with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her, declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring, by her own attentive care, to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate, desirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her better experience in nursing, of material use.","The man arrived, examined the patient, and reassured Elinor, making her believe that her sister would recover in just a few days.

From the beginning, Mrs. Jennings had taken Marianne's illness more seriously than Elinor, and now, showing great concern based on Mr. Harris's report, she agreed with Charlotte's fears and caution, advising the mother and daughter to leave immediately.

It was decided that Charlotte would leave; Mr. Harris had not been there for an hour when Charlotte set off with her young son and nanny to the house of a close relative of Mr. Palmer's, who lived a few miles beyond Bath; at her fervent insistence, her husband promised to join her within a day or two; she also almost equally insisted that her mother accompany her. However, Mrs. Jennings told Elinor with a kindness that truly endeared her to her that she would not move from Cleveland as long as Marianne was ill and would try to take her mother's place with her meticulous care; and Elinor found in her a willing and active helper who strove to share all her fatigue at every moment and often performed important tasks with her nursing experience.",18.254,17.909,"The apothecary arrived, examined the patient, and although he encouraged Miss Dashwood to trust that a few days would restore her sister's health, by declaring that her ailment had a putrid tendency and allowing his lips to pronounce the word ""infection,"" he instantly alarmed Mrs. Palmer, for her son. Mrs. Jennings, who from the beginning had believed the illness to be more serious than Elinor thought, listened gravely to Mr. Harris's report, and confirming Charlotte's fears and concerns, urged her to leave with her child; and Mr. Palmer, although he tried to dismiss her apprehensions as vain, found himself unable to resist his wife's enormous anxiety and persistence. It was then decided that they would leave; and less than an hour after Mr. Harris's arrival, she departed with her little boy and the nurse to the house of a close relative of Mr. Palmer, who lived a few miles past Bath; there, at her insistent pleas, her husband promised to join her in one or two days, and to that place her mother promised to accompany her, also obeying her entreaties. Mrs. Jennings, however, with a kindness that made Elinor truly appreciate her, was determined not to leave Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill, and to strive through her most attentive care to replace the mother from whom she had been separated; and at all times Elinor found in her an active and willing collaborator, eager to share all her efforts and, very often, of great help due to her greater experience in caring for the sick.",29.396,29.133
1537,"Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her malady, and feeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon. The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN really believed herself, that it would be a very short one.","Poor Marianne, exhausted and mentally devastated by the illness and overall weakness, no longer held hope that she would feel better the next day. The very thought of what the next day would bring only worsened her condition, because if not for the illness, they would have started their journey back home that day; and escorted by one of Mrs. Jennings' servants, the two sisters would have surprised their mother the following morning. The little she could say were complaints about this delay; even though Elinor tried to lift her sister's spirits and persuade her to believe, as she herself truly believed at that time, that it was only a short delay.",12.778,11.544,"The poor Marianne, who was weak and lifeless due to the natural effects of the illness and felt sick from head to toe, lost hope of recovery by the next day; the thought of what could have happened tomorrow if it weren't for this unfortunate illness made every symptom even more severe; because that day they were going to return home; one of Mrs. Jennings' servants would accompany them all the way, and the next day at noon they would surprise their mother. The few words she could utter expressed the sorrow she felt due to this inevitable delay; nevertheless, Elinor tried to cheer her up, attempting to make her believe, as she herself believed at that moment, that the delay would be very short.",14.748,13.746,"Poor Marianne, lifeless and dejected by the nature of her illness and feeling completely unwell, could no longer hope that she would recover the next day; and thinking about what would have happened the next day if not for her unfortunate illness, worsened her discomfort; because that day they were going to start their journey home and, accompanied all the way by one of Mrs. Jennings' servants, they would surprise their mother the next morning. The little she spoke was to lament this inevitable delay; and this despite Elinor's attempts to lift her spirits and make her believe, as she herself believed at that moment, that this delay would be very brief.",22.834,22.07
1538,"The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient; she certainly was not better, and, except that there was no amendment, did not appear worse. Their party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good–nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, Colonel Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going likewise.—Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister's account, would be to deprive them both, she thought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister, etc. she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings's entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence.","The next day did not show that the patient had made good progress; she certainly was not better, but did not seem worse either. The group of people now dwindled further; for Mr. Palmer, persuaded by Colonel Brandon, finally kept his promise to his wife, though he was reluctant to leave partly out of humanitarian and kind reasons, and partly because he did not want to appear afraid of his wife. While he was preparing, Colonel Brandon, through greater effort, also expressed a desire to leave. However, here Mrs. Jennings' kindness intervened and was most appreciated; for she thought that the Colonel leaving while his beloved was distressed by her sister's illness would leave both of them despondent, so she immediately told him that it was necessary for him to stay at Cleveland, that she needed him to play cards in the evening while Miss Dashwood was caring for her sister upstairs, and so on. She was so earnest that he agreed to fulfill the first wish of his heart, and thereafter did not want to appear hesitant; especially since Mr. Palmer enthusiastically supported Mrs. Jennings, as he felt relieved to leave behind someone so capable to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergency situation.",17.361,16.954,"The next day made almost no difference in the patient's condition; he was certainly no better, but apart from the lack of improvement, he didn't seem any worse either. Their groups had now become even smaller; Mr. Palmer, as much out of genuine humanity and benevolence as to avoid appearing afraid of his wife, finally joined the Colonel, though he did so quite reluctantly. Brandon was persuaded to go and keep the promise he made to his wife; as he prepared to leave, Colonel Brandon himself began to talk about leaving with much greater enthusiasm. -Here, alone, Mrs. Jennings' good-heartedness intervened in a very beneficial way; for she thought that sending the Colonel away while his lover was in so much distress because of her sister would deprive both of them of any comfort; therefore, she said it was essential for him to stay at Cleveland, that she wanted him to play piquet with her in the evening while Miss Dashwood was upstairs with her sister, and she insisted so much that the poor man, who wanted to accept more than anything, couldn't even pretend to hesitate; moreover, Mrs. Jennings' insistence was also strongly supported by Mr. Palmer, who wanted to leave someone behind who could help or advise Miss Dashwood in an emergency, thus putting his mind at ease.",15.587,15.117,"The next day brought little or no change in the patient's condition; she was evidently not better, and apart from the fact that there was no improvement, she did not seem to have worsened. The group had now reduced even further, for Mr. Palmer, though not very eager to leave, both out of humanitarian spirit and his good nature, as well as not wanting to appear intimidated by his wife, eventually let Colonel Brandon persuade him to follow her, as he had promised; and while he was preparing his departure, Colonel Brandon himself, making a much greater effort, also began to talk about leaving. At this point, however, Mrs. Jennings' kindness intervened in a very good way, for the colonel to leave while his beloved was suffering such distress on account of her sister would mean depriving them both of all comfort; and so, telling him without delay that his presence at Cleveland was necessary for her, that she needed him to play piquet with her in the afternoons while Miss Dashwood was upstairs with her sister, etc., she insisted so much that he stay, that he, in complying with what his heart desired in the first place, could not even pretend for long any hesitation about it, especially when Mrs. Jennings' pleas were warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed relieved to leave there someone so capable of supporting or advising Miss Dashwood in any emergency.",23.326,22.958
1539,"Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements. She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival. It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as it gave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name.","Of course, Marianne had no knowledge of these arrangements. She did not know that she was the reason for driving the owners of Cleveland away, about seven days after they arrived here. She was not surprised when she did not see anything belonging to Mrs. Palmer; and since this did not concern her, she never mentioned the host's name.",25.353,24.066,"Of course, Marianne was not informed about these arrangements. She did not know that Cleveland's owners had to leave their home seven days after their arrival. Not seeing Mrs. Palmer did not surprise her; moreover, it did not worry her, so she did not mention her name.",12.36,9.955,"Marianne, of course, was kept unaware of all these arrangements. She did not know that she had been the cause of the owners of Cleveland having to leave their house within a week of arriving.

1540,"Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure, and her situation continued, with little variation, the same. Mr. Harris, who attended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others was by no means so cheerful. Mrs. Jennings had determined very early in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel Brandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's forebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence. He tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each day in which he was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.","Two days after Mr. Palmer left, Marianne's condition remained almost unchanged. Mr. Harris came to care for her every day, still bravely speaking of a quick recovery, and Mrs. Dashwood was equally optimistic; but the others were not as encouraged. At first, Mrs. Jennings had determined that Marianne was unlikely to survive. Colonel Brandon always listened and could not resist the influence of her premonitions. He tried to reason from the fear that the apothecary seemed to find unreasonable; but many hours each day passed with him left entirely alone, making it easier for him to accept gloomy thoughts, and he could not rid his mind of the idea that he might never see her again.",17.695,17.118,"Two days had passed since Mr. Palmer's departure, and the situation continued with small changes. Mr. Harris, who came every day, still spoke of a rapid recovery; Miss Dashwood was equally optimistic; but the expectations of the others were not so bright. Mrs. Jennings had decided at the very beginning of the illness that Marianne would not overcome it, and Colonel Brandon, whose main benefit was listening to Mrs. Jennings' premonitions, was not in a state of mind to resist the impact of what he heard. He tried to dispel his fears by using his reason, because the doctor's different assessment rendered them unnecessary; but the long hours he spent completely alone every day were very conducive to the acceptance of melancholy thoughts, and at those times he could not rid his mind of the belief that he would no longer see Marianne.",27.575,27.095,"Two days had passed since Mr. Palmer's departure, and the patient's condition remained the same, with very few changes. Mr. Harris, who visited her every day, quite boldly continued to speak of a rapid recovery, and Miss Dashwood was equally optimistic; but the others did not have such cheerful expectations. Very early in the attack, Mrs. Jennings had decided that Marianne would never recover; and Colonel Brandon, whose main service was to listen to Mrs. Jennings' predictions, was not in a state of mind capable of resisting her influence. He tried to resort to reason to overcome fears that the differing opinion of the apothecary made seem absurd; but the many hours he spent alone each day were too conducive to nurturing sad thoughts, and he could not erase from his mind the conviction that he would not see Marianne alive again.",32.098,31.674
1541,"On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of both were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared his patient materially better. Her pulse was much stronger, and every symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit. Elinor, confirmed in every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her letters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend's, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel.","However, on the morning of the third day, the pessimistic predictions proved to be incorrect, because when Mr. Harris arrived, he informed that the patient had significantly improved. Her pulse was much stronger; all symptoms were better than during the previous visit. Elinor was very encouraged after her hopes were confirmed, happily thinking back that in the letters to her mother, she had presented her own judgment instead of her friend's, to ease the news of their late return, and now she could almost determine the time when Marianne would be strong enough to travel.",32.358,31.662,"However, on the morning of the third day, the gloomy expectations of both almost became invalid; when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared that the patient was much better. Her pulse was much stronger; all findings were much better than his previous visit.

She was happy because, in her letters to her mother, she had relied on her own judgment rather than that of her friends, and had downplayed the indisposition that had delayed their departure from Cleveland, and she almost dared to set the date when Marianne could travel.",35.641,35.049
1542,"But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.— Towards the evening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and uncomfortable than before. Her sister, however, still sanguine, was willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully administering the cordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into a slumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects. Her sleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a considerable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself, she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it. Mrs. Jennings, knowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed; her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained alone with Marianne.","But this day ended not as promisingly as it began. In the evening, Marianne's illness worsened again, becoming more severe, restless, and uncomfortable than before. Nevertheless, her sister remained optimistic, believing that Marianne was merely fatigued from having to sit up while the servants made the bed, carefully giving her a heart tonic, and feeling satisfied to see her sister drift into a sleep that she thought would yield good results. Marianne slept quite a bit, though not as soundly as Elinor had hoped. Anxious to see the outcome of her sister's sleep for herself, Elinor stayed by her side. Mrs. Jennings went to bed earlier than usual, unaware of the patient's condition; the maid, one of the main caregivers, was relaxing in the housekeeper's room, leaving Elinor alone with Marianne.",16.432,15.793,"But the day didn't end as brightly as it started. Towards the evening, Marianne fell ill again, in a state more severe, more uncomfortable, and more restless than before. Although her sister remained optimistic, she was inclined to attribute the change to the fatigue from staying up while waiting for the bed to be made; she carefully administered the syrups prescribed and was pleased to see Marianne finally fall into a deep sleep; she expected positive effects from the sleep. Although her sleep was not as calm as Elinor had hoped, it lasted for quite a while; Elinor decided to stay by her side the entire time to personally observe the outcome of the sleep.

To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its performance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by her sister, she hastened down to the drawing–room, where she knew he was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.","Elinor was horrified to realize that her sister was no longer conscious, and she checked her pulse while trying to comfort her.

1551,"Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her mother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief, fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.","Marianne's thoughts occasionally wandered disjointedly around her mother, and every time her sister mentioned her name, it caused Elinor's poor heart to ache. The elder sister blamed herself for having disregarded her sister's illness for many days, now miserably awaiting an urgent remedy, imagining that every solution had been delayed for too long, thinking of the scene where the sorrowful mother arrived too late to see her beloved daughter's face, or unable to see the reason in her.",16.687,15.399,"Marianne's mind was still intermittently and incoherently fixed on her mother; whenever she mentioned her name, a pang struck Elinor's heart for having taken lightly all those days spent in illness, and she immediately scrambled to find a remedy, fearing that soon all remedies would be in vain, that everything had been delayed too long, and that it might be too late for her suffering mother to see her beloved child or to see her in a sound state of mind.",25.608,24.648,"At intervals, Marianne's thoughts remained incoherently fixed on her mother, and each time she mentioned her name, poor Elinor's heart suffered a pang of pain; she reproached herself for having taken so many days of illness lightly, and longing for immediate relief, she thought that soon all relief would be in vain, that everything had been delayed too much, and she imagined her afflicted mother arriving too late to see her precious daughter alive or in possession of her senses.",30.369,29.484
1552,"She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if HE could not come, for some other advice, when the former—but not till after five o'clock—arrived. His opinion, however, made some little amends for his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger to be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was communicated to Elinor. He promised to call again in the course of three or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them.","When she was about to send someone to call Mr. Harris again, or if he couldn't come, to call someone else, he arrived - but they had to wait until five in the morning. However, his opinion did not make up for the delay, because although he acknowledged that the patient's condition had unexpectedly changed for the worse, he still believed there was nothing dangerous, and spoke about the effectiveness that the new treatment plan would bring, with a confidence that somewhat influenced Elinor. He promised to return within three or four hours, then left with both the patient and the caregiver feeling more reassured than before he came.",16.557,15.679,"He was about to call Mr. Harris again, or someone else if he couldn't come, when Mr. Harris arrived - but after five o'clock. However, his views somewhat compensated for his lateness, because although he admitted that there was an unexpected and undesirable change in the patient, he did not consider the danger to be significant and spoke encouragingly of the improvement that the new treatment should bring, some of which courage passed on to Elinor. Mr. Harris promised to visit again in three or four hours and left both the patient and the anxious caregiver in a calmer state than he had found them.",19.224,18.361,"He was about to send for Mr. Harris again or, if he could not come, seek new advice, when the apothecary —but not before five— made his appearance.

1553,"With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed. Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her no doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor, her conviction of her sister's danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope. Her heart was really grieved. The rapid decay, the early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have struck a less interested person with concern. On Mrs. Jennings's compassion she had other claims. She had been for three months her companion, was still under her care, and she was known to have been greatly injured, and long unhappy. The distress of her sister too, particularly a favourite, was before her;—and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere.","The next morning, Mrs. Jennings heard about what had happened during the night with extreme concern, and with reproach for not having called her. Her previous worries, now reinforced by more solid reasoning, left her in no doubt about the outcome; and although she tried to comfort Elinor, and she believed her sister was in danger, she could not find comfort in hope. Her heart was truly in anguish. The rapid decline, the death of such a young girl, a beautiful girl like Marianne, must have struck deeply into the mind of even someone less concerned. For Mrs. Jennings, it was even more so. She had been her companion for three months, was still under her guardianship, and had suffered severe emotional distress, grieving for a long time. Present before her was also the sorrow of her sister, whom she particularly cherished; - and regarding the mother of the two girls, when Mrs. Jennings considered what Marianne meant to her friend as Charlotte meant to her, her sympathy for the younger sister's suffering was very genuine.",18.743,18.136,"Mrs. Jennings learned about what had happened the next morning with great concern and considerable reproach for not being called for help. Her old fears, which had returned for a more justified reason, left no doubt in her mind about the event; -although she tried to say comforting words to Elinor, her belief that her sister was in danger did not allow her to speak hopefully. Her heart was bleeding. The rapid decline and early death of a young, beautiful girl like Marianne would sadden even a more indifferent person. It had other effects on Mrs. Jennings' conscience. She had been her companion for three months, she was still entrusted to her, it was known that she had suffered a severe wound and had been unhappy for a long time. The sorrow of her sister, for whom she had a separate affection, was also before her eyes; -as for their mother; Mrs. Jennings thought that Marianne was to her mother what Charlotte was to her, and she felt the mothers' anguish in her heart.",17.486,16.724,"Mrs. Jennings learned of what had happened in the morning, showing great concern and reproaching them for not having called her to help. Her old fears, now revived with much better basis, left her in no doubt about what had occurred; and although she tried to console Elinor, her certainty about the danger her sister was in did not allow her to offer the comfort of hope. Her heart was truly heavy. The rapid decline, the early death of such a young, so adorable girl as Marianne, could have affected even a less close person. But Marianne could expect more from Mrs. Jennings' compassion. For three months she had kept her company, she was still under her care, and it was known that she had been deeply hurt and had suffered for a long time. She also saw the anguish of the sister, who was especially her favorite; and as for her mother, when Mrs. Jennings thought that Marianne would probably be to her what Charlotte was to herself, she felt genuine compassion for her sufferings.",28.91,28.476
1554,"Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;—but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce. His medicines had failed;—the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more quiet—not more herself—remained in a heavy stupor. Elinor, catching all, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in further advice. But he judged it unnecessary: he had still something more to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was as confident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood. She was calm, except when she thought of her mother; but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued till noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed, her thoughts wandering from one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne's disappointment had brought on. Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it gave fresh misery to her reflections.","Mr. Harris arrived on time the next time; - but he came to be disappointed with the recent treatment plan. His medication had not been effective; - the fever had not subsided; and Marianne was only more silent - no longer herself - still in a heavy stupor. Elinor had grasped everything, and more than everything, his fear in that moment, and suggested calling someone else. But he deemed it unnecessary; he still had another method to try, which he was as confident in as the previous one that it would succeed. His visit ended with reassurances that only reached her ears, but could not touch the heart of Miss Dashwood. She was calm, except when she thought of her mother; but she was nearly hopeless. She remained in that state until noon, hardly moving from her sister's bed. Her thoughts wandered from one image of sorrow, one suffering friend to another. Her spirit was utterly crushed by Mrs. Jennings' conversation, as she did not hesitate to assume that this dangerous illness was the result of the despair Marianne had endured weeks before. Elinor found all of Mrs. Jennings' reasoning plausible, and this added further distress to her thoughts.",27.138,26.774,"Mr. Harris was punctual on his second visit; -but he was disappointed by the hopes that the last visit had created. The medicines had not worked; -the fever had not subsided; Marianne was only calmer -not more herself -and was in a deep faint. Elinor, realizing all the doctor's fears and more in an instant, suggested consulting others. But the doctor found this unnecessary; he still had some things to try, some new applications, of which he was as confident as the last, and his visit ended with encouraging words that reached Miss Dashwood's ears but not her heart. Except for when she thought of her mother, she was calm, but equally hopeless; she continued in this state until noon, not moving from her sister's side for a moment, her thoughts shifting from one painful image to another, from one grieving friend to another; Mrs. Jennings' talks, attributing the severity and danger of this crisis to Marianne's disappointment and weeks of sorrow, further darkened her spirits. Elinor felt that this idea was correct and a new worry was added to her thoughts.",22.066,21.626,"Mr. Harris was punctual on his second visit, but the hopes he had placed in the effects of the previous one were frustrated. His medications had failed; the fever had not been conquered; and Marianne, only more tranquil —not more in control of herself— remained in a dense stupor. Elinor, capturing all, and more than all her fears in a single instant, proposed seeking further advice. But he deemed it unnecessary; he still had something more to try, a new prescription in which he had as much confidence as in the last one, and his visit concluded with encouraging words of assurance that reached Miss Dashwood's ears but did not manage to reach her heart. Though she remained calm, except when she thought of her mother, she had almost lost hope; and in this state she continued until midday, barely moving from her sister's side, her mind jumping from one image of pain to another, from one distressed friend to another, her spirit utterly dejected by Mrs. Jennings' conversation, who had no qualms about attributing the severity and danger of this disorder to the many weeks Marianne had previously been indisposed due to her disappointment. Elinor felt how reasonable that idea was, and it added a new pain to her reflections.",28.986,28.622
1555,"About noon, however, she began—but with a caution—a dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her friend—to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her sister's pulse;—she waited, watched, and examined it again and again;—and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate her hopes. Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;—and Elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope. But it was too late. Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter, she bent over her sister to watch—she hardly knew for what. Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her. Others even arose to confirm it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her with a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock;—when his assurances, his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.","However, around noon she began - but with caution, terrified of the disappointment that had kept her silent for a while, even towards her - she imagined, hoped to recognize a slight recovery in her sister's pulse. She waited, watched, and then checked her sister's pulse again. Finally, through the barely concealed fluctuations beneath her calm exterior, she expressed her hope. Mrs. Jennings also examined, and though forced to acknowledge a temporary recovery, still tried to advise the young girl not to indulge in the thought that the recovery would continue. Reflecting on all of Mrs. Jennings' directives to be suspicious, Elinor also told herself not to hope. But it was too late. Hope had already crept into her mind; and feeling every anxious tremor, she bent over her sister to observe - she didn't know what she was supposed to observe. Another half hour passed, and the positive symptoms now made her happy. Others came to confirm. The signs of recovery through her sister's breathing, skin color, and lips all made Elinor happy. Then Marianne stared at her intently, alert though still tired. Anxiety and hope now weighed equally, not giving her a moment's peace until Mr. Harris returned at four o'clock. His reassurances, his congratulations on her sister's recovery exceeding his expectations, all gave her confidence, peace of mind, and tears of joy.",22.056,21.69,"Nevertheless, towards noon, she began to imagine and hope that she would find a slight change in her sister's pulse -cautiously -fearing disappointment, so much so that she remained silent even to her friend for a while; -she waited, watched, and looked again and again; -finally, with an excitement that was harder to conceal under her outward calm than all her previous anxieties, she attempted to express her hopes. Although Mrs. Jennings, upon examining the patient, admitted there was a temporary improvement, she tried to prevent her young friend from getting carried away with the thought that it would continue; -Elinor, who took every kind of warning seriously, also told herself not to get her hopes up in the same way. But it was already too late. Hope had once been born; feeling all its insistent flutterings, she leaned over her sister to watch her -without knowing what she hoped to see. Half an hour passed, the positive sign was still there. Other signs emerged to strengthen it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, all gave Elinor joy with signs of improvement, and Marianne fixed her eyes on her with a look that, though weary, was aware. Then anxiety and hope made her equally tense, giving her no comfort for even a moment, until Mr. Harris arrived at four o'clock; -Mr. Harris gave her courage and peace by saying that her sister's signs of recovery exceeded his expectations, leaving her in tears of joy.",24.294,23.963,"Around noon, however, she began —though with a caution, a fear of false hope that kept her silent for a while, even in front of her friend— to imagine, to hope that she was perceiving a slight improvement in her sister's pulse; she waited, watched, examined it over and over again; and finally, with an agitation more difficult to hide under a calm exterior than all her previous anguish, she dared to communicate her hopes.

But have I ever known it?—Well may it be doubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity, to avarice?—or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?— But I have done it. To avoid a comparative poverty, which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence, lost every thing that could make it a blessing.""","He answered: - I ask you to listen to the whole story. My estate is not large, and I have always spent a lot - always having the habit of associating with people who have higher incomes than myself. From the time I reached adulthood or even before, each year I fell further into debt. Although when Mrs. Smith passes away I will be able to pay off all my debts, even this is uncertain and perhaps far off, so for a long time I have intended to restore my situation by marrying a woman with a considerable fortune. Therefore, I did not think of becoming attached to your sister; and through base, selfish, cruel means - I acted in such a way - to win her affections without any thought of reciprocating. All the indignation, contempt, even from you, Miss Dashwood, no matter how much you may reproach me, is not enough. ""But one thing can be said about me: even in the dreadful state of such selfish vanity, I did not foresee the extent of the pain I caused, because at that time I did not know what love was like. But did I realize anything?

Since I came of age, and even before that, my debts increased every year; I would have been freed by the death of my elderly cousin Mrs. Smith, but since that event was uncertain and quite distant, I had been thinking for some time of improving my situation by marrying a wealthy woman. Becoming attached to your sister, therefore, was not something to be considered; -and it was vile, selfish, cruel -so much so that no scornful, no contemptuous look, not even yours Miss Dashwood, can condemn it enough -I was behaving in this way, trying to win her love, without even thinking of reciprocating. But even in that terrible state of selfish arrogance, the only thing that can be said for me is that I did not know the extent of the suffering I was causing, because I did not know what love was at that time. Have I ever known love? -This can be doubted; for if I had truly loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to pride and greed? -even more, could I have sacrificed her feelings? -But I did. By stepping into wealth to escape a poorer life that her love and companionship would have freed from all fears, I lost everything that could have turned that life into a paradise.""",26.677,26.398,"—I insist that you listen to everything —he replied—. I was never the owner of a great fortune and I have always had expensive tastes, I have always associated with people of higher incomes than mine. Since my coming of age, or even before, I believe, year after year my debts have increased; and although the death of my elderly cousin, Mrs. Smith, would free me from them, given that it is an uncertain and possibly very distant event, for some time I had intended to rebuild my situation through marriage to a wealthy woman. A relationship with your sister was, therefore, unthinkable; and thus I found myself acting with a baseness, selfishness, and cruelty that no look of indignation or contempt, not even yours, Miss Dashwood, could sufficiently censure, and always with the purpose of winning her affection, without any intention of reciprocating it. But there is one thing that can be said in my favor, even in that horrendous state of selfish vanity, and that is that I did not know the depth of the harm I was plotting, because at that time I did not know what it was to love. But, have I ever known it? It can well be doubted, for if I had truly loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity, to greed? Or, worse still, could I have sacrificed hers? But I have done so. To avoid a relative poverty, which her affection and company would have stripped of all its horrors, I have lost, by elevating myself to a position of fortune, everything that would have made it a blessing.",31.836,31.581

Preparations! Date! To speak sincerely, I needed her money, and in a situation like mine, I had to do anything to avoid a breakup. And after all, what importance could Mariani and her friends' opinion of my character have, the language in which my response was formulated? It had to serve a single purpose. I had to show myself as a villain, and it didn't matter whether I did it with a bow or bravado. “My reputation with them is ruined forever,” I told myself; “I am forever banished from their side; they already believe me to be a man without principles, this letter will merely make them think of me as a scoundrel.” Such were my thoughts while, in a kind of desperate indifference, I copied my wife's words and parted with the last relics of Marianne.

The world had made him extravagant and vain—Extravagance and vanity had made him cold–hearted and selfish. Vanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another, had involved him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed. Each faulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led him likewise to punishment. The attachment, from which against honour, against feeling, against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself, now, when no longer allowable, governed every thought; and the connection, for the sake of which he had, with little scruple, left her sister to misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature.

The world has made you into an arrogant and frivolous person, and then arrogance and frivolity have made you callous and selfish. Frivolity, in its quest for victory at the expense of others, has drawn you into a genuine attachment; but arrogance has demanded the sacrifice of this attachment.

The world had made him extravagant and fond of ostentation - Extravagance and pride had made him cold-hearted and selfish. Pride, which sought to declare its own guilty victory by destroying other qualities, had led him to a true companionship, which then required the sacrifice of extravagance or the need born of extravagance. Every flawed desire that led him to a bad end had also led him to punishment in the same way.

1652,"Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his faults, excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family, with a tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she soon acknowledged within herself—to his wishes than to his merits. She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction, that open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to possess; and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not even innocent to indulge. But she felt that it was so, long, long before she could feel his influence less.","Willoughby - the person whom she had despised as the most villainous just half an hour ago - Willoughby, despite his faults, had aroused compassion for the sufferings caused by those faults. This made her soon realize in her heart that she thought of him - as someone her family had completely rejected from now on - with affection and regret, according to his wishes rather than his dignity. She felt his influence on her mind growing stronger due to circumstances that should have had no reason to affect her; due to that extraordinarily attractive person - whose open, affectionate, and lively manner did not align with the value of this person; due to the love for Marianne that remained passionate while this person was no longer carefree to indulge.

She felt that the emotion he left on her was heightened due to circumstances that should not have been impressive; -that extraordinary physical charm which could not be counted as a virtue, those open, emotional, cheerful manners, and that still passionate love he felt for Marianne, which was too innocent to even dwell upon.

She felt that his influence over her was increased by circumstances that reasonably should not have mattered: by the uncommon attractiveness of his appearance; by his frank, affectionate, and lively manners, which there is no merit in possessing; and by that still fervent love for Marianne, in which she was not even innocent to take pleasure.

The past, the present, the future, Willoughby's visit, Marianne's safety, and her mother's expected arrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue, and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister.

She was supported into the drawing–room between her daughter and her friend;—and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable to speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look which spoke at once her gratitude, and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment. He shared it, however, in a silence even greater than her own.","Mrs. Dashwood was horrified as she approached the place, almost believing that Marianne was no more, and now could not find her voice to inquire about her younger daughter, nor could she speak to Elinor. But she did not wait for a greeting or question, immediately delivering the good news. The mother received the news with all the usual warmth, in a moment filled with joy, just as she had previously been filled with worry. She was guided into the family room by her daughter and her daughter's friend; and here, wiping away tears of joy though still unable to speak, she embraced Elinor with fervent kisses, occasionally turning to grasp Colonel Brandon's hand, her eyes expressing gratitude and the belief that he shared in her present happiness. However, he shared it in a less demonstrative manner than she did.",15.19,14.298,"As they approached the house, the horror Mrs. Dashwood felt had almost convinced her that Marianne was no longer alive; she was in no state to ask how she was; she was in no state to speak with Elinor; but Elinor, who neither expected a greeting nor a question, immediately gave her the happy news; -her mother, who clung to the news with all her usual fervor, was on the verge of collapsing from fear until that moment, and then collapsed from happiness. She was taken to the sitting room between the support of her daughter and her friend; -there, though still unable to speak, she repeatedly embraced Elinor with tears of joy, occasionally turning to shake Colonel Brandon's hand, expressing both her gratitude and her belief that he shared in her current happiness with her glances.

1655,"As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was her first desire; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger. Elinor's delight, as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;—but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, when the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing her mother was near her, and conscious of being too weak for conversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her. Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night; and Elinor, in compliance with her mother's entreaty, went to bed. But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by irritation of spirits. Willoughby, ""poor Willoughby,"" as she now allowed herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world, and now blamed, now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before. But her promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful. She dreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower. Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival's, the reward of her sister was due, and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby's death.","As soon as Mrs. Dashwood regained her composure, her first desire was to go see Marianne. Within two minutes, she was beside her beloved daughter - even more beloved now due to separation, suffering, and danger. Observing the emotions of the two, Elinor's joy was only tempered by the worry that Marianne might not be able to sleep again; but Mrs. Dashwood could remain calm, even cautious, when the life of a child was at stake; and Marianne felt content with her mother beside her and was too weak to converse, following everyone's advice to stay calm and silent. Mrs. Dashwood would sit by her all night; and Elinor, heeding her mother's plea, went to rest. But even after a completely sleepless night and many hours of the most exhausting anxiety, she could not rest, but was mentally agitated. Willoughby, ""poor Willoughby"" as she now allowed herself to call him, was always present in her mind; she only heard him justifying himself to the world, sometimes blaming herself, sometimes forgiving herself, for having judged him too harshly. But the promise to tell her sister was always painful. She was afraid of doing this, afraid of the impact on Marianne; wondering if, after hearing such an explanation, her sister could ever be happy with someone else; and for a moment she wished Willoughby would become a widower. Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, she blamed herself, thinking that his sufferings and his steadfastness far surpassed those of his rival, and deserved to be rewarded by her sister, then she wished for everything except the death of Mrs. Willoughby.",28.808,28.549,"As soon as Mrs. Dashwood came to her senses, her first desire was to see Marianne; within two minutes, she was reunited with her beloved child, to whom she was now more attached than ever due to her absence, unhappiness, and illness. Elinor's happiness at seeing their emotions upon meeting was only diminished by the thought that this reunion might prevent Marianne from sleeping more; but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm and even sensible when her child's life was in danger; Marianne, pleased to know her mother was by her side, aware that she was too exhausted to speak, willingly surrendered herself to the silence and calm that every nurse around her demanded. Mrs. Dashwood would sit by her side all night; Elinor, complying with her mother's wish, went to bed. But the rest necessitated by a completely sleepless night and hours filled with exhausting anxiety was impossible because her mind was still active. Willoughby, now she called him ""poor Willoughby,"" was constantly on her mind; his attempts to defend himself still echoed in her ears, and she felt guilty for having judged him so harshly before; she felt justified. But the promise she had made to tell her sister about it was equally painful. She was afraid to tell, afraid of the possible effects on Marianne; she doubted whether Marianne could ever be happy with someone else after such an explanation and for a moment wished that Willoughby would remain a widower. Then Colonel Brandon came to her mind, and she felt ashamed, feeling that her sister's reward should be for his sufferings and loyalty, not for his rival's, and she thought, let Mrs. Willoughby live, whatever happens.",24.579,24.279,"As soon as Mrs. Dashwood recovered, her first desire was to see Marianne; and within two minutes she was beside her beloved child, whom absence, unhappiness, and danger had made even dearer. Elinor's pleasure in seeing what each of them felt upon meeting was only restrained by the fear of robbing Marianne of hours of sleep; but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, she could even be prudent when it came to the life of a daughter; and Marianne, content to know that her mother was by her side and aware of being too weak to converse, quickly submitted to the silence and stillness ordered by all who cared for her. Mrs. Dashwood insisted on watching over her sleep throughout the night, and Elinor, obeying her mother's pleas, went to bed. But the rest, which a whole night without sleep and so many hours of the most overwhelming anxiety seemed to make so necessary, was hindered by the excitement of her mind. Willoughby, ""poor Willoughby,"" as she now allowed herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; he could not but have listened. to his justification before the world, and sometimes she blamed herself, sometimes she absolved herself for having judged him so harshly before. But her promise to tell her sister about it was invariably painful to her. She feared doing so, feared the effects it might have on Marianne; she doubted whether, after such an explanation, Marianne could ever be happy with another person; and for a few moments she wished that Willoughby would become a widower; then, remembering Colonel Brandon, she reproached herself, feeling that his sufferings and his constancy, much more than those of his rival, deserved to have Marianne as a reward, and wished for anything to happen except the death of Mrs. Willoughby.",36.408,36.197
1656,"The shock of Colonel Brandon's errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne, that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further intelligence, and had so far settled her journey before his arrival, that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away, as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection.","The prior warnings from her had helped Mrs. Dashwood to be less shocked when Colonel Brandon arrived at Barton, because she was so worried about Marianne that she decided to go to Cleveland on the same day without waiting for further news.

1657,"Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood's looks and spirits proved her to be, as she repeatedly declared herself, one of the happiest women in the world. Elinor could not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward. But Mrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her, was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it. Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which, as she now began to feel, her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her;—and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor. It was thus imparted to her, as soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred.","Marianne continues to recover daily. The bright eyes and cheerful spirit of Mrs. Daswood indicate, as she often declares, that she is one of the happiest women in the world. Elinor cannot hear the declaration, or the evidence of the declaration, without sometimes wondering if she still remembers anything about Edward. But even if she believes in what Elinor tells her to some extent about her own disappointment, she is still so drawn into her own joy that she only thinks about what adds to her happiness. Now, she begins to think that her previous misjudgment, in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby, had placed her daughter in an unfavorable situation. While Marianne recovers, she has an additional source of joy that Elinor does not think of. As soon as they had a moment alone, the mother told her:",20.155,19.576,"Marianne continued to recover every day; the radiant cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood's appearance and movements, as she often said, showed that she was one of the happiest women in the world. While Elinor listened to her mother's words or watched her movements, she occasionally couldn't help but wonder if her mother remembered Edward. But trusting in the mild explanation Elinor had given about her disappointment, Mrs. Dashwood was carried away by her exuberant cheerfulness, thinking of nothing but things that would further increase her joy. Marianne had escaped a great danger, and now Mrs. Dashwood was beginning to feel that she had a share in that danger because she had made the mistake of encouraging Marianne in her unfortunate relationship with Willoughby; -and now, as Marianne was recovering, she found another source of joy that hadn't even crossed Elinor's mind. She explained this to Elinor the first chance they got to be alone.",16.397,15.695,"Marianne continued to recover day by day, and the radiant joy on Mrs. Dashwood's face and in her demeanor testified that she was, as she repeatedly confessed, one of the happiest women in the world.

But Mrs. Dashwood, trusting in the moderate account of her disappointments that Elinor had conveyed to her, allowed the exuberance of her joy to lead her to think only of what could increase it. Marianne had been returned to her after a danger in which—so she had begun to feel—she herself, with her own erroneous judgment, had contributed to place her, as she had encouraged her unfortunate affection for Willoughby; and in her recovery, she had yet another reason for joy, one which Elinor had not considered.

When helping her sister down from the carriage and seeing Marianne crying, she only recognized a very natural emotion and felt nothing heavier than compassion. Such a reaction, which did not disturb anyone, deserved praise.

She spoke little, but every word aimed at cheerfulness, and though she sometimes sighed, there was always a smile to soften it.

In all her subsequent behavior, she saw the traces of a mind determined to make a reasonable effort, for as soon as they entered their sitting room, Marianne surveyed it with a determined and firm look, as if resolved to immediately get accustomed to the sight of every object that could be associated with the memory of Willoughby.

Long before I had recovered enough to speak, I could perfectly well reflect. I weighed the past: all I saw in my own behavior, from the beginning of our relationship with him last autumn, was a series of imprudences against myself and a lack of kindness towards others. I saw that my own feelings had paved the way for my sufferings and that my lack of strength in pain had almost brought me to the grave. I was aware that I myself had been the cause of my illness by neglecting my own health in a way that even at that time I felt was wrong. If I had died, it would have been self-destruction. I did not know the danger I had put myself in until that danger had passed; but with feelings like those to which these reflections gave rise, I am surprised I recovered; I am astonished that the very intensity of my desire to live, to have time for atonement before my God and before all of you, did not kill me immediately. If I had died, in what singular anguish would I have left you, my caregiver, my friend, my sister! You, who had seen all the irritable selfishness of my last days; who had known all the secrets of my heart! How would I have lingered in your memories! And my mother, too! How could you have consoled her! I cannot put into words how much I hated myself. Every time I looked back at the past, I saw a duty I had neglected or some fault I had overlooked. It seemed I had caused harm to everyone. To Mrs. Jennings' kindness, to her uninterrupted kindness, I had responded with ungrateful disdain. With the Middletons, with the Palmers, with the Steeles, even with the most ordinary acquaintances, I had been insolent and unjust; my heart had remained insensitive to their merits and my temper irritated by their very attentions. To John, to Fanny (yes, even to them, though they deserve little), I had given less than what was due to them. But to you, to you above all, above my mother, I had offended. I, only I, knew your heart and its sorrows; and yet, how did it influence me? Not in making me more compassionate, benefiting either you or myself. I had your example before me; but, what good did it do me? Was I more considerate of you and your well-being? Did I imitate the way you restrained yourself or ease your burdens by taking on some of the general deference or personal gratitude that had until then fallen entirely on you? No; when I knew you were unhappy no less than when I believed you to be at peace, I left unfulfilled all that duty or friendship demanded of me; I barely admitted that pain existed except in myself, and I only wept for that heart that had abandoned and wronged me, letting you, whom I professed to love without limits, suffer because of me.",31.887,31.755

But does it follow that had he married you, he would have been happy?—The inconveniences would have been different. He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they are removed, he now reckons as nothing.

But can it be inferred from this that if he had married you, he would be happy? The difficulties would be of a different nature. At that time, he would suffer from the poverty that he now sees as nothing because he has escaped it. He would have a wife whose temperament he could not complain about, but he would always be distressed - always poor.

But does this mean he would have been happy if he had married you? -The discomforts would just be different. Then he would have suffered from financial difficulties, but now that he doesn't have financial difficulties, he acts as if it's not important.

And, why does he regret it? Because he has discovered that it did not serve him. It has not made him happy.

But, does it follow from that that if he had married you he would be happy? The difficulties would have been different. He would have suffered from the financial worries that, now that he does not have them, have lost importance for him. He would have had a wife whose character he could not have complained about, but he would have always lived in need, always poor; and probably very soon he would have learned to value much more the countless comforts that a debt-free estate and a good income provide, even for domestic happiness, than the simple character of a wife.",28.257,27.776

1759,"When the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence. Mrs. Dashwood feared to hazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation. She now found that she had erred in relying on Elinor's representation of herself; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness, suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne. She found that she had been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of her daughter, to think the attachment, which once she had so well understood, much slighter in reality, than she had been wont to believe, or than it was now proved to be. She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her Elinor;—that Marianne's affliction, because more acknowledged, more immediately before her, had too much engrossed her tenderness, and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much, certainly with less self–provocation, and greater fortitude.","When the servants brought out dessert and wine, Mrs. Daswood and Elinor requested to be left alone, so for a while, both were immersed in their own silent thoughts. Mrs. Daswood, afraid of making any careless remarks, did not dare to offer words of comfort. Now she realized that she had been mistaken in relying on Elinor's account of her situation; and rightly concluded that everything had been softened at that time to prevent her from feeling more sorrow, to avoid the suffering she had endured because of Marianne. She felt that she had been deceived by her daughter's considerate and attentive demeanor. From that point on, she thought the bond, which at times she understood clearly, was not actually deeper than she wanted to believe, or more than what she now expressed. She feared that by the way she had trusted before, she had become unfair, indifferent - no - almost harsh towards Elinor.

She saw that she had been misled into thinking that the relationship she once understood so well was in reality much weaker than she wanted to believe or than it now appeared, by her daughter's careful, meticulous attention. She feared that in this belief she had acted unfairly, carelessly, even rudely towards Elinor; that Marianne's troubles, being more spoken of and more apparent, had received much of her compassion, and that she had forgotten that in Elinor she had a daughter who suffered just as much but was less demonstrative and much more composed.",17.323,16.785,"When they were brought dessert and wine and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left alone, they remained together for a long time in similar meditations and identical silence.

1790,"How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however, how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he expressed himself, and how he was received, need not be particularly told.

His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful. He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and raise his spirits. He was released without any reproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;—and elevated at once to that security with another, which he must have thought of almost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire. He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to happiness;—and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine, flowing, grateful cheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed in him before.","However, there is no need to recount how long it took him to reach a true resolution, how long it took for him to have the opportunity to act, how he revealed his intentions, and how he was responded to. It can simply be said like this: when they sat down for dinner at four o'clock, three hours after he arrived, he had been accepted by her, approved by her mother; and was immersed in the passionate revelations not only of a person in love, but also of the happiest man among all men, in the reality of reason and truth. His joy exceeded the usual limits. What he had achieved was more than the usual triumph of a love accepted to fill his heart and elevate his spirit. He was also liberated without any self-reproach, freed from the entanglement that had long tormented him, freed from the woman he had not loved for a long time - and then elevated to a stable state with another person, whom he had thought of almost hopelessly, even as he had considered with longing. He was transferred not from doubt or suspense - but from misery - to happiness. The transformation was expressed through genuine, overflowing, grateful joy - which those who knew him had never witnessed before.",17.261,16.683,"How quickly he reached the necessary determination by walking, how quickly the opportunity to put this determination into action arose, and in what way he expressed himself, how it was received, there is no need to elaborate on these at length.

His situation was truly filled with extraordinary joy. He felt much more than the ordinary victory of love that would bring happiness to his heart and joy to his soul. That had long made him miserable He had freed himself from a relationship with a woman he had not loved for a long time, without any fault of his own, and had regained his freedom; -and as soon as he began to think with desire, he had been forced to think with despair about another woman with whom he had reached that level of commitment.

And this not only in the enamored lover's rapturous speech but in the reality of reason and truth. Indeed, his happiness was more than common. A greater triumph than usual in requited love filled his heart and elevated his spirit. He had freed himself, without any fault on his part, from bonds that had long made him unhappy and had kept him tied to a woman he had long ceased to love; and, immediately, he had found in another woman that security for which he must have despaired from the very moment he began to desire her.

1792,"""It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,"" said he, ""the consequence of ignorance of the world—and want of employment. Had my mother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think—nay, I am sure, it would never have happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the time, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then had any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case I must have done. But instead of having any thing to do, instead of having any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any myself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, which belonging to the university would have given me; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen. I had therefore nothing in the world to do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging. She was pretty too—at least I thought so THEN; and I had seen so little of other women, that I could make no comparisons, and see no defects. Considering everything, therefore, I hope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since in every way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly.""","He said: - This is your foolish, lazy tendency, the consequence of ignorance about life - and having no job. If your younger brother had given you an active profession when you broke away from Mr. Pratt's guardianship at the age of eighteen, you think - no, you are certain - this would never have happened. Because, although you left Longstaple with what you thought at the time - an unbreakable attachment to Mr. Pratt's niece - if you had a job to pursue, a purpose to occupy your time and separate you from her for a few months, you would have matured and overcome the infatuation, especially after mingling more with the world - which you should have done. But instead of finding something to do, instead of taking up a profession chosen for you or one you were allowed to choose, you returned home completely idle. ""In the first twelve months after that (because he didn't enter Oxford until he was nineteen), he didn't take on even nominal work that the university could have given him. Therefore, he had nothing to do except indulge in the illusion that he was in love. Also because his mother didn't help him have a comfortable material life, because he had no friends, his siblings were not close to each other, and he had an aversion to new relationships; it was natural that he often went to Longstaple, where he always felt at home, where he was always sure to be welcomed. And so, most of his time from eighteen to nineteen was spent here: Lucy appeared to be everything lovely and indulgent. She was also pretty - at least he thought so at the time, and because he wasn't familiar with many women, he couldn't compare and didn't see any flaws."" ""Therefore, considering everything, with such a foolish engagement - foolish in every aspect as it later proved - at that time it was a naturally reckless and forgivable act - he hoped so.""",14.763,14.407,"""From my perspective, it was a foolish, silly inclination,"" he said, ""a result of not knowing the world - a lack of occupation. If my mother had given me an active profession when I came out of Mr. Pratt's supervision at eighteen, surely - no, I'm certain, none of this would have happened; even if I had left Longstaple with the interest I felt for my niece, which I then thought was indispensable, if I had a pursuit, a goal to dedicate my time to and keep me away from it for a few months, I would have quickly forgotten that imaginary love, especially if I had been more involved in life, which I should have done in that situation. But instead of having something to do, instead of a profession being chosen for me or being given the permission to choose, I returned home to complete idleness; during the first twelve months, I didn't even have the normal occupation that belonging to a university would give me, because I wasn't sent to Oxford until I was nineteen. So I had nothing to do in life, except to think I was in love; since my mother didn't make my home comfortable, my brother wasn't a friend or companion to me, and I didn't like meeting new people, it wasn't unusual for me to go to Longstaple often; I felt at home there and knew I would always be well received; thus, I spent most of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy seemed extremely charming and kind. She was also beautiful - at least it seemed so then; since I hadn't seen many other women, I couldn't make comparisons or see flaws. All things considered, I hope that, even though it was a foolish relationship, and has since proven to be foolish in every way, it wasn't an extraordinary or unforgivable example of foolishness at that time.""",18.295,17.963,"—It was a foolish and idle attachment on my part —he said—, a consequence of my ignorance of the world... and lack of occupation. If my mother had given me some active profession when I was taken out of Mr. Pratt's tutelage at eighteen, I believe... no, I am sure that nothing would have ever happened, for although I left Longstaple with what I then believed to be the most invincible devotion for her niece, even so, if I had had any activity, anything to occupy my time and keep me away from her for a few months, I would soon have overcome those fanciful affections, especially if I had interacted more with other people, as I would have had to do in that case. But instead of employing me in something, instead of having a profession chosen by me, or being allowed to choose one, I returned home to devote myself to complete idleness; and during the following year, I lacked even the nominal occupation that university membership would have given me, since I did not enter Oxford until I was nineteen. I had, therefore, nothing at all to do, except to believe myself in love; and as my mother did not make the home truly pleasant, as I found neither a friend nor a companion in my brother and disliked meeting new people, it is not surprising that I often went to Longstaple, which I always felt was my home and where I was sure to be welcomed; thus, I spent most of my time there between the ages of eighteen and nineteen. I saw in Lucy everything that is kind and agreeable. She was pretty too... at least I thought so at the time; and I knew so few women that I could not make comparisons or detect flaws.

1840,"In spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed his present engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he feared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him off as rapidly as before. With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness.

Therefore, he disclosed it with cautious anxiety, and he was listened to with a calmness he had not anticipated. At first, Mrs. Ferrars reasonably tried to advise him not to marry Miss Dashwood, using many arguments within her capacity, telling him that with Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher class and greater fortune; and reinforced this assertion by noting that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was merely the daughter of a commoner with no more than three. When she saw that, despite absolutely acknowledging the truth in her exposition, he still refused to be guided in that direction, from past experience, she deemed it best to acquiesce.

1847,"But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always treated them with the make–believe of decent affection, they were never insulted by her real favour and preference. THAT was due to the folly of Robert, and the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by them before many months had passed away. The selfish sagacity of the latter, which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it; for her respectful humility, assiduous attentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice, and re–established him completely in her favour.","However, although Mrs. Ferrars came to meet them and always pretended to show proper affection for the two, they never felt humiliated by her genuine fondness and favoritism. It was due to the foolishness of Robert and his cunning wife; and these two had to wait for many months to pass. Her selfish sharpness, which initially led Robert into a difficult situation, was the main tool to free him from this predicament. The respectful concessions, the diligent attentions, and the continuous flattery used whenever the opportunity arose, all helped to reconcile Mrs. Ferrars with the person he chose, restoring him fully in her affection.",10.347,8.419,"Although Mrs. Ferrars came to see them, she always treated them with a false affection; they never received her genuine interest and preference. -This was due to Robert's foolishness and his wife's cunning; they achieved this within a few months.

That had been earned by Robert’s foolishness and his wife’s cunning, and they had achieved it before many months had passed. Lucy’s selfish shrewdness, which had initially dragged Robert into such a mess, was the main instrument to free him from it; for as soon as she found the smallest opportunity to exercise them, her respectful humility, her assiduous attentions, and endless flattery reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to her son's choice and completely reinstated her in her favor.",27.628,26.951
1848,"The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which crowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self–interest, however its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and conscience. When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and privately visited her in Bartlett's Buildings, it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother. He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle the matter. In that point, however, and that only, he erred;—for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to produce this conviction. Some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted, which could only be removed by another half hour's discourse with himself. His attendance was by this means secured, and the rest followed in course. Instead of talking of Edward, they came gradually to talk only of Robert,—a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own; and in short, it became speedily evident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother. He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of marrying privately without his mother's consent. What immediately followed is known. They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut—and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;—and from thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, was adopted. The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks longer unpardoned. But perseverance in humility of conduct and messages, in self–condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence. Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered, and always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child. They settled in town, received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies and ill–will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy, in which their husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together.","Now, the entire behavior of Lucy can be presented. This is an encouraging example of what long-term, fervent self-interest can accomplish to seize all the advantages of wealth, while sacrificing nothing but time and conscience. When Robert first came to get acquainted with her and secretly visited her at the Barlett Building, his only purpose was to persuade her to give up the engagement. Since he saw no other issues to overcome except for their romantic relationship, it was natural for him to think that one or two conversations would be enough to settle the matter. However, at this point and only at this point, he was mistaken. Although Lucy soon gave him hope that with time his lively personality might persuade her, in reality, another visit was needed, another conversation was necessary to achieve this persuasion. When he bid farewell, there was always a lingering doubt in her mind, which could only be dispelled by another half-hour conversation. Thus ensuring he had to visit frequently, and what remained continued to unfold. Instead of talking about Edward, gradually they only talked about Robert - a topic he had much more to say about than any other, and soon she showed interest that was even equal to his. In short, the two quickly realized that he had taken his brother's place. He was proud of his conquest, proud of having deceived Edward, and very proud of having secretly married without his mother's consent. They spent many months in utmost happiness in Dawlish, as she had many acquaintances to sever ties with, and he was busy drawing plans for some splendid holiday homes. Then from there, he returned to the city, forgiven by Mrs. Ferrars, simply by asking for forgiveness, under Lucy's instigation. Indeed, at first, the forgiveness was reasonable as it was only granted to Robert, while Lucy had no obligations to her, thus had not violated anything, so she had to wait several more weeks to be forgiven. However, she persistently showed humility in her demeanor and speech to self-condemn herself for Robert's sins and to express gratitude for her mistreatment. This gave rise to an arrogant concern to surpass herself through kindness, so in a short time, she won affection and exerted influence to the highest degree. Like Robert or Fanny, Lucy became indispensable to Mrs. Ferrars. While Edward was never lovingly forgiven for the past sin of intending to marry her, and Elinor was spoken of as an outsider despite her superior wealth and family background; all things considered, Lucy was the one who won the family's affection more and was publicly acknowledged as such. The couple settled in the city, receiving extensive support from Mrs. Ferrars, and maintained a good relationship with the Daswood couple in an imaginable intimacy. They also set aside the jealousy and malice that always existed between Fanny and Lucy, in which their husbands were partly involved. Similarly, the internal disagreements between Robert and Lucy never exceeded the limits of the harmonious atmosphere in which they lived together.",20.642,20.47,"Lucy’s entire attitude in the matter, and the victory that crowned this attitude, can be seen as a very encouraging example of what can be achieved in terms of gaining wealth without sacrificing anything other than time and conscience, even if the path may sometimes seem obstructed. When Robert first wanted to meet her and secretly visited her at Bartlett Building, his intention was solely related to his brother. He was only thinking of convincing Lucy to end the relationship; naturally, he hoped to resolve the matter in one or two meetings since there was no obstacle other than their love to overcome. However, at that point, and only at that point, he was mistaken; -because although Lucy gave him the hope that his persuasive ability would convince her over time, each time he needed one more meeting to reach that persuasion. Whenever they parted, he always had some doubts in his mind, which he thought he could resolve by talking to her in person for another half hour. Thus, his visits were secured, and the rest followed gradually. Instead of talking about Edward, they gradually started talking only about Robert; -which was Robert’s favorite subject to talk about, and soon Lucy also showed that she was as interested in this subject as he was; in short, they both quickly realized that Robert had taken his brother’s place. Now he was proud of his conquest, proud of outsmarting his brother, and very proud of secretly marrying without his mother’s consent. What followed is well known. They spent a few months in great happiness in Dawlish; because Lucy had many relatives and old acquaintances to show off to -Robert also drew magnificent cottage plans; -on their way back to the city, they won Mrs. Ferrars' heart, with just the simple effort of wanting to, encouraged by Lucy. The forgiveness, of course, initially only included Robert; Lucy remained unforgiven for a few more weeks, even though she could not have wronged her mother-in-law in any way since she had no duty towards her. But the persistence in humility of behavior and expression, blaming herself for Robert’s fault, and being grateful in the face of ill-treatment eventually earned her a haughty interest, which first delighted her with its generosity and soon after rapidly elevated her to the highest ranks of love and influence. Lucy became as indispensable to Mrs. Ferrars as Robert and Fanny; whereas Edward was never properly forgiven for once wanting to marry her; Elinor, though superior to Lucy in both wealth and position, was always seen as a stranger; but Lucy was considered in every matter and always openly referred to as the most beloved daughter-in-law. They settled in the city; received generous support from Mrs. Ferrars; had the best imaginable relationship with the Dashwoods; nothing could be greater than the happiness they all lived together, except for the constant jealousy and enmity between Fanny and Lucy, which their husbands naturally joined, and the frequent family quarrels between Robert and Lucy.",17.532,17.324,"All of Lucy's conduct in this matter and the prosperity with which it was crowned can thus be exhibited as a very encouraging example of what intense, incessant attention to one's own interests, no matter how many obstacles seem to lie in the way, can do to achieve all the advantages of fortune, without sacrificing anything but time and conscience. The first time Robert sought to see her and visited her at Bartlett's Buildings, his only intention was the one his brother attributed to him. He only wanted to convince her to desist from the engagement; and as the only obstacle he imagined possible was the affection of both, he logically expected that one or two interviews would suffice to resolve the matter. In that point, however, and only in that, he was mistaken; for although Lucy very soon made him believe that, in the long run, his eloquence would convince her, another visit, another conversation was always needed to achieve such conviction. Upon parting, there always remained in her mind some doubts, which could only be clarified with another half-hour conversation with him. In this way, she ensured a new visit, and the rest followed its natural course. Instead of talking about Edward, they gradually came to talk only about Robert... a topic on which he always had more to say than the other and in which she soon showed an interest that almost equaled his; and, in short, it quickly became evident to both that he had completely supplanted his brother. He was proud of his conquest, proud of playing a trick on Edward, and very proud of marrying in private without his mother's consent. What followed immediately is already known. They spent some very happy months in Dawlish, for she had many relatives and old acquaintances with whom she wished to cut ties, and he drew many plans for magnificent country houses. And when they returned to the city from there, they obtained Mrs. Ferrars' forgiveness by the simple expedient of asking for it, a path adopted at the instigation of — Lucy. At first, logically, the forgiveness extended only to Robert; and Lucy, who had no obligation to her mother-in-law and therefore had not transgressed anything, remained a few weeks longer without being forgiven. But perseverance in humble behavior, plus messages where she assumed the blame for Robert's offense and gratitude for the harshness with which she was treated, eventually procured her a haughty acknowledgment of her existence that overwhelmed her with its condescension and then led her very quickly to the highest state of affection and influence. Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars as Robert or Fanny; and while Edward was never wholeheartedly forgiven for having once intended to marry her, and Elinor, though superior to Lucy in fortune and birth, was referred to as an intruder, she was always considered and openly recognized as a favorite daughter. They settled in the city, received very generous support from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best imaginable terms with the Dashwoods, and, setting aside the jealousy and ill will that continued to exist between Fanny and Lucy, in which of course their husbands took part, along with the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing could surpass the harmony in which they all lived together.",36.058,35.941
1849,"What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have puzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed to it, might have puzzled them still more. It was an arrangement, however, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing ever appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either leaving his brother too little, or bringing himself too much;—and if Edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no less contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an exchange.","Many people would surely find it difficult to understand what Edward did after losing the rights of the eldest son and what Robert did after inheriting these rights. However, this is a settlement that appears reasonable in its consequences, if not in its causes. In Robert's way of life or words, there is nothing to indicate that he regrets his level of income, having left so little for his brother and taken so much for himself. As for Edward, considering his fulfillment of duties in all areas, his increasing attachment to his wife and home, and his cheerful demeanor, it can be seen that he is no less content and no less free in all his desires for change.",12.327,11.459,"Many might be surprised to learn how Edward renounced his right as the eldest son; learning how Robert acquired that title might be even more surprising. However, it turned out to be a justified arrangement, if not by its reasons, then by its results; because nothing in Robert's way of living or speaking suggested that he was discontent with his income level, neither in the sense that he left very little to his brother nor that he took too much for himself; -As for Edward, considering his wholehearted fulfillment of his duties, his increasing devotion to his wife and home, and his consistent cheerfulness, it can be inferred that he was not at all dissatisfied with his situation and had no desire to trade places with him.",8.291,6.67,"What Edward had done to see his rights of primogeniture alienated might have surprised many, had they discovered it;. and what Robert had done to be the successor of those rights would surprise them even more. It was, however, an arrangement justified by its consequences, if not by its cause; for there was never any sign in Robert's lifestyle or in his words that would make one suspect he regretted the magnitude of his income, whether it left too little for his brother or assigned too much to him; and if one could judge Edward by his prompt fulfillment of his duties in every matter, by an ever-growing attachment to his wife and home, and by the constant joy of his spirit, one might suppose him no less content with his lot than his brother and no less free from wishing any change in it.",22.503,21.861
1850,"Elinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless, for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her. Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though rather more liberal than what John had expressed. It was now her darling object. Precious as was the company of her daughter to her, she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion–house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor. They each felt his sorrows, and their own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the reward of all.","After marriage, Elinor was not entirely separated from her family, so the Barton cottage did not become completely useless, as she spent more than half of her time with her mother and sister. Mrs. Dashwood now acted on the impulse of principle as well as pleasure through her frequent visits to Delaford; for her desire to bring Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was more earnest and generous than John had imagined. That was her dear objective at present. Although she longed to be as close to her daughter as possible, she did not wish to monopolize her affection to the exclusion of her dear friend. As for Edward and Elinor, they also wished to see Marianne settled in the mansion, for each felt the sufferings of the gentleman and their own personal gratitude; and Marianne was the reward for all these sufferings and gratitude.",17.949,17.113,"Since her mother and sisters spent half their time with her, Elinor's marriage separated her from her family as little as possible, but the cottage at Barton was not completely deserted. Mrs. Dashwood, in the frequency of her visits to Delaford, considered her pleasure as much as her plans; Marianne's desire to bring Colonel Brandon together had never diminished, even if it had become a bit more obvious than John had expressed. Now it was her favorite topic. Of course, being with her daughter made her happy, but she wanted more than anything to forever relinquish that happiness in favor of her dear friend; seeing Marianne settle in the mansion was also the wish of Edward and Elinor. They all felt Colonel Brandon's sorrow and their own obligations, and Marianne would be the reward for all these shared sentiments.",26.515,25.987,"Elinor's marriage only separated her from her family to the minimal extent necessary to prevent the Barton cottage from being completely abandoned, as her mother and sisters spent more than half their time with her. Mrs. Dashwood's frequent visits to Delaford were motivated as much by pleasure as by prudence; for her desire to unite Marianne and Colonel Brandon was only slightly less pronounced, though somewhat more generous, than that expressed by John. It was now her favorite cause. As precious as her daughter's company was to her, nothing did she desire more than to relinquish it for the sake of her esteemed friend; and seeing Marianne settled in the manor house was also the wish of Edward and Elinor. Everyone sympathized with the Colonel's sorrows and felt responsible for alleviating them; and Marianne, by general consensus, was to be the comfort for all of them.",26.349,25.812

1855,"Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as the source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy and rich. That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its own punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;—nor that he long thought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret. But that he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must not be depended on—for he did neither. He lived to exert, and frequently to enjoy himself.
