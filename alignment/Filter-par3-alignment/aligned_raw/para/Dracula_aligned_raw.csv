3,"3 May. Bistritz.—Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.","• Bistritz, May 3 Left Munich at 8 PM on May 1st; arrived in Vienna early the next morning. We were supposed to arrive at 6:50, but the train was delayed by an hour. And during the continued journey to Budapest, as imagined from what was witnessed while sitting on the train, and from what was admired in a few streets during a walk when the train temporarily stopped, I found this to be a beautiful city. But because I was very afraid of going too far from the station, as even if we were late, we still had to continue our departure as planned... I had a very clear impression of the journey leaving the West to reach the world of the East. After the train glided over the beautiful bridges with exemplary Western architecture spanning the wide and deep Danube river here, we immediately wandered into a region rich in Turkish customs.",9.314,8.327,"May 3rd. Bistriţa2 - 8 PM on the evening of May 1st. We left Munich at 8:35 and arrived in Vienna early the next morning; we should have arrived at 6:46, but the train was an hour late. From what I could see from the train and the short walk I took in the streets, Budapest looks like a wonderful place. Since we arrived late in Budapest and would be departing as close to the scheduled time as possible, I was afraid to stray too far from the station. I got the impression that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most Western of the magnificent bridges over the Danube River, with its noble breadth and depth, carried us into the traditions of Turkish rule.",37.777,37.295,"I left Munich at 8:35 PM on May 1st, arriving in Vienna early the next morning; I should have arrived at 6:46, but the train was an hour late.

4,"We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. (Mem., get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I don’t know how I should be able to get on without it.","Leaving Budapest not too late, we arrived in Klausenburgh by early evening. Here, I had to stay overnight at the Royal Hotel. They served me dinner, or rather a soup, a young chicken cooked with red pepper, quite tasty, but it would definitely make you very thirsty! (I thought about this dish from Mina's perspective). The waiter told me it was paprika hendi, a traditional dish that I could find everywhere in the Carpathian region. My basic knowledge of German proved to be quite useful, because honestly, if I didn't know any, I wouldn't have known how to manage.",8.876,7.513,"We departed with quite good timing and arrived in Klausenburg after nightfall. I spent the night here at the Royale Hotel. For dinner, or rather a late-night dinner, I had chicken cooked with red pepper; it tasted very good but was quite thirst-inducing. (Note: Get the recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter and he said it was called paprika hendl and that I could find it everywhere in the Carpathian Mountains as it is a local dish. My broken German was very useful here; I really don't know how I would have managed without it.",24.145,23.391,"We left with quite good weather, and it was pitch dark when we arrived in Klausenburg, where I spent the night at the Royale hotel.

5,"Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.","In London, during my free time, I often went to the British Museum or the National Library to look up geographical maps and books about Transylvania. I found it quite interesting to know a little about this place because I was about to have a business deal with a gentleman there. The land that this gentleman mentioned in his letter to me is located in the eastern part of the country, at the border of three regions: Transylvania, Moldavia, and Bukovina, in the Carpathian Mountains. This is one of the least known and most wild regions of Europe. But no book or map could show me the exact location of the castle named Count Dracula, as there is still no detailed map of this place. However, my research did inform me that Bistritz - the place Count Dracula mentioned to me and where I would have to travel by carriage - is a small, ancient city known to many people. I will recount my unforgettable impressions. That will revive a memory when recalling the excursions with Mina.",13.0,12.09,"When I had some time to myself in London, I visited the British Museum and did some research in the library among books and maps related to Transylvania; I thought that having some preliminary knowledge about the country wouldn't be insignificant when negotiating with a nobleman from that country. I saw that the region it is named after is at the easternmost edge of the country, at the border of Transylvania, Moldavia, and Bukovina, in the middle of the Carpathian Mountains; one of the wildest and least known parts of Europe. I couldn't find a map or study that gave the exact location of Dracula's Castle, as this country didn't have maps comparable to our detailed Ordnance Survey maps; but I saw that the town of Bistriţa, which Count Dracula named, was a fairly well-known place. While talking to Mina about my journey, I will record some of my notes here as they might refresh my memory.",27.767,27.299,"Since I had some free time when I was in London, I visited the British Museum and studied the books and maps in the library that referred to Transylvania; it had occurred to me that prior knowledge of the country would always be useful and important when dealing with a nobleman from the region.

6,"In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities: Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (Mem., I must ask the Count all about them.)","There are four races living in Transylvania: in the south are the Saxons living mixed with the Wallachians, who originate from the Dacian ethnicity; in the west are the Magyars; and in the east and north are the Szekelys. I will stay with the Szekelys. It is said that they descend from Attila and are the descendants of the Huns. This might be true because in the twelfth century, when the Magyars conquered the land they now inhabit, the Huns had already settled there. It seems that all the superstitions in the world exist in the Carpathians, and they always stir the imagination of the local people. If this is indeed the case, then my stay in this land will surely be very interesting. (I will certainly always bother the count with questions about these superstitious beliefs).",19.585,18.824,"There are four different nationalities in the population of Transylvania: in the south, the Saxons and the Wallachians, who are mixed with them and descended from the Dacians; in the west, the Hungarians; in the east and north, the Székelys. I am going among the last group, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This claim might be true because when the Hungarians conquered the country in the eleventh century, they found that the Huns had already settled there. I read that all known superstitions in the world seem to gather in the horseshoe formed by the Carpathian Mountains as if it were the center of a fanciful vortex; if so, my visit could be very interesting.

7,"I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then. I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call “impletata.” (Mem., get recipe for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?","The first night I couldn't sleep soundly, not because of the unfamiliar house and surroundings, but because I had strange dreams. Throughout the night, I always felt like there was a wolf howling loudly right below my window: was it due to my insomnia or the paprika dish? Because I had drained the water bottle in the room and still had a burning thirst. But eventually, I fell into a deep sleep when it was nearing dawn, as I was awakened by the sound of knocking, and it seemed the person knocking had to do so for a very long time. At breakfast, they served me paprika again, a bit of oatmeal made from cornmeal which they called mamaliga, and a few bowls of stuffed pastries - a delicious dish named impletata. (I noted down the recipe for Mina). I ate hastily, as the train was supposed to depart a few minutes before eight; to be precise, it was supposed to leave at a few minutes to eight, yet after a breathless sprint to the station at seven-thirty, I still had to wait over an hour in the carriage before the train started moving. I have a feeling that the farther east we go, the later the trains run. I wonder how things are in China?",6.889,5.582,"Although my bed was comfortable enough, I couldn't sleep well because I had all sorts of strange dreams. A dog barked under my window all night; maybe my sleeplessness had something to do with that; or maybe it was because of the red pepper since I had to drink all the water in my pitcher but still couldn't quench my thirst. I fell asleep towards morning and woke up to the persistent knocking on my door; at that moment, I think I was in a deep sleep. For breakfast, I ate some more red pepper, a type of porridge made from cornmeal which they said was called mamaliga, and a dish called impletata, which is eggplant stuffed with minced meat and is an excellent meal. (Note: Get the recipe for this as well.) Since the train was supposed to leave a little before eight - or rather it was supposed to leave at 7. 30, I had to rush my breakfast because after running to the station, I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we started moving. It seems to me that as we move further east, the trains get more delayed. Who knows what they are like in China?",26.7,26.295,"I did not sleep well, although my bed was sufficiently comfortable, because I had all kinds of strange dreams. Throughout the night a dog howled under my window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have also been the paprika, since I had to drink all the water from my jug, and I was still thirsty. In the early morning, I fell asleep, but I was awakened by some insistent knocks on my door, so I suppose that at that moment I was sleeping deeply. I ate more bell pepper for breakfast, a kind of porridge made from cornmeal that they say was ""mamaliga"", and eggplant stuffed with minced meat, an excellent dish they call ""impletata"" (remember to also get the recipe for this). I hurried to have breakfast, as the train was leaving a little after eight, or rather, it should have left, because after running to the station at seven-thirty, I had to wait sitting in the carriage for more than an hour before we started moving. It seems to me that the further east you go, the less punctual the trains are. What will they be like in China?",33.464,33.128
8,"All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are, however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion.","All day long, our train traveled through a beautiful and diverse land. At times, we admired small cities with castles perched precariously on steep hills, reminiscent of scenes described in ancient Biblical texts; at other times, the train ran alongside large and small streams with rocky, winding banks resembling nature's own railings. At the stations where we stopped, every platform was bustling with crowds dressed in vibrant, colorful attire of various kinds. Some people looked very similar to the farmers in our country or in France and Germany: they wore simple mesh shirts with rather wide-cut trousers and round-brimmed hats; but others were dressed in more colorful outfits. The women here seem very healthy and quite beautiful if you don't look at them too closely. They all wear oversized white-sleeved shirts, with leather belts that are always fluttering over their splendid skirts. However, I find the Slovakians to be the most peculiar; they wear wide-brimmed cowboy-style hats, baggy pants in a dull color, white linen shirts, and wide leather belts studded with brass rivets. Particularly, every man likes to tuck his pants into a pair of long boots. Their long black hair and thick beards make them look more distinctive but not at all charming. Honestly, if I were traveling by horse-drawn carriage, I might have mistaken them for a band of highway robbers, although I have been told that they have never done anything bad to anyone; on the contrary, they are always quite cowardly.",7.637,7.12,"Throughout the day, we slowly progressed through a terrain filled with all kinds of beauty. Sometimes, at the tops of steep hills, we saw small villages and castles similar to those we had seen in old prayer books; sometimes, we passed by rivers and streams with wide, stony banks that suggested they had been subjected to great floods. It takes a large amount of strong flowing water to sweep and clean the outer edges of a river. At every train station, there were crowds of people dressed in various kinds of attire, sometimes large gatherings. Some wore short jackets, round hats, and homemade trousers, just like those in our region or those I saw while passing through France and Germany; but others were very interesting. The women looked beautiful unless you got close to them, but their waistlines were quite thick. All of their clothes had white sleeves in one way or another; many wore wide belts with lots of ribbons hanging from them, resembling ballet dresses; but of course, they had underskirts underneath. The strangest people we saw were the Slovaks, who looked more barbaric than the rest with their large cowboy hats, wide, sack-like dirty white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous, heavy belts almost a foot wide, studded all over with brass nails. They wore high boots into which they tucked their trousers, and they had long black hair and thick black mustaches. They were very impressive but not attractive. They could be placed on stage right now as an old Eastern bandit gang. But as I was told, they were quite harmless and moreover, people who lacked self-defense skills.",22.45,22.133,"It seemed that throughout the day we wandered through a country that was full of all kinds of beauties. Sometimes we saw small villages or castles on the tops of steep hills, such as those seen in old missals; sometimes we ran alongside rivers and streams, which, by the wide and stony margins on either side of them, seemed to be subject to great floods. It takes a great amount of water, with a very strong current, to be able to clean the outer bank of a river. At all the stations there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all kinds of attire. Some of them were exactly like the peasants of my country, or those I had seen when crossing France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats and pants made by themselves; but others were very picturesque. The women were pretty, except when one got close to them, for they were quite thick around the waist. They all wore long white sleeves, and most of them had wide belts with a bunch of fringes of something hanging like in ballet dresses, but of course they wore petticoats underneath them. The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbaric than the rest, with their wide cowboy hats, large baggy and dirty pants, white linen shirts, and huge and heavy leather belts, almost a foot wide, completely studded with tin nails. They wore high boots, with their pants tucked inside them, and had long black hair and heavy black mustaches. They were very picturesque, but they did not seem friendly. In any setting, they would be immediately recognized as some old gang of bandits. However, I am told that they are quite harmless and, moreover, quite shy.",41.985,41.796
9,"It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier—for the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina—it has had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease.","We arrived in Bistritz at midnight. As I mentioned, Bistritz is an ancient city with a unique past. Located near the border - indeed, when leaving Bistritz, just crossing the Borgo Pass leads to Bukovina - this city has experienced numerous ups and downs, many of which are still evident today.

10,"Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress—white undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and said, “The Herr Englishman?” “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with a letter:—","Count Dracula arranged for me to stay at the Golden Crown Hotel. I was very pleased to see that it was a very ancient house, because after all, I wanted to understand as much as possible about the customs and traditions of this land.

The woman was so terrified that I tried every way to comfort her, but it was in vain. Finally, she suddenly knelt down and begged me not to go, or if I had to go, to stay for another day or two. This strange behavior made me feel a bit uneasy. But in any case, people were waiting for me at the castle, and nothing could stop me from going there. I helped the hostess up, but no matter what, I still had to set off. The woman stood up, wiped her tears, then took off the cross she wore around her neck and handed it to me.

As for myself, sometimes I could catch a few words from the crowd, but they were all words I didn't understand. Moreover, they spoke in many different languages. Therefore, I had to take out the multilingual dictionary from my travel bag to look up the meanings of all the strange words I had overheard. But to be honest, none of the meanings I found in the dictionary gave me any courage, because I only found words like: Ordog - Satan; Pokol - hell; stregocia - witch; vrolok and vlkoslak - something like ""vampire"" or ""werewolf"" according to the meanings in two dialects.",6.603,5.7,"When I got into the carriage, the coachman had not yet taken his place, and I saw him talking with the hotel owner.

23,"I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom—apple, plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the “Mittel Land” ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.","The beauty of the scenery along the way quickly made me forget my worries and anxieties, but I don't think I could have easily shed all my obsessions if I had understood the whole story of my fellow travelers. In front of us were vast forests, with steep hills occasionally rising on either side of the road, topped with a solitary clump of trees or a sparse farm casting shadows onto the path. Everywhere, trees were in full bloom - apple blossoms, plum blossoms, pear blossoms, and cherry blossoms, all creating a truly magnificent picture; and even the grassy carpets in the orchards we passed through, under the sunlight, were sparkling with fallen petals. Whether winding around or stretching up the hills, the road always seemed like a soft silk fabric lying exposed on the lush green velvet grass, or peeking out from under a forest of pines extending as far as the eye could see, making me feel as if I were lost in a fairyland. However, the farther we went, the worse the road became, but the coachman still urged the horses to run at full speed. This surprised me greatly. It seemed he wanted to reach Borgo Prund as quickly as possible. Before setting off, I was told that the road was excellent, but it clearly hasn't returned to that state after the recent winter snowfalls. This road is unlike the other roads in the Carpathian Mountains: indeed, no one dares to repair it, fearing that doing so would make the Turks mistakenly believe that preparations for an invasion of their country are underway, which would immediately serve as a pretext for them to declare war.",7.408,6.541,"If I had known the language -or rather, the languages- spoken by the other passengers, although I would not have been able to get rid of them so easily, shortly after setting off, my spiritual fears and memories related to them faded away in the beauty of the scenery. In front of us stretched a green sloping terrain filled with forests, adorned here and there with steep hills, crowned with clusters of farmhouses with trees or side walls facing the road. Everywhere, fruit blossoms were blooming with surprising density - apple, plum, pear, cherry; as we moved along the road, I could see that the green grass under the trees was speckled with fallen petals. The road stretched out among the green hills they called ""Mittelland"" here, disappearing as it extended over grass-covered curves or being blocked by the edges of pine forests as it descended the slopes like tongues of flame spilling out here and there. The road was rough, but still, it felt as if we were flying over it with an excited rush. At that time, I did not understand what this rush meant, but it was clear that the coachman was determined not to waste any time reaching Prundu Bârgăului. They said that this road was in perfect condition during the summer, but had not yet been restored after the winter snows. In this respect, it is different from most of the roads passing through the Carpathian Mountains, because it is an old tradition that those roads are not kept in very good condition. In the past, the hospodars did not repair the roads so that the Turks would not think they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, thus accelerating a war ready to break out at any moment.",24.032,23.729,"Soon I lost sight and memory of the ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene we were passing through, although if I had known the language, or rather, the languages spoken by my travel companions, it is very possible that I would not have been able to get rid of them so easily. Before us stretched the green sloping field full of forests with steep hills here and there, crowned with clusters of clovers or with peasant houses, with their empty walls facing the road. Everywhere there was a maddening amount of flowering fruits: apples, plums, pears, and strawberries. And as we advanced, I could see how the green grass under the trees was covered with fallen petals. The road wound in and out of these green hills of what is called ""Middle Earth"" here, freeing itself as it swept around the curves, or closed in by the strangling arms of the pine forests, which here and there ran down the hills like tongues of fire. The road was rough, but despite that, it felt like we were flying with an exciting haste. At that time, I couldn't understand the reason for that haste, but evidently the driver didn't want to waste time before reaching the Borgo Pass.

26,"As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and again we passed a leiter-wagon—the ordinary peasant’s cart—with its long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our driver’s haste, the horses could only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home, but the driver would not hear of it. “No, no,” he said; “you must not walk here; the dogs are too fierce”; and then he added, with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry—for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest—“and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep.” The only stop he would make was a moment’s pause to light his lamps.","Behind us, the sun gradually sank below the horizon, and the shadows of dusk descended ever more quickly. The sense of sunset became even more vivid when we were at a higher altitude. The snow-capped mountain peaks still sparkled with the scattered pink rays of the sun. Occasionally along the way, we encountered groups of Czechs and Slovaks in their famous traditional costumes. However, there was one thing that made me unhappy: most of them suffered from goiters. Every now and then, a solitary cross would stand by the roadside, and each time the carriage passed by, the passengers would hurriedly make the sign of the cross. We also saw farmers kneeling in prayer in front of graveyard chapels. They were so absorbed in their prayers that they didn't bother to look up when they heard the carriage approaching. All of them were devout, and while praying, they never paid attention to the world around them. Almost everything was new to me: the haystacks piled high up to the tree canopies, the weeping willows revealing through their leaves slender branches glistening with silver light...Occasionally, I encountered an ox cart carrying farmers returning home, the Czech men wearing pure white sheepskin coats; while the Slovaks wore dyed sheepskin coats, and they carried long axes like spears by their sides. Nightfall heralded a scene of icy coldness, the darkness deepening among the dense fir and oak leaves. We were on our way to the Borgo Pass. In the valley beneath us, the black fir trees seemed to be torn apart against a backdrop of freshly fallen white snow. Sometimes, as the road delved into a fir forest - which seemed to be swallowing us whole - thick, white fog banks would suddenly appear, completely obscuring the bushes, making them look like ghostly apparitions. Once again, I felt a shiver similar to the tingling sensation I had experienced at dusk. In the Carpathians, the setting sun had left behind bizarrely shaped clouds drifting among the rocky crags. The hillsides were now so steep that, despite being in a hurry to reach our destination, the coachman had to slow the horses down. I expressed my desire to get off and walk for a bit, as I would do back home in a similar situation, but the coachman immediately objected: — No, no! - He replied. - You can't walk there... Are the dogs here fierce? The coachman added another sentence, which I guessed was his attempt to prove that he too had a sense of humor, as I could clearly see him glancing at each passenger, hoping for a responsive smile: — Just trust me, and you will have everything, including the walk, when you are comfortably lying in bed tonight. He only kept quiet when it was time to light the lamps on the carriage.",7.598,7.25,"As we wound our way on our seemingly endless journey and the sun sank lower behind us, the shadows of evening began to silently envelop us. This was further accentuated by the snowy peak of the mountain, which still held the sunset upon it, appearing to glow with a light and cool pinkness. From time to time, we passed by Czechs and Slovaks in remarkable attire, and unfortunately, I noticed that goiter was a common condition. There were numerous crosses by the roadside, and as we passed them, all my companions crossed themselves. Here and there, there were peasant women and men kneeling before a shrine, who did not turn to look as we approached, wholly absorbed in their devotions, their eyes and ears shut off from the outside world. Many things were new to me: for instance, the haystacks in the trees, the beautiful clusters of birch trees with white trunks shimmering like silver among the delicate green of their leaves. From time to time, we overtook a leiter-wagon, an ordinary peasant cart with a long, sinuous spine adjusted to the roughness of the road. On this vehicle, there was always a group of farmers returning home, with white sheepskins for the Czechs and colored ones for the Slovaks; the second group carried long sticks with axes at the end, giving them the air of spears. As evening fell, the air grew very cold, and the increasingly dense twilight seemed to blend into a thick mist with the dimness of trees like oak, beech, and pine; yet, as we descended from the pass into the valleys deep between the arms of the mountains, we occasionally came across dark fir trees backed by patches of snow that had not yet melted. At times, the road was intersected by pine forests that seemed to close in on us in the darkness, while the early evening sunset, sinking ever lower, cast strange shapes with the ghostly clouds drifting incessantly through the valleys of the Carpathians, creating an unusually eerie and majestic effect with the large patches of gray covering the trees here and there. Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could only proceed slowly. I wanted to get out of the carriage and approach the horses, but the driver would not allow it. ""No, no!"" he said; ""You must not walk here; the dogs are too savage,"" then, making it clear he was making a cruel joke by looking around to catch the approving smiles of the others, he added, ""You will have enough of such matters to deal with before you sleep."" The only stop he made was for a moment to light the lamps.",26.496,26.311,"As we continued on our endless journey and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to surround us. This fact was highlighted because the peaks of the snow-capped mountains still received the sun's rays and seemed to glow with a delicate and cold pink color. Here and there we passed by Czechs and Slovaks, all in their picturesque attire, but I noticed that goiter was painfully prevalent. Along the road, there were many crosses, and as we passed, all my companions crossed themselves before them. Here and there, there was a peasant woman kneeling before an altar, not even turning to see us as we approached, but rather, in the rapture of devotion, she seemed to have neither eyes nor ears for the outside world. Many things were completely new to me; for example, haystacks in the trees, and here and there, very beautiful groups of weeping willows, with their white branches shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Time and again we passed a wagon (the ordinary cart of the peasants) with its long, sinuous spine, designed to adjust to the unevenness of the road. In each of them sat a group of peasants returning to their homes, the Czechs with their white sheepskins and the Slovaks with their colored ones. The latter carried their long staves like spears, with an axe at the end. As night began to fall, it became very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to blend the gloom of the trees—oaks, beeches, and pines—into a single mist, although in the valleys that ran deeply through the furrows of the hills, as we ascended towards the gorge, the dark fir trees stood out against the backdrop of the late snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine forests that seemed to close in on us in the darkness, large gray masses scattered here and there among the trees produced a gloomy and solemn effect, which revived the thoughts and sinister fantasies engendered by the evening, while the setting sun seemed to cast a strange comfort on the ghostly clouds that, among the Carpathians, seem to wander incessantly through the valleys. On certain occasions, the hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could only advance very slowly. I wanted to get out of the carriage and walk beside them, as we do in my country, but the coachman would have none of it. –No; no -he told me-, you must not walk here. The dogs are very fierce -he said, and then added, with what evidently seemed to be a macabre joke, as he looked around to catch the affirmative smiles of the others-: You will have enough to do before going to sleep. Thus, the only stop he made for a moment served to light the lamps.",34.65,34.508
27,"When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz—the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye. Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle. The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I thought it was “An hour less than the time.” Then turning to me, he said in German worse than my own:—","As soon as the lamps were lit, the passengers suddenly became lively, urging the coachman to drive the horses faster. The coachman immediately swung his whip, urging the horses to gallop up the mountainside. After the carriage had been running for a while, I believed I saw a pale blue light in the darkness ahead - but it was probably nothing more than a crack between the rocks. My fellow travelers became increasingly agitated. The carriage began to roll wildly, causing the springs to creak, making us feel as if we were on a boat in a stormy sea. I had to hold tightly to the side of the carriage to avoid being thrown off. After a while, the road seemed smoother, and I felt as if the carriage was flying through the night. The path also became narrower, the mountains closed in more tightly, and to be honest, it seemed as if they were spreading out to threaten us: we were passing through the Borgo Pass. For some reason, my fellow travelers began handing me various items as gifts, such as a sprig of garlic, a dried wild rose... and I realized I couldn't refuse them. Indeed, each gift had a certain amusing quality, yet those who gave them to me expressed sincere and simple intentions along with mysterious gestures, similar to those made by the people standing in front of the Bistritz hotel: making the sign of the cross and raising two fingers to protect me against the evil eyes lurking around. The coachman leaned forward, and the passengers on the benches strained their necks to look outside. Clearly, they were expecting something to appear in the night. I asked questions, but no one wanted to answer, not even a single sentence. The curiosity kept smoldering within me. Finally, we reached the eastern slope of Borgo Pass. Dark clouds piled up, the air stifling as if a storm was imminent. It must be said that the atmosphere between the two mountain slopes was distinctly different. Now we were entering a dangerous area. I quietly observed the carriage tasked with leading me to the Count's house, anxiously waiting for the moment to catch a glimpse of the faint light from the castle, but everything around was still pitch black. The only light at that moment was the flickering light from the carriage, mingling with the heavy, steamy breaths of the horses. That light allowed us to see the pale road ahead, but there was absolutely no sign of any other vehicle besides ours. My fellow travelers let out a sigh and then turned to find a more comfortable sitting position. I felt their gestures were like a mockery: they were ridiculing my disappointment. I was thinking of how to handle this awkward situation when the coachman suddenly checked his watch and said something to the passengers that I didn't understand; however, I could guess his meaning: ""An hour late..."" Then he turned to advise me in German that was even worse than mine:",9.97,9.671,"It seemed as if an excitement had arisen among the passengers when it got dark, and the passengers kept talking to the coachman one after another, as if insisting that he go faster. The coachman mercilessly whipped the horses with his long whip and urged them to make more effort with encouraging wild shouts. Then, in the middle of the darkness ahead, as if there was a gap between the hills, I saw a piece of some kind of gray light. The excitement of the passengers grew even more; the frenzied coach was shaking on its large leather springs and swaying from side to side like a ship tossed in a stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road improved a bit, and it seemed as if we were flying forward. Then, it seemed as if the mountains on either side were closing in on us; we were entering the Borgo Pass. Most of the passengers, with an insistence that accepted no objections, individually offered me gifts; of course, they were unusual and strange in nature, but each was given with good intentions, a kind word, a prayer, and a mixture of those strange gestures of fear I had seen outside the hotel in Bistriţa (cross and protection against the evil eye). Later, as we were flying forward, the driver leaned forward and the passengers on either side stretched their necks out from the edge of the coach, eagerly and attentively looking into the darkness. It was clear that something very exciting was happening or expected, but despite asking each passenger, no one gave me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement continued for a short while; finally, we saw the pass opening up ahead of us to the east. There was a heavy and oppressive storm feeling in the air, with black clouds rolling over our heads. The mountain ranges seemed to have separated the two airs, and we had entered the stormy one. Now I too was looking out to see the vehicle that would take me to the Count. I was expecting to see the brightness of the lamps from the darkness at any moment; but everywhere was dark. The only light was the flickering light of our own coach, which showed the steam from the breath of our rapidly running horses like a white cloud. Now, we could see the sandy road stretching out white in front of us, but there was no sign of any vehicle. The passengers, seeming to mock my disappointment, sighed with satisfaction and leaned back. When the driver looked at his watch and said something to the others that I could barely hear, I had already started thinking about what I should do; these words were spoken so quietly, in such a low tone, that I think he said: ""An hour early. ""Then, turning to me, he said in German even worse than mine:",27.78,27.606,"As dusk fell, it seemed that the passengers became more nervous and continuously spoke to the coachman one after another, as if asking him to increase the speed. He whipped the horses mercilessly with his long whip, and with wild shouts of encouragement tried to force them to greater efforts. Then, through the darkness, I could see a kind of gray patch of light ahead of us, as if there were a gap in the hills. The passengers' uneasiness increased; the mad carriage swayed on its large leather springs, and tilted from one side to the other like a ship floating on a stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road became more level and it seemed as if we were flying over it. Then, the mountains seemed to close in on us from both sides, as if they wanted to strangle us, and we found ourselves at the entrance of the Borgo Pass. One by one all the passengers offered me gifts, insisting in such a sincere manner that there was no way to refuse to accept them. Of course, the gifts were of very diverse and strange kinds, but each one gave it to me with such goodwill, with such kind words, and with a blessing, that strange mixture of fearful gestures I had already seen outside the hotel in Bistritz: the sign of the cross and the charm against the evil eye. Then, as we were flying, the coachman leaned forward and, on each side, the passengers, leaning against the windows of the coach, anxiously scrutinized the darkness. It was evident that something strange was expected to happen, but although I asked each of the passengers, none gave me the slightest explanation. This state of mind lasted for some time, and in the end, we saw how the gorge opened towards the eastern side. Dark and gloomy clouds hung over us, and the air was heavy, laden with the oppressive sensation of thunder. It seemed as if the mountain range separated two atmospheres, and that now we had entered the stormy one. I myself began to look for the vehicle that was to take me to the count's residence. At every moment, I expected to see the flash of lamps through the darkness, but everything remained in the deepest darkness. The only light came from the flickering rays of light from our own lamps, in which the vapors of our exhausted horses rose like white clouds. Now we could see the sandy road stretching white before us, but there was no sign of a vehicle on it. The passengers reclined with a sigh of relief, which seemed to mock my own disappointment. I was already thinking about what I could do in such a situation when the coachman, looking at his watch, said something to the others that I could barely hear, so soft and mysterious was the tone in which he said it. I think it was something like ""an hour ahead of time."" Then he turned to me and said in German worse than mine:",33.741,33.607
28,"“There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better the next day.” Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:—","— I don't see any car, they probably aren't waiting for you. Perhaps you should come with us to Bukovina, you can return here tomorrow or the day after... that would be better... Just as the coachman was about to finish his sentence, the horses suddenly neighed loudly and stomped the ground frantically. Several people sitting near me were startled, cried out in fear, and hastily made the sign of the cross: it turned out to be a convertible horse-drawn carriage, pulled by four horses, that had suddenly appeared behind us and then overtook us to stop right next to our carriage. Under the light, I saw that the newly arrived horses were all sleek, including one that was as black as coal. The driver was a tall man with a long, reddish beard like corn silk, wearing a wide-brimmed black hat that covered his face. In the flickering light, I could still make out the sparkle in his eyes. Those eyes were almost red in color.",5.458,4.314,"“There is no car here. After all, Herr is not expected. He will now go to Bukovina and return here tomorrow or the day after; the best is the day after tomorrow.” As he spoke, the horses began to neigh, snort from their noses, and lunge forward wildly; so much so that the driver had to restrain them. Then, amidst the villagers' chorus of cries and the universal gesture of crossing themselves, a light carriage with four horses came up the hill behind us, caught up to us, and began to move alongside our carriage. As beams of light fell on them, in the light emitted by our lamps, I saw that the horses were coal black and magnificent animals. The carriage was driven by a tall man with a long brown beard that hid his face and a large black hat. I could only see the gleam of a very bright pair of eyes, which appeared red under the lamp light as they turned towards us. He said to the driver:",30.443,29.978,"–There is no carriage here. After all, no one is waiting for the gentleman. It would be better for him to come to Bukovina now and return tomorrow or the day after; better the day after. While he was speaking, the horses began to prance and neigh, and to rear up so wildly that the coachman had to hold them firmly. Then, amidst a chorus of screams from the peasants who were hastily crossing themselves, a carriage appeared behind us, passed us, and stopped beside our coach. By the light emitted from our lamps, as the rays fell upon them, I could see that the horses were splendid animals, black as coal. They were driven by a tall man with a long grayish beard and a large black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I could only see the flash of a pair of very bright eyes, which appeared red in the lamp's glow, in the moments when the man turned towards us. He addressed the coachman:",38.667,38.299

31,"“That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.” As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger’s “Lenore”:—","— That must be the reason why I think - The newcomer continued - that you intend to take him all the way to Bukovina... No, my friend, you can't fool me. I know everything, and my horses run very fast too... He laughed and talked, but his face remained stern - at this moment he was standing very close to our car. I could see very clearly his blood-red lips, his sharp, yellowish ivory-like teeth.

34,"The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. “Give me the Herr’s luggage,” said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in excellent German:—","Surely the newcomer had heard the poem, because I saw him turn to look at the passenger with a grotesque smile. The passenger hurriedly turned his face away, made the sign of the cross, and held out two fingers. — Please give me your luggage, sir. - The stranger continued to speak. Without needing him to say so, my pile of suitcases was also transferred to the convertible car. I stepped out of the car and moved to sit in the new car. The man gave me a hand - his hand was indeed as hard as steel. He must have extraordinary strength. Without a word, he jerked the reins to turn the car halfway around. The new car began to move and sped at full speed on the Borgo Pass. Looking back, I could still make out the flickering lights of the passenger car faintly illuminating the misty breath of the horses; the silhouettes of the passengers, who had just recently been my companions, appeared one last time before my eyes: they were making the sign of the cross together. The coachman suddenly swung the whip forcefully, and the horses immediately turned onto the road to Bukovina. As the horses delved deeper into the night, I suddenly shivered with a dreadful sense of loneliness, but immediately a cloak was draped over my shoulders, followed by a travel blanket gently placed over my knees.

Without a word, he flicked the reins, the horses turned, and we swiftly advanced into the darkness of the pass.

35,"“The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.” I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.","— Sir, the weather is a bit bad, so the count, that is, my master, has ordered me not to let you catch a cold. The bottle of slivovitz[4] is over there, right under that seat, feel free to help yourself if you like. Even without drinking a drop, just knowing that there is such a bottle in the car is enough to comfort me. However, my anxiety is far from being calmed, if not to say that I am falling into an opposite state of mind. I believe that if I could, I would definitely abandon this increasingly mysterious journey. Speeding faster and faster down the road, the car suddenly swerved onto another road and then continued straight. I had the feeling that the car was looping around the same place over and over. I came up with the idea of trying to find some landmark to confirm my suspicion, and I realized that I was not mistaken. I intended to ask the driver what was going on but then decided against it, telling myself that in such a vulnerable situation, silence was the better option. Who knows, I might inadvertently oppose something if he was ordered to prolong the journey! Anyway, I wanted to check the time, and the only way to see the hour was to strike a match. It was almost midnight. I suddenly shivered with fear: surely the superstitions about everything that happens at midnight would haunt my mind again after the strange events I had experienced. What was going to happen next?",3.603,2.722,"“The night is cold, mein Herr, and my master Count has ordered me to take every care of you.” “If you wish, there is a flask of slivovitz [local plum brandy] under the seat.” I did not drink, but knowing it was there was comforting. I was feeling a bit strange and quite scared. If there had been another option, I think I would have chosen it rather than continue this unknown night journey. The carriage was moving straight ahead at a fast pace, then we made a complete turn and proceeded along another straight path. It seemed to me as if we were passing the same place over and over again; therefore, I paid attention to a noticeable spot and realized that this was indeed the case. I wished I had asked the coachman what all this meant, but I was really afraid to do so because, given my position, I thought that any objection, if there was a desire for delay, would have no effect. But a little later, wondering how time was passing, I struck a match and looked at my watch by its flame; it was a few minutes to midnight. This shocked me somewhat, because I suppose the general superstitions about midnight had been reinforced by my recent experiences.",27.835,27.511,"–The night is cold, my lord, and my lord the count asked me to take good care of you. Under the seat there is a bottle of slivovitz, a regional liquor made from plums, in case you would like some… But I didn't take anything, although it was nice to know there was a supply of liquor. I felt a bit strange, and no less scared. I think that if there had been another alternative, I would have taken it instead of continuing that mysterious night journey. The carriage moved quickly, in a straight line; then we made a complete turn and went down another straight path. It seemed to me that we were just going around and around the same place; so, I took note of a prominent point and confirmed my suspicions. I would have liked to ask the coachman what all this meant, but I was really afraid, as I thought that, in the situation I was in, any protest would not have the desired effect in case there was an intention to delay. After a while, however, feeling curious to know how much time had passed, I lit a match, and by its light, I looked at my watch; it was a few minutes to midnight. This gave me a kind of start, as I suppose the general superstition about midnight had been heightened by my recent experiences. I remained waiting with a sickly feeling of anxiety.",33.188,32.893
36,"Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road—a long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling—that of wolves—which affected both the horses and myself in the same way—for I was minded to jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.","The sudden sound of a dog barking echoed from somewhere down the road, perhaps from a farmyard; a fearful, prolonged bark... That bark was answered by another dog, then another, and yet another... Until it was swept away by the gusts of wind blowing fiercely through the pass. Those wild and mournful cries suddenly seemed to rise from every corner. The savage resonance echoed on and on, far into the depths of a ghostly world that an imagination could conjure up in the night... The horses immediately reared up, but the man calmed them down with a gentle voice, though each one was drenched in sweat and trembling like a leaf. At this moment, the furthest mountains were echoing back to us more haunting, more intense, and exponentially stronger howls: wolves. I thought I might jump out of the carriage and run away. The horses once again reared up and kicked wildly, but the coachman didn't need to exert much effort to keep them from bolting. He jumped down from the carriage and ran to the front of the horses to soothe, pat, and comfort them with the kindest words he had. The result was extraordinary: though still trembling, the four horses immediately obeyed their master, allowing him to get back on the carriage and take the reins. They hurriedly sped along the unavoidable road once more. This time, after crossing the pass, the coachman directed the horses along a different path, down a narrower road that disappeared to the right.",10.094,9.584,"Then, somewhere far down the road, a dog began to howl at the farmhouse - a long, painful wail as if from fear. The sound was taken up by another dog, then another, and another; until now, carried by the wind softly moaning through the pass, a wild howling began from every part of the country, from the gloom of the night, in every corner that the imagination could grasp. At the first howl, the horses became tense and started to rear, but they calmed down when the driver spoke to them soothingly, though they were trembling and sweating as if they had escaped from a sudden fear. Then, in the distance, a higher and sharper howl - the howl of wolves - began in the mountains on either side of us, and this howl affected the horses and me in the same way, for while I was thinking of jumping out of the carriage and fleeing, they reared once more and dashed forward madly; so much so that the driver had to use all his tremendous strength to prevent them from bolting away. However, within a few minutes, my ears got used to the sound, and during this time, the horses calmed down enough for the driver to get down and stand in front of them. The driver petted them, soothed them, and whispered something into their ears, as I have heard horse trainers do, with an extraordinary effect, for with his caressing, the horses, though still trembling, became quite docile once again. The driver took his place again and set off at great speed, shaking the reins. This time, after reaching the far corner of the pass, he suddenly turned onto a narrow road that sharply curved to the right.",32.585,32.344,"Then a dog began to howl in some farmhouse further down the road. It let out a long, mournful howl, as if it were afraid. Its call was picked up by another dog and another and another, until, born like the wind that now gently passed through the gorge, it began a terrifying concert of howls that seemed to come from all points of the field, from as far as the imagination could reach through the darkness of the night. From the first howl, the horses began to paw and become restless, but the coachman spoke to them, calming them down, and they regained their composure, though they trembled and sweated as if they had just experienced a sudden fright. Then, in the far distance, from the mountains on either side of us, came a much louder and sharper howl, the howl of wolves, which affected the horses and myself in the same way, for I was about to jump out of the carriage and run away, while they backed up and reared frantically, so that the coachman had to use all his strength to prevent them from bolting. However, within a few minutes, my ears had become accustomed to the howls, and the horses had calmed down enough that the coachman could descend and stand in front of them. He rubbed and petted them, and whispered something in their ears, just as I have heard horse trainers do, and with such an extraordinary effect that under these caresses they became quite obedient again, though still trembling. The coachman took his seat again, shook his reins, and we resumed our journey at a good pace. This time, after reaching the far side of the gorge, he suddenly crossed a narrow path that sharply veered to the right.",30.283,30.017
37,"Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along. It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.","Moments later, our car found itself between two rows of trees that intertwined at certain points to form a real arch, making me feel like we were entering a tunnel. Occasionally, we encountered massive rock formations that loomed like towering shadows, threatening passersby. And every time a gust of wind roared through the crevices in the rocks, the treetops would shake violently. The weather grew colder by the moment, and delicate snowflakes began to fall, soon turning everything around us into a blanket of white. The wind still carried the mournful, sorrowful howls of the house dogs to us, but those sounds gradually faded as we had traveled quite a distance. But on the contrary, the wolf howls that were previously faint now suddenly became more intense, more urgent; those mournful howls grew closer and seemed to be surrounding us. To be honest, I began to feel terrified. It seems that the horses also have an uneasy look like me. However, the man still calmly looked around as if nothing had happened. I strained my eyes to distinguish something in the night, but everything was still just a pitch-black color.",6.649,5.704,"Before long, we were surrounded by trees; in some places, they leaned over the road as if we were passing through a tunnel; once again, huge frowning rocks on both sides were bravely protecting us. Even though we were in a sheltered area, we could hear the increasing sound of the wind; because the wind was moaning and howling between the rocks, and as we moved quickly, the branches of the trees were hitting each other. The air grew colder and beautiful, powdery snow began to fall; so much so that soon we and everything around us were covered with a white blanket. The sharp wind still carried the howling of the dogs; although the sounds were getting fainter as we progressed on our way. The howling of the wolves was coming closer and closer, as if they were surrounding us from every direction. I had begun to get terribly scared, and the horses shared my fear; but the coachman was not disturbed at all. He continued to turn his head from side to side, but I couldn't see anything in the dark.",29.796,29.403,"Soon we found ourselves obstructed by trees, which in some places completely covered the path, forming a sort of tunnel through which we passed. And in addition to that, gigantic menacing boulders flanked us on either side. Despite being thus protected, we could hear the wind rising, as it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees clashed against each other as we passed along the path. It grew colder and a fine snow began to fall, so that in a moment everything around us was covered by a white mantle. The sharp wind still carried the howls of the dogs, though these diminished as we moved away. The howling of the wolves, on the other hand, came closer and closer, as if they were approaching us from all sides. I felt terribly distressed, and the horses shared my fear. However, the coachman did not seem to have any fear; he continuously turned his head to the left and to the right, but I could see nothing through the darkness.",32.227,31.837
38,"Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare. Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness around us I could watch the driver’s motions. He went rapidly to where the blue flame arose—it must have been very faint, for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all—and gathering a few stones, formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it, for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.","I suddenly jolted when I noticed a bright green light flickering some distance to the left of our car. The coachman must have noticed the light at the same time as I did, because he abruptly pulled the reins to stop the horse, then jumped down and disappeared into the night. I stood there, dazed, wondering what I should do... The howling of wolves grew closer to our car. While I was still hesitating, the man suddenly reappeared in front of me, said nothing, and quickly climbed back onto the seat to urge the horse onward. That light kept haunting my mind, and it seemed like I could see it flickering again and again. Yes, later when I think back, I still have the feeling that I fell into a terrifying nightmare. After a while, that greenish spot appeared so close to us that in the deep darkness, I could clearly see every gesture of the coachman. He quickly stepped towards the flickering light - though it was a very weak light, just enough to distinguish the surrounding ground - and then picked up some stones and piled them into a heap. I found his actions very strange. Another time, when that dim halo appeared: standing between the light and me, he didn't bother to block my view anymore. I continued to clearly see that flickering and mysterious light. I was stunned for a moment, but then told myself that my eyes had deceived me because I wanted so badly to pierce through the darkness... After that, we no longer saw those greenish spots, but the sound of wolves remained, as if they were forming a circle that was gradually closing in, tightening around our carriage.",5.897,4.799,"Suddenly, I saw a faint, flickering blue flame ahead on our left. At the same moment, the driver saw it too; he immediately stopped the horses, got down, and disappeared into the darkness. I didn't know what to do, and as the howling of the wolves got closer, I became even more indecisive; but just as I was thinking about this, the driver suddenly reappeared, took his place without saying a word, and we continued our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep and continued seeing this event in my dream because it seemed to repeat endlessly; now, looking back, everything seems like a terrible nightmare. At one point, the flame appeared so close to the road that despite the surrounding darkness, I could observe the driver's movements. He quickly went to where the flame was - the flame must have been quite faint because it didn't seem to illuminate the area around it - and he gathered some stones and arranged them in a certain way. Once, a strange optical illusion occurred: When the driver stood between me and the flame, he didn't block it, because despite him standing between us, I could see the ghostly shape of the flames. This situation startled me, but since the image was fleeting, I concluded that my eyes were straining in the dark and deceiving me. Then, for a while, no blue flame was seen and we quickly moved into the darkness, surrounded by the howling of wolves that seemed to be following us in a moving circle.",25.934,25.584,"Suddenly, far off to the left, I spotted the faint glow of a blue flame. The coachman saw it at the same time; he immediately stopped the horses and, jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I didn't know what to do, especially since the howls of the wolves seemed to be getting closer; but while I hesitated, the coachman suddenly appeared again, and without saying a word, took his seat and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep or repeatedly dreamed about the incident, for it happened over and over again, and now, when I recall it, it seems like a kind of horrifying nightmare. Once the flame appeared so close to the road that even in the darkness surrounding us, I could observe the coachman's movements. He quickly went to where the blue flame was (it must have been very faint, because it didn't seem to illuminate the area around it), and taking some stones, he placed them in a significant pattern. On one occasion, I was the victim of a strange optical effect: as he stood between the flame and me, he didn't seem to obstruct it, because I continued to see its ghostly glow. This astonished me, but since it was only a momentary effect, I supposed that my eyes had deceived me due to the effort I was making in the darkness. Then, for a while, the blue flames no longer appeared, and we sped through the darkness with the howls of wolves surrounding us, as if they were following us in encircling circles.",32.937,32.672
39,"At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled. For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import.","I don't understand why the coachman jumped off the carriage once again, and this time he went even farther away. While he was absent, the horses began to panic more than ever before, snorting and neighing loudly. I couldn't understand what made them so frightened, because at that moment, the moon suddenly appeared, flickering among the dark clouds, behind a majestic and jagged mountain peak, and the howling of the wolves abruptly ceased. Under the pale moonlight, I trembled as I realized that wolves had suddenly appeared out of nowhere, surrounding the carriage, baring their white teeth and red tongues; their fur bristling like porcupine quills. In the eerily silent night, they looked even more terrifying than when they were howling a hundred times over. I began to think of a danger that could strike at any moment. The fear had paralyzed my entire body.",10.65,9.729,"Finally, there came a moment when the driver went farther than he had ever gone before, and in his absence, the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and neigh in fear. I could see no reason for this, as the howling of the wolves had completely ceased; but just then, the moon, gliding through the dark clouds, appeared behind the rugged ridge of a pine-covered rock, and by its light, I saw a circle of wolves surrounding us, with their white teeth, red tongues hanging out of their mouths, long strong legs, and coarse fur. In the relentless silence that had fallen upon them, they were a hundred times more terrifying than when they howled. As for me, I felt as if I were paralyzed with fear. One can only truly understand the real meaning of such terrifying things when confronted with them.",31.554,31.076,"Finally, the coachman went farther away than he had done before, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble more than ever and to paw and neigh in fear. I could not see any cause for their nervousness, as the howling of the wolves had completely ceased; but then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of an overhanging rock covered with pines, and in its light, I saw around us a circle of wolves, with white teeth and red, hanging tongues, with long, sinuous limbs and bristly fur. They were a hundred times more terrifying in that gloomy silence that surrounded them than when they were howling. As for me, I fell into a kind of paralysis of fear. Only when a man comes face to face with such horrors can he understand their true meaning.",45.376,45.038
40,"All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see; but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.","The pack of wolves suddenly howled as if the moonlight had some special power over them. The horses could no longer remain calm. They glanced around furtively as if seeking some kind of pity, but the circle of life, the terrifying circle, still tightly surrounded them. I called the coachman, I shouted for him to turn back. I felt that my only remaining chance was to try to break through the eerie encirclement so that he could turn back. Therefore, I shouted even louder and pounded on the carriage door with the hope of scaring away the wolves lurking nearby. How he ended up there, I do not know, I only know that when I heard his authoritative and powerful voice and looked in that direction, I saw him standing in the middle of the road. When his long arms made a gesture as if pushing back some invisible obstacle, the pack of wolves suddenly retreated. At that moment, the moon was completely covered by a massive black cloud. The sky became pitch black again.",11.044,10.223,"As if the moonlight had a special effect on them, the wolves suddenly started howling. The horses jumped here and there, rearing up and looking around in despair with pitiable eyes; but the living ring of terror surrounded them from every direction, and they were inevitably trapped within the circle. I called out to the coachman to come, because it seemed our only chance was to break out of the circle and help the man come to us. I shouted and struck the side of the carriage, hoping that the noise would scare the wolves in that direction and give the coachman a chance to realize the trap we had fallen into. I don't know how he got there, but I heard the coachman's voice rise in a commanding tone, and when I looked towards the sound, I saw him standing on the road. When he waved his long arms as if pushing aside an intangible barrier, the wolves retreated, far back. At that moment, a heavy cloud passed in front of the moon, and thus we were plunged into darkness again.",23.119,22.602,"Suddenly, all the wolves began to howl as if the moonlight had a peculiar effect on them. The horses reared and backed away, looking helplessly around with eyes that rolled painfully; but the living circle of terror accompanied them on every side; they were forced to remain within it. I shouted to the coachman to come back, as it seemed to me that our last alternative was to try to break through the circle, and to aid his return I shouted and struck one side of the carriage, hoping that the noise would scare the wolves on that side and thus give him a chance to get back to the coach. How he finally arrived is something I do not know; but I heard his voice rise in an imperious tone of command, and looking towards the place from where it came, I saw him standing in the middle of the road. He waved his long arms as if trying to remove an impalpable obstacle, and the wolves retreated; just at that moment, a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so we were plunged back into darkness.",36.631,36.269
41,"When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.","When my eyes gradually adjusted to the darkness, I realized the man was climbing into the vehicle, while the pack of wolves had completely disappeared. Everything happened so bizarrely and ominously that I did not dare to speak or make any movement. The moonlight did not reappear, and at that moment, the journey seemed to stretch on endlessly for me. We continued on our way. The road seemed to keep climbing endlessly, although occasionally the vehicle would suddenly plunge down short slopes, only to then rush up a new incline. In a state of weariness and disappointment, I suddenly realized that the coachman had unexpectedly driven the carriage into the courtyard of a massive, dilapidated castle. The tall, dark windows did not emit a single ray of light, and the pitch-black arrow slits stood out even more against the sky, which was now pale with moonlight: the moon once again appeared, hovering among the heavy clouds.",10.494,9.638,"When I was able to see again, the driver was climbing into the car and the wolves had disappeared from sight. All of this was so strange and so eerie that a terrible fear descended upon me; I was afraid to speak or move. As we continued on our path, which was plunged into complete darkness because the rolling clouds hid the moon, time seemed to stand still. We kept climbing; although there were occasional steep descents, we were mostly ascending. Suddenly, I became aware of the fact that the driver was stopping the horses in the courtyard of a very large and ruined castle, whose high, dark windows let in no light and whose broken battlements formed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.",36.866,36.352,"When I could see again, the driver was getting into the carriage and the wolves had disappeared. All of this was so strange and mysterious that I was overcome by a panic fear, and I didn't have the courage to move or speak. Time seemed endless as we continued our journey, now in complete darkness, for the black clouds obscured the moon. We continued ascending, with occasional periods of rapid descents, but ascending most of the time. Suddenly, I became aware that the driver was stopping the horses in the inner courtyard of an immense, partially ruined castle, from whose tall black windows not a single ray of light emerged, and whose broken walls showed a jagged line that stood out against the sky illuminated by the moonlight.",36.602,36.063

44,"5 May.—I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.","• May 5 Perhaps I was dozing off, otherwise how could I have been startled by the scene in the ancient castle. In the dark night, the castle courtyard seemed to be more spacious; yes, with the intricate and dark pathways leading to the towering arches, the courtyard appeared even larger than it actually was. The horse-drawn carriage came to a stop, ending an impressive journey.",6.14,4.242,"May 5. - I must have fallen asleep because if I were fully awake, I would have noticed approaching such a remarkable place. In the dark, the courtyard appeared considerably wide, and it might have seemed larger than it actually was because many dark paths opened under the large, round arches.

45,"When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings.","The coachman got down first and helped me down afterward. Once again, I felt an immense strength emanating from him. His hand was like a steel vise that could crush mine if he wanted to. Then, he took my luggage and placed it on the ground near where I was standing, which was close to a large, old door studded with iron nails, the doorframe built from large stones. Even though it was still very dark, I could make out the carvings on the stone, worn away significantly by time and the elements. After unloading all my luggage, the man jumped back onto the carriage, pulled the reins, and drove the horses away, disappearing into one of the dark narrow paths.",9.865,8.058,"When the car stopped, the driver jumped down and extended his hand to help me get out. Once again, I couldn't help but notice his tremendous strength. Honestly, his hand was like a steel clamp that could crush mine if he wanted to. Then, he took my suitcases out of the car and placed them beside me on the ground as I stood by the large door located at the protruding entrance made of old, iron-nailed, and magnificent stone. Even in the dim light, I could see that the stone was impressively adorned with carvings, but it had been quite worn down by time and weather. As I stood there, the driver jumped back into his seat and shook the reins; the horses set off and, along with the car, disappeared into one of the dark gates.",31.667,31.114,"When the carriage stopped, the coachman jumped down and offered me his hand to help me disembark.

Even in that dim light, I could see that the stone was profusely carved, but the carvings had been worn away by time and rain. While I stood there, the coachman jumped back onto his seat and shook the reins; the horses started moving, and they disappeared under one of those black openings, carriage and all.",37.515,37.028
46,"I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people? What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor’s clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor’s clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor—for just before leaving London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to wait the coming of the morning.","I stood still like a statue, not knowing what to do. There was no bell to ring, no knocker to call, and there was no way anyone would hear my call through those solid walls or from those pitch-black windows. All I could do was wait, and the waiting felt endless to me. Terror and anxiety once again overwhelmed my mind. So where had I come to, and what kind of people would I have to meet? Had I embarked on some bizarre adventure? Was what happened to me—a notary clerk coming here to resolve a real estate transaction near London—just an ordinary trouble in life? I rubbed my eyes and pinched myself all over to make sure I was still awake, because I thought I was having a nightmare before. I told myself that I would open my eyes and find myself at home, and then the dawn would gradually shine through my bedroom window: it wouldn't be the first night I fell into a restless sleep after an exhausting day. I was still awake! When I pinched myself, I still felt pain, my eyes had not deceived me at all! I was fully awake and standing in front of a castle in the Carpathians! The only thing left to do: patiently wait for a new day.",13.349,12.828,"I stood silently where I was, because I didn't know what to do. There wasn't a single trace of a bell or door knocker around; it was unlikely that my voice would pierce through these frowning walls and dark window gaps. The time I spent waiting seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears swarming over me. What kind of place had I come to, what kind of people was I among? What a dreadful adventure had I embarked upon? Was this a usual event in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent to explain the purchase of a property in London to a foreigner? Solicitor's clerk! Mina would not have liked this at all. Solicitor, because I had learned that I had passed the exam just before leaving London; but was I now truly a solicitor? I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if I was awake. All of this seemed like a terrible nightmare to me, and just like after a day when I had overworked, I hoped to suddenly wake up and find myself at home with the dawn trying to enter through the window. But my body responded to the pinching test, and my eyes were not deceiving me. I was indeed awake and in the Carpathian Mountains. Now, all I had to do was be patient and wait for the morning to come.",38.005,37.73,"I remained silent where I was because I really didn't know what to do. There were no signs of any bell or knocker, and through those grim walls and dark windows, it was most likely that my voice wouldn't penetrate. The time I waited seemed infinite, and I felt doubts and fears assailing me. What kind of place had I arrived at, and among what kind of people had I found myself? What kind of gloomy adventure had I embarked on? Was this a normal incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent to explain the purchase of a property in London to a foreigner? Solicitor's clerk! Mina wouldn't like that. Better solicitor, since just before leaving London I received the news that I had passed my exam; so now I was a full-fledged solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself, to see if I was awake. Everything seemed like a horrible nightmare, and I hoped to wake up suddenly finding myself at home with the dawn struggling through the windows, just as had happened to me on other occasions after working too much the previous day. But my flesh responded to the pinch test, and my eyes were not deceived. It was undeniable that I was awake and in the Carpathians. All I could do was be patient and wait for the dawn to arrive.",37.508,37.223

As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could not conceal.

Involuntarily, I glanced up at the window: the first rays of dawn had appeared. The silent atmosphere seemed to weigh heavily on everything.

Strangely, they had hairs in the center of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp point. When the count leaned toward me and one of his hands touched me, I couldn't suppress a shiver. It might have been his breath, which was fetid, but the truth is that a terrible feeling of nausea overtook me, which, despite my efforts, I couldn't repress. Evidently, the count, noticing it, withdrew, and with a somewhat gloomy smile, which showed more of his protruding teeth than before, sat down again on his own side facing the fireplace. We both remained silent for a few moments, and when he looked toward the window, I saw the first faint glimmers of dawn approaching.

When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one. There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value. The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old, though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court, but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.

Seeing the valuable treasures scattered all over the house, I couldn't help but be surprised at the lack of other simple but useful items. The intricately carved gold tableware certainly had a very high value. The curtains were all made from the most splendid and luxurious fabrics, even the canopy over my bed was the same. All the armchairs and sofas in the house were also upholstered with premium fabrics. Despite having endured many centuries, the chairs here still retained their original state; I had seen similar chairs in Hampton Court, but most of them were rickety or had been gnawed by rodents. However, there was no room in this building that had a mirror. Not even on my table was there a fragment, so whenever I needed to shave or comb my hair, I had to use the tiny mirror attached to my travel bag. Even the servants were missing, at least until now I hadn't seen a single soul beyond the threshold. Another strange thing: since arriving here, I hadn't heard a single sound, not even the smallest, except for the distant mournful howls of the wolves.

81,"This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to talk, if only for talking’s sake, I asked him many questions regarding things that had already happened to me or come within my notice. Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year—last night, in fact, when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway—a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed. “That treasure has been hidden,” he went on, “in the region through which you came last night, there can be but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out to meet them—men and women, the aged and the children too—and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil.”","The count's insinuation added more interest to the conversation; noticing that he was enjoying the talk, meaning he wanted to converse just for the sake of it, I posed many questions to him about what I should take note of in his country, or about what I had experienced. Occasionally, he would avoid the issue or steer the conversation in another direction, claiming he did not understand what I meant. But generally, he answered my questions directly. After quite a while, feeling more at ease, I began to talk about the eerie night I arrived at the castle and asked him to explain: among a series of events, why did the coachman jump off the carriage whenever he saw a greenish light, and why did he keep heading towards that light. He informed me that according to Transylvanian folklore, on a certain night of the year - the night when demons are believed to rule the world, one would see a blue flame appear exactly where a treasure is buried underground. The old man continued the story: — There is a treasure buried in the place you passed by that night, for this is a land that the Wallachians, Saxons, and Turks have contested for centuries. Indeed, there is not an inch of this land that has not been stained with the blood of patriots and invaders alike. It was an extraordinary period. The Austrian and Hungarian tribes constantly threatened us. Our ancestors, both old and young, women and men alike, all bravely fought against the enemy. They clung to the mountains, waiting on the cliffs, ambushing, and from these high peaks, they caused landslides and avalanches to bury the invaders. But in the end, the enemy stubbornly pushed through. Nevertheless, they found almost nothing but empty gardens and deserted homes in this country, for the people had buried everything they had underground.",7.44,6.849,"This led to quite a bit of conversation, and since it was clear that he wanted to talk, even if just for the sake of talking, I asked him many questions about the things that had happened to me and the things I had noticed so far. Sometimes he diverted the topic or pretended not to understand and changed the subject; but generally, he answered everything I asked honestly. Then, as time passed and I somehow became more courageous, I asked about some of the strange events of the previous night, for example, why the coachman went to the places where we saw the blue flames. Was it true that these flames indicated where the gold was hidden? Then the Count explained to me that according to a widespread belief, on a certain night of the year - actually, last night when supposedly all evil spirits roamed freely - a blue flame is believed to appear over any place where treasure is hidden. “There is almost no doubt,” he continued, “that treasure is hidden in the area you passed through last night, because those are the lands that have been fought over for centuries by the Vlachs, Saxons, and Turks. There is not a single handful of soil in this entire region that has not been enriched by the blood of either patriots or invaders. In the old days, there were exciting times when Austrians and Hungarians invaded in hordes, and patriots - men, women, young, old - went out to resist them and waited at the tops of the rocks above the passes so they could crush and destroy them with artificial avalanches. When the invaders won, they found very little, because everything that existed there had been hidden in the friendly soil.”",28.712,28.439,"This led to much conversation; and it was evident that he wanted to talk even if it was just for the sake of talking. I asked him many questions about things that had already happened to me or that I had already taken note of. Sometimes he dodged the topic or changed the conversation, pretending not to understand me; but generally, he answered everything I asked in the most straightforward manner. Then, as time went on and I became more confident, I asked him about some of the strange events of the previous night, such as why the coachman went to the places where he saw the blue flame. Then he explained to me that it was a common belief that on a certain night of the year (in fact, the previous night, when evil spirits are believed to have unlimited powers) a blue flame appears in any place where some treasure has been hidden. That treasures have been hidden in the region through which you passed last night -he continued-, is something that is beyond all doubt. This has been land where the Vlachs, Saxons, and Turks have fought for centuries. To tell the truth, it would be difficult to find a square foot of land in this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or invaders. In ancient times there were turbulent periods, when the Austrians and Hungarians arrived in hordes and the patriots went out to confront them, men and women, old and young, awaited their arrival among the rocks above the gorges to hurl destruction and death upon them with their artificial avalanches. When the invaders triumphed, they found very little loot, as everything that existed was hidden in the kind earth.",34.634,34.405
82,"“But how,” said I, “can it have remained so long undiscovered, when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?” The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long, sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:—","— But why - I asked - have those treasures been hidden for so long, while the blue lights clearly indicate the hiding places to people who, surely, only want one thing: to sit and watch them? The old count burst out laughing, baring his long and sharp teeth:",4.653,2.535,"""Ama,"" I said, ""how could it have remained undiscovered for so long when there is such clear evidence that people would see if they took the trouble to look?""

85,"“Come,” he said at last, “tell me of London and of the house which you have procured for me.” With an apology for my remissness, I went into my own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw’s Guide. When I came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:—","— Well, - the Count said - now please tell me the news about London and all the details you can provide about the house you intend to buy for me. I apologize for my carelessness and ask to go to my room to find the contract papers. While arranging the papers, I suddenly heard the clinking sound of porcelain and metal from the next room, and when I passed by, I saw that the dining table had been cleared, and the lights had been turned on, as it was getting dark. The lights in the library were also lit, and the count was lying on the couch reading a book. Among a pile of books, he chose Bradshaw's ""Handbook to England."" Seeing me enter, he put down the book and stood up to clear the scattered books and newspapers on the table. We began to review the entire plan and the numbers recorded in the papers I had just brought over.

The house looks very massive and is certainly built from the medieval period. A part of the house is indeed built with rather thick stone slabs, the rare windows seen on the building are all placed high and protected by heavy iron bars, perhaps this was once a watchtower. Adjacent to it is a small church. Without a key, I couldn't enter this private church. But I took photos from many angles. The sanctuary must have been built later, and I couldn't estimate the measurements. That's all I can say.

Come; I am informed that your supper is ready.” He took my arm, and we went into the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate. After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host’s wishes in every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide. They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:—","The old count returned to the library after nearly an hour. — Oh, look! - The old man exclaimed. - Still engrossed in reading? It's still very early now. But you know, it's not always necessary to work. Come on, I was just informed that your meal is ready. The old man took my hand and we walked to the next room, where my soup had already been served. Once again, he apologized: he had already dined out. But just like the night before, he sat close to me to talk while I was eating. He asked me one question after another, even though I had finished eating a long time ago. Hours passed by, and I was sure it was already very late at night, but I didn't say anything; I felt my duty at that moment was to please the host in every way. Moreover, I didn't feel like sleeping; the long sleep from the previous night had completely refreshed me after a tiring journey. However, for some reason, I felt a shiver, the kind of shiver one often experiences just before dawn, and this made me think of a tidal wave. It is said that those who are dying often take their last breath at the beginning of a new day or when the tide changes. All those who have ever spent time contemplating the moment when night turns to day will easily understand me at this moment. I suddenly heard a clear, distant rooster crow, almost echoing from a supernatural realm. Count Dracula stood up abruptly and exclaimed:",8.182,7.418,"When the Count returned, half an hour had passed. “Aha!” he said, “Are you still with your books? Good! But you must not work all the time. Come; it was said that your dinner is ready.” He took me by the arm and we went to the next room where a perfect dinner was ready on the table. The Count once again excused himself, saying that he had eaten while he was out. But like the previous night, he sat and chatted with me while I ate my meal. After dinner, just like the previous night, I smoked a cigar, and the Count stayed with me for hours, chatting and asking questions on all possible topics. I felt that it was really late, but I said nothing because I felt I had to fulfill my host's wishes in every aspect. Since the long sleep from the previous day had refreshed me, I was not sleepy; but I couldn't help feeling the chill that comes at dawn and resembles the change in tide. They say that people close to death often die at dawn or when the tide changes, and anyone who is tired and remains on duty to experience this change can believe this view. In the clean morning air, we suddenly heard a rooster crow with an unusual sharpness; Count Dracula, who jumped to his feet, said:",27.824,27.539,"Approximately an hour passed before the count returned. –Aha! – he said –, still with your books? Good! But you must not work all the time. Come; I have been told that your dinner is already prepared.

Once again the count apologized, as he had dined during the time I had been out of the house. But just like the previous night, he sat and chatted while I ate. After dinner I smoked, and like the previous night, the count stayed with me, chatting and asking questions about all possible topics, hour after hour. I felt that it was getting very late, but I said nothing, as I felt obligated to satisfy my host's wishes in any way possible. I did not feel sleepy, as the long night's sleep from the previous day had strengthened me; but I could not avoid experiencing that chill that overtakes one with the arrival of dawn, which is in its own way, the change of tide. They say that people who are dying generally die with the change of dawn or with the change of the tide; and anyone who has been tired and forced to stay at their post has experienced this change in the atmosphere and can believe it. Suddenly, we heard the crowing of a rooster, arriving with supernatural shrillness through the clear morning; Count Dracula jumped to his feet, and said:",36.12,35.872

I want to leave here - leave here peacefully and never come back again! Perhaps staying up late every night has put my nervous system through a tremendous ordeal. I could endure this existence if at least I could talk to someone else, but there is absolutely no one, except for the host count. If I have to speak my mind from the bottom of my heart, to be honest, I am afraid that I am the only living soul here... Yes, if I were allowed to reveal things as they truly are, then perhaps I could be a little more patient to endure, to restrain my ever-vivid imagination.

97,"I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window, and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and heard the Count’s voice saying to me, “Good-morning.” I started, for it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly, but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count’s salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken. This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.","Reclining on the bed, I only managed to doze off for a few hours before waking up. Feeling that I couldn't sleep any longer, I jumped up and grabbed the mirror hanging on the window latch to prepare for shaving. Suddenly, I felt a hand gently placed on my shoulder, followed by the voice of the old count: ""Good morning!"" I was startled, truly amazed that I hadn't seen him enter the room, for looking through the mirror, I had clearly seen the entire length of the room behind me. In my surprise, I had slightly nicked my face with the razor, something I didn't immediately realize at that moment. While responding to the count, I looked back into the mirror, trying to understand how I could have been mistaken. This time, there could be no mistake; I knew he was standing very close to me, I only needed to turn my face slightly to see him standing right by my shoulder, yet strangely, his reflection did not appear in the mirror! Everything behind me was reflected in the mirror, but there was only one man there, and that was me, the one writing these diary entries. Another astonishing event added to a series of mysteries that I could not comprehend, further aggravating the discomfort I was enduring with the count's presence. Then I suddenly noticed a bloodstain under my chin. I put down the razor and turned away to find a piece of cotton. Looking at my face, the count's eyes suddenly gleamed with a malicious frenzy. Suddenly, he grabbed my neck. I quickly stepped back, causing his hand to miss and hit the chain with the small cross I was wearing around my neck. A moment passed, and his appearance changed noticeably, the madness in his eyes vanished as quickly as it had appeared.",13.895,13.463,"When I went to bed, I could only sleep for a few hours and got up feeling that I couldn't sleep any longer.

This time, there could be no mistake because the man was close to me and I could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in the mirror! The entire room behind me was visible; but there was no sign of anyone else besides myself. This situation was frightening, and piling on top of so many strange things, the vague unease I always felt when the Count was near began to increase, but just then I saw that the cut was bleeding slightly; the blood was running down to my chin. I slightly turned to look for a bandage and put down the razor. When he saw my face, the Count's eyes gleamed with a demonic rage, and suddenly he grabbed my throat. I quickly pulled back and, well, touched the string of the rosary holding the cross.

It is more dangerous than you think in this country.” Then seizing the shaving glass, he went on: “And this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief. It is a foul bauble of man’s vanity. Away with it!” and opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below.

Throw it away,” he said, opening the heavy window with a single stroke of his terrible hand and hurling the mirror outside; the mirror shattered into a thousand pieces on the stone floor of the courtyard below.

He must be a very peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice.

From this place, I could take in a vast landscape. The castle I was standing in was built right on the edge of a magnificent abyss. A stone thrown from a window of the castle would not hit anything in its path as it fell. In my view was an endless sea of green trees, occasionally revealing spots that I knew were mountain hollows.

104,"WHEN I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me. I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me that I was helpless I sat down quietly—as quietly as I have ever done anything in my life—and began to think over what was best to be done. I am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears, or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and shall need, all my brains to get through.","Prisoner! When I realized that reality, I thought I was going to go mad. I kept running up and down the stairs, trying to open any door I came across, peeking through every window I passed. After a short while, the feeling of helplessness extinguished all my willpower. After a few hours, honestly, just thinking about being like a rat struggling in a cage made me want to go insane. However, once I understood that struggling was futile, I began to calm down to think and find a way to overcome the situation. But at this moment, my mind could only think aimlessly and couldn't find any solution. I only knew one thing for sure, that it was completely useless to tell the count about my feelings. More than anyone, he knew I was a prisoner here, he wanted it that way, and surely had a reason for it. Therefore, if I confided in him, it was clear he would never admit the truth. So I thought that before clarifying anything, the first thing to do was not to speak about what I had just discovered, not to let him suspect my fears... and always keep a calm demeanor. I understood my situation very clearly at that moment: either I would be a child haunted by fear, or fall into a more difficult situation, and if I accepted that, in the coming days, I would need, very much need, a clear mind.",9.753,9.14,"I was almost out of my mind when I realized I was a prisoner. I frantically tried every door I could find and looked out of every window, running up and down the stairs; but soon my belief in my helplessness overshadowed everything else.

But when I concluded that I was helpless, I sat down quietly -more quietly than I had ever done in my life- and began to think about what the best course of action would be. I am still thinking and have not yet come to a definite decision. I am sure of only one thing: There is no point in explaining my thoughts to the Count. He knows very well that I am imprisoned here; since he is the one who did it and undoubtedly has his reasons for it, if I trust him with these facts, he will only deceive me. As far as I can see, my only plan is to keep what I know and fear to myself and stay alert.

105,"I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along thought—that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them. This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful, however, not to awake his suspicion.","Lost in thought, I suddenly heard the sound of a door closing downstairs: the old count had returned. He did not go straight to the library. I had to stealthily return to my room. I was very surprised to see him in there making my bed! Despite my immense astonishment, it confirmed something I had suspected since setting foot in this castle: there were no servants in the house. And a moment later, when I looked through the crack in the door and saw him setting the dining table in the dining room, I had no more doubts, for if he was taking on these tasks, it was simply because he had no servants to do them for him. I shuddered in fear at the thought that if there was no one else in the castle, the coachman who brought me here was none other than the old count himself. If that were true, what would it say about the power he wielded by raising his hand to command the wolves? Why were the people at the Bistritz hotel and all my fellow travelers on the first coach so fearful for me? Why did they give me a small cross, a sprig of garlic, and a wild rose? May God bless the kind-hearted woman who gave me the rosary with the cross? For every time I touch that cross, I feel as if I am imbued with strength and courage. I was very surprised to see that the cross, an inanimate object, something I had long considered useless, merely a symbol of faith, could somewhat save me from feelings of loneliness and despair. Does that small cross have an intrinsic power, or is it merely an object that revives old memories? I hope that one day, I will be able to test the matter to provide an answer. In the meantime, I must grasp as much as possible about Count Dracula; perhaps it will help me understand everything that is happening. And perhaps tonight he will reveal many things if I steer the conversation in this direction. However, I must also be very cautious so that he cannot suspect my inner thoughts.",13.55,13.186,"I had barely come to this decision when I heard the great door below close and realized that the Count had returned. He did not come to the library immediately, so I carefully went to my own room and found him making the bed. This was a strange situation, but it confirmed what I had thought from the beginning, that there were no servants in the house. Later, when I saw him setting the table in the dining room through the crack in the door hinge, I became even more certain; if he was doing all these servant tasks himself, it was proof that there was no one else to do them. This situation frightened me, because if there was no one else in the castle, the driver of the carriage that brought me here must also have been the Count himself. This is a terrifying thought; because if so, what does it mean that he could control the wolves by silently raising his hand? How was it that everyone in Bistriţa and in the carriage was afraid for me? What did it mean to be given a cross, garlic, wild rose, and rowan? God bless the good woman who hung the cross around my neck, for every time I touch it, it gives me peace and strength. How strange that something I was taught to approach with disapproval and see as idolatry is helping me in a time of loneliness and trouble. Is there something in the nature of this object, or is it a tangible aid that carries memories of love and peace? If possible, I must investigate this matter and come to a conclusion about it someday. In the meantime, I must learn everything I can about Count Dracula, as it may help me understand what is happening. Tonight, if I steer the conversation that way, he might talk about himself.

It is amusing that something I was taught to view with disdain and as idolatrous could be of help in times of loneliness and trouble.

106,"Midnight.—I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he afterwards explained by saying that to a boyar the pride of his house and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their fate is his fate.

It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of his race:—","• Midnight I had a very long conversation with the old count. I asked him a few questions about the history of Transylvania, and he answered them very enthusiastically. The topic I asked about seemed to really excite him! When he talked about life, people, and especially when he spoke about battles, I saw him eager as if he were participating in those events himself. He said that his position showed one thing: for a nobleman like him, the glory of his lineage and his name was his personal pride, the honor of his family was his honor, and the fate of his lineage was his fate. Every time he spoke about his lineage, he would refer to ""us"" as monarchs often do. I want to recreate here everything he told me, because recording is also a personal pleasure of mine. Perhaps I have heard the entire history of the land of Transylvania. The more he talked, the more excited he became; while speaking, he paced back and forth in the room, his hands either caressing his white mustache or gripping any object he touched as if he wanted to crush it. I tried to record a part of what he told me related to the history of his land.",11.131,10.468,"Midnight. - I had a long conversation with the Count. I asked him a few questions about the history of Transylvania, and he was filled with impeccable enthusiasm on the subject.

Later, while explaining this, he said that for a boyar, the pride of his house and name is his own pride, their glory is his own glory, and their fate is his own fate. Whenever he spoke of his house, he always said ""we,"" and he always spoke in the plural as if a king were speaking. I wish I could have recorded his words exactly as he expressed them, because it was utterly fascinating to me. What he narrated seemed to encompass the entire history of the country. As he spoke, his excitement grew, and he wandered around the room, tugging at his large white mustache and grasping everything in his path as if he would crush it with great force.

107,"“We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here, in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame, till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as Attila, whose blood is in these veins?” He held up his arms. “Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say, ‘water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.’ Who more gladly than we throughout the Four Nations received the ‘bloody sword,’ or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They said that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the Szekelys—and the Dracula as their heart’s blood, their brains, and their swords—can boast a record that mushroom growths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over. Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.”","“We, the Szekelys, have the right to be proud, for we carry the blood of brave and courageous peoples - who fought like real lions to protect their supremacy. In this country, always bustling with countless European ethnicities, the warriors from Iceland brought with them the belligerent spirit that Thor and Wodin instilled in them, and they brought madness to every European shore - of course, European, but also to the shores of Asia and the dark continent to the extent that the people of those lands thought they were being attacked by packs of wolves. Even when invading here, those suspicious warriors turned the famously warlike Huns into dying victims and forced them to admit that in those executioners ran the blood of old witches, those who had been driven out of Scythia and gathered in the desert with demons. Indeed, what fools? Has there ever been a witch or demon as powerful as Attila, whose blood flows in our veins?” - He said while rolling up his sleeves to show me.- “We must admit we are a warlike and proud race, so is it any wonder that the Magyars, Lombards, Avars, or Turks tried to invade us and were all driven back? Is it any wonder that Arpad and his army, wanting to invade the motherland, were stopped right at the border? Then when the Hungarians attempted to invade from the east, the victorious Magyars allied with the Szekelys. From then on, for many centuries, we were entrusted with guarding the Turkish border. Moreover, our duty seemed never-ending, because, according to the Turkish proverb, “the tree stands still, but the wind never stops. ”So among the four nations, which nation was more honored to receive the “bloodstained sword” than us, which nation quickly rallied under the emperor's banner when he called for battle more than us? And when the flags of the Wallachians and Magyars were lowered before the scythe flag, when will the great shame of my country be washed away? Wasn't it one of my relatives who crossed the Danube to fight against the Turks on his own land? Yes, it was a Dracula! Truly cursing a brother of his, he sold the nation to the Turks, causing many to suffer the shame of slavery! And it was also a Dracula who crossed the river years ago and passed on the passionate patriotism to a descendant who then crossed the river with his army to invade Turkey again? This man, after fighting and retreating, returned many times to lead the army, leaving behind a battlefield strewn with soldiers' bodies, because he knew that in the end, only he would win! People say he did it for himself! But what would armies mean without a commander? Where would the battle go without a heart and mind to guide it? Moreover, after the battle of Mohacs, we shattered the Hungarian domination. We, the Draculas, once again joined the ranks of commanders who achieved this victory! Well? Young friend, the Szekelys and Draculas were the blood, brain, and sword of the armies - the Szekelys can be proud of having done what the arrogant Hapsburgs and Romanoffs could not...But the war is over. Blood is now considered a precious thing in our disgraceful peacetime, and now, the glory of our great ancestors is just a fairy tale.”",11.471,11.209,"“We Seklers have the right to be proud, because in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought like lions for mastery. The Finno-Ugric peoples brought the warrior spirit from Iceland to here, into the whirlpool of European races, given to them by Thor and Odin, and demonstrated with a terror that created the impression that werewolves had arrived in the coastal regions of Europe, yes, and also in the coastal regions of Asia and Africa. When they arrived here, they found the Huns, who swept across the earth like a living flame with their warrior fury, making the dying people think that the blood of those ancient witches, driven from Scythian lands and mating with desert demons, flowed in their veins. Fools! Fools! What devil or witch could be as great as Attila, whose blood flows in these veins?” He raised his arms. “Is it surprising that we are a conquering race; that we are proud; that when the Hungarians, Lombards, Avars, Bulgars, or Turks poured thousands into our borders, we repelled them? Is it strange that when Árpád and his forces swept through the homeland of the Hungarians and reached the border, they found us here, completing the Honfoglalás here? And when the Hungarian incursion swept eastward, the Seklers were considered relatives of the victorious Hungarians, and for centuries, the task of guarding the border of the Turkish country was entrusted to us; yes, and beyond that, the eternal duty of border protection - for, as the Turks say, ‘Water sleeps, the enemy does not’ - which of the ‘Four Nations’ that make up Transylvania took the ‘bloody sword’ with greater satisfaction than us, or who gathered under the King’s banner more quickly when the call to arms was made? When was the great shame of my nation, the shame of Kosovo, when the flags of the Vlachs and Hungarians remained under the Crescent, ever compensated? Was it not one of my race, as Voivode, who crossed the Danube and defeated the Turks in their own lands? He was indeed a Dracula! Shame on his worthless brother who, when defeated, sold his people to the Turks and subjected them to the shame of captivity! Indeed, was it not this Dracula who inspired another member of his race in later centuries to repeatedly cross the great river with his forces into Turkish lands; or, when repelled, to emerge again, again, and again, even if he alone survived the bloody battlefield where his troops were slaughtered, knowing he could achieve absolute victory alone? They said he thought only of himself. Pah! What use are peasants without their leaders? Where does war end without a brain and heart to lead? Again, after the Battle of Mohács, it was we who threw off the Hungarian yoke; we, those descended from Dracula’s blood, were among the leaders, because our spirit could not endure being unfree. Ah! Young gentleman, the Seklers - and the Draculas as the blood, brains, and swords of their hearts - can boast of a kind of fame that the mushroom-like Habsburgs and Romanovs could never possess.

Here too, when they arrived, they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the land like a living flame, so much so that the dying people believed that in their veins ran the blood of those ancient witches, who, expelled from Scythia, coupled with devils in the desert.

In such a transaction, a London notary could very well be tempted by personal gain or assist someone else in making money; I reiterate, that person will help me achieve my interests in the best way possible. Now let's assume that I, a very busy person, want to send goods, for example, to Newcastle, or to Durham, Harwich, or Dover, would it be easy for me to ask a businessman residing in one of these ports?

119,"What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins’s interest, not mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but in his own smooth, resistless way:—","If I don't agree, then what else can I do? In this matter, the person with the vested interest is Mr. Hawkins, not me, and I have to think of him, not myself. Moreover, in the words, the gaze, and especially in the behavior of Count Dracula, there is something that reminds me that I am a prisoner in his house, and even if I wanted to leave, I couldn't shorten my stay here.

So I determined to write only formal notes now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to some books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which were face down on the table.

Looking at the sheets of paper, and looking at his casually smiling face with long, sharp teeth protruding beyond his bright red lips, I understood what he had just told me, I understood that I would have to be careful with the letters, because he could read everything. Therefore, I decided to write only brief and rather meaningless letters at first, and then secretly write longer ones to Mr. Hawkins and Mina later. Indeed, for Mina, I could write in shorthand, because at least if he saw it, the count would not be able to understand those scribbled characters. Having finished writing two letters, I quietly sat down to read them again, while the old man was also sitting and writing, occasionally pausing to look something up in the books placed on the table. After finishing writing, the old man placed my two letters on top of his letter, then set the stack down near the ink bottle and pen holder, and afterward, he went outside.

125,"When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse, inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me. It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of the rooms, that the windows of the Count’s own room would look out. The window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully out.","The Count had just left, and I returned to my room immediately. A long while later, when I could no longer hear any sound, I quietly went out to the hallway to find the window facing south. In contrast to the narrow, dark, and confined space of the castle courtyard, the vast, far-reaching space outside gave me a slight sense of the free sky. Nothing compares to breathing in the fresh air at this moment, even though it was still nighttime. While engrossed in the scenery, I suddenly jolted when I inadvertently noticed my own shadow, and thus the most bizarre and terrifying thoughts flooded my mind. Indeed, only God knows that my fears are not unfounded? I tried to calm myself, gazing at the scenery spreading out before me, under the bright moonlight as if it were daytime. Under the pale moonlight, the distant rolling hills seemed to blend with the valleys and ravines, forming a smooth, velvet-like black color. That simple beauty helped me calm down, and each cool breeze seemed to bring me peace and a bit of comfort and solace. Leaning out the window to look down at the foot of the castle, I accidentally discovered something moving on the lower floor, slightly to the left. From what I knew about the arrangement of the rooms, it seemed that the Count's quarters were right there. The window where I was leaning out was in a very high position, the frame deep, and the sills were all made of stone, so even if they were damaged over the years, there was nothing particularly noteworthy. I stood up straight to avoid being detected, but I did not forget to keep an eye on what was happening below.",9.131,8.472,"When the Count left my side, I went to my room. Shortly after, not hearing any sound, I went outside and climbed the stone stairs from which I could look south. Compared to the narrow darkness of the courtyard, there was a sense of freedom in the vast area I saw, even though it was unattainable. Looking at the view, I truly felt that I was being held in a prison, and despite it being night, I seemed to want to take a breath of fresh air. I began to feel that this nocturnal way of life was affecting me badly. It's getting on my nerves. I'm afraid of my own shadow, and my mind is filled with all sorts of terrifying imaginations. God knows, there is ample ground for every kind of horrifying fear in this cursed place! I looked at the beautiful expanse bathed in the soft, yellow moonlight until it was almost as bright as day. Under the soft light, the distant hills, the shadows of the valleys, and the velvety black passes melted away. This simple beauty seemed to have cheered me up; there was peace and comfort in every breath I took. When I leaned out of the window, something moving caught my eye, a floor below, slightly to my left, in the place where I assumed the windows of the Count's own room would be, according to the arrangement of the rooms. The window I stood at was high, deep, and stone-latticed, and although it was weather-worn, it was still in perfect condition; but it was very clear that the window frame had been here for a long time. I pulled back behind the stonework and looked out carefully.",27.627,27.316,"When he left me, I headed to my room. After some time, not hearing any noise, I went out and climbed the stone bleachers from where I could see to the south.

Looking outside, I felt without any doubt that I was a prisoner, and it seemed to me that I needed a breath of fresh air, even if it was at night. I am beginning to feel that this nocturnal existence is affecting me. It is destroying my nerves. I am scared of my own shadow, and I am filled with all kinds of terrible imaginations. God knows very well that there are reasons for my terrible fear in this damned place! I looked at the beautiful landscape, bathed in the faint yellow light of the moon, until it was almost like daylight. In the soft twilight, the distant hills melted away, and the shadows were lost in the valleys and hollows of a velvety black. The mere beauty seemed to cheer me up; there was peace and comfort in every breath I inhaled. As I leaned against the window, my eye was caught by something moving a floor below and somewhat to my left, where I imagine, by the order of the rooms, the windows of the count's own room would be. The window in which I was standing was high and deep, carved in stone, and although time and weather had worn it, it was still complete. But evidently, the frame had long since disappeared.

126,"What I saw was the Count’s head coming out from the window. I did not see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had so many opportunities of studying.

But my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.","The old count's head just poked out from the window on the lower floor; although I couldn't see his face, I still recognized him by his neck, back, and the unmistakable movements of his two arms, especially his hands - I couldn't be mistaken because I had many occasions to notice his peculiar hands. At first, I felt both intrigued and amused to be spying like that, because indeed there was nothing amusing or intriguing for a prisoner in normal times. However, all my initial feelings were quickly replaced by a sense of disgust and horror when I saw the old count slowly slither out of the window and begin to crawl along the castle wall. He kept crawling like that over the dizzying abyss, his black cloak spread wide like bat wings. I truly couldn't believe my eyes. At first, I thought I was dazzled by the moonlight or confused by some shadow, but when I strained my eyes to look more closely, I realized I was not mistaken. I could clearly see the fingers and toes gripping tightly onto the edges of the stones whose mortar had been eroded by time. He crawled swiftly down the deep wall.",13.233,12.566,"What I saw was the Count's head sticking out of the window.

128,"15 May.—Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion. He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without avail—the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count’s room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last, however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder, and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort, impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere “modernity” cannot kill.","• May 15 I was stunned to see the old count continue to crawl like a lizard. He crawled along the wall in a slightly diagonal line to the left. Then he suddenly slipped into a hole or some kind of window. When I could no longer see his head, I dared to lean out further to get a clearer view of his path, but I didn't discover anything new, as the hole or window was too far from where I stood. However, I was certain of one thing: the count had left the castle, and now I could do something I hadn't dared to do before: take the opportunity to explore the castle. I went to the middle of the room, grabbed the lamp, and tried to open all the doors. As I suspected, every door was tightly locked, and from what I could see, the locks were relatively new. I went down the stairs, walked along the hallway through the door I had entered on my first night at the castle. I found that I could easily open the door latches and remove the chain, but the door was tightly locked, and of course, the key was no longer in the lock. Surely the key was kept in the count's room, and so I needed to seize the opportunity, when his room door was unlocked, to sneak in, steal the key, and escape. I continued to meticulously inspect each corridor, each staircase, and tried opening all the doors I encountered along the way. The doors of one or two small rooms facing the central corridor were unlocked, but inside there was nothing noteworthy except for some old dusty wooden furniture and a few fabric-covered armchairs that had been badly gnawed by termites. Finally, upon reaching the top of a staircase, I came across a door that at first glance seemed tightly locked, but when I gave it a gentle push, it budged slightly. Continuing to push harder, I realized that the door was indeed not locked; it just resisted my push a bit because the hinges were somewhat loose, causing the door to sag close to the floor. This might be a unique opportunity that I must seize. After a few attempts of mustering my strength, I managed to open the door. I was standing in an annex of the castle, which was slightly to the right and below the rooms I had previously explored. Looking through the window, I saw the rooms stretching along the southern side of the castle, with the windows of the last room facing both south and west. Both sides overlooked a deep abyss. The castle was built right at the corner of a large mountain peak, so much so that all three sides were inaccessible; similarly, the windows were positioned very high on the walls, making them invulnerable to weapons like bows, catapults, and conventional firearms, which couldn't reach them. The high position of the windows gave part of the castle a more airy and pleasant atmosphere. To the east lay a valley deep at the foot of towering and steep mountains. Surely, in the old days, these rooms were the quarters of the ladies, because all the furniture here seems to be more comfortable compared to what I have seen in other rooms. The windows had no curtains, so the clear moonlight filtered through the glass, allowing me to easily distinguish the colors of the objects in the room, even though everything was blurred by the dust of time. The lamp in my hand suddenly became useless under the moonlight, but it still somewhat made me feel at ease, as it was clear that I was alone, a loneliness that made my heart tighten with a vague fear. However, it was better to be alone like this than to have the old count in the room. A bit of rational effort along with the comfort of the lamp in my hand helped me calm down. I sat down by a small oak table, where once a beautiful woman must have sat, dreamily and bashfully writing flowing but clumsy love letters. I sat thinking back on the diary pages that recorded everything that had happened to me. Shorthand is indeed a nineteenth-century advancement! Indeed, each century has its own distinct powers that modernism cannot extinguish...",11.886,11.641,"15 May. - I saw the Count slipping out like a lizard once again. He was moving sideways, descending about thirty meters down and quite a bit to the left. He disappeared into a hole or a window. When his head vanished from sight, I leaned out to see more, but it was no use - the distance was too great to allow a proper viewing angle. I knew he had left the castle, and I thought of using this opportunity to explore more than I had dared so far. I returned to the room, took the lamp, and tried all the doors. As I had guessed, they were all locked, and the locks were relatively new; but I went down the stone stairs to the hall where I had first entered. I found that I could easily pull the bolts and remove the huge chains, but the door was locked and there was no key! That key must be in the Count's room; I must watch for a time when the door to his room is not locked so I can take the key and escape. I continued to carefully examine various stairs and corridors, trying the doors that opened onto them. A few small rooms near the hall had open doors, but inside there was nothing to see except old, moth-eaten furniture covered in years of dust. But finally, at the top of a staircase, I found a door that, although it appeared to be locked, opened with a bit of force. I pushed harder and saw that it was not truly locked, the resistance came from the hinges somehow dropping, and the heavy door was resting on the ground. This was an opportunity that might not come again, so after using all my strength and many attempts, I pushed it back enough to get inside. Now, I was in the right wing of the castle, one floor below the rooms I knew. From the window, I could see that the connected rooms extended along the south wing of the castle, with the room at the end facing both west and south. As on the first side, there was a deep chasm on the second side as well. The castle was built on the corner of a large rock, making it quite impregnable from three sides, and the large windows were placed where no slingshot, arrow, or rifle could reach, thus providing light and comfort impossible for a place that needed to be defended. To the west, there was a wide valley and behind it, in the distance, rows of sharp-peaked mountains rising summit upon summit, with rowan trees and thorny bushes clinging to the cracks, crevices, and fissures in the rock. This part of the castle was evidently inhabited in the past because the furniture had a more comfortable air than what I had seen before. There were no curtains on the windows, and the yellow moonlight streaming through the diamond-shaped window panes weakened the layer of dust covering everything, somewhat concealing the damage caused by time and moths, making it possible to see colors. Under the bright moonlight, my lamp seemed almost useless, but I was glad to have it with me because there was a dreadful loneliness in this place that chilled my blood and unnerved me. Still, it was better than being alone in the rooms I had come to hate due to the Count's presence, and after trying to steady my nerves a bit, I felt a soft peace settle over me. Here I am, sitting at a small oak table where, in old times, a lovely lady might have penned a love letter full of spelling mistakes, blushing as she thought long and hard, writing in shorthand in my journal about what has happened since I last closed it. This is the nineteenth century, as updated as it can be. Yet, if my senses do not deceive me, the old times had their own unique powers that ""modernity"" could not kill, and still do.",29.856,29.747,"May 15th. Once again, I saw the Count slither like a lizard. He walked downward, slightly sideways, for about a hundred feet and veered to the left. There he disappeared into a hole or window. When his head had vanished, I leaned out trying to see more, but to no avail, as the distance was too great to provide me with a favorable viewing angle. But by then I already knew he had left the castle, and I thought I should take the opportunity to explore more than I had dared to see until then. I returned to the room, and taking a lamp, I tried all the doors. All were locked, just as I had expected, and the locks were comparatively new. Then, I descended the stone steps to the corridor where I had originally entered. I found that I could easily enough remove the bolts and unlock the large chains; but the door was firmly locked and there was no key! The key must be in the count's room. I have to watch in case his door is unlocked, so that I can get it and escape. I continued to make a thorough examination of various staircases and passages and pressed all the doors that were before them. One or two rooms near the corridor were open, but there was nothing in them, nothing to see except old furniture, dusty from the wind and moth-eaten. Finally, however, I found a door at the end of the staircase, which, although it seemed to be locked, gave way a little under pressure. I pushed it harder and discovered that it was not actually locked, but the resistance came from the hinges having sagged a bit and the heavy door resting on the floor. There was an opportunity that might well be unique, so I made a supreme effort, and after many attempts, I forced it back so that I could enter. I found myself at that moment in a wing of the castle much further to the right than the rooms I knew and a floor lower. From the windows, I could see that the series of rooms were situated along the south side of the castle, with the windows of the last room facing both east and south. On that last side, as well as the previous one, there was a great precipice. The castle was built on the corner of a large rock, making it almost impregnable on three of its sides, and large windows were placed here where neither wave, nor bow, nor culverin could reach, thus ensuring light and comfort to a position that had to be guarded. To the west, there was a great valley, and then, rising far away, a large chain of jagged mountains, rising peak to peak, where the bare stone was dotted with rowan trees and brambles, whose roots clung to the crevices, cracks, and fissures of the rocks. This was evidently the portion of the castle occupied in days past by the ladies, as the furniture had a more comfortable air than I had seen until then. The windows had no curtains, and the yellow moonlight reflecting in the diamond-shaped hollows allowed even the colors to be distinguished, while it softened the amount of dust that lay over everything and somewhat disguised the effects of time and moths. My lamp had little effect in the bright moonlight, but I was glad to have it with me, for there was a gloomy solitude in the place that made my heart and nerves tremble. Despite everything, it was better than living alone in the rooms I had come to hate due to the presence of the count, and after trying a bit to calm my nerves, I felt overwhelmed by a gentle tranquility. And here I am, sitting at a small oak table where in ancient times some beautiful lady used to take up the pen, with many thoughts and more blushes, to poorly write her love letter, writing in my diary in shorthand everything that has happened since I last closed it. It is the 19th century, very modern, with all its soul. And yet, unless my senses deceive me, past centuries had and have peculiar powers of their own, which mere ""modernity"" cannot kill.",41.386,41.303

The sense of sleep was upon me, and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly real—so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.","Having finished writing the recent diary entries and putting the paper and pen into my pocket, I suddenly felt my eyes grow heavy with sleep. Of course, I did not forget the count's warning, but for some reason, I still liked not following his words. The bright moonlight seemed so gentle and kind to me, and the vast, expansive scenery outside also seemed to want to comfort and soothe me, giving me a sense of the free sky. I decided not to return to my room but to sleep right here, where people still speculate about the presence of noble ladies of the past and where they used to gather to sing and alleviate the sadness of a luxurious but dull life, as their husbands were always away in distant lands due to endless and deadly wars. I chose a long reclining chair placed near the window so that I could still enjoy the view while lying down. Ignoring the thin layer of dust, I wearily leaned back, hoping to soon fall asleep. Indeed, I did fall asleep, or at least I hoped I did, because honestly, I was just afraid I hadn't fallen asleep yet, as everything that happened next seemed so real to me that even now, in broad daylight, in a room filled with the bright morning light, I still can't believe I could have been dreaming.",5.135,4.153,"After writing in my journal and fortunately putting the notebook and pen in my pocket, I felt sleepy.

Tonight, I decided not to return to those gloomy rooms and to sleep in this room where, in old times, ladies with sensitive hearts would sit and sing in sorrow because their men were far away in merciless wars, and they lived sweet lives. I pulled a large sofa close to the corner so that I could watch the beautiful view of the east and south while lying down and prepare myself for sleep without worrying about the dust.

I made the decision not to return that night to the rooms filled with horrors, but to sleep here where, in the past, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives while their gentle breasts saddened for the men away in bloody wars.

135,"I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight, my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some day it should meet Mina’s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth. They whispered together, and then they all three laughed—such a silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable, tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand. The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her on. One said:—","I'm not alone in the room. Clearly, nothing has changed since I stepped in here. I noticed on the floor, the moonlight illuminated my footprints clearly imprinted on the layer of dust. But standing before me now are three women, three noblewomen as shown by their makeup and demeanor. At first glance, I thought I was dreaming, because even though the moonlight shone through the window, I still couldn't see any shadow of theirs cast on the floor. They approached me, stared at my face for a moment, then turned to each other and whispered something. Two of them had brown hair, hooked noses like the old count's, sharp eyes like knives, wide open and gleaming as if on fire. The third was an incredibly beautiful woman with long, shiny blonde hair and eyes as blue as sapphires. I found her face somewhat familiar; and my memory took me back to a face I had seen in a nightmare, although at this moment I couldn't recall the exact time and circumstances. All three had sparkling white teeth, shining like pearls, peeking out from behind their bright red, sensual lips. There was something about them that made me feel uneasy, both desirous and fearful. Yes, indeed I very much longed to place a burning kiss on those red lips. But perhaps it's best that I don't write such words, for it would make my Mina sad if she read these diary entries, yet I must also say that it is the truth. The three women continued whispering to each other, then burst into a melodious, clear laugh, but I find it hard to fully describe, for that laugh contained something that seemed impossible to come from a human throat. It was both shrill and gentle, to the point of being unbearable, like the sound of clinking glasses in the hands of a clumsy artist. The blonde woman shook her head, seemingly provocatively, leaving the other two to push forward from behind. — Go ahead! - One of them said.",13.232,12.861,"I was not alone.

At that moment, when I saw them, I thought I was dreaming, because despite the moonlight being behind them, their shadows did not fall on the ground.

It was as if I knew her face from somewhere, in connection with an imaginary fear, but at that moment, I couldn't figure out how and where I knew her from. All three had dazzling white teeth that shone like pearls against the redness of their voluptuous lips. There was something about them that made me uneasy, a bit of longing and at the same time, a deadly fear. In my heart, I felt a wicked, burning desire for them to kiss me with those red lips. It's not good for me to write these here, as one day Mina might see them and it could cause her pain, but this is the truth.

Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as one’s flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer—nearer. I could feel the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat, and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there. I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited—waited with beating heart.","I didn't dare open my eyes wide, but I continued to look through my eyelashes.

That face revealed a pleasure full of emotion but also truly disgusting; she licked her lips like a hungry animal, so much so that under the clear moonlight, I could even see the slimy saliva on her ruby-colored lips and on the tip of her red tongue sweeping back and forth over her sharp white teeth. She bent lower and lower. I had the feeling she was about to press her chili-red lips against my neck. But no, she stopped, and I suddenly heard a sound, a sound almost like stirring water. It turned out to be the sound of her tongue hitting her teeth and her saliva-filled lips. I felt a hot breath blowing on my neck. The skin on my neck began to get goosebumps as if being caressed by a smooth hand, and what I was feeling was the trembling caress of her lips along with the very light gnashing of her sharp teeth.

Then she stopped, and I could hear the slurping sound her tongue made as she licked her teeth and lips, feeling her hot breath on my neck. Then, the skin of my throat began to shiver as it does when a hand approaches to tickle it.

139,"But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giant’s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires; the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:—","But right at that moment, I had to go through another feeling, a feeling that suddenly flashed like lightning. The old count was standing there as if he had just fallen from the sky. Indeed, when I reluctantly opened my eyes, I saw his iron hand gripping the slender neck of the woman and pulling her back with the tremendous strength of a brutish laborer. The woman's blue eyes flashed with anger, her teeth grinding together like a mad beast. And the old count? Never had I imagined someone swept away by fury like that. His eyes blazed with real flames, I even felt those flames had just erupted from the depths of hell. His face looked ashen like a corpse, his cheeks twitching continuously, his thick eyebrows furrowing together over his nose like a warped rusty iron bar heated to a white glow. He waved his hand, forcefully pushing the woman to the end of the room, then coldly signaled the other two women to immediately leave the room. That was the very same wave of the hand I had seen him use before the pack of wolves that day. In a deep, almost whispering voice, but enough to tear apart the atmosphere in the room, he spoke to the women:",7.695,6.721,"But at that very moment, another feeling spread through me with the speed of lightning. I felt the presence of the Count and that he was caught in a storm of rage. When my eyes involuntarily opened, I saw the Count's strong hand grasping the slender neck of the blonde woman and pulling her back with the strength of a giant, his blue eyes changing with anger, his white teeth clashing with fury, and his pale cheeks burning with passion. But the Count! I had never imagined that even the demons in the pits of Hell could have such wrath and anger. His eyes were absolutely blazing. The red light in his eyes was terrifying; it was as if the fires of Hell were burning behind his eyes. His face was as pale as a corpse and the lines on his face were as taut as tight strings; his thick eyebrows, meeting above his nose, now looked like a rod swollen with molten metal. With a single harsh movement of his arm, he flung the woman away from him and then made a gesture as if to repel them; it was the same commanding hand gesture he used against the wolves. In a voice that was low and almost like a whisper, yet piercing the air and echoing in the room, he said:",24.846,24.427,"But at that moment, another sensation ran through me as quickly as lightning. I became aware of the count's presence, and of his existence as if wrapped in a storm of fury.

But the count! I never imagined such an outburst and fury even in the demons of hell. His eyes positively emitted flames. The red light in them was terrifying, as if behind them were the flames of hell itself. His face was deathly pale and its lines were as hard as twisted wires; the thick eyebrows, which met over the nose, now seemed like a lever of white-hot metal. With a fierce movement of his hand, he threw the woman away from him, and then gestured towards the others as if he were repelling them; it was the same imperious gesture I had seen used with the wolves.

141,"“You yourself never loved; you never love!” On this the other women joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively, and said in a soft whisper:—","You don't dare to love, do you? The remaining two laughed gleefully with each other, their laughter was truly joyous, yet also truly harsh and cruel, making me almost faint. Indeed, their laughter was no different from the laughter of demons. Carefully observing me for a moment, the old count then turned and replied, his voice still cold and whispering:",3.183,1.138,"“You never loved yourself; you never love at all!” The other women joined in, and such joyless, harsh, soulless laughter echoed in the room that hearing it almost made me faint; it was like the joy of demons.

143,"“Are we to have nothing to-night?” said one of them, with a low laugh, as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.","— So, we have nothing tonight? - One of the women asked with a laugh, while pointing to the bag the old count had just thrown carelessly on the floor: the bag was moving as if there was a living entity inside. The old count nodded in place of a reply. One of the women immediately jumped forward to open the bag. I believe I heard a faint moan, like the sound of a child about to suffocate. The women gathered around the bag, while I stood frozen in horror. But what terrified me even more was that, somehow, the women had suddenly disappeared with the bag, even though my eyes had not left the floor for a second. Clearly, there were no doors near them, and if they had left in front of me, I would have seen it. They must have vanished with the moonlight through the window, because a moment later, I noticed the familiar shadows just barely outside. A moment later, the three shadows disappeared completely.",10.38,9.547,"One of them pointed to the bag that the Count had thrown to the ground, which moved as if something alive was inside, and said with a low laugh, ""Aren't we going to drink anything tonight?"" The Count nodded in response, as if to say yes. One of the women sprang forward and opened the bag. If my ears did not deceive me, I heard sounds of labored breathing and moaning, as if from a half-drowned child. While I was frozen with fear, the women gathered around the bag; but when I looked, they had vanished, and the dreadful bag had disappeared with them. There was no door nearby, and they could not have passed by me without my noticing.

The women surrounded the bag, while I remained petrified with fear. But when I looked again, they had already disappeared, and with them the horrifying bag. There was no door near them, and it is not possible that they passed over me without me noticing.

147,"I AWOKE in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and many such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not have brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it.

If it is true that I wasn't dreaming last night, then surely the count must have brought me back here. I tried to calm myself, but I couldn't come to any definite conclusion. Obviously, I saw things around me that could serve as evidence: for example, my clothes were carefully folded and placed on a chair, which is not my usual habit. On the other hand, my watch had stopped, even though I always wind it before going to bed. And there were many other details...But no, none of this would mean anything if I had been absent-minded last night, or if some reason had caused my mind to be in a whirl. I need to find concrete evidence. However, there was still one thing that made me happy: if the count was the one who brought me back here, he must have been in a great hurry, because everything in my pockets was still intact. Surely, if he found these diary entries, he wouldn't understand anything, because I write in shorthand. That would annoy him and he would immediately destroy what I had written.

149,"19 May.—I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days, another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to prolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a chance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked him what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and then said:—","• May 19 Surely, I have fallen into the count's trap; any hope of escape is just a vain dream. Last night, with a voice like a spell, he made me write three more letters, informing that I am about to finish my work here and will return in a few days, the second letter stating that I will leave here the very next day. The last letter indicates that I have left the castle and am on my way to Bistritz. Honestly, I very much wanted to rebel against this coercion, but upon reflection, I realized it would be madness to discuss the count's goodwill, for at this moment I am entirely in his hands; if I do not comply with his demands, I will make him suspicious and provoke his wrath. He understands that I know too much about him and could become a danger to him. My only chance, if it can still be called that, is to try to prolong the current situation. Who knows, an opportunity might arise that allows me to escape... I have seen the violence in his eyes when he roughly pushed that beautiful woman. He explained to me that the postal service here is very erratic, and the letters would reassure my friends. He also told me that with the last letter I have to write, he would have it held in Bistritz until the exact day I am supposed to return, fearing that my stay here might be prolonged. He spoke with such conviction that merely opening my mouth to protest would be enough to arouse new suspicions in him. So I had to restrain myself. I asked him how I should date the letters, and he replied:",12.429,11.943,"May 19. - It is certain that I have fallen into a trap like an animal.

I wanted to oppose this, but given that I am entirely under his control at the moment, I felt that openly arguing with the Count would be madness, and refusing his request would arouse suspicion and anger him. He knows that I know too much and that I must die so that I won't be a danger to him; my only chance is to bide my time. Something might come up that will give me a chance to escape. A kind of rage, similar to the fury that appeared in his eyes when he threw that blonde woman away from himself, is gathering in his eyes. He said that the postal service is sparse and unreliable, and that writing now would put my friends at ease, and he so insistently assured me that if I had the chance to extend my stay here, he would cancel the forward-dated letters to be held in Bistriţa until the time came, that opposing him would have aroused new suspicions.

183,"Same day, later.—I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have come safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut, and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty well the direction and distance of the Count’s window, and made for it as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did not feel dizzy—I suppose I was too excited—and the time seemed ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery. The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one corner—gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.","• That same morning, a little while later So I managed to get down there, and by the grace of God, I returned to my room without a scratch. I will explain everything in detail right now. At that moment, I don't know why I was so brave! I walked towards the southern window of the castle and immediately climbed onto the narrow stone ledge running along the outer wall. The stones on the outer edge of the wall were very large and only roughly hewn; as I mentioned, the mortar joints were weathered and crumbling with age. Setting foot on these precarious stone ledges meant embarking on a deadly adventure. After climbing a few steps, I tried to look down at the deep abyss below the castle to see if I would get dizzy, but clearly, I didn't dare do so for more than a second. I had completely determined the position of the count's window and tried to climb there as quickly as possible. The precariousness of the wall's edge didn't make me dizzy, as I always tried to look straight ahead. And in what seemed to me to be a very short time, I had climbed to the ledge of the count's window shutter. After pushing the door open, I bent my body, stuck my legs in first, and then slid into the room. I furtively looked around, and luckily the old count was not in the room. There wasn't much furniture down here, just a few rickety wooden items that seemed like they were never used; each one was covered in dust, some looking very similar to the ones I had seen in the rooms in the southern wing of the castle. I immediately thought of the key, but it was not in the lock, and I couldn't find it anywhere. My attention was drawn to a heap of gold coins piled high in the corner of the room - they were coins of various kinds from Romania, England, Austria, Hungary, Greece. These coins seemed to have been there for a long time as they were covered with a thick layer of dust. All of them were ancient coins dating back at least three hundred years. I also noticed a few necklaces and some art pieces inlaid with more or less gemstones, but these items were all very old and damaged.",10.021,9.665,"The same day, later. - I did my best and, with God's help, I returned safely to this room.

I tried it, for, since I could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended, minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark, tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a discovery.","I walked towards a heavy door that had just been discovered in a corner of the room, because I couldn't find the room key or the castle key. This is something I must not forget and is my main search objective, so I had to rummage around and explore randomly; otherwise, my recent adventurous journey would be of no use at all. This door opened to a corridor with walls entirely built of stone, leading to a spiral staircase. I cautiously stepped down, as this steep staircase was only illuminated by two arrow slits on a very thick wall. At the bottom of the stairs, I found myself in another dark corridor, a real tunnel, filled with a sour, pungent smell that reminded me of the scent of corpses—a smell rising from freshly dug earth. The deeper I went, the stronger that smell became, making it almost unbearable. Finally, I flung open another very thick door in the corridor. I was standing in front of an ancient, dilapidated church, where bodies must have been buried. The church roof was full of holes, and there were many steps on both sides of the walls leading to the crypts. I noticed the freshly dug earth and shovels of dirt filling large scattered crates around: these were surely the wooden crates that the Slovak men had just transported. There was no one in the church. I continued to grope around: who knows, maybe there was an exit inside? No, there was no exit at all. I continued to inspect more thoroughly. And despite my great disgust, I still barged into the crypts, where faint light was emanating. In the first two crypts, I found nothing but fragments of old coffins and dust.

Since the steps were dark, illuminated only by the loopholes in the heavy stone walls, I descended carefully, watching my step. At the bottom, there was a dark, tunnel-like corridor from which emanated a deadly, nauseating smell, like the scent of old, overturned earth. As I progressed down the corridor, the smell grew closer and heavier. Finally, I opened the heavy door that was ajar and found myself in an old, abandoned chapel that was evidently used as a cemetery. The roof had collapsed, and there were steps leading down to underground tombs in two places, but the ground had been recently dug up, and the soil had clearly been filled into large wooden crates brought by the Slovaks. There was no one around, so I searched for another exit but found none. Then, to leave no stone unturned, I scanned every square inch of the floor.

209,"The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count, but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face, merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face, blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell.","The large chest still lay in its old place, close to the wall, but this time it was carefully covered, the lid of the chest was pre-nailed as if waiting for hammer blows. I knew that I had to search the corpse inside to possibly find the key. Therefore, I had to lift the lid of the chest and lean it against the wall, the corpse inside the chest terrified me? Yes, it was still the old count lying there, but now he looked half his age, as his white hair and beard had turned a grayish ash color; his cheeks appeared fuller and even seemed to have a fresh pink hue beneath the pale skin. Especially his lips, which now looked plumper than ever, with fresh blood dripping from the corners, streaming down his chin and neck. His deep-set, glaring eyes were lost in a swollen face. I had the impression that this terrifying monster lived solely on fresh blood. The mere thought of bending down to touch him made me shudder; the contact filled me with a sense of revulsion, but no matter what, I had to find what I was looking for, or I would fail! And thus, my body could become a plaything for the three dreadful women the next night. I gritted my teeth and searched all the pockets on his person, but still couldn't find the key. The count's bloated face seemed to mock me, driving me to the brink of madness. Yet, I had spent countless efforts to help him move closer to London, where he could continue to satiate his insatiable bloodlust for centuries to come, turning the weak into half-human, half-monster creatures. The mere thought of it was unbearable. Thinking this, I furiously grabbed the shovel lying on the ground and aimed to strike the count's hideous face. But at that moment, the count's head slightly turned to one side, and his gleaming, malevolent eyes met mine. I froze as if paralyzed, my hand dropped, causing the shovel to make a deep cut on his forehead. The shovel slipped from my hand, fell into the coffin, and got caught in the wooden lid. I was about to bend down to grab the shovel handle when the coffin lid suddenly slammed shut, sparing me from the ghastly sight below. The last detail I saw was the bloated, blood-stained face with a sinister, mocking grin that could only belong in hell.",9.101,8.706,"The large chest was in the same place, close to the wall, but its lid, though not reinforced, was placed on top; the nails were also ready in their places to be hammered into their slots. I knew I had to search its surface to find the key, so I lifted the lid and leaned it against the wall; then I saw something that filled my soul with fear. The Count was lying there, but he looked as if he had half-rejuvenated, for his white hair and mustache had turned to a dark iron gray; his cheeks were fuller, and beneath his pale skin, a ruby red was visible; his mouth was redder than ever, as there were fresh blood droplets on his lips, trickling from the corners of his mouth and running down his chin and neck. Even his sunken, gleaming eyes seemed lost among the swollen flesh, for his eyelids and under-eye bags were swollen. The horrific creature seemed to be bloated with blood; he lay there like a repulsive parasite, exhausted from overindulgence. When I leaned over to touch him, my skin crawled, and all my senses revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was doomed. The approaching night could similarly present my body as a feast to that terrifying trio. I searched his entire body, but I found not a single trace of the key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile on his swollen face, which seemed to be driving me mad. Perhaps this was the creature I had helped move to London to satisfy his thirst for blood among the city's fertile millions for centuries to come, creating a new and ever-expanding circle of half-demons clogged with the desperate. This thought drove me insane. I was seized with a terrible desire to rid the world of such a monster. There was no deadly weapon nearby, but I raised the shovel the workers had used to fill the chests, with its point downward, to strike the hateful face. But just as I did so, his eyes turned to me, burning with a terror reminiscent of mythological serpents. This sight seemed to paralyze me, and the shovel twisted in my hand, missing his face and opening a deep wound above the forehead. The shovel slipped from my hand and fell onto the chest, its edge catching the corner of the lid; the lid closed again, hiding the horrific thing from my eyes. The last thing I saw was a swollen face, smeared with blood, fixed in a grin full of evil that held its place in the deepest hell.",28.905,28.744,"The large box was in the same place, leaning against the wall, but the lid had been put on, with the nails ready in place to be driven in, although this had not yet been done. I knew I had to get to the body to look for the key, so I lifted the lid and leaned it against the wall; and then I saw something that filled my soul with terror. There lay the count, but looking as young as if he had been rejuvenated for his white hair and mustache had changed to a dark gray; the cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed a ruby red beneath them; the mouth was redder than ever; on his lips were drops of fresh blood that fell in trickles from the corners of his mouth and ran down his chin and neck. Even his eyes, deep and sparkling, seemed to be sunken in the midst of the swollen flesh, for the eyelids and the bags beneath them were bloated. It seemed as if the horrid creature was simply sated with blood. It lay like a horrid leech, exhausted from gluttony. I trembled as I bent down to touch it, and every sense in me rebelled at the contact; but I had to rummage through its pockets, or I was lost. The next night I could see my own body serving as a feast in a similar manner for those horrid three. I fell upon the body, but I could not find any signs of the key. Then I stopped and looked at the count. There was a mocking smile on his swollen face that seemed to drive me mad. That was the being I was helping to move to London, where, perhaps, in the centuries to come, he could quench his thirst for blood among its prolific millions, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to prey upon the defenseless. The mere thought of it drove me mad. I felt a terrible desire to save the world from such a monster. I had no lethal weapon at hand, but I took the shovel the men had been using to fill the boxes and, raising it high, struck the hateful face with the edge. But as I did so, the head turned and the eyes fell upon me with all their horrid basilisk brilliance. His gaze seemed to paralyze me and the shovel twisted in my hand, missing the face, making only a deep cut on the forehead. The shovel fell from my hands onto the box, and as I pulled it, the edge of the blade caught on the edge of the lid, which fell back over the crate, hiding the horrid image from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the swollen face, stained with blood and fixed, with a grimace of malice that would have been very fitting in the deepest of hells.",43.35,43.235
210,"I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count’s room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened. With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance; but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing round me more closely.","I stood there, dazed, thinking about what I would have to do, but clearly, I couldn't think of anything. My body felt heavy, despondent, powerless...I kept standing, standing, until suddenly the singing of the Gypsies echoed from afar. The singing grew closer and closer, accompanied by the rhythmic sound of horse hooves. As the old count had told me last night, the Gypsies and even the Slovaks were coming to the castle. After glancing around and taking one last look at the chest containing the cursed corpse, I hurried back to the old man's room, intending to escape right when the gate opened. I strained my ears to listen: there was the sound of a key turning in a large lock, followed by the heavy creaking of a door on the ground floor. So, either there were other entrances to the castle, or someone with a key had opened one of the doors I knew about. Then, I heard the varying sounds of many footsteps in some hallway. I turned back and ran towards the church, thinking there might be an exit I hadn't seen yet. But just then, a sudden strong gust of wind slammed the door leading to the spiral staircase shut, causing dust to fly everywhere. I hurriedly ran back, but it was too late, the door was locked. So, I became a prisoner again. The net of fate was tightening around me.",4.811,3.813,"I kept thinking about what my next move should be, but my mind was like a burning field, and I waited with a growing sense of hopelessness inside me. While waiting, I heard a Gypsy song sung by cheerful voices coming closer and closer, and amidst the songs, the turning of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips; the Gypsies and Slovaks the Count had mentioned were coming. After taking one last look around and at the coffin hiding the disgusting body, I decided to dash out as soon as the door opened and escaped to the Count's room. I listened to the sounds with great care and heard the key turning and the heavy door being pulled back downstairs. There must have been other entrances, or one of the locked doors had a key. Then, footsteps making noise and echoing in the corridor were heard, moving away. I turned to run to the crypt where I could find the new entrance; but at that moment, a violent and sudden wind blew, slamming the door opening to the spiral staircase and scattering the dust on the upper lintel. When I ran to open the door, I found it desperately jammed. I was a prisoner again, and fate was weaving its webs around me more tightly.",23.415,23.065,"I thought and thought about what my next move would be, but it seemed like my brain was on fire, and I waited with a desperation that I felt growing by the moment. While I was waiting, I heard in the distance a gypsy song sung by cheerful voices that were approaching, and through the song, the sound of heavy wheels and cracking whips; the gypsies and Slovaks whom the count had spoken of were arriving. Taking one last look at the box containing the vile body, I ran out of that place and reached the count's room, determined to leave suddenly the moment the door opened. With attentive ears, I listened, and heard below the creak of the key in the great lock and the sound of the heavy door opening. There must have been other means of entry, or someone had a key to one of the locked doors. Then the sound of many feet walking reached me, dying away in some passage that sent back a resounding echo. I wanted to run back to the vault, where I might find the new entrance; but at that moment a violent gust of wind seemed to penetrate the room, and the door leading to the spiral staircase slammed shut with such force that it raised the dust from the lintels. When I ran to open the door, I found it was tightly shut. Once again, I was a prisoner, and the web of my fate seemed to be closing in ever tighter.",39.427,39.179
211,"As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes, with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the box being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.","As I write these lines, I hear heavy footsteps and the sound of something being thrown... yes... it must be the boxes filled with earth in the hallway below.

A moment later, I hear the sound of heavy footsteps in the hallway again, followed by lighter footsteps.",7.365,5.535,"As I write these, there are numerous footsteps and the noise of weights being placed heavily on the floor in the corridor below; those being placed are undoubtedly crates filled with soil.

I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together freely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan’s studies, and I have been practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a stenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I shall keep a diary in the same way. I don’t mean one of those two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not intended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try to do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing descriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears said during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little plans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan from Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I am longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange countries.

The life of a female trainer is not always easy. How I long to walk with you along the beach and chat about everything under the sun. Yes, these days I've been burying myself in work because I want to be capable enough to collaborate with Jonathan. I've been diligently practicing shorthand, so that when we get married, I can help him record everything he deems necessary and then type it out. I'm also learning to type now. Moreover, we both often receive letters written in shorthand, and I know that during his travels, he also keeps a diary in that way. When I return to you, I will do the same. I will keep a diary and whenever I feel like it, I will jot down everything that comes to mind. Maybe one day, I will show that diary to Jonathan if needed. But first, I will treat it as an exercise book. I want to do what female journalists often do: conduct interviews, describe what I see, try to recall stories I've heard, and then recount everything as truthfully as possible. Someone told me that with just a bit of practice, one can easily remember everything that happened, or everything heard during the day. In the end, we will see... I'm very happy to share with you my little plans. I just received a few words from Jonathan sent from Transylvania. He is still healthy and will return here in about a week. I'm very excited to hear Jonathan talk about his trip. The trip must have been wonderful because it spanned so many lands.

230,"“I must say you tax me very unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I wrote to you twice since we parted, and your last letter was only your second. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing to interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the last Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr. Holmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well together; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some time ago a man that would just do for you, if you were not already engaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent parti, being handsome, well off, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He is only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to see us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men I ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to read one’s thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do you ever try to read your own face? I do, and I can tell you it is not a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you have never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological study, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a bore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day. There, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other since we were children; we have slept together and eaten together, and laughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like to speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn’t you guess? I love him. I am blushing as I write, for although I think he loves me, he has not told me so in words. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that does me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire undressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel. I do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop, or I should tear up the letter, and I don’t want to stop, for I do so want to tell you all. Let me hear from you at once, and tell me all that you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in your prayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.","To be honest, you were a bit too harsh in criticizing me: I have written to you twice since we parted ways, and your latest letter is only the second one I have received? Moreover, I don't have anything new to tell you; honestly, there's nothing worth your attention. These days, we go out quite often, sometimes to art exhibitions, sometimes for walks or horseback riding in the park. As for the tall, handsome guy with blond hair you mentioned, I think you were referring to the guy who accompanied me to a recent concert. Clearly, you've heard some rumors... That was Holmwood. He often visits my house; my mother and he seem to get along very well. They usually care about the same things. At least that's what I think. Recently, we met someone like you mentioned, and I was planning to set you up with him if you weren't Jonathan's fiancée. Isn't that a wonderful match? A handsome, elegant, wealthy, and very knowledgeable young man. He is a very intelligent doctor. Can you imagine, at just twenty-nine years old, he is already able to run a very large sanatorium. It was Holmwood who introduced him to me. These days, he often comes to my house. I believe he is the most resilient, determined, and at the same time, the calmest man I have ever met in my life. I sense in him an unshakeable resoluteness. He also always lingers in the eyes of others, as if he wants to read all their thoughts. He often acts according to my interests, but I am very glad to tell you that he is far from achieving his goal! For me right now, just being able to look at myself in the mirror is enough. Have you ever tried reading your own expression in the mirror? That psychiatrist said that to him, I am quite a peculiar mental case, and although it's uncomfortable, I still think he's right. Mental illness! How amusing? You know, I'm not the kind of person who pays much attention to fashion to be able to describe to you what's trending. Fashion is just a frivolous thing, as Arthur often says... All that is called new to me is just that. Mina, do you remember, from our youthful days, we used to share with each other our deepest secrets; we used to sleep together, share every piece of cake, every smile, and even tears? You know, now I really want to talk, to chat endlessly with you! Mina! Can you guess? I love him! I'm blushing as I write these words, because even if I have enough reason to believe that he loves me too, he hasn't said it to me yet. Mina, I love him! I love him? I love him! That's it! Only by writing this do I feel at ease. If only I could be with you now, sitting close to you by the fire in casual clothes to confide like the old days; we would whisper to each other, and I would try to share with you all the emotions I've been through. I don't know how to express my innermost feelings, even to you. ..I'm afraid I have to stop writing here, because if I don't, I might tear this letter apart. Honestly, I still don't want to stop writing, because I still crave to tell you something more. Reply to me right away, tell me frankly what you think. Mina, I'm stopping here. Goodbye. Pray to God to bless me and my happiness, Mina.",13.594,13.374,"I must say that you have very unfairly accused me of being a bad pen pal. Since we parted, I have written to you twice, and the last one you sent was only your second letter. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. Seriously, there is nothing that would interest you.

Just think! At only twenty-nine years old, he has a huge mental hospital entirely under his supervision. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, he came to visit us, and now he comes often. I think he is one of the bravest and at the same time the most cool-headed men I have ever seen. He definitely looks dignified. I can imagine how he could have perfect control over his patients. He has a strange habit of looking directly into a person's face as if trying to read their mind. He often tries this on me, but I pride myself on thinking he has met his match. I know this from my mirror. Do you ever try to read your own face? I do, and I can tell you, it's not a bad examination, and if you haven't tried it before, it causes you more trouble than you might think. He says I am an interesting psychological case for him to study, and I humbly think so too. As you know, I don't care enough about clothing to describe the latest fashions. Clothing is a nuisance. That's slang, but never mind; Arthur says it every day. That's all. Mina, we've shared all our secrets since childhood; we've slept together, eaten together, cried and laughed together; now, even though I've spoken, I want to talk more. Oh Mina! Can't you guess? I'm in love with him. My face blushes as I write because although I think he loves me too, he hasn't told me in words. But oh! Mina! I'm in love with him; I'm in love with him; I'm in love with him! There, that makes me feel better. I wish I were with you, dear; sitting by the fire with our clothes off as we used to; I would try to tell you how I feel. I don't even know how I'm writing this to you. I'm afraid to stop, or I'll have to tear up the letter, but I don't want to stop because I so much want to tell you everything. I'm eagerly waiting to hear from you; tell me everything you think about this. Mina, I must stop. Good night. Bless me in your prayers and Mina, pray for my happiness.",34.407,34.286,"""I must say that you value me very unfairly by saying that I am bad at correspondence. I have written to you twice since we parted, and your last letter was only the second. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing that might interest you. The city is very beautiful these days, and we often go to the art galleries and to walk or ride horses in the park. As for the tall man with curly hair, I suppose he was the one who was with me at the last popular concert. Evidently, someone has been telling tall tales. It was Mr. Holmwood. He often comes to see us, and he gets along very well with mom; they have many things in common to talk about. Some time ago we met a man who would be suitable for you if you were not already engaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent match; handsome, rich, and from a good family. He is a doctor and very smart. Imagine that! He is twenty-nine years old and owns a huge lunatic asylum, all under his direction. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me and he came here to see us, and now he visits us often. I think he is one of the most resolute men I have ever seen, and yet, the calmest. He seems absolutely unperturbable. I can imagine the magnificent power he has over his patients. He has the curious habit of looking one directly in the face as if trying to read one's thoughts. He tries to do this many times with me, but I pride myself that this time he has met a nut too hard to crack. I know that from my mirror. Have you never tried to read your own face? I have, and I can tell you it is not a bad study, and it gives you more work than you can imagine if you have never tried it yet. He says that I provide him with a curious psychological case, and I humbly believe that is so. As you know, I do not take enough interest in dresses to be able to describe the new fashions. The subject of dresses is boring. That is slang again, but don't mind it; Arthur says that every day. Well, that is all. Mina, we have told each other all our secrets since we were girls; we have slept together and eaten together, we have laughed and cried together; and now, although I have already spoken, I would like to speak more. Oh, Mina! Could you not guess? I love him; I love him! Well, that makes me feel good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting in confidence by the fire, just as we used to; then I would try to tell you how I feel; I don't even know how I am writing this to you.

238,"“My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are. Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a proposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three. Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn’t it awful! I feel sorry, really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so happy that I don’t know what to do with myself. And three proposals! But, for goodness’ sake, don’t tell any of the girls, or they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at least. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can despise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep it a secret, dear, from every one, except, of course, Jonathan. You will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell Arthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything—don’t you think so, dear?—and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just before lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don’t generally do when they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to me, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him, though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to help and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute and would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if I could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled, and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one else. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman’s heart was free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever wanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can’t help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn’t at all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to know that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing quite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so miserable, though I am so happy.","Dear friend, until now I have truly felt the saying: ""Fortune comes in pairs"" is correct? This September, I will turn twenty, and until now, I have never received a serious marriage proposal from anyone, but do you know what? Today, I received proposals from three different people? Yes, three marriage proposals in just one day? It's quite overwhelming, isn't it? But I also feel a bit sad, truly sad for the two unfortunate men, because whether I want to or not, I can only choose one. But you must remember not to tell anyone, okay? I don't want to hear any gossip, rumors, or jealousy at all! Now, perhaps I will tell you about all three, will you promise to keep it a secret for me? Of course, if you want, you can tell Jonathan, but only him. A woman usually has to tell her husband everything, right, dear friend? Now I will tell you one by one: the first person came around twelve o'clock, just as the family was sitting down for lunch. As I told you before: it was Dr. John Seward, the director of the mental asylum, a man with a determined chin and a very high forehead. On the outside, he seemed completely calm, but I guess it was more like tension. He showed himself to be a person with very impressive manners. However, he was so clumsy that he almost sat on the hat he had just placed on the chair, something that men generally wouldn't do if they had a cool head. And to appear natural, he took out a scalpel to play with, and for some reason, every time I saw it, I felt terrified? But Mina, he was very honest in his conversation. He said that he expected a lot from me even though we hadn't known each other for long, that life for him would become wonderful if I were there to help, encourage, and comfort him. He wanted me to understand that his sadness would disappear when I was there, but when he saw the tears on my face, he panicked and called himself heartless, saying he didn't want to make me more upset. He only asked if time would make me love him or not. I shook my head, my hands trembling and feeling a bit hesitant inside. He also inquired if I had already loved someone else and said that when a girl's heart doesn't belong to anyone, a man like him could still hope and wait. So, Mina, at that moment, I felt it was my duty to confess that I was in love with someone. Hearing that, he immediately stood up, his face very serious but still trying to appear calm, and took my hands with wishes for happiness. He also said that if I ever needed a friend, a truly devoted friend, I could trust him. Dear Mina, do you know, writing to you, I can't hold back my feelings. I'm sure you'll forgive me when you see the dried tears on this page, won't you, dear friend? Being proposed to is the best thing for a girl, but I assure you that no one is happy to see a sincere young man leave with a broken heart, knowing very well that no matter what he says, I will completely disappear from his life. Dear Mina, perhaps I should stop writing here, I can't write any more about it, I am very sad, although I still feel truly happy inside!.",9.794,9.527,"My dear, God gives as He pleases. How true the old proverbs are. In September, I will turn twenty, and until today, I have never received a marriage proposal - a real marriage proposal - but today, I received three proposals at once. Can you imagine! Three marriage proposals in one day! Terrifying, isn't it! I feel so sorry for the other two poor men; I really do. Oh, Mina! I am so happy that I don't know what to do. And three marriage proposals! But for God's sake, don't tell the girls, or they'll get all sorts of exaggerated ideas and feel hurt and insignificant if they don't get at least six proposals on the first day they return home. Some girls are so proud! You and I, Mina my dear, who are engaged and will soon settle down and live as sensible, old married women, can scorn excessive pride. Well, I must tell you about this trio, but my dear, you must keep it from everyone - everyone except Jonathan, of course. You will tell him, because if I were in your place, I would certainly tell Arthur. A woman should tell her husband everything - don't you think so, my dear - and I must be honest. Men also want women, especially their wives, to be as honest as they are; I fear women are not always as honest as they should be. Yes, dear, number one came just before lunch. I had told you about him, Dr. John Seward; the man from the mental hospital with the strong jaw and beautiful forehead. He seemed very calm on the outside, but he was nervous. Clearly, he had trained himself in all sorts of little things and remembered them; but in a way that men usually don't when they are calm, he almost sat on his silk hat and then started playing with his scalpel so much that I almost screamed when he wanted to appear relaxed. Mina, he spoke very openly with me. Despite knowing me very little, he told me how important I was to him and how his life would be if I helped and cheered him up. He was going to say how unhappy he would be if I didn't care for him, but when he saw me crying, he said he was being very rude and wouldn't add to my current troubles. Then he suddenly stopped and asked if I could grow to love him in time; when I shook my head, his hands trembled, and he hesitantly asked if there was already someone else I loved. He put it so beautifully; he said he didn't want to force my secret out of me, just wanted to know because if a woman's heart is free, a man can hope. And then, Mina, I felt it was my duty to tell him there was someone. I told him as much, he stood up, took both my hands in his and wished me happiness, and told me to consider him one of the best friends if I ever needed one; he looked so strong and serious while saying this. Oh Mina, my dear, I can't help but cry; you must forgive me for this letter being stained. Receiving a marriage proposal is wonderful, but having to see a poor man who you know loves you honestly walk away with a broken heart and knowing that no matter what he says at that moment, he is leaving your life, is not a happy thing at all. My dear, I must stop here for now; although I am very happy, I feel completely shattered.",32.678,32.571,"""My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are! Here I am, about to turn twenty in September, and I had never received a proposal until today; not a real one, and today I've had three. Imagine that! THREE proposals in one day! Isn't it terrible? I feel sad, truly and deeply sad, for two of the three suitors. Oh, Mina, I am so happy that I don't know what to do with myself! And three marriage proposals! But, for God's sake, don't tell any of the girls, or they would immediately start having all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves offended and slighted if they didn't receive at least six on their first day at home; some girls are so vain! You and I, dear Mina, who are engaged and soon to settle down soberly as old married women, can scorn vanity. Well, I must talk to you about the three, but you must keep it a secret, without telling anyone, except, of course, Jonathan. You will tell him, because I, if I were in your place, would surely tell Arthur. A woman must tell her husband everything, don't you think, dear? And I must be fair. Men like women, of course their wives, to be as fair as they are; and women, I fear, are not always as fair as they should be. Well, dear, number one arrived just before lunch. I've already told you about him: Doctor John Seward, the man from the lunatic asylum, with a strong chin and a good forehead. Outwardly he seemed very cold, but he was nervous nonetheless. He was evidently educating himself about all sorts of little things, and he remembered them; but he almost managed to sit on his silk hat, which men generally don't do when they are calm, and then, trying to appear calm, he was playing with a lancet in a way that almost made me scream. He spoke to me, Mina, very directly. He told me how he loved me, despite knowing me for such a short time, and what his life would be like if he had me to help and cheer him. He was about to tell me how unhappy he would be if I didn't love him too, but when he saw me crying, he said he was a brute and didn't want to add more sorrows to the present ones. Then he paused and asked me if I could come to love him in time; and when I shook my head negatively, his hands trembled, and then, with some uncertainty, he asked me if I already cared for someone else. He told me everything in a very nice way, claiming he didn't want to force me to confess, but that he wanted to know, because if a woman's heart was free, a man could have hopes. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was already someone. I only told him that, and he stood up, looking very strong and very serious when he took my two hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever needed a friend, I should count him among the best. Oh, my dear Mina, I can't help crying: you must forgive that this letter goes stained. It's very nice to be proposed to and all those things, but it's not at all a happy thing when you see a poor fellow, whom you know loves you honestly, walk away looking all heartbroken, and knowing that, no matter what he might say at those moments, you are walking away forever from his life. My dear, for the moment I must stop here, I feel so bad, although I am so happy!",50.05,49.978

240,"“Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left off, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two came after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he has been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her ear, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I don’t, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never told any, and yet—— My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P. Morris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl alone. No, he doesn’t, for Arthur tried twice to make a chance, and I helping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn’t always speak slang—that is to say, he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well educated and has exquisite manners—but he found out that it amused me to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he has to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall ever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was very nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:—","Arthur just left, and now I feel much more relieved than when I paused my writing. So I can continue telling you about a day in my life. The second character arrived in the afternoon. He was a very interesting young man, an American from Texas. He looked so young that I couldn't believe he had traveled to so many countries and witnessed countless events! Now I feel sympathy for poor Desdemona and understand what she went through when hearing about a bunch of fascinating stories, even if the storyteller was a black man? We girls are often scared of everything, so we always think of a man who can protect, ensure, and marry us. If I were a man, I would completely know how to win a girl's heart. But no, after all, I know nothing, because I see that if Morris - the American guy I just mentioned - doesn't hesitate to tell everyone about all his adventures, Arthur doesn't tell anything at all, and although... But never mind, I'm going too fast... Quincey P. Morris met me at home when I was alone. When a boy comes to meet a girl, she is always alone, as if by coincidence. No, this is not entirely true, because Arthur has tried twice to arrange to meet me alone and I also facilitated it: coincidence means nothing at all, now I can assert this without any shame. I also want to tell you that Morris doesn't always use slang. Indeed, he never behaves that way in front of foreigners, as he is a very well-educated person with a very clear manner of conduct. But when he realized that I was very happy to hear American slang, and seeing that there was no one at home to be offended by it, he also said many really funny things? My dear friend, I have to wonder if he made up those situations, because every story he told had a specific implication that he wanted to convey. Maybe I also need to learn the habit of speaking slang. I don't know if I will do that in the future, and I also don't know if Arthur would like it, as I have never heard him say a single slang word. And then that guy Morris sat down next to me, looking delighted and happy, though still very tense. He held my hand tightly for a long time and then whispered, in a very gentle voice:",12.139,11.805,"Arthur has just left, and I am in a better mood than when I paused my letter, so I can continue telling you about what happened today.

In my opinion, we women are such cowards that we marry a man thinking he will save us from our fears. If I were a man and wanted a girl to fall in love with me, I now know what I would do. No, I don't know because Mr. Morris told his stories, but Arthur never did, yet - My dear, I think I went a bit too fast. Mr. Quincey P.Morris found me when I was alone. It seems that a man always finds a girl when she is alone. No, that's not true because despite my best efforts to help, Arthur tried twice to get a chance; I am no longer ashamed to say that I helped. First of all, I must tell you that Mr. Morris does not always speak slang - that is, he never does so with strangers or in front of strangers because he is well-educated and has refined manners - but he realized that his American slang amused me, and whenever I was around and there was no one to be bewildered, he would say very funny things. I'm afraid, my dear, he has to make all this up himself, because what he says fits with everything else he needs to say. But that's the way to speak slang anyway. I don't know if I ever speak slang; I don't know if Arthur likes it because I've never heard him use such things before. Anyway, Mr. Morris sat next to me, looking as happy and cheerful as he could; however, I could see that he was very nervous.

I fear, dear, that he has to make it all up, because it fits perfectly with anything else he has to say. But this is a thing inherent to slang. I myself don't know if I will ever come to speak slang; I don't know if Arthur likes it, since I have never heard him use it.

242,"“Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn’t seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I wasn’t broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn’t help feeling a bit serious too—I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid flirt—though I couldn’t help feeling a sort of exultation that he was number two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very heart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest, because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:—","Honestly speaking, I find him so humorous that if I were to reject his proposal, he wouldn't be as sad as poor Dr. Seward. I also responded to him in a humorous tone that I had no idea how to saddle a horse, and that up until now, I still didn't like being put on horseback. He apologized for speaking too softly and suggested that I let him make it up to me on an occasion he deemed important and serious. When he said these things, he looked so despondent and solemn that I couldn't help but feel moved. And before I could say anything more, he hurriedly poured out a stream of affectionate words, then expressed all his soul and feelings. Once again, he confided his feelings with such genuine seriousness that I completely forgot his humorous demeanor from before. He must have read something on my face that made him worried, because he suddenly stopped and then spoke to me in a more enthusiastic and courageous tone. If my heart had not already been occupied by someone else, I might have fallen in love with him just for that enthusiasm:",7.194,6.289,"Eh, he looked so cheerful and happy that rejecting him didn't seem half as hard as rejecting poor Dr. Seward, so I cheerfully said that I didn't know anything about gathering skirts and that I wasn't yet in a position to harness. Then, he spoke in a cheerful manner and asked me to forgive him if he made a mistake by speaking so about such a serious and important matter for him.

270,"24 July. Whitby.—Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to see down. The houses of the old town—the side away from us—are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of “Marmion,” where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and talk.","• Whitby, July 24 Lucy went looking for me just as I got off the train, and she looked prettier and more charming than ever. We went straight to the Crescent Moon Hotel, where she and her mother had booked a few rooms. It was a mesmerizing place, with the little Esk River flowing through a deep valley that gradually widened into the surrounding areas of the harbor. Connecting the two sides of the valley was a viaduct perched high on tall pillars; from the bridge, the landscape stretched out endlessly as if in an unreal world. The valley was truly beautiful with precarious mountains covered in lush green. If you stood on one of the peaks and looked down, you would be amazed to see a small stream shimmering with silver light flowing lazily to a deep abyss at the bottom of the dark green valley. The roofs in the old city were all tiled with red tiles, and they seemed to overlap each other like the scenes we often see in paintings depicting the Nuremberg area. Leaving the city, you would immediately come to the ruins of the old Whitby Abbey, which was ravaged by the Danes long ago and also served as a lifelong prison for young girls in the area. These vast ruins would give you a grand and majestic sense of the surrounding landscape. There is a legend that occasionally... a lady dressed entirely in white appears by a window in the evening. Between the old city and the ruins is a church bell tower surrounded by a cemetery. In my view, this is the most beautiful place in Whitby: here you can take in the entire view of the harbor and a small bay, where a headland juts out into the sea. At the harbor, this headland is so steep that its edges have eroded into the water, causing some graves - as the cemetery extends to this point - to collapse as well. You can also enjoy the shaded paths running through the cemetery, with scattered benches inviting passersby to rest and enjoy the scenery for hours, while the gentle sea breeze softly caresses them. I often come here to sit and work. In fact, right now, I am sitting here scribbling in a notebook on my lap, while a few old men chat about the weather right next to me.",9.534,9.128,"July 24. Whitby. - Lucy, looking sweeter and more beautiful than ever, met me at the station and we went by carriage to the house with vacant rooms in Crescent. This is a very beautiful place. A small river called Esk flows through a deep valley that widens as it approaches the harbor. A large bridge on high piers crosses to the other side, and the view between the piers makes it seem farther away than it actually is. The valley is lush and so steep that, unless you are close enough to look down, you only see the opposite side. In the old town - the side far from us - all the houses have red roofs and seem to be stacked on top of each other, similar to the pictures we saw in Nuremberg. Right above the town are the ruins of Whitby Abbey, which was plundered by the Danes and where the part of ""Marmion"" where the girl is walled up takes place. An extremely noble, very large, beautiful, and romantic ruin; there is a legend that a white lady has been seen in one of the windows. There is another church between the town and the abbey; a parish church with a large graveyard full of tombstones around it. To me, this is the most beautiful spot in Whitby, because it is right above the town and overlooks the entire bay, from the harbor to the headland called Kettleness that stretches out to the sea. It descends so steeply to the harbor that part of the ground has slipped down, damaging some of the graves. In one place, the tombstones extend down to the sandy road below. Along the churchyard, there are walking paths with seats beside them; people go there and sit all day, enjoying the beautiful view and the breeze. I will often sit and work here too.

At the end of the rock formation, there is a buoy equipped with a bell that only tolls mournfully during significant moments.

Those travelers from York and from Leeds, those who always like to see what's cheap at the market, might believe in that. But I don't understand why anyone would waste their effort to tell them such lies - even the newspapers known for being foolish don't do that. I thought to myself: ""This is truly an old man from whom others can certainly learn many interesting things,"" and had to divert the conversation to the ancient practice of whale fishing. But just as I was about to hear the story, the clock suddenly chimed six times, and the old man immediately stood up, his voice strained:",5.466,4.302,"“If I were you, I wouldn't bother with these things, young lady.

277,"1 August.—I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come and join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think must have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit anything, and downfaces everybody. If he can’t out-argue them he bullies them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a beautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down. She is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her on the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but gave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends, and he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it and put it down:—","• August 1 I've been sitting here with Lucy for about an hour, and we've had a very interesting conversation with our new friend: Old Marin, and the two friends who visit him daily. Among the three old men, I can clearly name Old Marin as the Saint, because he always wants to be the one who's right, and he always likes to contradict everyone else. If he can't, he'll make a fuss, as if he's cursing directly at the people he's talking to, and when they get tired and don't want to talk anymore, he thinks they've been convinced by him. Lucy is wearing a long dress that she really likes. Since coming to Whitby, her complexion seems to have improved significantly. I've noticed that whenever we have a chance to sit and chat here, the three old men always try to find a way to get closer to her. Indeed, Lucy is a very likable girl to the elderly. No one could resist her charm. Even my old friend was subdued and never contradicted her.

If he couldn't prevail in a debate, he would bully, and then he would see the silence of his opponents as a sign of agreement with his thoughts. Lucy looked very elegant and beautiful in her white, thin linen dress; she has gotten a nice color since she came here. As soon as we sat down, I noticed that the old men didn't waste any time getting up to sit close to her. Lucy is so sweet to old people; I think they immediately fell in love with her.

Lucy was sweetly beautiful in her white linen dress; since we arrived she has had a beautiful color. I noticed that the old man wasted no time in getting to her and sitting by her side when we sat down. Lucy is so sweet with the elderly that I think they all fall in love with her instantly. Even my old friend succumbed and did not contradict her, but supported everything she said.

It enrages me to think about it. Why is it that they, not content with printing lies on paper and preaching them from pulpits, want to engrave them even on tombstones? Look around as much as you want and you'll see that all those tombstones that raise their heads as much as their pride allows, are tilted..., simply falling under the weight of the lies written on them.

296,"5 June.—The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to understand the man. He has certain qualities very largely developed; selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the object of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own, but what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of animals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd sorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a quantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he did not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in simple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: “May I have three days? I shall clear them away.” Of course, I said that would do. I must watch him.","• June 5 The case of Renfield is becoming increasingly interesting, making me understand more and more about human nature. In his personality, the most prominent traits are selfishness, cunning pretense, and stubbornness. I hope I will understand why he is so obstinate. It seems to me that he is harboring a very specific intention, but what is that intention? However, he loves animals very much, though in that affection, expressed in various foolish ways, there is something strangely cruel. Up to now, his eccentricity has been manifested in the hobby of catching flies. I find it unnecessary to keep observing this peculiar behavior, as his absurd actions are not few. One thing that surprises me greatly is that he never gets angry, as I had feared, but after thinking for a moment, he just asked me in a rather serious tone: “Would you agree to give me three days? Within three days, I will make them disappear.” Of course, I replied: “Agreed,” then stared at him as if I had never seen him before.",10.118,9.321,"June 5. - The Renfield case is becoming more interesting as I understand the man better. He has some highly developed qualities: Selfishness, reticence, and determination. I wish I could understand what his determination is directed towards. He seems to have a specific plan of his own, but I don't know what it is yet. His love for animals is one of his good qualities, but he has such unprecedented tendencies in this regard that sometimes I think the man possesses a mere perverse cruelty. He has peculiar kinds of pets. His current hobby is catching flies. At present, he has so many flies that I felt compelled to personally warn him. I was surprised to see that, as I expected, he did not have a fit of rage and took the matter seriously. He thought for a moment and said, “Will you give me three days? I will get rid of them.” Of course, I said I could give him that time. I must keep an eye on him.",25.49,24.989,"June 5. Renfield's case becomes more interesting the more I manage to understand the man. He certainly has some very broadly developed characteristics: selfishness, stealth, and intentionality. I wish I could find out what the purpose of the latter is. He seems to have a finished scheme of his own, but I don't know what it is. His redeeming virtue is his love for animals, although, in fact, he has such curious changes that sometimes I imagine he is just abnormally cruel. He plays with all kinds of animals. Right now his hobby is catching flies. Currently, he has so many that I had an altercation with him. To my astonishment, he did not have any outburst of fury, as I had expected, but took the matter with a very dignified seriousness. He reflected for a moment, and then said: –Can you give me three days? At the end of them, I will set them free. I told him that, of course, I would give him that time.

He looked very sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all events. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time as before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a horrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room, he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger and thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his mouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it was very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must watch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem in his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always jotting down something.

I angrily made him throw them all away. But seeing his sorrowful face, I felt a pang of sympathy. I told him at least to throw away a portion. He promised to do so. While sitting with him, I suddenly felt a shiver when a huge fly quickly flew into the room; he swiftly caught the creature, then held it between his thumb and index finger, examining it with a very delighted expression. And before I could guess what would happen next, he suddenly popped the fly into his mouth and chewed it voraciously. I did not hesitate to express my disgust, but he nonchalantly replied that flies are delicious, and that the vibrant life of the fly would invigorate him. A thought, or rather a suspicion, flashed through my mind: I needed to know how he intended to deal with the spiders. There must be something quite serious occupying his mind, as he was scribbling furiously into a pocket notebook. The pages were filled with numbers, as if he was doing calculations.",4.812,3.875,"July 1st. - Now the spiders have also become as big a problem as the flies, and today I told him that he needed to get rid of the spiders. He was very upset to hear this, so I told him that he still needed to clean up some of them. He accepted this cheerfully, and I gave him the same amount of time I had given him before to reduce their number. When I was with him, he made me feel terribly nauseous, because when a disgusting, bloated horsefly that had been feeding on rotting meat buzzed into the room, he caught it, held it joyfully between his fingers for a few seconds, and before I could understand what he was going to do, he put it in his mouth and ate it. I scolded him for this, but he calmly argued that the fly was very tasty and nutritious; that it meant life - strong life - and it gave him life. This gave me an idea or at least a fragment of an idea. I should watch how he gets rid of his spiders. Clearly, he has a serious problem in his mind, because he keeps a notebook in which he constantly scribbles something.

I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed had just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula, and says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan; I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy, although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in her sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided that I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy’s father, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress himself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the autumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is to be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan and I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to make both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood—he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only son of Lord Godalming—is coming up here very shortly—as soon as he can leave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is counting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seat on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it is the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he arrives.","• July 26 The more time passes, the more anxious I feel, and writing in my diary somewhat eases my mind; it's like confiding in myself. Moreover, writing in shorthand gives me a different feeling compared to regular writing. I feel worried for Lucy as well as for Jonathan. It's been a long time since I last heard from him, but yesterday, Mr. Hawkins, who is always very kind, sent me a letter he received from Jonathan. The letter contained only a few short lines informing about his return from Dracula's castle. This is not like Jonathan at all? I don't understand what could have happened... why do I long for peace of mind so much! As for Lucy, although she seems much healthier, lately, she has been experiencing sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism as the doctors call it. Her mother told me about it, and we decided that from now on, I will lock the door tightly every night. Mrs. Westenra always imagines that sleepwalkers often climb onto the roof, walk to the edge of the most precarious walls, and then wake up and fall to the ground with a desperate, tragic scream that can be heard everywhere. The poor mother has trembled many times at the thought of such a tragedy happening to her Lucy. She told me that in the past, her husband, Lucy's father, also suffered from similar conditions: he would often wake up in the middle of the night, get dressed, and wander out of the house if no one stopped him. Lucy is supposed to get married this fall; she has already prepared her wedding dress, house, and a bunch of clothes to take along. Sir Holmwood - the honorable Arthur Holmwood, son of Lord Godalming and Lucy's fiancé, will surely come here soon; he will come as soon as he can leave the city, as his father is ill. Lucy quietly counts each day, each hour...She says she really wants to sit with him on the stone bench in the cemetery and show him the magnificent scenery of Whitby. I think her anxious waiting will negatively affect her health. I hope she will be satisfied when she meets her fiancé here.",14.932,14.632,"July 26. - I am anxious and expressing myself here calms me; it's like whispering to oneself and listening at the same time. Also, there is something in the shorthand symbols that sets it apart from regular writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and Jonathan. I hadn't heard from Jonathan for a while and was worried; but yesterday, dear Mr. Hawkins, who has always been very kind, sent me a letter from him. I had asked him if he had heard from Jonathan, and he said that the enclosed letter had just arrived. The letter was a single line written from Castle Dracula, saying that he was about to set off for home. This is not at all like Jonathan; I don't understand anything and this situation makes me very uneasy. Then, Lucy, although she is actually very well, has recently reverted to her old sleepwalking habit. Her mother told me about this and we decided to lock our room door every night. Mrs. Westenra thinks that sleepwalkers always go up to the roofs of houses, walk along the edges of cliffs, and then suddenly wake up and fall down with a desperate scream that echoes everywhere. Poor thing, she is naturally worried about Lucy; and she tells me that her husband, that is, Lucy's father, had the same habit and would get up, dress, and go out at night if not stopped. Lucy will get married in the fall; she is already planning her clothes and how her house should be arranged. I understand her because I am doing the same, only Jonathan and I will start life from a much simpler place and try to make ends meet. Mr. Holmwood - that is, the Honorable Arthur Holmwood, the only son of Lord Godalming - is coming here very soon, as soon as he manages to leave town, because his father is not very well; I think dear Lucy is counting the seconds until he arrives. She wants to take him to the bench on the hill in the churchyard and show him the beauty of Whitby. I can tell that what bothers her is the waiting; she will be fine when Mr. Holmwood arrives.",36.15,35.977,"July 26. I am anxious and it calms me to express myself in writing; it is like whispering to oneself and listening at the same time. And there is something also about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from simple writing. I am sad for Lucy and for Jonathan. I had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and I was very worried; but yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from him. I had written to him asking if he had heard from Jonathan and he replied that the letter he was sending me he had just received. It is just a line dated from Dracula's castle, in which he says that at that moment he is starting the journey back home. It is not like Jonathan; I do not quite understand, and I feel very uneasy. And then, also Lucy, although she is so well, has lately fallen back into her old habit of sleepwalking. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided that I should lock our room door every night. Mrs. Westenra has the idea that sleepwalkers always go walking on the roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs, and then wake up suddenly and fall off with a desperate cry that echoes all over the place.

I understand her well, for I will do the same, with the difference that Jonathan and I will start life in a simple way, and we will have to try to make both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood (he is the honorable Arthur Holmwood, only son of Lord Godalming) is going to come here for a brief visit, as soon as he can leave the town, for his father is not so well, and I believe dear Lucy is counting the minutes until he arrives. She wants to take him to the bench in the churchyard on the cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I dare say it is the waiting that makes her impatient: she will feel better when he arrives.",52.021,51.913
312,"27 July.—No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him, though why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write, if it were only a single line.

Fortunately, the weather is so hot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually being wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and wakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy’s health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously ill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch her looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely rose-pink. She has lost that anæmic look which she had. I pray it will all last.","• July 27 There is still no further news about Jonathan. Why doesn't he write to me, even just a word? Lately, Lucy has been getting up more often at night, and every time I wake up, I see her pacing back and forth in the room.

On the contrary, thank God, Lucy is still healthy. Holmwood just received a telegram and had to return to Ring immediately; Lord Godalming's health is becoming very serious. Of course, Lucy is very upset because she cannot meet her fiancé as she thought she would, sometimes she even shows irritation and frustration, but her health is not affected at all, and her cheeks are sometimes even rosier than usual.

I look at that last letter of his, but somehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is his writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her which I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching me. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room searching for the key.","• August 3 Another week has passed, and I still haven't received any news from Jonathan! This time, he didn't even write to Mr. Hawkins. Oh! I hope he's not sick. But if that were the case, he would surely have sent a letter. Reading his last letter, I felt something was off. I no longer recognize him in the things he says in the letter. This time, Lucy is no longer sleepwalking as much as before, but now there is something really strange about her that makes me somewhat worried: even when she is sleeping, I still have the feeling that she is watching me. She tried to open the door several times, but when she realized that it was locked, she started looking for the key all over the room.",9.369,8.1,"August 3rd. - Another week has passed and still no news from Jonathan, even mr Hawkins, who writes to me, hasn't heard anything.

314,"6 August.—Another three days, and no news. This suspense is getting dreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should feel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last letter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable than ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and the fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and learn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is hidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey—except the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock; grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar, muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey mist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and there is a “brool” over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom. Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in the mist, and seem “men like trees walking.” The fishing-boats are racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that he wants to talk....","• August 6 Another three days passed, and Jonathan was still nowhere to be found. The waiting for me now has become a truly terrible anxiety. At this moment, I just need to know if I can write to someone or find someone, that would be enough to ease my mind. But among Jonathan's friends, not a single one has received any word from him. I can only pray to God to grant me the patience to wait longer. Lucy is truly more irritable than ever, although she is still healthy. Tonight there is a storm, the fishermen say that a storm is coming. Just by looking at the sky and the earth, I can also recognize the signs of the storm. Today's sky is gray; as I sit writing these lines, the sun has been completely obscured by the clouds heavily laden with moisture rolling in from the headland. Everything is a uniform gray, completely gray, except for the grass which still has a hint of dark green. The sunlight now only casts weak rays through the gray clouds down to the equally gray sea, where occasionally long sand dunes jut out like dark fingers. The white-capped waves continuously crash against the shore, but the noise of the sea seems to be muffled by the fog being driven inland all at once. It all creates a vast feeling. The clouds pile up on each other like giant rocks in the endless roaring space of the sea. Here and there on the beach, one can catch sight of vague human figures curled up in the fog, making anyone who sees them think they are seeing ""walking trees."" The fishing boats are hurrying back to the harbor to avoid the sea's calamity...There he is, old Swales, it seems the old man wants to come and talk to me.",7.283,6.444,"August 6. - Three more days have passed, no news. This uncertainty has started to become terrifying. If I knew where to write or where to go, I would feel more at ease; but since that last letter, no one has heard a single word from Jonathan. I must pray to God to give me patience. Lucy gets excited more easily than ever, but other than that, she is fine. Last night was very frightening, and the fishermen said that a storm was inevitable. I must watch and learn the signs in the air. Today is a gray day, and as I write these, the sun is hidden behind thick clouds over Kettleness. Everything is gray - except for the green grass that looks like emerald among the grays - gray earthy rock; gray clouds leaning over the gray sea where the sand dunes stretch out like gray fingers, slightly colored by the sunlight in the distance. The sea falls over the beach and sandy areas, choking and roaring as it accumulates inland. The horizon has disappeared into a gray mist. Everything is vast; the clouds are piled up like gigantic rocks, and there is a sound over the sea that comes like a sign of doom to the ears. On the beach, here and there, there are dark shapes sometimes half-hidden in the mists, giving the impression of ""trees walking like men."" The fishing boats are racing to return home, bobbing up and down in the ground swell as they drift towards the harbor, tilting from side to side as if about to sink. Here comes old Mr. Swales.

Lucy is more excitable than ever, but otherwise she remains well. Last night there was bad weather and the fishermen say there will be a storm soon. I must try to observe it and learn to predict the weather. Today is a gray day, and as I write the sun is hidden behind thick clouds, very high over Kettleness. Everything is gray, except the green grass, which looks like an emerald amidst it all; gray earth stones, gray clouds, tinged by the sunlight on the farthest shore, hanging over the gray sea, into which the sandbanks protrude like gray figures. The sea is pounding with a roar on the shallow, sandy coves, cloaked in the sea mist that reaches the land. Everything is vast; the clouds are piled up like gigantic stones, and over the sea, there are gusts of wind that sound like the omen of a cruel fate. On the beach, here and there, there are dark figures, sometimes shrouded by the mist, and they look like ""Trees with human shapes that walk."" All the fishing boats are heading quickly to the harbor, rising and plunging into the large waves as they sail towards the port, listing. Here comes old Mr. Swales.

It all touched me, and upset me very much.","— My daughter, I hope I won't shock you when I talk to you about all things related to death... Honestly, I have gone beyond my own thoughts and I want you to remember everything when I'm no longer here... We, the old folks, often tend to ramble. We are all close to the grave, and no one wants to think too much about death or to fear that fate! As for me, I have decided to talk a bit about death to somewhat reassure myself. However, my daughter, God as my witness, I am not afraid of death, not at all. It's just that, if only it wouldn't aim at me so soon, because I still want to live a little longer. But my time is surely coming to an end, because when one reaches a hundred years old, there's not much hope left. As you can see, I can't hold back these blasphemous words... yes, the Grim Reaper will soon sound the trumpet calling me back, but don't be sad, my daughter? - The old man said while wiping my tears. - Even if He calls tonight, I am ready to answer. Because after all, living means waiting for something different from what we have, something different from what we are doing. Death is the only thing we can count on in that situation. Yes, my little daughter, it can come and come very quickly, in fact, I am very content! Perhaps the wind from the sea has carried away all those ill-fated ships as well as the lonely, miserable lives... See? See, my child. - The old man suddenly exclaimed. - In that wind, in that mist, there seems to be something lurking like death? It is hovering in the cold wind! It's coming, it's coming, I know it... Oh God! Make me answer that call without regret! The old man reverently raised his hands to the sky and then respectfully took off his hat. His lips moved continuously as if he were praying.

My time must be approaching now, because I am old and a hundred years is far more than one can expect; I am so close to death that the Old Man has already started sharpening his scythe.

But, God bless you, miss, I'm not afraid of death, I don't fear it in the slightest; it's just that if I could avoid dying, it would be better. My time is running out, for I am already old, and a hundred years is too much for any man to hope for; and I am so close to it that the Old Man is already sharpening his scythe.

But don't grieve or regret my death -he said, seeing that I was crying-, for if it were to come tonight, I wouldn't refuse to answer his call. For life, after all, is just a wait for something else besides what we are doing; and death is the only thing we can truly depend on.

Perhaps it is in the wind out there at sea that brings with it loss and destruction, and painful ruins, and sad hearts. Look, look! – he suddenly shouted-.

It's maneuvering in an extremely strange way. It seems like it doesn't respond to the hands on the helm; it changes with every gust of wind.

325,"ONE of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood’s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers Emma and Scarborough made trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of “tripping” both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of “mares’-tails” high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical language is ranked “No. 2: light breeze.” The coastguard on duty at once made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour—flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the sketches of the “Prelude to the Great Storm” will grace the R. A. and R. I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and there that his “cobble” or his “mule,” as they term the different classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed. The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers, which usually “hug” the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but few fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea,","The most terrible and unexpected storm has just made landfall, causing unprecedented severe consequences. Before that, the weather was quite stifling but not unusual for a month like August. On Sunday afternoon, the weather was still very beautiful, but yesterday many villagers had left for other places or into the Mulgrave woods, making the atmosphere in Whitby and the surrounding areas suddenly become bustling. The weather remained normal, if not splendid, until late afternoon, but a few old men - who had the daily habit of climbing up to the cemetery to chat and watch the sea, as this cemetery was located on a towering cliff - were startled when they noticed ""cat-tail"" shaped clouds drifting in the northwest. At that time, the wind was only at level two on the anemometer. The coast guard had to urgently make a report about the unusual weather phenomenon; and an old fisherman, who had more than fifty years of experience in observing marine weather signs, announced that a terrible storm was about to fiercely attack the mainland. But the twilight still had enough strength to tint the clouds drifting towards the horizon with a rosy hue, creating a magnificent picture as a reward for those still lingering in the ancient cemetery. The setting sun gradually turned the headland into a dark shade like a sword slashing across the sky. The sunset mixed with the clouds in various shades of pink, purple, blue, and especially shimmering gold, creating all sorts of bizarre shapes. The most romantic artists could use this as inspiration for their nature paintings: they might name a piece, for example, Prelude to the Death Storm. No ship owner dared to boldly decide to let their vessel leave the port before the storm subsided. At dusk, the sea breeze completely died down, the space suddenly became eerily quiet, and the stifling, oppressive atmosphere typical before storms began to spread into every corner, making it unbearable for sensitive people. The sea was as dark as ink. The only thing that could still be clearly recognized was a foreign sailing boat. The boat had all its sails up, seemingly drifting westward. The carelessness and clumsiness of the officers on the ship were so evident that the crowd standing on the port was buzzing with discussion, trying to make them realize that there was a looming danger above them, and that they should lower all the sails.",4.44,3.666,"With its strange and unique results, the largest and most sudden storm on record occurred here. The weather was quite hot and humid, but it was not unusual for the month of August. Saturday evening was one of the best-known days, and the holiday crowd had planned visits to Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and various trips to places near Whitby for yesterday. The steamships named Emma and Scarborough were making excursion trips up and down the coastline, and there was an unusual number of ""tour trips"" coming to and departing from Whitby. In the afternoon, some regulars who often visited the East Cliff Churchyard and were accustomed to watching the vast sea stretching to the north and east from the first-class viewpoint noted the sudden appearance of ""mare's tails"" in the northwest, until then the day had been unusually beautiful. At that time, the wind was blowing lightly from the southwest, which in barometer terms is classified as a ""force two light breeze."" The coastguard on duty immediately prepared a report, and an old fisherman who had been observing the weather indicators at East Cliff for over half a century emphatically announced that an unexpected storm was about to break. The arrival of sunset was so beautiful, so majestic among the gloriously colored cloud formations, that a crowd had gathered on the cliffside path of the old churchyard to enjoy this beauty. Before the sun set beneath the landmass of Kettleness, as it boldly stood against the western sky, the descending path was painted with endless colors - every shade of fiery red, purple, pink, green, violet, and gold; alongside huge shadows here and there, all kinds of small but visible land shapes could be seen. The experience did not fail to impress the painters, and some sketches of the ""Great Storm Before"" will undoubtedly honor the walls of the Royal Academy and the Royal Institute next May. More than one captain immediately decided that the ""cobble"" or ""cutter"" (as they called different classes of ships) should stay in the harbor until the storm subsided. By evening, the wind had completely died down, and by midnight, the oppressive heat and the intense silence that precedes a storm, affecting sensitive people, had set in. At sea, there were very few lights visible because even the steamships that ""hugged"" the coast closely had moved far out, and only a few fishing boats were in sight. The only visible sailing ship appeared to be a foreign schooner heading west with all its sails set. During the time it remained in view, the recklessness and ignorance of the sailors on board became a fruitful topic of commentary, and efforts were made to signal it to lower its sails in the face of danger. Before night fully set in, it was seen gently rising and falling on the waves of the sea, its sails flapping idly:",21.902,21.724,"One of the strongest and most sudden storms in memory has just passed through here, with strange results. The weather was somewhat sultry, but by no means exceptional for the month of August. Saturday night was as good as any other, and the large number of visitors went yesterday to the Mulgrave woods, Robin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the other recreational sites around Whitby. The steamers Emma and Scarborough made numerous trips along the coast, and there was an extraordinary movement of people coming and going from Whitby. The day was extremely beautiful until the afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the churchyard of East Cliff, and from that prominent eminence observe the wide expanse of sea visible to the north and east, drew attention to a group of very high ""mare's tails"" in the sky towards the northwest. The wind was blowing from the southwest at a gentle degree that in barometric language is classified as 2: light breeze. The coastguard on duty immediately made the report, and an old fisherman, who for more than half a century has made weather observations from East Cliff, emphatically predicted the arrival of a sudden storm. The sunset was so beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly colored clouds, that a large number of people gathered on the sidewalk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy its beauty. Before the sun sank behind the black mass of Kettleness, openly meeting port to starboard across the western sky, its descent path was marked by a myriad of clouds of all the colors of the sky: red, purple, pink, green, violet, and all shades of gold; here and there were masses not very large, but notably of an absolute black, in all kinds of shapes; some only outlined and others like colossal silhouettes. The sight of that landscape was not wasted by the painters, and there is no doubt that some sketches of the ""Prelude to a Great Storm"" will adorn the walls of R. A. and R. I. next May. More than one captain decided at that moment and in that place that his ""pebble"" or his ""mule"" (as they call the different types of boats) would remain in the harbor until the storm had passed. By nightfall, the wind had completely died down, and by midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity that, as thunder approaches, affects people of very sensitive nature. There were very few lights at sea, for even the coastal steamers, which usually sail very close to the shore, stayed offshore, and only a few fishing boats could be seen. The only outstanding sail was a foreign schooner that had all its sails unfurled and seemed to be heading west. The stubbornness or ignorance of its crew was a topic exhaustively discussed while it remained in sight, and efforts were made to send signals to lower the sails, in view of the danger. Before nightfall, it was seen with its sails idly fluttering while it sailed with great tranquility over the choppy waves of the sea.",36.948,36.829
326,“As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.”,"The carelessness and clumsiness of the officers on the ship were so evident that the crowd standing on the port was buzzing with discussion, trying to make them realize that there was a looming danger above them, and that they should lower all the sails.",2.786,1.001,"In a painted sea, painted adrift like a ship. 18",16.59,8.914,"""As idly as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.""""",62.062,59.564
327,"Shortly before ten o’clock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the great harmony of nature’s silence. A little after midnight came a strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.","A little before ten o'clock, the oppressive atmosphere started to become suffocatingly stifling, and everything was so profoundly silent that one could clearly hear the bleating of a sheep or the barking of a house dog coming from a great distance. But that silence could not last forever. Right after the clock struck twelve, a strange and ominous rumbling sound was heard coming from the offshore, getting closer and closer, at the same time a faint thunder rumbled threateningly behind the deadly clouds.",13.354,12.029,"Shortly before ten o'clock, the calmness of the air became quite oppressive; the silence was so pronounced that the bleating of a lamb inland and the barking of a dog in the town could be clearly heard, and the lively French melody played by the band on the quay clashed with the great harmony created by nature's silence. Shortly after midnight, a strange sound came from the sea, and the air carried a peculiar, indistinct, and deep rumbling from above.",30.965,30.027,"Shortly before ten o'clock at night, the stillness of the wind became quite oppressive, and the silence was so pronounced that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the village could be distinctly heard; and the band playing on the pier, which was playing a lively French march, was a dissonance in the great harmony of nature's silence. A little after midnight, a strange sound came from the sea, and very high up, a strange, faint, hollow rumble began to occur.",47.763,47.193
328,"Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize, the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster. White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet, or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came drifting inland—white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion, so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm.","That thunderous roar was indeed an immediate sign heralding an unexpected disaster rumbling in right after. It was truly incomprehensible: within just a few minutes, the gentle nature suddenly turned its face, revealing its fierce essence. The calm sea transformed itself into a monstrous demon with gigantic waves crashing against each other as if wanting to level and destroy everything. The frenzied sea roared, demanding to swallow the shores and the steep cliffs. The winds at this moment also roared like thunderclaps, with a terrifying force that made it difficult for even the sturdiest men to stand firm on their path. The people lingering on the harbor had to quickly find shelter, as the danger was increasing by the minute. As if to prove its boundless ferocity, the sea was showing off with enormous waves crashing deep inland. On the shore, those with a weak heart could easily imagine these white mist clouds as countless bizarre ghosts, hovering and dancing on the beach. Anyone with a bit of imagination could immediately think of the image of the sea trying to drag all the small, fragile creatures on the shore down to its dark abyss with its deadly white hands. Yes, those white clouds could instantly envelop you if you were unfortunate enough to stand there. Occasionally, the sea ghosts would appear and disappear as sudden blinding flashes of lightning zigzagged across the sea, followed by thunderclaps that seemed to tear the sky apart. The continuous flashes of lightning made the sea seem even more majestic.",3.024,2.274,"Then, suddenly, a storm broke out. At that moment, it was at an unimaginable speed, even impossible to comprehend afterward; suddenly, nature had begun to shake entirely. The waves were rising with increasing fury, each one surpassing the previous one; until, in just a few minutes, the sea that had looked like glass turned into a roaring and all-consuming monster. The white-capped waves were madly pounding the sands at sea level and rising towards the sloping cliffs; others were crashing into the pier and washing the lighthouses at the ends of each of the Whitby Harbor piers with their foam. The wind was roaring like a storm and blowing with such force that even strong men could barely stand or had to hold onto iron poles tightly. It became clear that it was necessary to clear the piers of the crowds of spectators, otherwise the deadly events of the night would multiply. In addition to the difficulties and dangers of the moment, masses of fog from the sea were drifting inland - ghostly white, wet clouds; so wet, damp, and cold that it didn't take much imagination to think that the souls lost at sea were touching their friends with the cold hand of death; many shivered as the sea fog rolled in waves. From time to time, the fog would clear, and under the light of lightning followed by sudden thunderclaps that made the sky above us seem to tremble in astonishment at the storm's steps, the sea could be seen from afar.",16.509,16.086,"Then, without prior warning, the storm burst forth. With a swiftness that, at those moments, seemed incredible, and even afterward is inconceivable; the entire aspect of nature immediately turned convulsive. The waves rose, growing with fury, each one surpassing its companion, until in just a few minutes the glassy sea of not long ago was roaring and devouring like a monster. Waves with white crests struck the beach sands savagely and hurled themselves against the steep cliffs; others broke over the piers, and swept with their foam the lanterns of the lighthouses that stood at each end of the piers in the port of Whitby. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force that it was difficult even for strong men to stay on their feet, or to cling desperately to the steel supports. It was necessary to completely clear the mass of onlookers from the piers, or otherwise the misfortunes of the night would have increased considerably. As if the difficulties and dangers looming over the town were not enough, masses of sea fog began to invade the land, white and damp clouds that advanced in a ghostly manner, so wet, vaporous, and cold that it took only a small effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living comrades with the clammy hands of death, and more than one person felt shivers and chills as the spirals of sea fog climbed inland. For a few moments the fog cleared, and one could see the sea at some distance, by the light of the lightning, which now flashed frequently followed by sudden crashes of thunder, so horrendous that the entire sky above seemed to tremble under the storm's blow.",30.917,30.665
329,"Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest—the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been tried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea. Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat, with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.","Each time the waves rose, the sea surface suddenly elevated with undulating water mountains. Scattered here and there on the sea were a fishing boat and a small boat, looking like tattered rags not knowing where to go or how to escape. Occasionally, atop the waves appeared white seabirds struggling against the stormy winds. Standing tall on the eastern cliff was a lighthouse waiting to be used for the first time. The port's people were trying every possible way to make the light shine. And once or twice, this new light had proven effective - any ship or boat that saw the sweeping light from this lighthouse could find its way into the port without fear of crashing into the rocks. Each time a boat or a fishing vessel made it into the port, the crowd would cheer loudly from their hiding places. Of course, their joyous shouts were always drowned out by the roaring sea and stormy winds.",3.463,2.594,"Therefore, part of the emerging scene was immeasurably magnificent and interesting - the sea rising like a mountain, throwing masses of white foam skyward with each wave, and the storm seemed to be carrying them into space; here and there, a fishing boat with tattered sails was frantically hurrying to find shelter before the storm fully broke; occasionally, the white wings of a sea bird thrown by the storm could be seen. The new beacon at the top of East Cliff was ready for the experiment, but it had never been tested before. The officials responsible for it got to work and scanned the sea surface with the beacon during the intervals given by the fog rushing inland. Once or twice, it worked very well; for instance, a fishing boat with its bulwark underwater managed to quickly enter the harbor, avoiding the danger of crashing into the piers thanks to its guiding light. With each boat reaching the safety of the harbor, a cheer of joy rose from the crowd on the shore; this cheer momentarily interrupted the storm and then seemed to be lifted off the ground within its speed.",14.592,13.952,"Some of the scenes that took place were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest. The sea, rising as high as the mountains, hurled great masses of white foam into the sky, which the storm seemed to catch and scatter all over the space; here and there a fishing boat, with torn sails, desperately navigating in search of refuge from the danger; from time to time the white wings of a seabird tossed by the storm. At the top of East Cliff, the new spotlight was ready to go into action, but it had not yet been tested; the workers in charge of it positioned it, and in the pauses of the fog that was coming upon us, they swept the surface of the sea with it. Once or twice it rendered the most efficient of services, such as when a fishing boat, with its gunwale under water, rushed towards the harbor, avoiding, thanks to the guidance of the protective light, the danger of crashing against the docks. Every time a boat managed to reach the harbor safely, there was a shout of joy from the crowd gathered on the shore; a shout that for a moment seemed to stand out from the gale, but was finally overshadowed by its force.",27.64,27.273
330,"Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east, and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter, it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such speed that, in the words of one old salt, “she must fetch up somewhere, if it was only in hell.” Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any hitherto—a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, mirabile dictu, between the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed, swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However, all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.","Under the flickering lights, people could still see the sailboat raising all its sails offshore; it seemed to be the same boat they had seen at dusk. At this moment, the wind had shifted to the east, and the people hiding on the shore began to feel a shiver as they realized the terrible danger looming over the lone boat. Between the boat and the harbor was a jagged line of rocks stretching out, which had shattered countless ships before sending them to the depths. Once the east wind picked up, the boat would be like a grain of sand in that vast sea, unable to enter the harbor. Although it was high tide, the savage waves rose so high that when they receded, only the bare seabed was visible. Yet the boat, with its sails taut, sped forward; as an experienced fisherman would say, the boat was ""clearly heading somewhere down to hell. "" Driven ashore, the dense fog clouds appeared again like walls separating the world, allowing the fishermen and those on shore to perceive everything only through their ears. All that remained were the howling of the storm, the deafening roar of thunder, and the furious crashing of the waves. The lights now focused on a fixed point at the harbor entrance, precisely towards the east of the breakwater, where a collision was expected. Those lingering on the shore held their breath in anticipation. But the sea wind suddenly shifted to the northeast, immediately dispersing the fog. And something almost unbelievable happened: the sailboat rose above the massive waves, sped between the two breakwaters, and dashed straight into a shelter within the harbor. The beam of light immediately swept across the boat. The people on the shore were stunned when they suddenly noticed a dead body standing close to the rudder at the stern, its head drooping and swaying continuously from side to side with the rocking of the boat. There was no other person on it. The crowd gasped in horror, suspecting that the sailboat had sailed into the harbor by some magical force: was it the hand of the dead body gripping the rudder? However, the scene passed too quickly to describe in detail. The boat continued to speed towards the shore and crashed into a pile of sand and gravel accumulated by the tide and sea storms at the southeast corner of the harbor, adjacent to the end of the cliff, where there was another breakwater that the locals called Tate Hill.",9.312,8.946,"Soon, the beacon spotted a schooner with all sails set ahead; it was evidently the boat noticed earlier in the evening. By this time, the wind had turned east, and a shudder ran through the spectators on the cliffs as they realized the terrible danger the boat was now in. Between the ship and the harbor lay a flat rock where many good ships had struggled from time to time, and with the current wind direction, it seemed almost impossible for the ship to find the harbor entrance. It was almost time for the tide to rise, but the waves were so large that the shallow areas along the shore were nearly visible in the troughs between them; the schooner with all sails set was advancing at such a speed that, as the old sailors said, ""Even if it were Hell, it was certain to reach somewhere. "" Then came a wave of sea fog larger than any seen so far - a damp and cold mass of fog covering everything like a gray shroud and leaving people with only their sense of hearing; only their sense of hearing remained because the roar of the storm, the rumble of thunder, and the roar of the great waves came through the damp nothingness even stronger than before. The beacon's rays were fixed on the harbor mouth at the East Pier where the collision was expected, and the men held their breath and waited. The wind suddenly turned northeast, and the remnants of the sea fog melted away with the breeze; then, mirabile dictu, between the piers, a strange schooner with all sails set reached the safety of the harbor at breakneck speed before the collision. The beacon followed it, and everyone who saw the ship was horrified because a corpse with its head bowed was tied to the helm, and with each movement of the ship, the head of the corpse was swinging back and forth in a ghastly manner. No one else was visible on deck. When they realized that the ship had miraculously found the harbor guided only by the hand of a dead man, a great fear fell upon everyone! However, all this happened in a much shorter time than it takes to write these words. The schooner did not stop and quickly advanced in the harbor, grounding on the sand and gravel pile known to the locals as Tate Hill Pier, which jutted out under East Cliff, washed by many tides and storms.",24.169,23.965,"Shortly thereafter, the spotlight discovered at some distance a schooner with all its sails unfurled, apparently the same vessel that had been sighted earlier that night. At that hour, the wind had shifted to the east, and a shudder ran through all the spectators on the cliff as they witnessed the terrible danger in which the ship found itself. Between it and the harbor lay a large flat reef on which many good ships had crashed from time to time, and with the wind blowing in that direction, it would be an almost impossible obstacle to overcome if it attempted to reach the harbor entrance. It was almost high tide, but the waves were so impetuous that the sands of the beach were almost visible in their troughs, and the schooner, with all its sails unfurled, was rushing forward with such speed that, in the words of an old sea dog, ""it had to reach somewhere, even if it was only to hell."" Then came another burst of sea fog, thicker than all the previous ones; a mass of damp mist that seemed to envelop everything like a gray shroud and left men with only the sense of hearing, for the noise of the storm, the crash of thunder, and the rumble of the mighty waves that came through the humid atmosphere were louder than ever. The beams of the searchlight remained fixed on the mouth of the harbor through the east pier, where the collision was expected, and the men held their breath. Suddenly, the wind shifted to the northeast, and the rest of the sea fog dissipated; and then, mirabile dictu, between the piers, rising from wave to wave as it advanced at great speed, the strange schooner entered with all its sails unfurled and reached the sanctuary of the harbor. The searchlight followed it, and a shiver ran through all who saw it, for tied to the helm was a body, with its head fallen, swaying horribly from side to side with each movement of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck. A great state of reverence and fear overcame everyone when they saw that the ship, as if by a miracle, had found the port, guided only by the hands of a dead man! However, everything happened more quickly than it takes to write these words. The schooner did not stop, but, sailing swiftly through the port, rammed into a bank of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms, located at the southeast corner of the pier that juts out under East Cliff, and which is locally known as Tate Hill Pier.",37.366,37.223
331,"There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the “top-hammer” came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstones—“thruff-steans” or “through-stones,” as they call them in the Whitby vernacular—actually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.","The ship experienced a significant shock when it collided with a pile of gravel and sand. The masts and ropes were torn apart. And there was another surprise: just as the bow of the ship hit the shore, a large dog suddenly burst from below deck onto the deck and then leapt onto the shore as if urged by the recent collision. The dog ran headlong towards the edge of the precarious cliff - so precarious that some gravestones were jutting out - and then disappeared into the darkness beyond the lights.",3.224,1.897,"Of course, when the ship reached the sandbank, there was a great jolt. Every mast, every rope, every stay was strained, and part of the cargo on the deck spilled onto the ground. But the strangest thing was that as soon as the ship touched the shore, a huge dog appeared on the lower deck as if it had been thrown by the impact and leapt from the ship's bow onto the sand. Directly, it headed towards the steep hill where the soil from the top had fallen down, exposing some gravestones - known locally in Whitby as ""yard stones"" or ""long stones"" due to their horizontal position caused by the steepness - disappearing into the darkness that seemed to concentrate just beyond the focus of the lighthouse.",12.96,11.981,"Of course, when the ship crashed into the sandbank, a considerable jolt occurred. Every spar, rope, and stanchion felt the shock, and part of the main mast came down. But the strangest thing of all was that, at the very moment it touched the shore, a huge dog leaped onto the deck from below, and as if propelled by the impact, ran forward and jumped from the bow onto the sand. Running directly towards the steep cliff where the churchyard hangs over the lane leading to the east pier, so steeply that some of the tombstones (""transatlantic"" or ""cross stones,"" as they are vernacularly called here in Whitby) actually jut out where the cliff supporting them has collapsed, and disappeared into the darkness, which seemed intensified just beyond the beam of the searchlight.",28.383,27.825
332,"It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd. When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd, whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel.","The incident happened by chance; at that time, there was no one on Tate Hill. The residents of the surrounding houses were either fast asleep or had temporarily moved to the high mounds by the harbor. The coast guard rushed to the scene and was the first to jump onto the boat. The lighthouse operators, after a while of not detecting any further hazards on the way to the harbor, directed all the lights towards the stranded boat and kept the lights fixed there. On the boat, the coast guard hurriedly ran to the end to check. People could clearly see him bending down to look at the place where the rudder was, then immediately backing out as if he had just experienced an unbearable shock. This further stimulated the curiosity of those watching his presence on the boat. Many people rushed towards the boat to witness firsthand what had happened. I was also among the first to run from the cliff down to the breakwater. However, some people had managed to arrive before me. The coast guard, along with the police, had to work hard to prevent the curious from climbing onto the boat. However, as a reporter for the Dailygraph, I was allowed to board the deck. Along with a few others, I witnessed firsthand the corpse leaning against the rudder.",7.083,6.164,"By chance, there was no one at Tate Hill Wharf at that time because everyone who lived nearby was either in their beds or up on the hills. Therefore, the coast guard on duty on the east side of the harbor, who ran to the small wharf below, was the first person to board the ship. After the men operating the searchlight scanned the harbor entrance without seeing anything, they turned the light towards the shipwreck and kept it there. The coast guard ran to the stern of the ship, and when he reached the helm, he bent down to examine it and immediately pulled back as if struck by a sudden emotion. This situation aroused public curiosity, and a large number of people began to run. West Cliff is quite a distance from Tate Hill Wharf via the suspension bridge, but your reporter is a fairly good runner and reached the ship before the crowd. However, when I arrived, I saw that a crowd had already gathered on the wharf, and the coast guard and police were not allowing them to board the ship. With the permission of the chief sailor, I was allowed to board the deck as your reporter and joined the small group who saw the dead sailor tied to the helm.",22.994,22.572,"It happened that by chance at that moment there was no one on the Tate Hill pier, as all those whose houses were nearby were either in bed or had gone up to the heights for a better view. Therefore, the coast guard captain on duty on the east side of the harbor, who immediately ran to the small pier, was the first to board. The men operating the searchlight, after scanning the harbor entrance without seeing anything, directed the light towards the abandoned ship and kept it there. The coast guard captain ran across the aft deck, and when he reached the wheel, he leaned over to examine it and suddenly recoiled as if under strong emotion. This seemed to pique general curiosity, and a good number of people began to run. It's quite a distance from West Cliff, across the Drawbridge, to the Tate Hill pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and I arrived well ahead of the rest of the crowd. However, when I arrived, I found a crowd had already gathered on the pier, and the coast guard captain and the police were not allowing anyone to board. As a courtesy from the chief sailor, I was allowed to board as a correspondent, and I was one of the small group who saw the dead sailor still tied to the helm.",37.891,37.606
333,"It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the state of things, and a doctor—Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot Place—who came immediately after me, declared, after making examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of delegated possession, is held in a dead hand. It is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till death—a steadfastness as noble as that of the young Casabianca—and placed in the mortuary to await inquest.","Surprise, then fear were clearly visible on the typically honest face of the coast guard. The dead man's hands were still gripping tightly onto a spoke of the ship's wheel. Between those palms and the wooden spoke was a small cross, which no one knew who had placed there or when. The string attached to the cross was wrapped around both hands and also around the spoke of the wheel, along with several other strings tied messily around it. Surely, this poor man had been standing like that for quite some time, because in the raging storm, the wheel had freely turned this way and that, causing the binding strings to chafe and wear down to the bone on his wrists. A detailed report was made about this incident, and the physician, Dr. J. M. Caffyn (house number 33, East Elliot Square), who arrived right after me, declared after examination that the unfortunate man had been dead for two days. In the man's trouser pocket, they found a bottle sealed very carefully, containing a small roll of paper, which was later identified as the ship's logbook pages. According to the coast guard, the man had surely tied his own hands and used his teeth to tighten the knots before he died.",8.324,7.992,"The coast guard officer being surprised, even scared, is not for nothing because such a scene is rarely seen. The man's hands were tied first to each other and then to a stick of the helm. There was a cross between his palm and the wood, and the rosary attached to the cross was wrapped around both his wrists and the helm, all supported by strings. Perhaps the poor man was sitting at first, but as the sails flapped and struggled with the wind, the helm moved his body from its place, causing him to be dragged back and forth; so much so that the strings he was tied with cut into his flesh down to the bone. A definitive report on the incident was written, and the doctor who came immediately after me - Surgeon J. M. Caffyn from 33 East Elliot Place - stated after the examination that the man must have been dead for at least two days. In his pocket was a carefully corked bottle; inside it was nothing but a small roll of paper that seemed to be an addition to the logbook. The coast guard officer said that the man must have tied his own hands by undoing the knots with his teeth. The fact that the coast guard officer was the first to board the ship could prevent some difficulties that might arise in the Maritime Court in the future, because the coast guard officer cannot claim the right to salvaged goods granted to the first civilian to board a shipwreck. However, the legal jaws had already dropped, and a young law student loudly argued that ownership rights had already been lost, that it was held in violation of unsellable property legislation because although the helm's tiller was not proof of power of attorney, it was symbolically held in a dead hand. Needless to say, the dead helmsman, who kept his honorable watch until his death - showing a patience as noble as that of the young ""Casabianca"" - was taken from his place with great respect and brought to the morgue to await the official investigation.",21.024,20.745,"It was not surprising that the coast guard captain had been startled, or that he had felt fear, for it is not very common to see such things. The man was simply tied by his hands, one over the other, to the spoke of the steering wheel. Between his right hand and the wood there was a crucifix, with the rosaries with which he was bound wrapped both around his wrists and the wheel, all tightly secured by the ropes that bound him. The poor fellow may have been sitting at first, but the flapping and banging of the sails had taken their toll on the steering wheel and dragged him from side to side, so much so that the ropes with which he was tied had cut into his flesh down to the bone. A detailed description of the state of affairs was made, and a doctor, surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of East Elliot Place, No. 33, who came aboard immediately after me, declared after an examination that the man must have been dead for at least two days. In his pocket there was a bottle, carefully corked, and empty, except for a small roll of paper, which turned out to be an appendix to the logbook. The coast guard captain said that the man must have tied his own hands by tightening the knots with his teeth. The fact that the coast guard captain was the first to board may avoid some complications later in the Admiralty Court; since coast guards cannot claim the right of salvage that all civilians who are the first to find an abandoned ship can opt for. However, the legal officials are already moving, and a young law student is loudly and clearly asserting that the owner's rights are already completely sacrificed, with their property being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain, since the helm's tiller, as an emblem, if not proof of delegated possession, is considered mortmain. It is needless to say that the dead sailor has been reverently removed from the place where he maintained his venerable watch and guard (with a tenacity as noble as that of young Casablanca), and has been placed in the morgue awaiting further inquiries.",37.887,37.719

336,"9 August.—The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the Demeter. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a small amount of cargo—a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould. This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of 7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too, acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations. As the matter is to be a “nine days’ wonder,” they are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the S. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the animal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found; it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found dead in the roadway opposite to its master’s yard. It had been fighting, and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away, and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.","The discoveries following the unexpected appearance of the strange ship amidst last night's storm were even more astonishing than the event itself. It is now known that the ship was a Russian vessel from the region of Varna, and its name was Demeter. The first strange thing discovered was that the ship was carrying a cargo of seemingly worthless items - crates filled with soil sent to the address of a solicitor in Whitby, Mr. S.F. Billington, 7 Crescent Street. This morning, the person named Billington arrived at the port to receive the shipment in accordance with the proper paperwork procedures. As for their part, the Russian consulate officially reclaimed the ship after completing all diplomatic procedures and signing the ship receipt report. In Whitby today, people are only talking about the strange ship event. Many also mentioned the large dog that jumped ashore as soon as the ship's bow struck the gravel and sand. After that, the animal was nowhere to be found. Perhaps out of sheer terror from the storm, the animal hid somewhere in the dense, overgrown wastelands. Some people expressed doubts about this predicted scenario and also saw it as a real danger, as they said the animal seemed very ferocious. Early this morning, someone discovered a very large dog lying dead on its back on the road near the harbor. The owner of the dog, a drug dealer, found the poor animal lying dead right in front of his house. It was clear that the animal had been killed by a very strong and fierce opponent, as there was a real tear on its neck, and its belly had been ripped open by the fangs and claws of a wild beast.",8.872,8.467,"August 9.- The events following the strange arrival of the abandoned ship in last night's storm are almost more frightening than the event itself. The ship turned out to be a Russian vessel from Varna, named Demeter. The ship is almost entirely filled with silver sand; it has very little cargo - a few large wooden crates filled with soil. This cargo was received this morning by Mr. S., a legal advisor from Whitby, who officially took delivery of the goods sent to him.F.Billington, sent to number 7 Crescent. The Russian consul also officially took delivery of the ship under the charter agreement and paid all port fees, etc. Nothing else is being talked about here today other than this strange coincidence; the Chamber of Commerce officials were very meticulous about ensuring everything was done according to current regulations. They are clearly determined that there should be no reason for complaints later, as people's interest will soon wane. The dog that landed when the ship struck was a great curiosity, and more than one member of the SPCA, which is very strong in Whitby, rushed to embrace the animal. However, the dog's disappearance caused general disappointment; it seemed to have vanished from the town entirely. Perhaps it got scared and headed for the bushes; it might still be hiding there in fear. There are those who look at such a possibility with fear, thinking it might be a danger in the future, as it is clearly a wild animal. Early this morning, a large shepherd dog mix belonging to a coal merchant near Tate Hill Pier was found dead on the road opposite its owner's yard. It had fought and clearly had a wild opponent, as its throat was torn, and its abdomen was slashed open as if attacked by a predatory claw.",19.434,19.13,"The aftermath of the strange arrival of the abandoned ship in last night's storm is almost more astonishing than the event itself. It turns out that the schooner is Russian, from Varna, and it is called Demetrius. It is filled almost entirely with ballast of silver sand, with only a small amount of cargo: many large wooden boxes filled with earth. This cargo was consigned to a solicitor in Whitby, Mr. S. F. Billington, of The Crescent, No. 7, who went on board this morning and took formal possession of the goods consigned in his name. The Russian consul, also, acting on behalf of the shipping side, took formal possession of the ship and paid all the port dues, etcetera. Nothing else is talked about here but the strange coincidence; the employees of the Ministry of Commerce have been exceedingly scrupulous in ensuring that all legal procedures are followed according to the current regulations. As the matter seems to be ""a nine-day wonder,"" they are evidently determined that there should be no cause for further complications. Considerable interest has been noted regarding the dog that jumped ashore when the ship ran aground, and more than one member of the A. P. C. A., which is very strong here in Whitby, has tried to take charge of the animal. But to the general dismay, it has not been possible to find it anywhere; rather, it seems to have completely disappeared from the town. It may very well be that it was terrified and ran to take refuge in the marshes, where it is possibly still hiding. There are some who look with fear at this last possibility, as it could later become a danger, since it is evidently a fierce beast. Early this morning, a large dog, a mixed-breed mastiff belonging to a coal merchant near Tate Hill Pier, was found dead on the road in front of its owner's yard.

337,"Later.—By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been permitted to look over the log-book of the Demeter, which was in order up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced at the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my statement must be taken cum grano, since I am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for me, time being short.","• A few hours later The inspector from the Ministry of Commerce allowed me to open the logbook that had been kept sealed for three days in accordance with maritime law, but the contents of the logbook were not interesting except for details related to the loss of lives. To be honest, I have never known a stranger story than this. The authorities have agreed to let me record it here at the request of the readers. I feel that when drafting these log entries, the captain of the ship might have been suffering from some kind of madness just before setting sail, and his condition seemed to worsen throughout the journey. You should know that I have transcribed the contents of the logbook according to the translation of a Russian consulate secretary:",3.965,2.991,"Later. - Thanks to the courtesy of the Chamber of Commerce inspector, I was allowed to glance at the logbook of the Demeter, which was kept regularly until the last three days but contained no remarkable data other than the facts about the missing men.

Since there is no reason to conceal them, I was permitted to use them; I am sending you a copy of the technical details related to shipping and cargo transport. It almost seems that the captain succumbed to some kind of madness before dying in the blue waters of the sea, and this condition appears to have increased throughout the voyage.

He said that during his watch, he had stood hiding behind the ship's bow to avoid the rising storm, and had accidentally seen a tall but gaunt man, unlike anyone among us, appear on the deck, walk quickly towards the bow, and suddenly disappear. He followed, but when he reached the bow, he saw no one there; all the deck doors were still locked.

He had carefully watched the man and found no one when he reached the bow of the ship; all the hatchways were closed.

He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: “It is here; I know it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the air.” And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into space.

You work the helm.” And, with a warning look and his finger on his lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could not leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark, raving mad, and it’s no use my trying to stop him. He can’t hurt those big boxes: they are invoiced as “clay,” and to pull them about is as harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and write these notes.

At this moment, he looked no different from a truly insane person: his eyes were bewildered, his face clearly showing fear. ""Help me! Help me!"" He screamed while fearfully looking around the wall of fog. Then his fear was replaced by a feeling of despair, and he spoke to me in a rather determined voice: ""You should also find a way to manage before it's too late, captain. It's down there. Now I know everything very clearly. Only the sea can help me escape the claws of this monster!"" Before I could say a word or make any reflexive movement, I saw him jump into the sea.

However, I will find a way to thwart all the schemes of this demon: when I feel exhausted, I will tie my hands to the wheel and also tie to it that which... that which it dares not touch, and regardless of whether the weather is favorable or not, I will still find every way to escape and preserve the honor of a captain! I feel myself growing weaker, soon the night will fall again. If I delay, I might not have time to act... If not, at least people will know that I was not an irresponsible person.

Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed.

364,"10 August.—The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst the cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way. The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on it when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset. She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing: she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if there be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our seat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said, fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor dear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other people do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog. The dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few yards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a noise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs bristling out like a cat’s tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect, to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly fear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The whole agglomeration of things—the ship steered into port by a dead man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror—will all afford material for her dreams.","• August 10 The funeral of the poor captain today was truly moving. I believe that all the ships in the port gathered at his funeral. The naval officers directly carried his coffin from Tate Hill to the cemetery. Lucy went with me. The two of us sat on the familiar stone bench watching the funeral procession of ships go upstream the small river to the viaduct and then return to Tate Hill. Sitting at the top of the cliff, we could see everything within our view. We observed every detail of the burial ceremony. Lucy was very emotional, deeply sorrowful, when she saw the captain's remains being lowered into a grave right within our sight. Perhaps the restless nights and continuous dreams had a very negative impact on her health. But strangely, when I mentioned this, Lucy absolutely refused to admit the cause of her nervous tension, even denying that she felt that way at all. Perhaps today, her distress increased greatly after learning that this morning, old Mr. Swales was found dead right on the bench we were sitting on, with a cut on his neck. According to the doctor, it was certain that before he fell, the old man must have experienced an inexplicable, tremendous terror, as that terror was still clearly etched on his face when they found his body. What an unfortunate old man? Did he see the Grim Reaper?... Lucy is such a sensitive girl that everything can affect her more deeply than anyone else going through the same ordeal. While people were burying the unfortunate captain, she was haunted by something that didn't catch my attention at all, even though I am someone who always loves animals. One of the men who often came here to watch the boats and the sea appeared with a dog that he always brought along. For some reason, the dog didn't want to approach its owner, who was sitting on the same bench as us. The dog stood some distance away, barking and growling loudly. At first, the man gently reminded it, but the dog still wouldn't be quiet. He then raised his voice, and angrily shouted at it. It was useless. The animal barked even more fiercely than before. It was also furious, its eyes wild, fur standing on end like a porcupine's quills. The man truly lost his temper, jumped off the bench, and kicked the dog in the stomach, then furiously grabbed it by the neck and dragged it to the stone grave where the bench was placed. Strangely, as soon as it touched the stone, the animal fell silent, but instead, its body began to tremble violently. Not only did it fail to calm down, but the animal also collapsed to the ground, seemingly terrified of something. I tried to soothe it, but it was no use. Lucy also felt sorry for the animal, but she did nothing to comfort it, only looked at it with a very worried expression. I feared she had an incredibly sensitive and delicate instinct, adding to all that life had already given her. I wondered how she would get through the night! All the events that had just occurred: a ship arriving at the port with a dead body right before the helm, a prolonged funeral, then the dog alternating between fury and terror - yes, all of it happened at once, causing my friend to fall into new nightmares.",10.422,10.157,"August 10.- The poor captain's funeral today was very sad. It seemed like all the boats in the harbor were there, and the coffin was carried by the captains from Tate Hill Pier all the way to the churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old bench and sat down as the boat procession went up the viaduct and then back down. We had a very good view and watched the procession almost from start to finish. The poor man was buried very close to our bench; thus, when the time came, we stood on the bench and saw everything. Poor Lucy looked very sad. She was constantly restless and tense; I couldn't help but think that the dreams she had at night were having a bad effect on her. She is acting quite strangely about one thing: She doesn't admit that there is any reason for her restlessness, or if there is such a reason, she doesn't understand it herself. There is another reason for her restlessness: Poor old Mr. Swales was found dead on our bench this morning with his neck broken. According to the doctor, he clearly fell onto the bench out of some kind of terror, because his face had an expression of fear and horror that, according to the men, made their hair stand on end. Poor dear old man! Perhaps his dying eyes saw Death! Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels such effects much more strongly than other people. Now she is very upset over a small matter that I, personally, don't care much about despite liking animals a lot. One of the men who often comes here to look at the boats always has his dog with him. The dog is always with him. Both are very quiet beings; I have never seen the man get angry or the dog bark. During the ceremony, the dog did not come to its owner, who was sitting on the bench next to us, but stood a few meters away, barking and howling. The owner spoke to it first gently, then sternly, and finally angrily; but the dog neither came to him nor stopped making noise. It was in some kind of rage; its eyes wild, its fur standing on end like the tail of a cat going into battle. Eventually, the man also got angry, walked towards the dog, kicked it, and half-dragged, half-threw it onto the gravestone to which the bench was fixed. As soon as it fell onto the stone, the poor thing went quiet and started trembling. It didn't try to escape, it cowered and trembled in such a pitiable terror that I tried to soothe it, though it had little effect. Lucy also felt very sorry for it, but she did not try to touch the dog, only looked at it with pained eyes. I fear that Lucy's nature is too sensitive to go through life without trouble. I am sure she will see this in her dreams tonight. The combination of all these things - the ship being brought into the harbor by a dead man; the man being tied to the helm with a cross and rosary; the touching funeral ceremony; the dog in a state of furious terror - will provide material for her dreams.",27.889,27.747,"August 10. The funeral of the poor captain today was most moving. All the boats in the harbor seemed to be there, and the coffin was carried on the shoulders of captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier to the churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went very early to our old seat, while the procession of boats went up the river to the viaduct and then came down again. We had a magnificent view, and we saw the procession almost the entire way. The poor man was laid to rest near our seat, so we stood up and, when the time came, we could see everything. Poor Lucy seemed very nervous. She was restless and agitated the whole time, and I can't help but think that her dreams at night are affecting her. There is something very strange: she doesn't want to admit to me that there is any cause for her unease; or if there is a cause, she herself does not understand it. There is an additional reason in the fact that the poor old man, Mr. Swales, was found dead this morning in our seat, with his neck broken. Evidently, as the doctor said, he fell backward onto the seat, stricken with fear, for there was a look of dread and horror on his face that the men said made them tremble. Poor dear old man! Perhaps he saw death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so sweet and feels influences more keenly than other people. Right now she is very excited about a small detail to which I did not pay much attention, even though I myself love animals very much. One of the men who always came up here to look at the boats was followed by his dog. The dog was always with him. Both are very calm, and I never saw the man angry, nor did I hear the dog bark. During the service, the dog did not want to approach his owner, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few meters away, barking and howling. His owner spoke to him first softly, then in a harsher tone, and finally very angrily; but the animal did not want to come closer nor did it stop making noise. It was possessed as if by some kind of rage, with its eyes shining wildly, and all its hairs standing on end like a cat's tail when preparing for a fight. Finally, the man also got angry, and jumping off the seat, he kicked the dog, and then, grabbing it by the neck, dragged it and threw it onto the tombstone on which the seat is mounted. At the moment it touched the tombstone, the poor creature regained its peaceful demeanor but began to tremble desperately. It did not try to leave, but curled up, trembling and crouching, and was in such a state of terror that I tried to calm it, though without effect. Lucy also felt compassion, but did not try to touch the dog, only looking at it with pity. I fear very much that she has too sensitive a nature to be able to go through the world without problems. I am sure that tonight she will dream of everything that has happened. All the accumulation of strange events (the ship piloted into the harbor by a dead man; his posture, tied to the helm with a crucifix and rosaries; the emotional funeral; the dog, sometimes furious and other times terrified) will give her plenty of material for her dreams.",41.272,41.175

368,"Same day, 11 o’clock p. m.—Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I had made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovely walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean and give us a fresh start. We had a capital “severe tea” at Robin Hood’s Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have shocked the “New Woman” with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest, and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could. The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates, who don’t take supper, no matter how they may be pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and breathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and looks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now. Some of the “New Women” writers will some day start an idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or accepting. But I suppose the New Woman won’t condescend in future to accept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make of it, too! There’s some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night, because dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned the corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should be quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him.","• 11 PM the same day It's quite funny, the one exhausted after the walk is actually me! If I didn't have the habit of writing a diary, I probably wouldn't write anything tonight. We had a rather interesting walk. Lucy seemed more serene, she laughed heartily at the curiosity of the cows as they ambled near the fence, naively watching us pass by - this seemed to make both of us forget all our most troubling thoughts. Down at Robin Hood's Bay, in a small teahouse where guests could sit and look out at the seaweed-covered rocks, the owner served us an excellent tea. Surely, the mothers and sisters who call themselves ""fashionable women"" would be shocked to see us enjoying it so much. As for the gentlemen, thank God, they always seem more generous! After that, we continued back, but occasionally stopped to rest a bit. Back at the hotel, Lucy said she was very tired, so we decided to go straight to our room to lie down. But a young vicar had just come to visit, and Mrs. Westenra invited him to stay for dinner with us: I wasn't pleased, but Lucy was still fine. Her face looked so lovely with her rosy cheeks. If Holmwood felt love for her at first sight in the drawing room, I can't imagine how he would feel seeing her asleep like tonight! Perhaps some ""fashionable women"" writers would immediately think of a new trend: they would suggest that young men and women, before getting married, should watch each other sleep! But I think from now on, the ""fashionable woman"" will no longer be content with just accepting a man's proposal; she might even be the one to do it, and perfectly at that. That is just a consolation. I would be so happy to see Lucy healthier. I truly believe she has passed the most critical moment, and tonight she will have a peaceful sleep. As for me, I will have complete joy if I know that Jonathan...May God bless and protect him!",6.916,6.481,"The same day, 11 PM.- Ah! How tired I am! If I hadn't made it a duty to keep a journal, I wouldn't open it tonight. We had a very nice walk. After a while, Lucy cheered up; I think we owe this to a few cute cows that slowly approached us in the field near the lighthouse and scared us. I think we forgot everything except our personal fears, and in this way, we wiped the slate clean and made a fresh start. At Robin Hood's Bay, we had a perfect ""bitter tea"" in a lovely, tiny, old-fashioned inn with a curved window right above the seaweed-covered rocks on the shore. I'm sure our appetite would astonish the ""New Woman"". Men are more tolerant, God bless them! Then we walked home, taking a few, or rather many, rest breaks, with an unending fear of wild bulls in our hearts. Lucy was really very tired, and we aimed to crawl into our beds as quickly as possible. But the young preacher came to visit us, and Ms. Westenra asked him to stay for dinner. Both Lucy and I fought the sleep fairy for him; I know it was a tough battle for me, but I acted quite heroically. I think one day bishops should come together and find a way to produce a new class of preachers who, no matter how much they are insisted upon, do not stay for dinner and understand that the girls are tired. Lucy fell asleep and is breathing lightly. Her cheeks are more colorful than ever and oh, she looks so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her just by seeing her in the living room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now. Someday, some ""New Woman"" writers will support the idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other while sleeping before proposing or accepting a marriage proposal. But I think in the future, the ""New Woman"" will not show the humility to accept a marriage proposal; she will make the proposal herself. And she will do a very good job at it! We can find some consolation in this. I am very happy tonight because Lucy looks better. Really, I believe she has overcome the danger and the problems related to dreaming. My happiness would be complete if I knew Jonathan was well, God bless and protect him.",27.604,27.412,"Same day, 11 p.m. Oh, how tired I am! If it weren't for the fact that I have taken it as a duty to write in my diary every night, I wouldn't open it today. We had a lovely walk. After a while, Lucy was in a better mood, due, I think, to some peaceful cows that came to sniff us in the field near the lighthouse, and they completely drove us crazy. I think we forgot everything, except, of course, personal fear, and this seemed to erase everything and give us the chance to start anew. We had a magnificent ""English tea"" at a small and charming old-fashioned inn in Robin Hood's Bay, with an arched window overlooking the seaweed-covered rocks on the beach. I think we would have scared the ""New Woman"" with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless them! Then, we set off on the walk back home, making some or rather many stops to rest, and with our hearts in constant fear of the wild bulls. Lucy was truly tired, and we intended to sneak off to bed as soon as we could. However, the young priest arrived, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay for dinner. Lucy and I both had a quarrel about it with the miller; I know that on my part it was a very tough fight, and I am quite heroic. I believe that someday the bishops should meet and see how to raise a new class of priests, who do not accept staying for dinner, no matter how much they are insisted upon, and who know when the young women are tired. Lucy is asleep and breathing softly. She has more color in her cheeks than other times, and she looks so sweet! If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her just by seeing her in the living room, I wonder what he would say if he could see her now. Some of the ""New Woman"" writers might someday put into practice the idea that men and women should be able to see each other sleeping first before proposing or accepting. But I suppose that the ""New Woman"" will not condescend to accept in the future; she will make the proposal herself. And what a job she will have! There is some consolation in this. Tonight I am very happy because my dear Lucy seems to be quite better. I really believe that he has turned the corner, and that the problems caused by his sleepwalking have been overcome. I would be completely happy just to hear news from Jonathan... God bless him and keep him.",38.089,37.952
369,"11 August, 3 a. m.—Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write. I am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an agonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary.... Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark, so I could not see Lucy’s bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her dreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside. Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. “Thank God,” I said to myself, “she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.” I ran downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to the East Cliff, in the hope or fear—I don’t know which—of seeing Lucy in our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black, driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary’s Church and all around it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a half-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was, whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy’s condition. The time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, “Lucy! Lucy!” and something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living thing about.","• August 11, 3 AM I continue writing in my diary after being unable to sleep any longer. How could I sleep after that terrifying adventure? To be honest, I did manage to sleep for a while right after closing the notebook. However, I woke up with a start, drenched in sweat, without understanding why. I had the feeling that I was alone in the room; it was so dark that I couldn't see Lucy's bed. Only when I tiptoed closer did I realize that the bed was empty - Lucy was no longer there! I struck a match to see: she wasn't in the room! The door was still closed but not locked; I clearly remembered turning the lock before going to sleep. So Lucy had gone out. Not wanting to disturb Mrs. Westenra's hard-earned sleep, I quickly threw on a coat and rushed out to find her daughter. As I left the room, I thought that the clothes Lucy wore when she went out might give me a clue about her intentions while sleepwalking. If she was wearing her nightgown, she might still be somewhere in the house, but if she was wearing a dress, it meant she had gone outside. But her nightgown, along with all her other clothes, were still in the room. ""Thank God!"" I thought to myself, ""she couldn't have gone far in the middle of the night wearing only a nightgown!"" I rushed downstairs into the living room. Lucy wasn't there. I burst into all the remaining rooms, growing more anxious by the minute. Finally, I ran to the front door and was startled to see it wide open. Remembering that this door was usually locked every night, I began to fear that Lucy had gone outside with only her nightgown on. But I couldn't waste time thinking about what might have happened: a vague sense of dread was rising within me, making me incapable of focusing on details. I hurriedly ran out the door. When I reached Crescent Street, the clock somewhere struck a long chime, the street was deserted with not a soul in sight. I kept running without noticing a white shadow. Reaching the western cliff edge that jutted out over the bridge, I stopped to look around the eastern side, feeling both hopeful and fearful. I truly don't know how to describe my emotions when I saw Lucy's silhouette sitting on the familiar stone bench. The clear moonlight in the sky was being obscured by gathering dark clouds, leaving the world below alternately bright and dim. At times, I couldn't distinguish anything, as a massive dark cloud had enveloped the silhouette of St. Mary's Church and the surrounding areas. However, the clouds soon dispersed due to the strong winds, allowing the moonlight to once again illuminate the ruins of the abbey, then the church, and the cemetery. My waiting, whether hopeful or fearful, would not be in vain, for on that bench, the pale moonlight clearly revealed a white figure, half lying, half sitting. Another cloud quickly swept in, plunging everything back into darkness, but I still had the feeling that something very dark was standing behind the bench, bending over the white figure. I couldn't tell if it was a human shadow or that of an animal. Not wasting time waiting for the cloud to pass, I quickly slipped down to the harbor, walked along the fish market, and climbed up the bridge, as this was the only way to reach the eastern cliff. The deserted city made me feel more comfortable, because after all, I didn't want the world to know the true state of my poor friend Lucy. Time, and even distance, seemed to stretch endlessly for me; my knees began to tremble, and I felt increasingly breathless as I climbed the stone steps leading to the monastery. I mustered all my strength to climb to the top as quickly as possible, yet my legs felt as heavy as lead. Groping near the place, I immediately recognized the stone bench and the white figure there; now I was close enough to distinguish everything in the darkness. There was no doubt about it, there was clearly a long, dark shadow bending over my friend. I blurted out, ""Lucy, Lucy?"" and immediately saw a head lift up along with a pale face and bright eyes. Not hearing Lucy respond, I dashed into the cemetery. The towering shadow of the church obscured my view. I ran around the church. Finally, the moonlight, free of clouds, allowed me to clearly see Lucy in a half-lying, half-sitting position, her head resting against the back of the stone bench. She was alone there; behind the bench, there was no trace, not even the smallest, of any living creature.",11.064,10.858,"August 11, 3 AM.- Diary again. Now there's no sleep, so I might as well write. I'm too excited to sleep. We experienced such an adventure, such a surprising experience. As soon as I closed my diary, I fell asleep. I suddenly woke up, sitting up with a terrifying fear pressing down on me and a sense of emptiness around me. The room was dark, so I couldn't see Lucy's bed; I quietly went over and searched for Lucy by touch. The bed was empty. I lit a match and saw that she wasn't in the room. The door was closed, but it wasn't locked as I had left it. I was afraid of waking her mother, who had been sicker than ever lately; so I put on some clothes and prepared to look for Lucy. As I was leaving the room, it occurred to me that what she was wearing might give some clues about her purpose in sleepwalking. A robe meant home; a dress meant outside. Both the robe and the dress were in their places. ""Thank God!"" I said to myself; ""She can't have gone far, because she's only in her nightgown. ""I ran downstairs and looked in the sitting room. She wasn't there! Then, with a growing fear that chilled my heart, I looked in all the other rooms with open doors in the house. Finally, I reached the entrance door and saw that it was open. It wasn't wide open, but the latch wasn't in place. The household is quite diligent about locking the door every night, so I feared that Lucy had gone outside just as she was. There was no time to think about what might have happened; an overwhelming, all-encompassing fear blurred all the details. I grabbed a large, heavy shawl and ran outside. When I reached the Crescent, the clock struck one, and there wasn't a single person in sight. I ran along North Terrace, but there was no sign of the white figure I was expecting. With hope or fear - I don't know which - of seeing Lucy on our favorite bench, I looked from the edge of North Cliff over the harbor to East Cliff on the other side. There was a bright full moon and heavy, dark, moving clouds that turned the entire landscape into a visual feast of light and shadow as they drifted. For a second or two, I couldn't see anything because a cloud's shadow darkened Saint Mary's Church and its surroundings. Then, as the cloud passed, I saw the ruins of the Abbey reappear; a narrow line of light, as sharp as a sword cut, moved forward, and the church and churchyard began to come into view. Whatever my expectation was, it wasn't in vain, because there, on our favorite bench, the moon's silver light was shining on a snow-white figure leaning back slightly. The cloud quickly returned before I could see much more; the shadow almost immediately cut off the light, but it seemed to me that there was something dark standing behind the bench where the white figure had shone. I couldn't tell what it was, whether human or animal; I didn't wait to look again; I ran down the steep steps leading to the pier and ran across the bridge, the only way to reach East Cliff from the fish market. The town was dead, as I didn't see a single person; I was glad of this because I didn't want anyone to witness Lucy's condition. Time and distance seemed infinite; my knees trembled, and I began to breathe heavily as I struggled up the endless stairs leading to the Abbey. I must have gone quickly, but I felt as if lead weights were tied to my feet and all the joints in my body were rusted. As I approached the top, I began to see the bench and the white figure, for I was now close enough to distinguish it despite the shadow's effect. Undoubtedly, there was a long, black thing bending over the half-reclining white figure. In horror, I shouted, ""Lucy! Lucy!"" and something lifted its head; from where I stood, I could see a white face with red, gleaming eyes. Lucy didn't respond, and I ran to the entrance of the churchyard. When I entered, the church was between me and the bench, and I lost sight of Lucy for about a minute. When I began to see her again, the cloud had passed, and the moonlight was so bright that I could see Lucy lying slightly reclined with her head on the back of the bench. She was completely alone, and there was no sign of any living thing around her.",33.089,33.002,"August 11, 3 a.m. I am not sleepy, so it would be better if I write. I am too agitated to be able to sleep. We have had an extraordinary adventure; a very painful experience. I fell asleep as soon as I closed my diary… Suddenly I woke up completely and sat up, with a terrible sensation of fear all over my body; with a feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark, so I couldn't see Lucy's bed; I approached it and searched for her by touch. The bed was empty. I lit a match and discovered that she was not in the room.

She wasn't there! Then I searched the other open rooms in the house, with a cold, ever-growing fear in my heart. Finally, I reached the hallway door and found it open.

At the edge of West Cliff, over the pier, I looked across the harbor towards East Cliff, with hope or fear, I don't know which, of seeing Lucy in our favorite seat. There was a full, bright moon, with fast-moving black and heavy clouds, giving the whole scene a diorama of light and shadow as they sailed across; for a few moments, I couldn't see anything, as the shadow of a cloud darkened St. Mary's Church and all around it. Then, as the cloud passed, I could see the ruins of the abbey becoming visible; and when a narrow strip of light as sharp as a sword's edge passed along, I could see the church and the churchyard appear within the field of light. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for there, in our seat, the silvery moonlight illuminated a half-reclined figure, white as snow. The arrival of the cloud was too quick for me, and it didn't allow me to see much, as the shadows fell over the light almost immediately; but it seemed to me as if something dark was behind the seat where the white figure shone, and was leaning over it. Whether it was man or beast, I cannot say. I didn't wait to take another look, but ran down the steps to the pier and hurried through the fish market to the bridge, which was the only way to get to East Cliff. The town seemed dead, as there wasn't a soul around. I was glad it was so, as I didn't want any witnesses to the poor condition Lucy was in. Time and distance seemed infinite, and my knees trembled and my breath became labored as I climbed the endless steps to the abbey. I must have run fast, and yet, it seemed to me that my feet were weighed down with lead, and as if every joint in my body was rusted.

Undoubtedly, there was something long and black leaning over the half-reclined white figure. Filled with fear, I shouted, ""Lucy! Lucy!"", and something lifted a head, and from where I was, I could see a white face with red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not respond to me, and I ran towards the entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church stood between me and the seat, and for a minute I lost sight of it. When I saw her again, the cloud had already passed, and the moonlight illuminated the place so brightly that I could see Lucy half-reclined with her head resting on the back of the seat. She was completely alone, and there were no signs of living beings anywhere.",47.105,47.044
370,"When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips were parted, and she was breathing—not softly as usual with her, but in long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck, for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air, unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly, till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was. Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not. However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.","Lucy was sleeping very soundly, her lips slightly parted, her breathing not as smooth as usual. It seemed she was struggling with labored breaths to draw air into her chest. She stirred slightly and unconsciously pulled her nightgown up to cover her neck. I suddenly noticed she was shivering from head to toe. I gently wrapped my woolen scarf around her neck. However, it seemed my clumsy, frightened hand had jabbed her neck, as I saw her raise her hand to rub her neck and let out a soft moan. My long fingernail had hurt her, but she did not wake up because of it. After putting my shoes on her feet, I dared to gently wake her up. She let out another soft moan and exhaled deeply, but did not move any further. Realizing that a new day was approaching, which would make it inconvenient to take Lucy back to the hotel, I had to shake her a bit more firmly. Finally, she opened her eyes, but did not show any surprise upon seeing me, clearly still unaware of where she was. Even in her drowsy state, Lucy looked as beautiful as ever. Even though she had spent a cold, shivering night in a desolate graveyard, wearing only a nightgown, she had not lost her graceful charm. Even after waking up, she was still trembling. When I said, ""Let's go home right away,"" she silently stood up and obediently followed like a child. On the way back, the gravel had bloodied my feet. Seeing this, she stopped and insisted that I put on the shoes I had given her. Of course, I refused. Upon leaving the cemetery, I had to dip both feet in mud so that if anyone saw us, they wouldn't notice I was barefoot.",6.542,6.096,"When I leaned over, I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips were parted and she was breathing - not softly as usual, but with long, deep breaths as if she wanted to fill her lungs completely with each inhale. When I approached her, she raised her hand in her sleep and wrapped the collar of her nightgown around her neck. As she did this, she shivered slightly as if she felt the cold. I threw a warm shawl over her and fastened the edges tightly around her neck because I was afraid she might catch a bad chill in the night air while she was so exposed. I was afraid of waking her suddenly, so I secured the shawl around her neck with a large safety pin to free my hands and help her; but in my anxious clumsiness, I must have pricked or stuck her with the pin because soon after, as her breathing calmed, she brought her hand to her neck and groaned once more. Once I had carefully wrapped her up, I put my shoes on her feet and then began to wake her gently. At first, she did not respond, but she became increasingly restless, occasionally groaning and sighing in her sleep. Time was passing quickly, and for many other reasons, I wanted to get her home as soon as possible; finally, I shook her with great effort until she opened her eyes and woke up. Of course, she did not seem surprised to see me because she did not immediately understand where she was. Lucy always wakes up beautifully, and even at such a time, when her body was chilled from the cold and her mind was somewhat horrified by waking up in the churchyard at night without her clothes, she did not lose her grace. She shivered a little and hugged me; when I told her to come home with me immediately, she stood up without saying a word, like an obedient child. As we walked, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed the pained expression on my face. She stopped and wanted to insist that I take my shoes back, but I refused. But when we reached the goat path outside the churchyard, where there was a puddle left from the storm, I stepped into the mud with one foot after the other, so that if we encountered anyone on the way home, no one would notice my bare feet.",34.911,34.763,"When I leaned over her, I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips were open, and she was breathing, but not with the usual softness; rather, in large and heavy gasps, as if she were trying to fully fill her lungs with each breath. As I approached, she raised her hand and pulled at the neck of her nightgown, as if she felt cold. However, she remained asleep. I placed the warm shawl over her shoulders, tying the ends tightly around her neck, as I was very afraid she might catch a deadly cold from the night air, being almost naked as she was. I feared waking her abruptly, so to have my hands free to help her, I fastened the shawl near her throat with a large safety pin; but in my anxiety, I must have acted clumsily and pricked her with it, because shortly after, when her breathing became more regular, she brought her hand to her throat again and moaned. Once I had carefully wrapped her, I put my shoes on her feet and began to wake her very gently. At first, she did not respond: but gradually she became more and more restless in her sleep, occasionally moaning and sighing.

She shivered a little and hugged me tightly; when I told her to come back home with me immediately, she got up without a word and obeyed me like a child. As we began to walk, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed my jump. She stopped and wanted to insist that I put on my shoes, but I refused.

Once we saw a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as there are here, steep little closes, or “wynds,” as they call them in Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into bed. Before falling asleep she asked—even implored—me not to say a word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her mother’s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her, and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted—nay, infallibly would—in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do so.

Once home, after washing her feet, I immediately took her to her room. Before sleeping, she pleaded with me not to tell anyone, not even her mother. At first, I hesitated about whether to promise her, but after thinking it over, I decided to agree, as I was also concerned about her mother's health, knowing she would be shocked by the news.

Lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow.

377,"“His red eyes again! They are just the same.” It was such an odd expression, coming apropos of nothing, that it quite startled me. I slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare at her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat, whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself, for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary’s Church behind our seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I called Lucy’s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went early to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself; I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home—it was then bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen—I threw a glance up at our window, and saw Lucy’s head leaning out. I thought that perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and waved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then, the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell on the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a good-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs, but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat, as though to protect it from cold.","Lucy slept soundly until I woke up, and it seemed she only turned over once in bed. It appears that last night's adventure did not tire her out; on the contrary, I have the feeling she looks even more refreshed this morning, more so than she has in weeks. However, she still looks sad, very sad indeed. She must be recalling the terrible scene she went through on the cliff last night. We do not want to bring up that matter again. After dinner, Lucy complained of a headache and went back to bed. Once she was asleep, I dared to go out; I wanted to take a walk alone on the cliffs. To be honest, I also felt very sad because I always think of Jonathan. When I returned, the moonlight was so bright that although the hotel was almost entirely in darkness, I could still distinguish every small object. Looking up at the window of my room, I glimpsed Lucy's slanted shadow. I took out my handkerchief and waved, thinking she was looking for me. However, she did not move at all; it seemed she did not notice me. At that moment, the clear moonlight illuminated the corner of the house, so my window was as bright as day. I saw my friend with her eyes closed, leaning her head on the window sill. She was sleeping, and I had the feeling there was a large bird perched beside her. Afraid she might catch a cold, I rushed upstairs, but when I entered the room, I found her back in bed, still sleeping soundly with labored breaths, one hand clutching her neck as if to ward off the chill.",6.324,5.885,"“Those red eyes again!” “Just like those eyes.” It was such a strange, unrelated remark that it quite frightened me. I turned a bit to get a better look at Lucy without seeming to stare at her and saw that she was in a semi-dazed state with a strange, incomprehensible expression on her face; so I said nothing, but watched her eyes. She seemed to be looking at the bench where a shadow sat alone. I was a bit frightened, because for a moment it seemed as if the stranger had large, blazing eyes; but when I looked again, the optical illusion was gone. The red sunlight was shining on the windows of Saint Mary’s Church behind our bench, and as the sun set, the light refracted and reflected in such a way that it seemed as if the light had moved. I drew Lucy’s attention to this unusual effect; she started and came to herself, but she looked unhappy; she might have been thinking about the terrible night here. We never mention that night; so I said nothing and we returned home for dinner. Lucy had a headache and went to bed early. Seeing that she was asleep, I went out for a short walk; I walked along the slopes to the west; a sweet melancholy filled me because I was thinking of Jonathan. On my way back home -the moonlight was bright; so bright that although the part of the Crescent on our side was in shadow, everything could be seen very clearly- I glanced at our window and saw Lucy’s head leaning out. I thought she might be looking for me, so I opened my handkerchief and waved it. She didn’t notice or make any movement. At that moment, the moonlight slid from the corner of the building and fell on the window. There was Lucy, clearly, with her head resting on the window sill and her eyes closed. She was in a deep sleep, and beside her, on the window ledge, sat something that looked like a large bird. Fearing she might catch cold, I ran upstairs, but when I entered the room, she was still asleep and breathing deeply as she returned to her bed; she had brought her hand to her throat as if to protect it from the cold.",32.735,32.576,"–Again with his red eyes! They are exactly the same. That was such a strange expression, out of context, that it left me perplexed. I moved away a little, just enough to see Lucy well without seeming to be looking at her, and I saw that she was in a state of drowsiness, with such a strange expression on her face that I couldn't decipher it; so I didn't say anything, but I followed her eyes. She seemed to be looking at our own seat, where at that moment a dark and solitary figure was sitting. I myself felt a bit uneasy, for a few moments it seemed that the stranger had large eyes like blazing flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion.

Lucy had a headache and went to bed early.

At that moment, the moonlight crept around a corner of the building, and its rays fell upon the window. There was Lucy, with her head leaning against the side of the window sill, and her eyes closed. She was deeply asleep, and next to her, perched on the windowsill, there was something that seemed to be a bird of regular size.

The night before, I even saw her sticking her head out the window, and no matter how much I called, she didn't respond: she had fainted. Finally, when I managed to wake her, she cried silently with labored breaths. When I asked why she was at the window, she just shook her head and turned away. I hope her discomfort is not caused by the scratches on her neck. While she was sound asleep, I secretly checked her neck.

I would advise you that for a long time, you should not bring up these frightening stories with your husband; what is deeply ingrained in his thoughts surely cannot be easily erased.

417,"For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and greater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict observation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to know so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes.

At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:—","For half an hour or more, Renfield became increasingly agitated. Although outwardly I always appeared indifferent to him, in reality, I quietly observed his every move.

Then, he suddenly became completely silent and sat down heavily on the edge of the bed, his face showing a clear expression of resignation. He began to stare into the distance with a vague, inscrutable look in his eyes. I didn't know whether his emotions were real or fake, so I decided to test him by bringing up his little animals - a topic he was always very attentive to.

I had lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield had escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me. He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his bed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once sent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off. The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out of the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn’t get through the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost, and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house.","I had just been lying awake for a while when the clock chimed twice - so it was only 2 AM! I had just turned over wearily when I suddenly heard a knock on the door; the night attendant came to inform me that patient Renfield had escaped! I hurriedly dressed and rushed down the stairs. It would indeed be very dangerous if my patient were to wander freely around the surrounding areas. His stubborn thoughts could pose a real threat to anyone he encountered on the road. The warden was waiting for me. About ten minutes earlier, through a small hole in the door, he had still seen Renfield lying on the bed, seemingly asleep. But then, he was startled when he heard a noise outside the window. He ran to Renfield's room door but didn't see him there anymore: had he jumped out the window to escape? He immediately sent someone to call me. According to the warden, Renfield, wearing only a nightgown, couldn't have gone far. He asserted that Renfield had run to the left and then straight ahead. I also quickly jumped out the window into the yard, of course with the warden's assistance, and hurriedly ran in that direction. As I neared the bushes, I suddenly noticed a faint white figure climbing the wall that separated our garden from the garden of an abandoned house.",7.235,6.38,"I am pleased that I made this decision, and even more pleased that I adhered to it. I lay tossing and turning; when the guard sent from the ward came to tell me that Renfield had escaped, I had only heard the clock strike twice.

When I arrived, the nurse was waiting for me. He said it had not even been ten minutes since he looked through the observation hole in the door and saw him seemingly asleep in his bed. The sound of the window being opened outward caught his attention. He turned back and ran to the door, and upon seeing the patient's foot disappear out the window, he immediately called for me. The patient is only in his nightclothes and cannot have gone far. The nurse thought it would be more useful to watch where he was going rather than chase after him and risk losing his trail as he exited the building through the door. The nurse is a burly man and couldn't get out the window. I am slender, and with the nurse's help, I went out the window feet first and landed on the ground without injury, as we were only a few meters up.

I dressed and ran down immediately; my patient is too dangerous a person to be at large. Those ideas he has can work dangerously in front of strangers. The assistant was waiting for me. He told me that he had seen him less than ten minutes ago, apparently asleep on his bed, when he looked through the observation slit in the door. Then his attention was drawn by the noise of a window being forced open. He ran back and saw his feet disappearing through the window, and then quickly sent the guard to call me.

On the far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old ironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest I might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping is upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to him—the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in.

I hurriedly chased after him. When I reached the corner of the house, I saw him furiously pushing against the oak door of the chapel. It seemed like he was talking to someone, but I didn't dare get closer for fear he would recognize me and run away. Teasing a bee is not as difficult as catching a madman plotting to escape! However, after a few minutes of observation, I realized he wasn't paying any attention to what was happening around him, so I boldly moved closer, feeling reassured that the people I had just called for help had probably also climbed over the wall and were preparing to surround him.

Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse, tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself, and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear them, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again, and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved about, added: ‘I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be, have no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes to you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can treat of.’ I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of my being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I felt a thrill of joy through me when I knew that no other woman was a cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his face while he sleeps. He is waking!...","Dear Lucy, I know you are very anxious to know everything that has happened since we parted ways at Whitby station. I'll tell you! To Hull, I took a ship to Hamburg and from there, I took a train back here. It would be a bit tiring if I had to recall all the details of my journey. When I realized I had to find Jonathan and take care of him, I only thought of one thing: to sleep as much as possible. I met Jonathan, he looked emaciated, pale, and in a very poor state of health. In his eyes, there was no longer the resolute, calm look that I often described to you, instead, there was a dark gaze that did not recall anything that had happened to him recently, at least that was my impression when I first met him. Jonathan had gone through a real shock, and I fear that even if his memory is restored, he still won't be able to bear the recollection of what happened to him. Sister Agatha, a wonderful believer and a kind nurse, recounted that Jonathan only spoke of terrible things while delirious. I wanted to know more details, but Sister Agatha said that it was impossible, because everything a patient utters in delirium is considered God's secret, and if overheard, all doctors are obliged to keep this secret. However, the next day, knowing I was very worried, the sister met me and said: “All I can tell you is that your husband often spoke of a mistake he made. And you, who will soon become his wife, had nothing to do with this mistake. Your husband has not forgotten you, nor has he forgotten everything you have done for him. His worries stem from the terrible things that anyone, being human, would find hard to forget.” Perhaps the kind sister feared I was jealous, thinking that my fiancé had fallen in love with another girl! Jealous of a girl my beloved had fallen for! Jealousy? I have always trusted in Jonathan's love! My dear friend, now I can tell you that there is no woman who is the cause of his poor mental state. As I write to you, I am watching him sleep... He has woken up!",9.666,9.298,"I know you'll be curious to learn everything that has happened since we parted at the train station in Whitby. Well, my dear, I arrived safely in Hull, caught the ship to Hamburg, and from there, the train that brought me here. I can't remember much about the journey except that I knew I needed to sleep as much as possible since I would need to take care of Jonathan when I arrived. I found my beloved looking so weak, pale, and frail! My dear, all the determination in his eyes, that quiet dignity I told you about on his face, had vanished. He has become a shadow of himself and does not remember what happened to him during that long period. At least, he wants me to believe that, and I will never ask. He has suffered a terrible shock, and I fear that trying to remember it might strain his poor brain too much. Sister Agatha, who is a very good soul and a natural nurse, says that he raved about horrible things when he was acting mad. I asked her to tell me what they were, but she just crossed herself and said she would never tell; because a patient's ravings are considered God's secrets, and if a nun hears them as part of her duty, she must respect the trust placed in her. She is sweet and kind; the next day, when she saw I was distressed, she brought up the subject again and said she could never speak of what my beloved raved about, but added: ""I can tell you this much, dear: What he raved about was not something bad he had done, and there is no reason for you to worry as his future wife. He has not forgotten you or what he owes you. His fear is related to things so great and terrifying that no mortal could speak of them. ""I think this sweet person thought I might be jealous if my poor beloved had fallen in love with another girl. Imagine thinking I could be jealous of Jonathan! But still, my dear, let me whisper that I felt a joyful relief when I learned that another woman was not the cause of his distress. Now, I am sitting by his bed, where I can see his face while he sleeps. He is waking up!..",30.398,30.231,"""I know you must be very anxious to know everything that has happened since we parted at the railway station in Whitby. Well, dear, I arrived in Hull without any trouble, took the boat to Hamburg, and then the train from there. I feel like I can barely remember what happened during the journey, except that I knew I was on my way to Jonathan, and that, as I would surely have to act as a nurse, it was best to sleep as much as I could… I found my beloved very thin, pale, and weak. All the strength has escaped from his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity that I have always told you he showed on his face has disappeared. He is only a shadow of what he was, and he remembers nothing of what has happened to him in recent times. At least, that is what he wants me to believe, and therefore I will never ask him. He has had a terrible experience, and I fear his poor brain will pay the consequences if he tries to remember. Sister Agatha, who is a wonderful nun and a born nurse, tells me that he raved about horrible things while his head was disturbed. I wanted her to tell me what it was about, but she only crossed herself and told me she would never say anything; that the ravings of the sick were secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation came to hear them, she must respect her vows. She is a sweet, good soul; and the next day, when she saw that I was very distressed, she herself brought up the subject again, and after saying that she would never mention what my poor patient raved about, she added: 'I can tell you this, dear: it was not about anything bad that he himself had done; and you, who will be his wife, have nothing to worry about. He has not forgotten you nor what he owes you. His fears were about great and terrible things, which no mortal should speak of. I believe the sweet sister thought I might be jealous, fearing that my beloved had fallen in love with another woman. The idea that I could be jealous of Jonathan!. And yet, my dear Lucy, let me whisper to you that when I found out that it was not another woman causing all the trouble, I felt a rush of joy throughout my body. I am now sitting beside his bed, from where I can see his face as he sleeps. He is waking up…!",41.172,41.036

I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to let me look at it—for I knew then that I might find some clue to his trouble—but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment. Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:—","As soon as he woke up, he asked me about the notebook kept in his jacket pocket. I intended to beg him to let me read the notes in it - because I knew I would find clues to guess the cause of his breakdown, but it seemed he had guessed that intention from the look in my eyes, as he suggested I move near the window, he wanted to be alone. A moment later, he called me back, still holding the notebook, and spoke to me in a very serious tone:",15.083,14.102,"When he woke up, he wanted his coat to get something from his pocket; I told Sister Agatha, and she brought all of Jonathan's belongings. Among his things, I saw his notebook, and knowing that I might find a clue to his trouble inside, I was about to ask for permission to look at it when I think he saw my desire in my eyes; because he asked me to go to the window for a moment, saying he wanted to be alone. Then he called me back, and when I returned, his hand was on the notebook, and with a very serious expression, he said: ""Wilhelmina,"" - that was when I knew he was very serious because he hadn't called me by that name since he proposed - ""My dear, you know my thoughts on trust between husband and wife:",24.039,23.457,"""Upon waking, he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to take something out of his pocket; I asked Sister Agatha if he could do it, and she brought all his things.

You know I have had brain fever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to know it.

They should not hide anything from each other, and there should be no secrets kept by either. Therefore, I can confess to you that I have gone through a terrible shock; and now, as I try to recall what happened to me, I no longer know if it was real or just a nightmare. People have told you that I have a brain disease, like a kind of mental illness, isn't it frightening? The secret of what happened to me lies in these pages, but I don't want to mention it anymore. I want my life, and our wedding as well, to start from scratch. (Because, my dear friend, we will get married here, right after all the procedures are completed) Wilhelmina, do you want to share this innocence with me? Here is the notebook, take it and keep it, and if you want, you can read everything I have written, but remember never to mention any of it to me, I don't want to recall that terrible chapter... unless some duty compels me to do so. After saying that much, Jonathan fell asleep again due to exhaustion. I hugged him while slipping the notebook under his pillow.

He answered his ‘I will’ firmly and strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, I shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities I have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband—oh, Lucy, it is the first time I have written the words ‘my husband’—left me alone with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax, and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it to my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each other; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he took his wife’s hand, and said that it was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go through all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the year.","Lucy, do you know, many hours have passed since I put pen to paper...Time passes so slowly for me! But anyhow, now I feel overflowing with happiness! When Jonathan woke up, everything was ready. He struggled to sit up against the pillows on the bed and answered with a determined voice, ""yes"". As for me, I could only say very softly, overwhelming happiness made me sob with emotion. The devotees here are so dedicated to us! God wants me to never forget them, to never forget the heavy but gentle responsibilities I have to bear! Perhaps now I should tell you about my wedding gift. When the chaplain and the nuns left me alone with my husband. Oh! Lucy, this is the first time I get to write these words: my husband, I took the notebook from under his pillow, wrapped it in silver paper, and tied it with a bow like a real gift. I placed a kiss on it and told my husband that I would keep this memento for life as a testament to my faith in him and that I would never open the notebook unless it was for his benefit or in a truly urgent situation. He took my hand...Oh! Lucy, this is the first time he held his wife's hand...He replied to me that he would engrave my heart's sentiment in his and to be worthy of my affection, he would revive the past if necessary. Clearly, my poor man was ready to reveal a part of his past, but he couldn't determine the time that had passed, and I wouldn't be surprised if at some point, he not only forgets the days but also the years.",17.74,17.439,"Lucy, the moment came and went.

Then I kissed the package and showed it to my husband, telling him that I would keep the notebook this way, so it would be a visible and clear sign that we trust each other throughout our lives, and that I would never open it unless it was for his own good or an unrelenting duty.

He was still in the strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading—I might almost say, “cringing”—softness. I was satisfied with his present condition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated, but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for, coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking furtively at them:—","• August 22 Renfield's case is becoming increasingly complex and also more interesting: suddenly he has become very calm.

Hearing the warden report this, I immediately ran down and understood what was happening.

The patient grew calmer every instant, and presently said:—","• On the same day, a little while later Another adventure tonight. Renfield waited for the warden to enter the room and took advantage of the moment he was busy with something to run quickly into the hallway. I hurriedly ordered the night guards to chase after him.

Seeing me arrive with a guard, he went into a frenzy, and if my men hadn't grabbed his hands in time, he might have torn me apart. Surrounded and subdued by us, he became even more ferocious, but shortly after, he suddenly calmed down, which surprised me greatly. I looked around: there was nothing unusual. Following his gaze, I also didn't notice anything unusual in the moonlit sky, except for a large bat fluttering westward like a ghost.

He got very angry when he saw me; if the nurses hadn't caught him in time, he might have tried to kill me. Something strange happened while the men were holding him. Suddenly, he made twice the effort to escape from our grasp and then immediately calmed down. Instinctively, I looked around, but I saw nothing. Then I caught the patient's gaze and focused on where he was looking; in the great silence, I found nothing but the sky illuminated by the moonlight, with a large bat flapping its wings like a ghost towards the west.

474,"“I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present, and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is. We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained, for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed, however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to make a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:—","Seeing me arrive at Hillingham, Lucy appeared very cheerful and innocent. Her mother also stood close to her, and it didn't take me long to realize that she couldn't hide her condition forever with the hope of not causing her daughter anxiety and distress. Mrs. Westenra's caution was indeed necessary, but I still believed that at some point, her daughter would figure out her health condition, even if no one told her. I had lunch with the family, and without saying a word, all three of us silently tried to appear cheerful and carefree. These efforts were well rewarded: we genuinely had fun for at least an hour. Afterward, Mrs. Westenra said she wanted to rest, leaving me alone with Lucy. Until we moved to the living room to talk, Lucy kept up a cheerful demeanor, as the servants were constantly coming and going. But as soon as the door closed, she collapsed into a chair, covering her face with her hands and sighing. She could no longer keep up the act. I had to ask why she was sighing.",8.814,7.941,"I found Miss Westenra seemingly cheerful.

476,"“I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see the usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something mental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but regarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back, and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not returned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your relations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for her. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows what he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day; and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution, self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the kindliest and truest heart that beats—these form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for mankind—work both in theory and practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in him. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra to-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.","I immediately noticed that Lucy was suffering from anemia, although she showed no specific signs of the disease. Moreover, by chance, I was able to check her blood levels because she had a slight injury when opening the window. Of course, it was nothing serious, but it was enough for me to take a few drops of blood for analysis. The test results were very good. On the other hand, I did not see any worrying symptoms. However, when this anemia clearly stems from a specific cause, it must be due to some mental instability. Lucy also complained of shortness of breath and heavy, laborious sleep, similar to a stupor, often accompanied by terrible nightmares that her memory did not record any specific details of. Lucy told me that as a child, she suffered from sleepwalking, and this summer in Whitby, the condition clung to her again. One night, still in a sleepwalking state, she left the hotel and climbed a steep cliff where Mina Murray found her. However, she reassured me that she has had peaceful nights recently. Not being very knowledgeable about this type of pathology, I did what I thought was best: I wrote to my old friend and mentor, Professor Van Helsing, a master expert on similar diseases in Amsterdam. I asked Van Helsing to visit Lucy, and as he mentioned in his letter to me, he would cover all the costs of the trip, as I had told him that you are Lucy's fiancé. Anyway, I want to help Lucy to the best of my ability. As for Van Helsing, I am sure he will do his utmost for me. Therefore, when the professor arrives, we should follow his decisions. In some situations, the professor may appear authoritarian, but he truly knows what he is talking about, so please do not be obstinate. Van Helsing is both a philosopher and a metaphysician - he deserves to be one of the greatest scholars of our time. Therefore, I believe he will have an open mind to all possibilities. Moreover, the professor has nerves of steel, a resolute character, an iron will that always sees things through, a commendable self-discipline, and finally, an infinite kindness. These are the admirable qualities of the professor, a man who dedicates himself wholeheartedly to his humanitarian mission. I say this so that you can understand why I trust this professor so much. I have asked him to temporarily stop all work at home. Tomorrow, I will visit Lucy Westenra again, but not at her home, because I do not want my frequent visits to worry her mother.",10.514,10.234,"I could easily see that she was somewhat anemic, but there were no usual signs of anemia; by chance, I was able to measure the quality of her blood because a wire snapped while opening a stuck window and she slightly cut her hand with the broken glass. In itself, it was a trivial thing, but it gave me a clear opportunity, and I took a few drops of blood and examined them. The qualitative examination yielded quite normal results, and according to this conclusion, her health seems quite good. I was convinced that there was no need to worry about other physical matters; but since there must be a cause for this problem somewhere, I concluded that it must be mental. She complained that from time to time she had difficulty getting enough breath and that she had heavy, deep sleeps filled with dreams that frightened her, but she remembered nothing afterward. She says she had a habit of sleepwalking as a child, that this habit reappeared while she was in Whitby, and one night she went out in her sleep to East Cliff and Miss Murray found her there; but she emphasizes that this old habit has not recurred recently. I am skeptical of this and did the best thing that came to my mind; I wrote to my old friend and mentor, Professor Van Helsing of Amsterdam, who knows more about obscure diseases than anyone else in the world. I asked him to come here, and since you said you would cover everything, I told him who you are and what your connection is with Miss Westenra. I did this in accordance with your wishes, my dear friend, because I would take great pride and happiness in doing anything for Miss Westenra. For a personal reason, I know that Van Helsing would do anything for me. Therefore, whatever reason he comes here for, we must accept his wishes. He may seem like someone who does whatever he pleases, but this is because he knows what he is talking about better than anyone else. He is a philosopher, a metaphysician, one of the best scientists of his time, and I believe he is entirely open-minded. Besides these, his iron nerves, nature resembling a river of ice, unyielding determination, self-control, and tolerance, his extremely fine and honest heart - these are the tools of his noble work for humanity - all these work both in theory and practice, because his views are as broad as his all-encompassing love.

488,"“Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first saw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him feel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite geniality that I could see poor Lucy’s pretense of animation merge into reality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation gently round to his visit, and suavely said:—","And now it is the visit of our teacher and us. Lucy seems happier than the previous day, and her complexion also looks better. She no longer looks with the eyes that used to make him fearful, and her breathing has returned to normal. To the professor (as well as to everyone else), she appeared very lovely, and she tried to behave as naturally as possible. However, in my opinion, to be so cheerful, the poor girl must have struggled tremendously with herself. I believe Van Helsing thought the same as I did, because I saw the professor quickly furrow his brow when he looked at her. The professor chatted about various topics, except about ourselves and the patients, because he really wanted to bring true joy to Lucy. And while pretending to continue the flow of conversation, the professor slowly revealed the purpose of his visit:",12.552,11.709,"Yes, regarding the visit: Lucy was more cheerful compared to the first day I saw her and definitely looked better. The pallor that had unsettled you had somewhat faded, and her breathing had returned to normal. She behaved very sweetly towards the Professor (as always) and tried to make him feel comfortable; though, I could see that the poor girl was making a great effort for it. I think Van Helsing saw it too, because I noticed that sharp look I knew from the past under his bushy eyebrows. Then, she started talking about all sorts of topics other than ourselves and illnesses, and she did it with such great cheerfulness that Lucy's feigned liveliness disappeared and turned into reality. Then, without changing her demeanor at all, she gently brought up the topic of his visit and sweetly said:",26.701,26.126,"""Well, now, to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than the day I first saw her, and she certainly seemed much better. She had lost some of that ghostly look that unsettles you so much, and her breathing was normal. She was very sweet with the professor (she always is), and tried to make him feel at ease; however, I could see that the poor girl was making a great effort. I think Van Helsing noticed it too, for under his thick eyebrows I saw that quick look that I know so well. Then, he began to chat about all sorts of things except for us and illnesses, and he did it so cleverly that I could see how Lucy's feigned liveliness turned into reality. Then, without the change being noticeable, my teacher smoothly steered the conversation to the reason for his visit, and said calmly:",42.808,42.449
489,"“‘My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so much beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a ghastly pale. To them I say: “Pouf!”’ And he snapped his fingers at me and went on: ‘But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can he’—and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of—‘know anything of a young ladies? He has his madmans to play with, and to bring them back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and, oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all to ourselves.’ I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the professor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but said: ‘I have made careful examination, but there is no functional cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has been, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anæmic. I have asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question, that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say. And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go back home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if there be cause I shall come again. The disease—for not to be all well is a disease—interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me too. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.’","— My dear friend, - the professor began to explain - indeed, I am very honored to visit you, because my friend here wants us to act for a great love. And that is a truly precious sentiment, please believe me! Before coming here, my friend said that you looked very pale and weak. I replied: ""Oh dear..."" I did not believe what he said. Now you and I will prove to him that he was wrong. How could he - the professor said while looking at and pointing to me exactly the same way he did to me once, when I caused an accident while studying under him, which I still haven't forgotten - how could he possibly understand anything thoroughly about young girls? He should be busy caring for his patients, helping them find happiness, and returning them to their loved ones. The reward for a doctor's efforts like his is seeing the happiness of each patient. As for young girls! He doesn't have a wife, and of course, no daughters either, and young girls never trust young men, they only trust old men, those who have gone through many hardships and bitterness throughout their lives, which even they sometimes haven't fully realized. So, my dear, let him go out to the garden to smoke, and we will sit here and chat about some trivial matters. Knowing the professor's intention, I quietly went outside to walk around the house. But not long after, I heard the professor calling through the window. When we met again, he informed me: — I have examined very thoroughly but still do not see any signs of functional decline. Like you, I think perhaps she lost a lot of blood, I say lost, do you hear me clearly? I say that because she is no longer losing blood now. However, there is something very strange that she does not have any symptoms of anemia. I suggested she call her maid to ask a few questions, and then we will find the most accurate information possible. But in fact, I already know what this maid will answer. Anyway, there must be a cause leading to the pathological state, and there is always only one cause. I will return to Amsterdam to think further. Send me a telegram every day, and if necessary, I will come back here. I call it a disease because no matter what, it is still a disease that I cannot ignore, and even I cannot be indifferent to the charming girl. Yes, she is indeed very charming, lovely, and I would willingly come back just for her, even if you are not here and she is not ill.",5.929,5.377,"“Dear young lady, I am very pleased that you are so loved. Even if there are things I haven't seen, my dear, this is an important matter. They told me that you were feeling unwell and looking pale as a ghost. I say to them, ‘Pshaw!’"" Then she snapped her fingers at me and continued: “But you and I will show them how wrong they are. He,"" and she pointed at me with the look and gesture she used after a particular incident she never failed to remind me of, “what could he know about young ladies? They have fools to play with and bring them back to happiness and love them again. There is much work to do and oh, great rewards of happiness to be found. But young ladies! He has neither wife nor daughter, and young people confide in the elderly like me, who know many sorrows and their causes, not in the young. So, my dear, we will send him to the garden to smoke, and meanwhile, you and I will have a little chat alone.” I took the hint and wandered around; soon the Professor came to the window and called me inside. He looked serious and said: “I have examined very carefully, but there is no functional cause. I agree with you that there has been a great loss of blood; the blood loss happened a long time ago, it is not recent. However, her condition has nothing to do with anemia under any circumstances. To make sure I haven't missed anything, I asked her to send her servant to me to answer a few questions. I know well what the servant will say. Yet there is a reason; there is always a reason for everything. I must go home and think. You must send me a telegram every day; if necessary, I will come again. The illness -for not being well is an illness- interests me, and the dear sweet young lady interests me too. She has fascinated me, and I would come for her sake, if not for yours or the illness.”",27.363,27.165,"""My dear young lady, I have this great pleasure because you are charming. That is a lot, dear, even if he whom I do not see were here. They told me you were discouraged, and that you had a ghostly pallor. To them I say: bah! (and he snapped his fingers, adding afterwards): But you and I are going to show them how wrong they are. How can he (he said, and pointed at me with the same look and gesture with which he had once dismissed me from his class, or rather, after that occasion), how can he know anything about young people? He has his madmen with whom he plays, and to whom he returns happiness, along with the happiness of those who love him. It is quite a lot he does, and, oh!, but there are rewards, in the very act of being able to restore that happiness. More so with young ladies! He has no wife or daughter, and young people do not trust the young, but the old like me, who have already known so many pains and their causes. So, dear, we will send him to smoke a cigar in the garden, while you and I have a little confidential chat. ""I accepted the suggestion and left the room, until after a while the professor came out the window and asked me to come in. He seemed worried, but said: ""I have conducted a thorough examination, but there is no functional cause. I agree with you that there has been a lot of blood loss; there has been, but there is none now. Moreover, the young woman's general condition does not show any symptoms of anemia. I have asked him to send me his maid so that I can ask her a couple of questions, in such a way that there is no chance of missing anything. I know very well what she will say. And yet, there is a cause; there is always a cause for everything. I must return home and think. You must send me the telegram every day; and if there is a reason, I will come again. The illness, for not being completely well is an illness, interests me and she interests me too, the sweet young lady.

492,"4 September.—Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him. He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was some distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen, woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly. I cannot quite understand it.","• September 4 The more I observe my psychiatric patients, the more interesting I find it. Yesterday, he only had one episode. Near noon, he started to go berserk. Recognizing his familiar symptoms, the warden immediately called for assistance. Fortunately, everyone arrived in time; otherwise, we would have had a hard time restraining someone in such a terrible fit of madness like his. But only about five minutes later, he calmed down and, of course, fell into a prolonged state of melancholy again. The warden informed me that just before his episode, he had uttered some terrifying screams. This did not surprise me, as I had grown accustomed to the long, mournful cries in the wild states of some other patients. As I write these lines, it is dinner time for the inpatients, yet Renfield is still sitting with his knees hugged in a corner of the room, his face sorrowful with his own thoughts. I do not think much about his state of mind.",3.946,2.979,"September 4th. - The zoophagous patient still holds our interest. He only had one outburst, and that was at an unusual hour yesterday.

493,"Later.—Another change in my patient. At five o’clock I looked in on him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to his own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to humour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a harvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find a spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:—","• A moment later There was a change in the person of my patient. I went back to visit him at 5 o'clock, and it seemed he was very content with his fate. He caught flies and put them in his mouth, chewing voraciously, and each time he caught one, he would mark a line on the door with his fingernail. As soon as he saw me, he hurriedly apologized for his improper behavior and then requested, or rather begged, me to allow him to return to his room, where he could continue his work of recording in his notebook. I thought I had to make him abandon this erratic temperament, so I agreed to his request. He returned to his room and immediately opened the window, then he took a pinch of sugar and sprinkled it on the outer window ledge to catch flies. But this time he caught flies not to put them in his mouth, but to put them in a box as he had done before, and then he went to check all the corners of the room to look for a spider. I tried to probe him to see what he thought about the past days, because even a minimal thread in his thoughts would help me a lot in my work. But indeed, there was no way to draw him out of his silence at this moment. After a while, his sullen face suddenly showed a hint of sadness, and only then did he whisper in a barely audible voice, making me feel as if he was talking to himself rather than to me:",10.629,10.037,"Later. - There has been a new change in my patient. I went to see him at five o'clock and found him happy and content as before. He was catching flies and eating them, and he was keeping a record of his captures by making notches with his fingernail on the protrusions of the door frame. When he saw me, he came up to me and apologized for his bad behavior, and with great respect and obsequiousness, he asked to be taken back to his room and to be allowed to have his notebook back. I thought it would be good to humor him; so, he returned to his room and his window is open. He spread the sugar from his tea on the window sill and is having a good harvest of flies.

497,"Midnight.—Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra, whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart to endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less frenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised me, so I asked him: “Are you not going to keep flies any more?”","• Midnight Another change in Renfield's behavior. I had just returned from Lucy's house (her condition has improved) and stopped at the threshold of the asylum, intending to sit for a while to watch the sunset, when I was startled by a scream. It was him again. I felt a bit uneasy and saddened that I could no longer leisurely admire the wondrous sky at sunset casting its golden haze over London, but had to turn back to face the dismal stone walls of the asylum, which cast a hopeless shadow over a wretched soul. I stepped into Renfield's room as the sun was gradually setting outside the window. The patient's madness had subsided for a few minutes, but just as the sun disappeared, he suddenly slipped from the grasp of the person holding him and collapsed to the floor like a felled tree. It was truly surprising to see patients suddenly regain their sanity, even if only fleetingly, for after a few minutes, he stood up again and looked around with a very calm demeanor. I signaled to the attendants to let him act as he wished, because I was very curious to see what would happen. He quickly walked towards the window and swept all the sugar grains off the ledge onto the ground, then he opened the lid of the fly box to let them all fly out before tossing the lid away. Finally, he slammed the window shut and plopped down on the bed. — So you don't need those flies anymore?",8.342,7.62,"Midnight. - Another change in the patient. I had just returned to the hospital after visiting Miss Westenra, whom I found much better, and was standing at our door looking at the sunset when I heard Renfield shouting once again. Since his room is on this side of the building, I could hear him better than in the morning. Turning from the perfect, misty sunset over London, with its red lights, dark shadows, and all those extraordinary hues coming over the ugly clouds and even uglier waters, to the cold, stony rigidity of my building, breathing in the richness of suffering and my lonely heart that would endure it all, shook me. As the sun set, I reached the patient and saw the red orb setting from his window. At the moment the sun set, the patient's madness gradually decreased, and as it completely set, the patient slid to the ground like a heavy lump from the hands holding him. But the mental healing power that mental patients possess is extraordinary, for within a few minutes, he stood up with great calmness and looked around. I signaled the attendants not to hold him, as I was curious to see what he would do. He went directly to the window and swept the sugar crumbs outside; then he took the fly box in his hand, emptied it outside, and threw the box away; then he closed the window, crossed to the other side of the room, and sat on his bed. All this surprised me, so I asked him, ""Won't you keep flies anymore?""",32.349,32.101,"Midnight. Another change in him. I had gone to visit Miss Westenra, whom I found much better, and had just returned; I was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset when I heard the madman scream. Since his room is on this side of the house, I could hear him better than in the morning. It was a very strong surprise for me, and with displeasure, I turned my gaze away from the wonderful smoky beauty of the sunset over London, with its fantastic lights and purplish shadows, and all the wonderful hues seen in the dirty clouds as well as in the dirty water, to realize the sad austerity of my own cold stone building, with its wealth of breathing miseries, and my own desolate heart that endures it. I reached the patient at the moment the sun was sinking, and from his window, I saw the red disk disappear. As it sank, the patient began to calm down, and as it completely disappeared, he slipped from the hands holding him, like an inert mass, falling to the ground. However, the intellectual recuperative power that lunatics have is wonderful, for after a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around. I signaled to the attendants not to restrain him, as I was anxious to see what he would do.

We must also avoid making her aware of Lucy's situation at all costs, as it would be a painful shock that nothing could compensate for. My dear friend, we are facing seemingly insurmountable difficulties. However, with the grace of God, we hope to remain steadfast. Whenever necessary, I will update you further.

In one way or another, we are all madmen, and in the case where you show a lack of caution when caring for your mental patients, you would be acting no differently than the mad sheep of God. Do not tell your patients why you have to care for them, nor should you tell them what you are thinking. In situations that make us hesitate, he should keep what he knows to himself until his belief is more firmly established. Yes, let us keep what we know to ourselves, like this and like that... for now...

For reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: “The good husbandman tell you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all, there’s some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.” He broke off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very gravely:—","— My friend, when the wheat plant emerges from the ground but has not yet reached maturity, the milk of the mother earth still flows within its body. However, before the sun has yet to spread its radiant golden rays, the plowman hastily picks a stalk, crushes it in his rough hand, and blows away the still-green grain, saying to you: ""Just look at this! The grain is truly plump."" It is promising a bountiful harvest!” To be honest, I still haven't grasped the connection between the professor's metaphorical story and what we are discussing. Van Helsing did not reply but pinched my ear hard and pulled it to one side just as he used to do when I was his student. Finally, he explained: — The kind-hearted farmer said this because at that moment he was certain of a good harvest, but before seeing the wheat ears, he did not dare to boast. There would never be a case where a farmer would uproot the wheat he had spent so much effort sowing and tending to just to see how it had grown. Only carefree children would act like that, but those who sow seeds to make a living would never do so. Now, do you understand my point, my friend? I sow the wheat seeds, and nature must make them sprout. And if the seeds sprout, then what I await will be plump, full grains. Van Helsing's expression suddenly became pensive and hard to understand. After a moment of silence, he continued the story, his tone serious, quite different from before:",4.465,3.611,"“My friend John, when corn is growing, even before it matures - while Mother Nature's milk is still inside and the sun has not yet begun to paint it golden, the farmer pulls the cob and takes it in his rough hands, blows off the green husk, and says to you: ‘Look! This is good corn; it will yield a good harvest when the time comes.’” I didn't understand what he was trying to say and told him so. In response, just as he did in lessons long ago, he reached out and grabbed my ear, tugging it playfully as he said: “A good farmer tells you this because he knows, but until then he does not know. But you don't see a good farmer pulling the corn out of the ground to see if it is growing; that is for children playing at farming, not for those who see it as their life's work. Do you understand now, my friend John? I have planted my corn and there are things Nature must do for it to sprout; if it sprouts, there is hope; I will wait until the cob grows.” He suddenly stopped because he saw that I understood.

I didn't see the application, and I told him. In response, he extended his arm and took my ear between his hands, pulling it playfully, as he used to do during his classes in the past, and said: –The good husband says so because he knows, but not until then. But you don't find the good husband by digging up the planted corn to see if it grows; that's for children who play at being sowers. But not for those who have that trade as a means of subsistence. Do you understand now, friend John? I have sown my corn, and now nature has the job of making it grow; if it grows, then there is some hope; and I will wait until the grain begins to show.

When we were shown in, Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause or other, the things not personal—even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attached—do not seem to reach her. It is something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact.

Mrs. Westenra came out to greet us. She did not have the worried look that I had feared. The nature of nature has the good quality of always providing a remedy for the most terrible obsessions, even if death is lurking somewhere. Mrs. Westenra had donned an emotional armor against all harm, even when she sensed the changes in her daughter that I found frightening.

She assented readily, so readily that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were shown up to Lucy’s room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or hear. Van Helsing’s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose.

Then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door. “My God!” he said; “this is dreadful. There is no time to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart’s action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is it you or me?”","However, my understanding of the core of psychiatric pathology compelled me to adhere to a very clear course of action: I decided never to allow Mrs. Westenra to be present when we examined Lucy, and she should not be concerned about her daughter's health unless it was absolutely necessary. Lucy's mother tried to appear cheerful when accepting my suggestion. A maid led us, that is Van Helsing and me, into Lucy's room. If yesterday, looking at her, I only felt a slight concern, then today I was truly shocked by the change that had taken place in her: before me was a gaunt, sallow Lucy; her face was pale, her lips were colorless, and her gums seemed to have no blood circulating inside. Listening to her breathing at this moment was truly a torment: she was struggling to breathe to the point that it seemed she could not endure it much longer. Van Helsing's complexion seemed unchanged; he was deep in thought about something. Lucy lay still, she didn't even have the strength to greet us anymore. The three of us quietly looked at each other for a long time. Then Van Helsing slightly nodded to signal me, and we quietly left the room. The door hadn't fully closed yet when he pulled me, dragging me to the next room, and said: — My God! It's really terrible? We can't afford to waste another minute. Lucy will die from blood loss.

I am so thankful to you, sir, for coming.” When first the Professor’s eye had lit upon him he had been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed.

539,"Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come back to poor Lucy’s cheeks, and through Arthur’s growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy’s system must have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her. But the Professor’s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: “Do not stir an instant. It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.” When all was over I could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round—the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:—","And then, with a few quick, precise, and methodical movements, he began the blood transfusion. Life seemed to be gradually bringing a rosy hue back to Lucy's cheeks, while Arthur's face quickly turned pale, yet his eyes still shone with indescribable joy. Looking at my friend, I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. I feared that someone like him would find it difficult to recover after losing so much blood. The professor's face was very serious and tense. Holding the watch in his hand, he kept looking at the patient and then at Arthur. I was so nervous that I could hear every beat of my heart. Van Helsing suddenly told me: — That's enough. Now you have to keep an eye on him, and I'll take care of the patient. Arthur visibly weakened. I only dared to acknowledge this reality after the work was done. I was preparing to take Arthur outside after bandaging his wound when I heard Van Helsing's voice. He spoke without turning around, giving me the impression that he had eyes in the back of his head.",10.249,9.436,"Then Van Helsing quickly, but with absolute order, performed the procedure. As the blood transfusion continued, something resembling life seemed to return to poor Lucy's cheeks, and despite his increasing pallor, Arthur's face definitely appeared to glow with joy. After a while, I began to worry, because even though he was a strong man, the blood loss was badly affecting Arthur. This gave me an idea of the terrible strain Lucy's body was under; so much so that what weakened Arthur had partially healed Lucy. But the Professor's expression was stern, and with a watch in his hand, his eyes kept locking alternately on the patient and on Arthur. I could hear my own heartbeat. A little later, Van Helsing said in a soft tone: ""Don't move for a second. Enough. You accompany him, I will look after my little lady. "" When everything was over, I could see how weak Arthur had become. I bandaged the wound, and as I took his arm to lead him away, Van Helsing spoke without turning around - as if the man had eyes in the back of his head:",25.258,24.799,"Then, quickly but methodically, Van Helsing carried out the operation. As it was being done, something like life seemed to return to the cheeks of poor Lucy, and through Arthur's growing paleness, the joy on his face seemed to shine. After a short time, I began to feel anguish, for despite Arthur being a strong man, the loss of blood was already affecting him. This gave me an idea of the terrible strain Lucy's body must have been under, since what weakened Arthur only partially improved her. But my master's face was rigid, and he stood with the watch in his hand and his gaze fixed sometimes on the patient, sometimes on Arthur. I could hear the beating of my heart. Finally, he said in a low voice: –Don't move for a moment. That's enough. You take care of him; I'll take care of her. When everything was over, I could see how Arthur was weakened.

540,"“The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have presently.” And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the pillow to the patient’s head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up, and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing’s ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to me, saying: “Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port wine, and let him lie down a while.

But when Lucy made the first slight movement after receiving the blood transfusion, the black velvet band she always wore around her neck suddenly moved up, revealing a red mark. It seemed that Arthur didn't notice, but Van Helsing did, because I clearly heard his sharp and sudden intake of breath. Whenever he is emotional and surprised by something, I always see him react like that. He still pretended not to notice anything and turned to tell me: — Okay, go down with this brave friend of yours, give him a glass of Porto wine and let him rest for a while. After that, he will go home to rest, sleep well, and eat as much as possible to make up for what he just did for his fiancée. Don't stay here too long! Wait, there's one more thing! My friend, I believe you would want to know the result of what we just did. Rest assured! The operation was a complete success. You have saved the young lady, and now you can go home without any worries. You have done everything you could for her. I will talk to her when she has recovered. Surely she will love you more. Goodbye.",8.456,7.467,"“I think a brave lover deserves another kiss that he should receive immediately.” And now, having completed the procedure, he adjusted the pillow under the patient's head. As he did this, the narrow, black velvet band that Lucy always seemed to wear around her neck, fastened with a diamond brooch given by her lover, slid up a bit and revealed the red mark on her neck. Arthur did not notice this, but I could hear Van Helsing's deep sigh, one of his ways of revealing his emotions. He did not say anything for now, but turned to me and spoke: “Now take our brave, young lover downstairs, give him some port wine, and let him rest a bit. Then he should go home and rest, sleep a lot, and eat well so that he can recover what he has given to his love and heal. He should not stay here. Wait! One minute. I can see you have concerns about the outcome, sir. So, leave here knowing that the procedure was successful. This time you have saved her life, and you can go home and rest with a peaceful mind, knowing that everything that could be done has been done. When she recovers, I will tell her everything; she will love you even more for what you have done. Goodbye.”",26.295,25.942,"–The brave groom, I think, deserves another kiss, which he shall have immediately. And since he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the pillow under the patient's head. In doing so, the narrow velvet ribbon that she always seemed to wear around her throat, fastened with an old diamond brooch her boyfriend had given her, slid up a bit and revealed a red mark on her throat. Arthur didn't notice it, but I could hear the deep hiss of inhaled air, which is one of the ways van Helsing betrays his emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to me and said: –Now, go down with our brave groom, give him some wine, and let him rest for a while. Then you must go home and rest; sleep a lot and eat a lot, so you can recover what you have given to your love. You must not stay here. Wait a moment!

541,"When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently, but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently. The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a whisper:—","When Arthur had left the house, I returned to meet Van Helsing. Lucy was still asleep, but her breathing seemed much more gentle.

544,"“I have not examined it yet,” I answered, and then and there proceeded to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.","— I still haven't examined that wound carefully, let me remove the bandage and take a look. Indeed, on the outside of the jugular vein on the girl's neck, there were still two small marks like two unhealed punctures. It was certainly not a symptom of any pathology, but the edges of the wounds were pale white with frayed edges as if they had been there for a long time. I immediately thought that this wound, if it could be called a wound, might suggest a cause of severe blood loss for the girl, but I had to quickly dismiss this nascent thought because I found it utterly absurd. If one saw Lucy's pallor, as if she were about to die before the blood transfusion, her bed would surely be soaked with the blood she had lost.",9.199,7.946,"“I haven't seen it yet,” I replied and immediately went to loosen the bandage right there. There were two holes right over her jugular vein; they weren't big but looked somewhat bruised, they didn't look healthy. It occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it was, could be the source of this apparent blood loss; but as soon as this thought formed in my mind, I dismissed it, because such a thing couldn't be possible. With the amount of blood she lost that left the poor girl this pale before the blood transfusion, the entire bed should have been stained red.",19.22,18.498,"–I still haven't examined it -I replied, and at that very moment, I proceeded to unfasten the necklace. Precisely over the external jugular vein, there were two punctures, not large, but neither did they bode well. There was no sign of infection, but the edges were white and seemed worn, as if they had been mistreated. At the moment, it occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it was, could be the means of the evident blood loss; but I abandoned the idea as soon as I had formulated it, for such a thing could not be. The entire bed would have been soaked red with the blood the girl must have lost to have a pallor like the one she showed before the transfusion.",46.484,46.101

553,"8 September.—I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good, and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter’s renewed strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made preparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:—","I stayed up all night and, of course, didn't dare leave the patient's room for a minute. As night fell, the effect of the sleeping pills wore off, and Lucy woke up completely naturally. She was a completely different young girl from the one we had met before the blood transfusion. There was even a sparkle of joy and liveliness in her eyes, although the signs of deep fatigue were still there. When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had instructed me to stay up all night to watch over her daughter, she expressed reluctance to accept this suggestion, reasoning that her daughter had fully recovered. However, I did not relent and continued to prepare myself to stay awake all night by Lucy's bedside. After the maid finished her personal hygiene and I hurriedly ate dinner, I returned to sit by her bed. There was no one else in the room. Every time we looked at each other, I could read gratitude in her eyes. I had the feeling that she was gradually falling asleep, but at the same time, I sensed that she was resisting that sleep. She kept trying like that, and each attempt was more strenuous than the last. It was clear that she didn't want to sleep, so I had to ask her why.",13.351,12.873,"September 8 - I sat by Lucy's side all night. The effect of the narcotic wore off towards twilight and she woke up on her own; she seemed like a different person compared to before the procedure. Her spirits were even good and she was filled with a happy liveliness, but I could see the traces of the absolute exhaustion she had been subjected to. When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had ordered me to watch over Lucy, she almost scoffed at the idea, pointing out her daughter's renewed strength and perfect morale. But I was determined and made preparations for my long night watch. When her maid prepared her for the night, I went in; meanwhile, I had had my dinner and sat by her bedside. She did not object and looked at me with gratitude when our eyes met. After a long time, she seemed to fall asleep, but she struggled to gather herself and shook off sleep. This situation repeated itself several times with increasing efforts and shorter intervals as time went on. It was clear that she did not want to sleep, so I immediately addressed the issue:",29.418,29.053,"September 8. I spent the whole night sitting beside Lucy.

The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the past day and night.

You can lie on the sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon.

She showed me a room with a flickering fire next to her room. — There, you will rest there. I will leave both doors of the two rooms open. You will lie on the couch. I know that according to ethics, no doctor would want to lie on a bed when there is a patient. Rest assured, if anything is needed, I will call you immediately.

There is no young Arthur here now; I have to call on you yourself this time, friend John.” As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so, without a moment’s delay, we began the operation. After a time—it did not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one’s blood, no matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling—Van Helsing held up a warning finger. “Do not stir,” he said, “but I fear that with growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection of morphia.” He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips.

But we must get to work immediately. Now that Arthur is no longer here, I need to rely on your generosity, my friend John! The professor spoke while pulling out some tools needed for the blood transfusion from his bag; I hurriedly took off my jacket and rolled up my shirt sleeve as high as possible. We quickly got to work. After a few minutes that seemed to stretch into eternity - it was truly grueling to feel the blood flowing out of your veins, even when you are a volunteer. Van Helsing raised his finger to warn me: — Don't move anymore, you must be patient... But I'm afraid that when her strength returns, she will wake up, and that would be very dangerous. We need to be cautious. Perhaps I should give her another dose of morphine. The dose of morphine quickly took effect, as we saw our patient seemingly transition gradually from a state of coma to a natural sleep. Honestly, I felt a surge of pride when I saw her cheeks and then her lips begin to regain their rosy color.",4.839,3.863,"“It is not too late yet. Her heart is beating, weak as it may be, it is beating. Everything we did was in vain; we must start over.

At this moment, there was neither the possibility nor the necessity for a narcotic; thus, without losing a moment, we began the procedure. After a while -that while had not felt short because, although it was given willingly, the draining of one's blood is a terrifying feeling- Van Helsing raised his finger to warn me. “Do not move,” he said, “but I fear, due to her increasing strength, she may wake up and this could be dangerous, oh, it could create great danger. I must take precautions. I will inject morphine under the skin.” Swiftly and skillfully, he set to work to achieve his purpose. The effect of this procedure on Lucy was not bad because her unconsciousness gracefully blended into a drug-induced sleep.

No man can know what it feels like to have his own blood drawn into the veins of the woman he loves without experiencing it.",25.076,24.743,"He listened to the heart, and after a few moments of agonizing wait, he said: ""It is not too late.""

And as he spoke, he reached into the briefcase and took out the instruments for the transfusion; I took off my jacket and rolled up the sleeve of my shirt. In such a situation, there was no possibility of using a soporific, but there was also no need for one; and so, without losing a moment, we began the transfusion. After a certain amount of time (it didn't seem so short either, as the flow of one's own blood, no matter how joyfully it is viewed, is a terrible sensation), Van Helsing raised a finger in warning: –Don't move -he told me-, because I fear that when she regains her strength, she will wake up; and that would be very, very dangerous.

Ah, sweet little lady, there, that lovely nose is straight again. It has healing properties, but you don't know how. I'm placing it by your window, making a beautiful garland and hanging it around your neck so that you sleep well. Ah, yes! Like the lotus flower, these will make you forget your troubles.

Aha, my beautiful lady, that's it: such a pretty nose is very straight again. This is medicinal, but you don't know how. I put it on your window, make a beautiful garland, and hang it around your neck so you can sleep well. Yes; these flowers, like lotus flowers, make one forget their sorrows.

But the moment she disappeared, he gave me a sudden and strong pull, taking me to the dining room and closing the door behind him.",14.519,13.437
619,"Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair, and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. “God! God! God!” he said. “What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!” Suddenly he jumped to his feet. “Come,” he said, “come, we must see and act. Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him all the same.” He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we went up to Lucy’s room.","Indeed, this was the first time in my life that I saw Van Helsing showing signs of losing courage like that. He raised his hand to the sky as if to say that all his plans from now on would be in vain. Finally, he collapsed into a chair, covering his face with his hands and crying. Yes, he cried. His sobs seemed to come from a heart that was shattered and helpless. Then he raised his hand again as if to plead for justification before the world. — Oh Lord! - He lamented in a sobbing voice - What have we done, what has that poor little girl done to deserve this fate? Could destiny be so cruel? That poor innocent mother, just because of her good intentions for her daughter, has inadvertently pushed the girl's soul and body into danger without knowing it. But we cannot tell the truth to that woman, because she is living in a half-dead state, and her death would also mean the death of her daughter. Oh! Why have we fallen into such a predicament, oh Lord? But then he suddenly stood up and told me in a completely different tone: — Come here, we must do something new! Even if it's a demon, or a whole pack of demons coming together against us, it doesn't matter. We will fight, we will defeat them all. He quickly ran to the door to get the bag and then pulled me to run up to Lucy's room.",12.658,12.192,"Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing lose his composure. In silent despair, he raised his hands above his head and then clapped his palms together in helplessness; finally, he sat down in the chair and began to sob uncontrollably with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come from the pain in his heart, covering his face with his hands. Then, as if addressing the entire universe, he raised his arms again. “My God! My God! My God!” he said. “What have we done, what has this poor thing done to be surrounded by such suffering? Is the fate brought down from the pagan world of old still among us that such things must happen in this way? This poor mother, unaware of everything and wanting the best for everything, is doing something that harms her daughter's body and soul; moreover, we must not tell her, we must not even warn her, or she will die, they will both die. Oh, how trapped we are! How all the powers of the devil are working against us!” Suddenly, he sprang to his feet. “Come,” he said, “come, we must look at the situation and take action. Whether it is the devil before us or not, or all the devils together, it does not matter; whatever happens, we will fight.” He went to the hall door to get his bag, and we went up to Lucy's room together.",44.605,44.399,"There, for the first time in my life, I saw van Helsing dejected.

Then he raised his hands again, as if imploring the entire universe. –God! God! God! –he said-. What have we done, what has this poor creature done, that has caused us so much sorrow? Is there still a fate among us, inherited from the ancient pagan world, by which such things must happen, and in such a way? This poor mother, ignorant, and according to her doing everything the best way, does something to lose her daughter's body and soul; and we cannot tell her, we cannot even warn her, or she dies, and then both die.

627,"17 September.—Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong again that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since, however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my wits—the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and commanded me to do I know not what—have all ceased. I go to bed now without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from Haarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a day in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left alone. Thank God for mother’s sake, and dear Arthur’s, and for all our friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found him asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again, although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against the window-panes.","• September 17 Four peaceful days and nights - yes, four absolutely peaceful days and nights have passed! I feel strong enough to recognize myself. I even feel as if I have just gone through a long, very long nightmare only to wake up in a room filled with sunlight under the cool morning air. I suddenly remember, very vaguely, the dark, desperate memories in the midst of hardship, followed by long periods of oblivion. There is another feeling: I feel like I am rising to the surface of life, like a diver emerging from a suffocating abyss. Honestly, since Dr. Van Helsing came here, all the terrifying dreams have become things of the past for me. The sounds that used to frighten me - like the flapping of birds or animals against the window, or the voices from afar getting closer, and the calls that seemed to command me from nowhere - have not reappeared. Now I have also lost the fear of sleeping, so I no longer need to force myself to stay awake. And especially, those garlic-scented flowers have made me feel much more comfortable. Every day I receive a box of flowers sent from Harlem. Tonight, Dr. Van Helsing said goodbye to me; he has to go back to Amsterdam for a day. But the feeling of health and comfort has given me real confidence to stay in the room alone. I thank God when I think of my mother, my dear Arthur, and the friends who have wholeheartedly supported us! Whether someone is watching over me or not, I feel no difference anymore, because the night before, on two occasions when I woke up, I saw the professor sleeping on the couch. And yet, I still did not feel afraid to fall into a new sleep. Meanwhile, I don't know if it was the branches or the bats outside the window occasionally hitting the glass panes as if in anger.",8.838,8.283,"September 17. - Four days and four nights of peace.

But, with Dr. Van Helsing by my side, all these bad dreams seem like the past; all the sounds that scared me to the point of losing my mind - the flapping wings at the window, the voices that seemed close but were heard from afar, the harsh voices commanding me to do who knows what - seem like the past.

Suddenly the door was burst open, and in rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord into the Superintendent’s study is almost unknown. Without an instant’s pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and, as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely. Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist, keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist.

The blood is the life!”","• September 17 After finishing dinner, I returned to my room, planning to schedule the next few working days. Suddenly, my door burst open, followed by the abrupt appearance of Renfield: he charged straight at me with a very fierce expression. I stood there stunned, as it was very rare for a patient to unexpectedly seek out the head doctor without anyone's permission. He was brandishing a gleaming knife. I immediately realized that in his madness, he could become very dangerous, so I cautiously stepped back, intending to use the wooden table as a barrier between him and me. But he was quicker than I was; before I could regain my balance, he had already slashed my left wrist quite deeply. However, not allowing him to swing the knife a second time, I immediately lunged at him, pushing him flat onto the floor. Blood from the wound on my hand pooled into a small puddle on the carpet. Renfield remained lying still, seemingly not intending to attack again. It was only then that I had time to bandage my wound while keeping my eyes fixed on the patient. When the attendants arrived, we gathered around to lift him up and push him back to his room, but he started thrashing and suddenly turned around to do something that astonished me once again: he crawled on the floor like a dog and licked up the blood that had just dripped from my wound. As he licked, he kept muttering the same phrase over and over: “Blood is life? Blood is life!”",7.24,5.962,"September 17 - After dinner, due to the pressure of other tasks and the numerous visits to Lucy, I unfortunately worked in my room to complete my remaining tasks.

He had a dinner knife in his hand, and seeing that it was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. But he was far too fast and far too strong for me; thus, before I could regain my balance, he struck me with the knife and cut my left wrist quite seriously. However, before he could attack again, I lunged at him with my right hand and knocked him flat on his back. My wrist was bleeding heavily, forming a small pool on the carpet. Seeing that my friend had no intention of further struggle, I busied myself with bandaging my wrist without taking my eyes off the person lying on the ground. When the nurses rushed in and we turned our attention to him, what he was doing absolutely sickened me.

In his hand was a kitchen knife, and seeing that it was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. However, he was too quick and too strong for me; before I could regain my balance, he had struck the first blow, cutting my left wrist quite deeply. But before he could strike me again, I punched him with my right hand and he fell to the floor with his arms and legs spread out. My wrist was bleeding profusely, and a small pool formed on the carpet. I saw that my friend did not seem to be making another effort, so I focused on bandaging my wrist, all the while keeping a cautious watch on the prostrate figure.

Then there came to me the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be alone, I opened my door and called out: “Is there anybody there?” There was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again. Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog’s, but more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in; seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me.

The wind rushed in through the broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear mother’s breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I didn’t like to remove them, and, besides, I would have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went to the dining-room to look for them.","Although I had only fainted for a short time, I was still very vague about the terrifying moments that had passed. When I regained consciousness, the first sound that reached my ears was the distant ringing of a death knell, followed by the barking of dogs around the house, and from the bushes in the garden, not far from my window, came the melodious singing of a nightingale. Sorrow, fear, and severe health deterioration all seemed to come at once, leaving me as lifeless as a dead person. However, hearing the nightingale's song, I felt as if I were hearing my mother's beloved voice, gently speaking in the dark to comfort me. Surely the strange noise had awakened the servants in the house, because I could clearly hear their bare footsteps softly stepping on the stair landing. Hearing my faint call, they quickly stepped into the room. They all screamed in fear; it goes without saying how terrified they were when they realized the misfortune that had befallen us and saw my mother lying on top of me. The wind blowing through the broken window occasionally made the door creak. The brave girls gathered around to move my mother aside so I could sit up. Knowing they were very emotional, I told them to go down to the dining room and have a sip of wine to calm down. They opened the door and then slammed it shut immediately after stepping out of the room. I could still hear them exclaim once more, followed by the sound of hurried footsteps rushing down the stairs. At that moment, I didn't know what to do except painfully pick up the flowers to place on my mother's chest and recall Professor Van Helsing's instructions, but remembering was just for the sake of remembering, as I no longer needed these flowers for anything. I anxiously waited for the servants to return: we would keep vigil together. But they did not return. I called out: no one answered. Finding it strange, I decided to grope my way down to the dining room.",6.416,5.657,"The time it took for me to regain consciousness wasn't long, but it felt very, very terrifying. A bell was ringing somewhere nearby; all the dogs in the vicinity were howling, and a nightingale was singing in the thicket just outside. I was stunned and bewildered with pain, horror, and weakness, but the nightingale's voice was like the voice of my dead mother who had come back to comfort me. The voice seemed to have awakened the servants too, because I could hear the sound of their bare feet outside my door. I called out to them, they came in, and when they realized what was lying in my bed, they screamed in terror. The wind blew in through the window and the door slammed shut. They lifted my dear mother's corpse and, after I got up, they laid her on the bed and covered her. They were so frightened and tense that I ordered them to go to the dining room and have a glass of wine each. The door opened for a moment and then closed again. The servants screamed and all went to the dining room together; I laid all my flowers on my mother's chest. While they were there, I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I didn't want to move them, and besides, I was going to ask some of the servants to stay with me through the night. I was surprised that the servants did not return. I called out to them, but received no answer, so I went to the dining room to look for them.",34.267,34.016,"It did not seem to take long, but rather it was very, very terrible, until I could regain consciousness again. Somewhere nearby, a bell was tolling; all the neighborhood dogs were howling, and in our bushes, seemingly very close, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and dulled by pain, terror, and weakness, but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother returning to comfort me. The noises also seemed to wake the maids, as I could hear their bare footsteps running outside my door. I called them and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what was lying on me in the bed, they screamed. The wind burst through the broken window and the door slammed shut. They lifted the body of my beloved mother and laid her, covering her with a sheet, on the bed after I had gotten up. They were so scared and nervous that I ordered them to go to the dining room and each have a glass of wine. The door burst open for a few moments and then closed again. The maids screamed in horror, and then they went in a tight group to the dining room, and I placed the flowers I had had around my neck on my dear mother's chest. When they were already there, I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I did not want to remove them, and besides, one of the maids could sit with me now. I was surprised that the maids did not return. I called them, but received no response, so I went down to the dining room to look for them.",48.554,48.38
683,"My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious, and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother’s doctor uses for her—oh! did use—was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back in the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken window.","I nearly collapsed when I unexpectedly witnessed the scene before my eyes: four maidservants were sprawled on the floor, breathing laboriously. A half-empty wine bottle still sat neatly on the table, but the room was filled with a strange pungent odor. I picked up the wine bottle and sniffed: it was all the smell of cannabis alcohol. Opening the buffet cabinet, I realized the medicine bottle that the doctor used to care for my mother was completely empty. What should I do now? What should I do?...I staggered back to my room, to the bedside with my mother. I couldn't leave her. Now I was in the room alone, if not counting the poor maidservants lying unconscious downstairs due to the opium alcohol someone had poured into the wine bottle. Alone with death? And I didn't dare go outside, as the savage howling of the wolf somewhere still echoed in my ears through the broken window.",11.571,10.687,"I was devastated when I saw what had happened. All four of them were lying on the ground, breathing heavily and helplessly. The sherry decanter was half full on the table, but there was a strange, bitter smell in the air. I became suspicious and examined the decanter. It smelled like laudanum, and when I looked at the sideboard, I saw that the bottle my mother's doctor used to -oh, once used to- use for her was empty. What am I going to do? What am I going to do? I returned to the room to be with my mother. I can't leave her, and except for the servants who were drugged and put to sleep, I'm all alone. Alone with the dead! I don't dare go outside, because I can hear the deep howling of the wolf through the broken window.",34.372,33.9,"My heart sank when I saw what had happened.

687,"18 September.—I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early. Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while, finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an hour—for it was now ten o’clock—and so rang and knocked again, but more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses; and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry anywhere.","• September 18 I arrived at Hillingham very early. Leaving the car parked outside the gate, I walked all the way to the house. I knocked on the door very gently so as not to wake Lucy and Mrs. Westenra if they were still sleeping. I hoped that only the servants would hear the knock. After waiting a while and seeing no one come out, I knocked again, then banged harder. There was still no response. I began to get annoyed with the servants, as it was almost ten in the morning and they were still sound asleep. Thinking about it made me furious and impatient, so I banged on the door repeatedly, but it was all in vain. Granted, the servants were mainly responsible for this silence, but for some reason, an indescribable fear surged within me. Could this silence be yet another sign of the curse that has been haunting us for so long? Do I really have the courage to step into a house where death has arrived before me? I knew that every minute, every second that passed could lead to extremely dire consequences for Lucy if her health deteriorated once again, so I decided to circle around the house in the hope of finding an entrance I had not known before.",7.88,6.909,"September 18. - I immediately drove to Hillingham and arrived there early in the morning. Leaving my car at the garden gate, I walked alone down the tree-lined path to the house. I knocked on the door slowly and rang the bell as quietly as possible because I was afraid of disturbing Lucy or her mother and hoped to bring only one of the servants to the door. After a while, when I received no response, I knocked and rang the bell again; still no answer. At this hour - for it was ten o'clock - I cursed the laziness of the servants who might be in bed and thus knocked and rang the bell more impatiently once again, but still, there was no response. Until now, I had only blamed the servants, but now a great fear began to fill me. Was this abandonment a new link in the chain of bad news that was tightening around us? Was this house, to which I had indeed arrived too late, a house of death? I knew that being late by even a few minutes, or even seconds, could mean long hours of danger for Lucy if her condition had relapsed; I circled the house hoping to find any possible entrance by chance.",28.616,28.24,"September 18. I went immediately to Hillingham and arrived early. Leaving my carriage at the gate, I ran down the avenue alone. I rang the bell softly, as delicately as possible, for I feared disturbing Lucy or her mother, and hoped that only a servant would answer the door. After a while, finding no response, I rang again; still, no one answered. I cursed the laziness of the servants who might still be in bed at that hour, as it was ten in the morning, so I rang again, but more impatiently, still without obtaining a response. Up to this point, I had only blamed the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this desolation another link in the chain of misfortunes that seemed to be surrounding us? Could it be that I had arrived at a mansion of death, too late?

688,"I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse’s feet. They stopped at the gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue. When he saw me, he gasped out:—","I knew that every minute, every second that passed could lead to extremely dire consequences for Lucy if her health deteriorated once again, so I decided to circle around the house in the hope of finding an entrance I had not known before. All the doors were tightly locked, and the windows were firmly shut, which made me extremely disappointed. I could only return to the original place. Just as I reached the main door, I suddenly felt a sense of suspicion when I heard the sound of horse hooves pounding on the road, then abruptly stopping right in front of the gate; a few seconds later, I recognized Van Helsing's figure stepping down from the carriage, he hurriedly ran into the house. Seeing me, he immediately asked, panting: — Ah!",6.397,5.083,"I couldn't find a way to get inside. All the doors and windows were closed and locked, and I turned back to the porch in bewilderment. As I went there, I heard the rapid sound of a horse's hooves being driven like a bullet.

When he saw me, he started speaking breathlessly:",28.652,27.666,"I couldn't find any way to get in. Every window and door was bolted and locked, so I returned puzzled to the porch.

He paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly:—","I tried to answer clearly and concisely that I had just received his call early in the morning, that I had arranged all my work to come here immediately. I knocked and knocked repeatedly but still didn't get any response. Van Helsing took off his hat and stood silently for a moment.

692,"We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There was no one in the kitchen or in the servants’ rooms, which were close at hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room, dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead, for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we moved away he said: “We can attend to them later.” Then we ascended to Lucy’s room. For an instant or two we paused at the door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the room.","We both went around to the back of the house. Van Helsing held a scalpel and pointed towards a kitchen window. I slid a thin knife through the gap in the door, flipped the latch, and opened the two window panes wide. I helped the professor climb into the kitchen first, then I followed. There was no one in the kitchen, nor in the pantry. We peeked into the rooms on the ground floor, but they were all empty. Only when we reached the dining room, thanks to a faint light filtering through the fanlights, did we notice four servants lying on the floor. We didn't think they were dead, as their heavy opium-laced breaths in the room indicated their condition. Van Helsing calmly told me, ""We will come back to them later,"" then immediately pulled me up to Lucy's room. However, when we got there, we didn't enter right away but stopped at the door to listen: everything was eerily silent. We nervously opened the door, filled with suspense and anxiety.",17.567,17.155,"We circled around to the back of the house where the kitchen window was located. The professor took a small surgical saw from his bag and handed it to me, pointing at the iron bars guarding the window. I immediately set to work and soon cut through three of them. Then, with a long, thin knife, we pushed back the latches of the window sashes and opened the window. I helped the professor inside and followed him. There was no one in the kitchen or the nearby servant rooms. As we advanced, we checked all the rooms and found four maidservants lying on the floor in the dining room, dimly lit by the light filtering through the shutters. There was no reason to think they were dead, as their wheezing breaths and the bitter opium smell in the room left no doubt about their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we walked, he said, “We can deal with them later.” Then, we went up to Lucy’s room. We paused at the door for a second or two to listen inside, but there was no sound to be heard. With pale faces and trembling hands, we slowly opened the door and entered the room.",46.51,46.277,"We took a detour and went to the back of the house, where a kitchen window was open.

There was no one in the kitchen or in the nearby service rooms. We pressed the knob of every room as we walked, and in the dining room, dimly lit by the rays of light passing through the blinds, we found the four maids lying on the floor. There was no need to think they were dead, as their labored breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt about their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we moved away, he said: ""We can attend to them later."" Then we went up to Lucy's room. For a few brief seconds, we paused at the door and listened, but we couldn't hear any sound. With pale faces and trembling hands, we gently opened the door and entered the room.",52.466,52.268
693,"How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her mother’s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled. Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching poor Lucy’s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:—","I don't know how to describe the scene before my eyes. Both Lucy and her mother were lying on the bed. On the mother's body was a white sheet, the edge of which was blown back by the wind from the broken window, revealing a pale face, deeply etched with lines of terror. Lucy’s face looked even more miserable. The garland around her neck was now placed on Mrs. Westenra's chest. I could easily see that the two small wounds on her had now become much deeper and wider compared to a few days ago, and I didn't understand why. Without a word, Professor Van Helsing bent low over the bed, his head almost touching Lucy's chest; after listening for about a second, he suddenly stood up and told me:",18.626,18.066,"How can I describe what we saw?

We found the flowers that had previously been on her neck on her mother's chest, and her throat was bare, revealing the two small wounds we had noticed earlier, but it looked terrifyingly white and crushed.

The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure, but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands. He said to me:—","I rushed down to the dining room, grabbed a bottle of wine, brought it to my nose to smell, and then tasted it to ensure that no one had poured opium into the bottle. The servants were still lying down, breathing; their breaths now seemed lighter and more regular; perhaps the effects of the opium tincture were gradually wearing off. I hurried back to Lucy's room. Van Helsing grabbed the bottle of wine, poured some into his hand, and rubbed it vigorously on Lucy's lips, wrists, and forearms. After completing this emergency task, he softly said to me:",8.727,7.346,"I ran downstairs and returned with the brandy; I did not neglect to smell and taste it to understand whether it was drugged like the sherry decanter I found on the table.

Go downstairs and wake those girls up. Just use a wet towel to slap their faces, don't worry about being cruel! I need them awake to light a fire and boil some hot water.

She needs to be warmed up first, then we can do anything else.",8.647,6.667,"“I can do this, for now, this is the only thing we can do. You go and wake up those servants.

697,"I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message, and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.","I had no difficulty waking up the first three servants; but the fourth one lay there like a child, seemingly the most affected by the opium. I had to carry her to the couch so she could continue sleeping. The three girls who had just woken up were dazed like simpletons. However, when they suddenly remembered what had happened, they burst into tears and sobbingly recounted the events to me. But I remained resolute and stern, not allowing them to go on for long. I told them that one death in the house was enough, and that if they kept lamenting, Lucy might be next. Hearing this, they had no choice but to sob their way into the kitchen. Fortunately, the stove was still on, so the water in the pot was still hot. After preparing the bath, we placed Lucy in to soak. While we were focused on massaging her limbs, there was a sudden knock at the gate. A servant hurried out to open the door. A moment later, she ran back in to inform us that a man was waiting outside, saying he had a letter from Holmwood. Knowing we couldn't receive guests at that moment, I sent someone to ask him to kindly wait.

The fourth was a young girl, and it was clear that the drug had affected her more strongly, so I carried her to the couch and let her sleep.

I told them that losing one life was bad enough, and if they delayed, they would sacrifice Miss Lucy. Thus, sobbing and half-dressed, they set to work and prepared the fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and the boiler fire were still burning, and there was no shortage of hot water. We prepared the bath and carried Lucy as she was, placing her in the tub. While we were busy warming her arms and legs, the hall door was knocked. One of the servants ran, hurriedly put on some more clothes, and opened the door. She came back and whispered that a young gentleman had arrived with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I asked her to tell the man he had to wait, as we could not see anyone at the moment.

That night, the horse was too weak to stand up, and I had to put a bullet in its head to spare it a painful death. Jack, if it weren't for professional secrecy, please tell me. Was Arthur the first person to donate blood?

732,"When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy’s first movement was to feel in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing had given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room, and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her poor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that meant—that she had realised to the full her mother’s death; so we tried what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as if in thought, but he said nothing.","In the afternoon, when she woke up, to my astonishment, the first thing Lucy did was to slip her hand under her nightgown to take out the pieces of paper that Van Helsing had given me to read. The professor had carefully put them back in their original place, fearing that if she woke up and didn't see those pieces of paper, she would be frightened. Holding the pieces of paper in her hand, she looked at Van Helsing for a moment and then turned to look at me, appearing genuinely satisfied. Then she looked around the room like a child getting acquainted with a new world, but when she suddenly realized this wasn't her room, she burst into tears and covered her face with her hands, which were still pale as if she had drowned. It was only at this moment that she remembered the reality that she had lost her mother. We gathered around to comfort and console her. If we could ease her heart even a little, she would be less tormented by the pain. But Lucy continued to sob in front of us. It was only when I said that from now on, either Van Helsing and I would be together, or we would take turns being with her, that she felt a little more at ease. The night fell, she began to drift into sleep again. One more thing surprised me: while sleeping, she held the pieces of paper she had torn earlier and ripped them in half. Van Helsing tried to remove those pieces of paper, but she held on very tightly and even tore them into smaller pieces. Finally, she raised her hand and spread her fingers as if she wanted to throw the tiny pieces of paper high into the air. Van Helsing was very puzzled, but he didn't say anything.",11.309,10.906,"When she woke up late that afternoon, the first thing Lucy did was to feel her chest and, to my surprise, take out the paper that Van Helsing had given me to read from her chest.

Then, she looked around the room and shuddered when she realized where she was; she screamed loudly and covered her pale face with her poor, thin hands. We both understood what this meant - that she fully comprehended her mother's death; so we did our best to comfort her. Undoubtedly, the empathy comforted her a bit, but she was very weak mentally and spiritually; she cried silently and feebly for a long time. We told her that one or both of us would always stay with her; this seemed to comfort her a little. She fell into a light sleep towards twilight. During this time, a very strange thing happened. In her sleep, she took the paper out of her chest and tore it up. Van Helsing went to her and took the pieces of paper from her hand.

Thank God, his condition is improving every day, and I dare to hope that gradually he will fully recover. Now, allow me to ask a few questions about your situation. When do you plan to get married, and where? Who will officiate? What dress do you plan to wear? Will you invite many friends or just have a simple ceremony? Remember to answer, my dear friend, because you know well that I always think of you and care about what you are holding in your heart.

750,"“In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of everything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, there is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier’s cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours—the house to which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and saw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of Renfield’s room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to “shut up for a foul-mouthed beggar,” whereon our man accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice, so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: ‘Lor’ bless yer, sir, I wouldn’t mind what was said to me in a bloomin’ madhouse. I pity ye and the guv’nor for havin’ to live in the house with a wild beast like that.’ Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him where the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats and curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I could make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the window of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent on some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the face, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his heavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat on him, he began to shout: ‘I’ll frustrate them! They shan’t rob me! they shan’t murder me by inches! I’ll fight for my Lord and Master!’ and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set it all right; and he is going on well.","I would like to report that the condition of several patients under my care is nothing noteworthy. As for Renfield's case, I find there is much to be said. He had another episode, but this time it ended without any unfortunate consequences. By the way, I should also mention that this afternoon, a truck with two men appeared at the abandoned house near our hospital—the house where Renfield twice escaped and crossed over to, you remember? These two men stopped in front of the hospital to ask the gatekeeper for directions, as far as I know, they are not locals. At that time, I had just finished lunch and was standing outside my office smoking, so I noticed one of the men heading towards the hospital's outer corridor. When he passed by Renfield's window, the patient immediately sprang up and started cursing wildly. He cursed that the man was not only there to steal but also intended to kill him, and he swore that next time, he wouldn't let the man harm him. I opened the window and told the truck driver not to take it to heart. After glancing back at the front of the hospital building, the man realized where he was standing. Only then did he say to me: — May God bless you. Indeed, I still cannot fully imagine the scene of having to stand before a group of madmen. I truly sympathize with you and your master for having to live among such fierce individuals! Then the man politely asked me for directions to the abandoned house next door. I courteously gave him the directions. He left, but Renfield continued to madly spew out a torrent of curses and threats. When I went down to visit him, I kept wondering if this time I could find out the reason for his anger. When I went down to his room, I was very surprised because I didn't understand why he was so quiet and gentle. I tried to ask him what he had to say about what had happened, but he asked me back what I meant. I felt as if he truly didn't remember anything anymore. It was really unpleasant if that was just another example of his cunning mind, because less than half an hour later, he made me talk about him again. This time, he jumped out of the window and ran away at full speed. Afraid he might do something wrong, I had to call some guards and told them to catch him at all costs. And I wasn't wrong. A while later, I saw the truck turning back towards the hospital, now carrying large crates. The two guys on the truck were wiping sweat off their foreheads, their faces red as if they had just gone through a fierce struggle. Before I could catch the patient, he had already jumped onto the truck, grabbed one of the drivers by the neck, and pulled him to the ground, then he grabbed the victim's hair and repeatedly smashed his head against the road. If I hadn't run after him in time, he probably would have beaten the man to death. The other driver also hurriedly jumped to the ground, holding a rubber hose and whipping it continuously at the patient. These blows should have made him scream in pain, but no, he didn't seem to feel anything, because after that he calmly stood up and fought back against the man attacking him, then he attacked all three of us, pushing us around easily as if we were just a bunch of scrawny cats. You know that I'm just a skinny guy, but I can't say the same for the two truck drivers: they were as strong as bulls. At first, he didn't say a word, only when we tried to subdue him and when the guards put the straitjacket on him did he scream: ""I am ruining their plans! They can't steal from me, they can't kill me anymore! I must fight for God and for my master!” He kept spewing out crazy words that no one could understand. It was very difficult for us to get him back to the hospital and lock him in a room. As for the two truck drivers, at first, they kept threatening to take this assault to court; but later, I noticed mixed in with those threats were words of regret and remorse for letting a madman beat them up like that.",9.981,9.721,"In line with your requests, I am sending the report regarding the items left under my responsibility as an attachment. There are more things to be said about the patient, Renfield. He had another fit that could have had a terrible ending, but fortunately, it did not. This afternoon, a transport cart with two men on it arrived at the empty house adjacent to our property - you remember, the house the patient escaped to twice. Since the men were strangers to the area, they stopped at our door to ask the porter for directions. I was looking out the window of my study while smoking my cigarette after dinner and saw one of the men approaching the house. As he passed in front of Renfield's room window, the patient began to scold him from inside and shouted all kinds of obscenities at him. The man, who seemed quite gentlemanly, simply replied, ""Shut up, you foul-mouthed beggar,"" upon which our man accused him of robbing and killing him and said he would stop him even if he were to be hanged for it. I opened the window and signaled to the man not to mind, so he, after taking a look around and deciding what kind of place he had come to, simply said, ""God bless you, sir, I don't care what is said to me in a damn madhouse. I pity you and the director for having to live in this house with such a wild animal,"" and then politely asked for directions; I told him where the door of the empty house was; he walked away with our man's threats, curses, and swearing trailing behind him. Wondering if I could understand why he got so angry, I went downstairs, because he is usually very well-mannered and nothing like this had ever happened outside of his wild fits. To my great surprise, I found him quite calm and moderate in his demeanor. I tried to get him to talk about the incident, but he kept sweetly asking what I meant and made me think he was completely unaware of the matter. Regrettably, I must report that this was just another display of his devilishness, because half an hour later, I received another report about him. This time, he had climbed out of his room window and was running down the tree-lined path. I told the attendants to follow me and ran after the patient because I was afraid he might harm someone. My fear was justified when I saw the cart that had passed by earlier moving down the road with several large wooden crates on it. The men were wiping their foreheads as if they had been exercising vigorously, and their faces were flushed. Before I could reach him, the patient lunged at the men, pulled one of them off the cart, and started banging his head on the ground. If I hadn't caught him in time, I think he would have killed the man right there. The other man jumped down and hit the patient on the head with the blunt end of his whip. It was a terrible blow, but he didn't seem to care and fought with all three of us, pulling us back and forth as if we were kittens. You know, I am not light, and the other two were hefty men as well. At first, he was silent while fighting; but when we started to subdue him and the attendants put a straitjacket on him, he began to shout: ""I will stop them! They will not rob me! They will not slowly kill me! I will fight for my master!"" He said this and other such nonsensical things. With considerable difficulty, they took him back to the house and put him in the padded room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a broken finger. But I have sorted everything out, and he is now in good condition.",29.044,28.935,"""In compliance with your wishes, I am sending attached a report on the conditions of everything that has been left in my charge... Regarding the patient, there is something more to say. He had another escape attempt, which could have had a terrible end, but fortunately, as it happened, did not reach the tragic outcome that was expected. This afternoon, a carriage with two men arrived at the empty house whose grounds border ours, the house to which, you will recall, the patient escaped on two occasions. The men stopped at the gate to ask the porter for directions, as they were strangers. I myself was looking out the study window, smoking after dinner, and saw one of the men approach the house. As he passed by Renfield's room window, the patient began to taunt him from inside and call him every rotten name he could put on his tongue. The man, who seemed a decent type, merely told him to ""shut his rotten beggar's mouth,"" to which our inmate accused him of stealing from him and wanting to kill him, adding that he would thwart his plans even if they hanged him for it. I opened the window and signaled to the man not to take things seriously, so he contented himself with taking a look around the place, perhaps to get an idea of the kind of site he had ended up at. And then he said: 'God bless you, sir; I don't get upset by what they say to me in a madhouse like this. You and the director rather have my pity for having to live in a house with a wild beast like that. Then he asked for directions quite courteously, and I showed him where the gate of the empty house was; he walked away, followed by threats and insults from our man. I went down to see if I could discover the cause of his anger, as usually he is a proper man, and except for violent periods nothing like this ever happens to him. To my astonishment, I found him quite calm and behaving in the most cordial manner. I tried to get him to talk about the incident, but he gently asked me what I was talking about, leading me to believe he had completely forgotten the matter. It was, however, I regret to say, just another instance of his cunning, for half an hour later I had news of him again. This time he had escaped again from his room window and was running down the avenue. I called the attendants to follow me and ran after him, fearing he was attempting some trick. My fear was justified when I saw the same carriage that had passed by us earlier coming down the road, loaded with some wooden boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads and had flushed faces, as if they had just done some violent exercise. Before I could reach him, the patient ran towards them and, pulling one of them off the carriage, began to bash his head against the ground. If I hadn't restrained him at that moment, I believe he would have beaten the man to death right there. The other fellow jumped off the carriage and struck him with the handle of his heavy whip. It was a terrible blow, but he didn't seem to feel it; instead, he grabbed the man too and fought us three, tossing us around like kittens. You know very well that I am not light, and the other two men were burly. At first, he fought silently, but as we began to overpower him, and when the attendants were putting the straitjacket on him, he started to shout: 'I will stop it. You won't rob me! You won't murder me by inches! I will fight for my master and lord!’, and all that kind of incoherent nonsense. With considerable difficulty, they managed to bring him back to the house and we locked him in the secure room. One of the attendants, Hardy, has a bruised finger. However, he splinted it well, and it is improving.",37.954,37.864
751,"“The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of him. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so ‘bloomin’ good a bloke’ as your correspondent. I took their names and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are as follows:—Jack Smollet, of Dudding’s Rents, King George’s Road, Great Walworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley’s Row, Guide Court, Bethnal Green.

They both tried to explain that if they hadn't been humiliated into delivering the goods smoothly, they would have surely overpowered that madman! But they also gave another reason to justify their defeat: the burning thirst after loading the goods onto the truck had drained their strength, and there wasn't a single refreshment stand around here. I understood what they really wanted. So, after giving each of them two glasses of white wine mixed with lemon, sugar, and hot water, and slipping a gold coin into each of their hands, I didn't hear them mention anything about suing anymore. They even joked that one day they would be ready to fight another madman, even one much fiercer. I carefully noted down their names and addresses, because who knows, we might need them someday.

But their threats were intertwined with an indirect defense relating to both of them being defeated by a feeble madman.

As another reason for their defeat, they cited the unusual thirst they had fallen into due to the dusty nature of their profession and the deplorable distance of their work from any place of amusement. I understood their purpose very well; after one or more glasses of rum and a gold coin placed in each of their hands, they began to disregard the attack and swore they would encounter a worse madman to have the pleasure of meeting such a ""damn good fellow"" who writes these lines to you.

Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either father or mother, so that the dear old man’s death is a real blow to me. Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow, deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life, and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He begins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and my belief in him helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his—a nature which enabled him by our dear, good friend’s aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years—should be so injured that the very essence of its strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in the midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one, for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming up to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr. Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his father. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief mourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few minutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,","We are going through a great misfortune. Sir Hawkins just suddenly passed away, making us feel like we have lost a real father. I feel this very clearly because I have never known my biological parents. As for Jonathan, the departure of a generous man who always considered him as a biological son has left him with an unending sorrow. So now the responsibility for all the work begins to fall on him, making him feel increasingly stressed and even, at times, he has shown self-doubt. However, I have tried my best to encourage him, and the faith I have placed in him has made him more confident. After all, this is the result of a terrible shock of which he is the victim. I still remember that Jonathan used to be a courageous and determined man - it was this very quality that convinced Hawkins when he decided to entrust him with the role of an assistant. It's hard to imagine that now he is so devastated! My dear friend, if what I have just said worries you and affects your happiness, please forgive me! But I have to confide in someone at this moment, because the more courageous and steadfast I appear in front of Jonathan, the more silently enduring this anxiety alone makes me fall apart. I'm afraid that the day after tomorrow - the day we have to bring Hawkins back to London to be buried beside his ancestors according to his last wish, I will not be able to stand firm if I cannot confide in you. Jonathan will be the one leading the funeral because he no longer has parents either. But no matter what, I will try to visit you, dear Lucy. Once again, please don't blame me for this bad news! Wishing you a thousand times good luck?",3.208,2.497,"We experienced such a great disaster! Mr. Hawkins died suddenly. Some might think that this is not very sad for us, but we both loved him so much that it truly feels like we have lost our father. Since I never knew my mother or father, the death of this dear old man was a great shock to me. Jonathan is quite distressed. Not only does he feel great sorrow for this good man who had been his companion throughout his life and finally treated him like his own son, leaving him a fortune beyond our humble means, but Jonathan is also troubled by something else. He says that the amount of responsibility placed upon him with this situation makes him uneasy. He is starting to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and my faith in him helps him believe in himself. But this heavy shock he has experienced affects him the most in this matter. Oh, it is so hard that such a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature - a nature that, with the help of our dear, good friend, elevated him from a legal consultant to mastery within a few years - has been wounded in a way that destroys the essence of its strength. If I am troubling you with my worries in the midst of your own happiness, forgive me, dear; but dear Lucy, I must tell someone because trying to appear brave and cheerful in front of Jonathan is exhausting me, and there is no one here with whom I can share my secret. We have to go to London tomorrow, but I am hesitant about it; Mr. Hawkins stated in his will that he wanted to be buried in the same grave as his father.

And he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late—Lucy’s mother and Arthur’s father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.","• September 20 Tonight, I volunteered to stay alone, and as usual, I took out my journal to write.

765,"I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. “Come, my child,” he said; “come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms. Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we sleep.” Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy’s face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy’s neck, over the silk handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her, and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled round—doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim—and every now and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her.","At the appointed time, I watched over Lucy so that Van Helsing could rest for a while. Both the professor and I tried to persuade Arthur to take a break, but he stubbornly refused. However, when I explained to him that the next day we might very much need his help and that we shouldn't let ourselves get more tired just because of lack of sleep, he complied. Van Helsing also encouraged him: — Come down and rest, young friend? The pain and sorrow might have already exhausted you, don't let it get worse. You shouldn't stay alone, because loneliness might make you suffer even more. Come down to the living room with me, there's already a fireplace and two couches down there. The two of us will each take a couch instead of a bed. I'll pull my couch closer to yours, we need to be near each other to comfort one another during this time, even if we both fall asleep and don't say anything, that's fine too. Arthur painfully stood watching Lucy for a long time, then quietly followed Van Helsing down the stairs. Lucy remained motionless on the bed. Glancing around the room, I noticed the professor continued to use garlic flowers: he had rubbed garlic flowers on all the windows of the rooms, filling the place with the pungent smell of this unpleasant plant. He also quickly wove the garlic flowers into Lucy's handkerchief and wrapped it around her neck. Lucy had never shown such signs of pain. Occasionally, she would gasp with irregular breaths. She still slept with the same symptoms as before: mouth agape, gums purplish and receding, her teeth appearing longer and even sharper than in the morning, especially the canines, which seemed much longer and sharper than the others. As I sat down at the edge of the bed, she weakly stirred as if experiencing pain. That was also when something suddenly struck the windowpane hard. I cautiously approached the window, lifted a corner of the curtain, and looked outside. In the pale moonlight, I saw a large bat tirelessly flying back and forth as if mad, perhaps attracted by the faint light emanating from the bedroom. Occasionally, I saw it flap its wings and brush against the window glass. When I turned back to the bed, Lucy had slightly changed her lying position and had somehow pushed the garlic wreath off her neck without me noticing. I tried to arrange it back as it was.",6.162,5.456,"I took over the duty of keeping watch over Lucy from Van Helsing just in time. We also wanted Arthur to go and rest, but he initially refused. However, when I told him that we would need his help during the day and that we shouldn't be exhausted from lack of rest if Lucy's condition worsened, he agreed to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. ""Come, my child,"" he said; ""come with me. You are sick and weak, and in addition to the burden we know of, you have also experienced great sorrow and mental anguish. You should not be alone; for to be alone is to be filled with fear and dread. Come to the sitting room where there is a large fire burning and two couches. You lie on one, I on the other, and even if we do not talk or even sleep, our companionship will comfort each other."" Arthur, looking longingly at Lucy's face, which was almost whiter than the linen on her pillow, left the room with the Professor. Lucy was lying quite still, and I looked around the room to see that everything was as it should be. I could see that the Professor maintained his determination to use garlic in this room as well as in the other; all the window frames smelled of garlic, and around Lucy's neck, over the silk handkerchief that Van Helsing wanted her to wear, there was a rough garland made of the same scented flowers. Lucy's breathing was a bit raspy, and her face was in a terrible state because her pale gums were exposed through her open mouth. In the dim and uncertain light, her teeth seemed longer and sharper than they had in the morning. Especially, by some trick of the light, her canine teeth appeared longer and sharper than the others. I sat down beside her, and she immediately moved restlessly. At that very moment, monotonous wing sounds were heard at the window. I slowly went to the window and looked outside from the corner of the curtain. There was a full moon, and I could see that the noise was being made by a large bat, which, though very dim, was undoubtedly attracted by the light and occasionally struck the window with its wings. When I returned to my seat, I noticed that Lucy had slightly moved and had torn off the garlic flowers from her throat. I placed them back as best as I could and sat down to watch her.",37.76,37.618,"I promptly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to go rest as well, but at first, he refused. He only agreed when I told him that we would need him during the day to help us, and that we should not all exhaust ourselves at the same time because Lucy might suffer the consequences. Van Helsing was very kind to him. –Come, son -he said to him-; come with me. You are sick and weak and have had many sorrows and much pain, as well as a depletion of your strength that we know well. You should not be alone, for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms. Come to the living room, where there is a good fire and two sofas. You will lie on one and I on the other, and our company will give us some relief, even if we do not speak, and even if we sleep. Arthur went with him, casting a nostalgic glance at Lucy's face, which lay on her pillow almost whiter than the sheet. She lay quite still, and I looked around the room to see that everything was in order. I could see that the professor had carried out in this room, as in the other, his intention to use garlic; all the window sashes smelled strongly of it. And around Lucy's neck, over the silk scarf that Van Helsing had made her wear, was a rough necklace made of the same fragrant flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously and her face was contorted, for her open mouth revealed pale gums. In the dim and uncertain light, her teeth seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning. In particular, perhaps due to some play of light, the canines seemed longer and sharper than the rest. I sat by her side, and after a short time she moved restlessly. At that very moment, a kind of dull flapping or scratching came from the window. I went silently towards it and peered through a corner of the lattice. There was a full moon, and I could see that the noise was caused by a large bat fluttering about, undoubtedly attracted by the light, although it was so faint, and occasionally hitting the window with its wings. When I returned to my seat, I saw that Lucy had moved slightly and the garlic flowers had fallen from her neck. I placed them back in their spot as best as I could, and sat down, watching her.",45.761,45.646
766,"Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed. She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.","After lying for a while longer, she woke up. I tried to feed her a little as per Van Helsing's instructions, but she ate as if enduring a torture! Despite the fact that even her unconscious instinctive strength had now abandoned her, it seemed there was still something urging her to fight to the end against the illness and to conquer it at all costs. I was truly surprised to see that as soon as she woke up, she hurriedly clutched the garlic wreath. I found this very strange: every time she fell into a deep sleep, making her breathing very labored, she would push the wreath away. Conversely, every time she woke up or was about to wake up, I saw her clutch the wreath tightly to herself. There was one more thing I couldn't mistake: in the hours that followed, I saw her wake up and then fall back into a deep sleep many times, and this kept happening with the same actions from her.",5.425,4.198,"She woke up a little later and I gave her the meal prescribed by Van Helsing. She ate very little and was reluctant. There seemed to be no sign of the struggle for life and strength that had been indicative of her illness until now. It struck me as odd that as soon as she regained consciousness, she pressed the garlic flowers to her chest. It was certainly strange that whenever she fell into that state of sleep with labored breathing, she pushed the flowers away, but when she woke up, she clung to them tightly. There was no possibility of making a mistake in this matter, because she went through many periods of sleep and wakefulness over the long hours that followed, and she repeated these two actions many times.",28.841,28.22,"Shortly after, she woke up, and I gave her food just as van Helsing had prescribed. She only took a little, and reluctantly. It seemed that her former unconscious struggle for life, and the strength that had marked her illness until then, were no longer with her. I was surprised by the curious fact that at the moment she became conscious, she pressed the garlic flowers against her chest. It was certainly very strange that whenever she entered that lethargic state, with stertorous breathing, she tried to remove the flowers, but upon waking, she held onto them. There was no possibility of making a mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many periods of sleep and wakefulness, and repeated both actions many times.",43.163,42.745
767,"At six o’clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy’s face I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a sharp whisper: “Draw up the blind; I want light!” Then he bent down, and, with his face almost touching Lucy’s, examined her carefully. He removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, “Mein Gott!” as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too, and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.","At six o'clock in the evening, Van Helsing came to take over my shift. Arthur had fallen asleep, so he didn't have the heart to wake him up. He looked at Lucy and couldn't help but sigh. After a while, he turned to me and said, in a very soft yet very clear voice: — Pull up the curtain for me! I want some light! He bent down to remove the garlic wreath from Lucy's neck to check on the patient's condition.",6.351,5.011,"At six o'clock, Van Helsing came to take over the watch from me. During this time, Arthur had fallen asleep, and the Professor, out of compassion, had allowed him to continue sleeping. When he saw Lucy's face, I could hear the hiss in his breathing, and he said harshly in a whisper: ""Open the curtain; I want light!"" Then he leaned in and examined her carefully, his face almost touching Lucy's. He removed the flowers and the silk handkerchief from her neck. As he did so, he flinched, and I heard him say, as if choking, ""Mein Gott!"" I also leaned in and felt a strange shiver when I saw what had startled Van Helsing.",25.31,24.633,"At six in the morning, Van Helsing arrived to relieve me. Arthur had fallen into a stupor, and kindly he allowed him to continue sleeping. When he saw Lucy's face, I could hear the hissing intake of his breath, and he said to me in a sharp whisper: –Raise the lattice; I want light! Then he leaned over and, with his face almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully. He removed the flowers and then took off the silk handkerchief from her throat. As he did so, he stepped back, and I could hear his exclamation: ""Mein Gott!…"" which got stuck in his throat.

He covered his face with his hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained, perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. “Come,” I said, “my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best and easiest for her.”","I was shocked and ran down to call Arthur. It took him a while to regain his composure after a deep sleep. At first, I had to lie to him that Lucy was still sleeping, but gradually I had to confess that both Professor Van Helsing and I were very afraid of a tragic end approaching. Arthur felt as if the sky was about to collapse; he knelt down on the chair, his hands covering his face, his shoulders shaking violently with sobs. He remained kneeling like that, praying for many minutes. I had to take his hand and pull him up. — Come on, my friend, - I said - be brave, you must be brave for her.",10.407,9.324,"I went to the dining room and woke Arthur up.

For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no will—and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case—have been treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming, though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.”","— To be honest, we tried to prevent our client from including such terms in her will. We warned Mrs. Westenra that unforeseen events could leave her daughter penniless or hinder her decision-making on her wedding day. Things between us and the client got so bad that she angrily asked if we intended to respect her final wishes or not. Clearly, we had no choice but to silently accept. But in principle, we were ninety-nine percent right, because logically, we could prove the validity of our advice. However, I must admit that in this particular case, no other form of will could have fulfilled her wishes. Because logically, she would pass away before her daughter, and the daughter would inherit all the wealth and property. Yet the daughter only outlived her mother by a short time and left no will, as confirmed by the examination, so this can be considered a case of intestacy. Thus, Lord Godalming, although a very close friend and also the fiancé of the young lady, would have absolutely no claim. Perhaps the heirs, even those far away, would not yield to a stranger for sentimental reasons. They are the rightful returnees. Trust me, gentlemen, this is an argument that truly satisfies me.",10.816,10.156,"“Frankly, we did everything we could to avoid such an arrangement regarding the will and pointed out certain possibilities where his daughter would be left penniless or would not be very free if she acted according to a marital bond. Seriously, we went so far on the matter that we were almost about to disagree, because he asked if we were ready to fulfill his wishes. Of course, at that moment we had no choice but to accept. In principle, we were right and with the logic of events, we could prove the correctness of our thoughts ninety-nine percent. But frankly, in this case, any other attitude would make it impossible to fulfill his wishes. Because if he died before his daughter, she would be the owner of the estate, and if she lived even five minutes longer than her mother, in the absence of a will - which would be impossible in such a case - it would be considered as if no will had been left. In such a case, Lord Godalming, despite being a very good friend, would have no rights; the heirs, being distant relatives, would not renounce their rights for emotional reasons related to a complete stranger. I assure you, gentlemen, this result pleases me, pleases me greatly.”",15.272,14.748,"–Frankly, we did everything possible to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and we pointed out certain contingencies that could leave your daughter either without a cent, or not as free as she should be to act considering a matrimonial alliance. In fact, we pressed the matter so much that we almost came to a clash, as she asked us whether we were or were not prepared to fulfill her wishes. Of course, we had no alternative but to accept. In principle, we were right, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we could have proven, by the logic of events, the soundness of our judgment. However, frankly, I must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have resulted in the impossibility of carrying out her wishes. For her daughter would have come into possession of the property and, even if she had only survived her mother by five minutes, her property, in the event that there was no will, and a will was practically impossible in such a case, would have been treated upon her death as ab intestato. In which case, Lord Godalming, although he was a close friend of theirs, would not have any right. And the heirs, being distant relatives, would not so easily abandon their rightful claims for sentimental reasons related to a complete stranger. I assure you, my esteemed gentlemen, that I am happy with the outcome; very happy.",44.907,44.685

The funeral home staff seemed more enthusiastic than usual today. The sorrowful atmosphere in the small room plunged us into an unbearable feeling of numbness. Van Helsing requested the funeral home staff to restore everything in the room to its previous state. He said that Lord Godalming was about to arrive, and seeing only his fiancée here would make it less painful for him.

I felt it very improper, for you can’t go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he was my husband, and we didn’t know anybody who saw us—and we didn’t care if they did—so on we walked.

There were very few people in the park, and all the benches were completely empty. The melancholy scene here made me unconsciously think of the empty chair we would see again when we returned home.

I suddenly noticed a very beautiful young girl, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, sitting in a Victoria-style carriage parked in front of Guillano's house.

879,"22 September.—It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has taken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy’s death as any of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his journey. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can only be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says he has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his iron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy’s veins; I could see Van Helsing’s face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very terrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried, till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time. His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and forceful and mysterious. He said:—","• September 22 Everything is done. Arthur returned to Ring with Quincey Morris. Quincey is indeed a very likable young man. He was as grieved by Lucy's death as any of us, yet he knew how to maintain a calm demeanor with the courage of a Norse pirate. If America continues to produce men like him, it will soon become a world power. As for Van Helsing, he took a bit of rest before heading back home. He had to return to Amsterdam to handle some personal matters. However, he planned to go to London tomorrow evening and stay there if possible to deal with a rather time-consuming matter. To be honest, I still worry that his enduring stamina may not last as long as it used to. At the funeral, I noticed he showed some slightly unusual signs. When the work was done, we gathered around Arthur as he emotionally spoke about the blood he had given to Lucy. I saw Van Helsing's face turn from pale to crimson. Arthur said that since he gave his blood to Lucy, he felt she had truly become his wife in the eyes of God. Of course, we were not foolish enough to mention the other blood transfusions that Arthur did not know about, and we would certainly never reveal that. Arthur and Quincey led each other to the station, while Van Helsing and I returned here. We had just gotten into the carriage when the professor suddenly had a seizure, I mean his nerves were extremely agitated. But later, he firmly denied this agitation. He explained that it was merely a humorous feeling after all the terrible events that had occurred. He laughed, laughed until he cried, laughed so hard that I had to lower all the curtains around the carriage so that outsiders wouldn't see him in such an abnormal state, and then he cried, truly cried, like a child. After that, I had to witness him laugh again, laughing hysterically. Finally, he was both laughing and crying, crying bitterly like a woman, or rather like a madman. I tried my best to comfort and soothe him, even sternly told him to stay calm, but all my efforts were in vain. So I let him be mad, until he got tired of it. In similar situations, women often react differently than men. Finally, when his face returned to its usual serious and important look, I dared to ask what had made him laugh in such a sad moment. He answered quite logically, but also as incomprehensibly as he himself is. — Ah!",9.111,8.735,"September 22 - Everything is over. Arthur returned to the Ring and took Quincey Morris with him. Quincey is such a good man! I truly believe that he suffered as much as we did because of Lucy's death; but he behaved like a virtuous Viking during that time. If America continues to raise such men, it will indeed be a significant power in the world. Van Helsing is lying down to rest before his journey. He is going to Amsterdam tonight, but he says he will return tomorrow night, and that he only wants to make some arrangements that he needs to handle personally. Then, if he can manage, he will stay with me; he says he has some business in London that might take up some of his time. Poor old man! I fear the tension of the past week has worn down his iron strength. Throughout the entire funeral, I could see that he was holding himself terribly tight. When everything was over, we were standing next to poor Arthur, who was talking about his role in the transfusion of his own blood into Lucy's veins; I could see Van Helsing's face turning alternately white and purple. Arthur has been saying since then that he feels as if they were truly married, as if Lucy were his wife in the eyes of God. Neither of us spoke a word about the other procedures, and we never will. Arthur and Quincey went to the station together, and Van Helsing and I came here. As soon as we were alone in the carriage, Van Helsing had a hysterical fit. Since then, he has been denying that it was hysteria and says it was just his sense of humor showing itself under terrible circumstances. He laughed until he started crying, and I had to lower the blinds so no one would see us and misunderstand; then he cried until he laughed again; then he both laughed and cried at the same time like a woman. I tried to be stern with him, just as one would be with women in such a situation; but it had no effect. The ways in which women and men express their nervous strengths and weaknesses are so different! Then, when his face took on a serious and stern expression, I asked him why he had been cheerful and why he had been cheerful at such a time. His answer was unique, because it was logical, impressive, and mysterious. He said:",29.339,29.152,"September 22. Everything has culminated. Arthur has returned to Ring and has taken Quincey Morris with him. What a magnificent fellow this Quincey is! I believe deep in my heart that he suffered as much as any of us did over Lucy's death; but he managed to overcome his grief like a stoic. If America can continue producing men like this, there is no doubt that it will become a great power in the world. Van Helsing is lying down, taking a preparatory rest for his journey. He is going to leave for Amsterdam tonight, but he says he will return tomorrow night; he just wants to make some arrangements that can only be done in person. When he returns, if he can, he will stay at my house; he says he has work to do in London that may take some time. Poor old friend! I fear that the effort of the past few weeks has broken even his iron strength. During the entire time of the funeral, I could see that he was making a terrible effort to restrain himself. When everything was over, we were standing next to Arthur, who, poor thing, was talking about his part in the operation when his blood was transferred to Lucy's veins; I could see that van Helsing's face was turning alternately white and purple. Arthur was saying that since then he felt as if the two had really been married and that she was his wife in the eyes of God. None of us said a word about the other operations, and none of us ever will. Arthur and Quincey went together to the station, and van Helsing and I came back here. The moment we were alone in the carriage, he gave free rein to a regular fit of hysteria. Since then he has refused to admit that it was hysteria, and insists that it was only his sense of humor manifesting under very terrible conditions. He laughed until he cried and I had to lower the blinds so that no one could see us and misinterpret the situation; and then he cried until he laughed again; and he laughed and cried at the same time, just like a woman does. I tried to be stern with him, in the same way one is with a woman in similar circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in their nervous strength or weakness! Then, when his face became grave and serious again, I asked him the reason for his joy and why precisely at that moment. His reply was in some way characteristic of him, as it was logical, full of strength and mystery. He said:",43.337,43.211
880,"“Ah, you don’t comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad, though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and say, ‘May I come in?’ is not the true laughter. No! he is a king, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no time of suitability. He say, ‘I am here.’ Behold, in example I grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other sufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very grave—laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say ‘Thud! thud!’ to my heart, till it send back the blood from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy—that dear boy, so of the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his hair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet when he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my father-heart yearn to him as to no other man—not even to you, friend John, for we are more level in experiences than father and son—yet even at such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear, ‘Here I am! here I am!’ till the blood come dance back and bring some of the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and tears that burn as they fall—all dance together to the music that he make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and, like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the sunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with our labour, what it may be.”","My friend John, you still don't understand me! Don't think that just because I laugh, I'm not sad. I have cried even when I was forced to laugh out loud! But don't believe that I only express sadness when I cry. Never forget the laughter that comes knocking at your door and asks: ""May I come in?"" That is not genuine laughter. Never! That laughter is a king, it comes to your house when it sees your house is happy in its own way! It doesn't need anyone's permission, only joy matters to it. For example, day and night I am tormented by that gentle young girl, even though I am old and tired, I still intend to donate blood to save her. I still devote my time, knowledge, and even my sleep to her. I have neglected my other patients to give everything to her. That's it! Yet in just a moment, I burst out laughing right in front of her grave, laughing continuously, making my face flush red. That's not all. My heart also tightened when I thought of that poor young man - a young man about the age of my son if I had been fortunate enough to keep him; how their eyes, noses, and hair are so similar, I don't know! Now you understand why I cherish that young man so much, don't you? Even so, when he talked to us about the marital love he never once enjoyed, he moved me and left a strange attraction in my paternal heart that I had never experienced with my students. Of course, the same goes for you, my friend John, because everything we have done and lived through together has only brought us a more equal relationship rather than a father-son bond. I repeat, even so, the King of Laughter still comes and shouts in my ear: ""Here I am, I have arrived!"", so loudly that I feel a surge of blood rushing through me, making my face flush red like the sun. That's it, my friend, our world is truly strange! A world of boredom, hardship, misfortune, and always full of worries. However, when the King of Laughter arrives, everyone starts dancing together in the atmosphere that he always finds satisfying! Bleeding hearts, skeletons lying in the cemetery, burning tears on cheeks, all suddenly join in dancing together to the music emanating from the mouth of the King of Laughter. Believe me, my friend, we will have to be grateful to him! Because we, men and women alike, can be compared to strings stretched at both ends, and then there are tears falling, like raindrops on each key, suddenly making us tense up until, at some point, the tension becomes truly unbearable, and we snap. Right at that boundary, the King of Laughter suddenly appears like a ray of sunshine, loosening the string, and we can continue our work regardless of our current state.",8.952,8.6,"‘Ah, you don't understand, my friend John. Even if I laugh, don't think that I'm not sad. Look, I cried even while choking with laughter. Always remember that the laughter knocking on your door and asking, ‘May I come in?’ is not real laughter. No! It is a king and comes whenever and however it wants. It doesn't ask anyone, it doesn't wait for the right time. ‘I have arrived,’ it says. Look, for example, my heart bleeds for that very sweet young girl; despite being old and exhausted, I give my blood for her; I give my time, my talent, my sleep; just so she can have it all, I allow my other patients to be deprived of it. But still, I can laugh right at her grave - while the soil falls on her coffin from the sexton's shovel until the blood drains from my cheeks and it calls out to my heart, ‘Pat! Pat!’ I can laugh. My heart bleeds for that poor child - for the beloved child who would be the same age as my own son if he had lived and whose hair and eyes would be just like his. Now you know why I love her so much. But when it strikes my husbandly heart at its core and causes my fatherly heart to be more emotional than for anyone else - not even for you, my friend John, because our experiences are more equal than those of father and son - even at such times, King Laughter comes to me, dancing with blood, bringing some of the daylight he carries to my cheek, shouting in my ear, ‘Here I am! Here I am! ’Ah, my friend John, this world is a strange, sorrowful world, full of unhappiness, pain, and trouble, and when King Laughter comes, he makes everything dance to the tune they play. Bleeding hearts, dry bones in the churchyard, and tears burning as they fall - they all dance to the music made by his unsmiling mouth. And believe me, my friend John, it's a good thing he comes. Ah, we men and women are like taut strings pulling us in different directions. The last tears come; like raindrops on the strings, perhaps they strengthen us until the tension is too much and we snap. But King Laughter comes like daylight, easing the tension again, and whatever the task is, we endure to continue our work.”",20.279,20.081,"–Ah, you do not understand, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad, even though I laugh. Look, I have cried even when laughter choked me. But do not think that I am entirely sad when I cry, for laughter would have come in the same way. Always remember that the laughter that knocks on your door and says, ""may I come in?"" is not true laughter. No! Laughter is a queen, and it arrives when and how it wants. It does not ask anyone; it does not choose time or appropriateness. It says: ""here I am."" Remember, for example, I hurt in my heart for that young sweet girl; I give my blood for her, even though I am old and worn out; I gave my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my others suffer need so that she could have everything. And yet, I can laugh at her own grave, laugh when the gravedigger's shovel earth fell on her coffin and said thud!, thud!, over my heart, until it drained the blood from my cheeks. My heart bled for that poor boy, that dear boy, so much the age my own boy would have been if he had blessedly lived, and with hair and eyes so alike. Well, now you know why I love him so much. And yet, when he says things that move my man's heart so deeply, and make my father's heart nostalgic for him like no other man, not even you, friend John, because we are more balanced in experiences than a father and a son, for even then, in those moments, the queen laughter comes to me and shouts and roars in my ear: ""here I am, here I am!"", until laughter comes dancing again and brings with it some of the sunshine that she brings to my cheeks. Oh, friend John, it is a strange world, a world full of miseries, and threats, and troubles, and yet, when the queen laughter comes, it makes us all dance to the tune she plays. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones in cemeteries, and tears that burn as they fall... all dance together to the same music that she plays with that laughterless mouth she possesses. And believe me, friend John, she is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like strings in the midst of different forces pulling us in different directions. Then come the tears; and like rain on the strings, they tighten us, until perhaps the tension becomes too great and we break. But the queen laughter, she comes like the sunshine, and relieves the tension again; and we can endure and continue with our work, whatever it may be.",35.105,34.972

896,"The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what was known to the writers of headlines as “The Kensington Horror,” or “The Stabbing Woman,” or “The Woman in Black.” During the past two or three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all these cases the children were too young to give any properly intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses is that they had been with a “bloofer lady.” It has always been late in the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the children have not been found until early in the following morning. It is generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed gave as his reason for being away that a “bloofer lady” had asked him to come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the “bloofer lady” is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general principles of human nature that the “bloofer lady” should be the popular rôle at these al fresco performances. Our correspondent naïvely says that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of these grubby-faced little children pretend—and even imagine themselves—to be.","The surrounding areas of Hampstead are experiencing many events reminiscent of the incidents we once discussed in articles titled: The Horror in Kensington, or The Stabbed Woman, or The Woman in Black. Indeed, for the past two or three days, there has been much gossip about children disappearing from home, or more precisely, not being seen returning home after playing in the fields. Granted, the children are too young to provide convincing explanations for their absences, but every time they return, they say they followed a ""blood-stained woman."" And every time, as soon as it gets dark, they are nowhere to be seen. Two of the missing children were only found at dawn the next day. When the first missing child returned home, they recounted that the ""blood-stained woman"" had lured them to go for a walk with her. Other cases also reported a similar story. We all know that children these days do not like to imitate each other, so the idea that they all lied and snuck out overnight is impossible. One of our correspondents reported that he saw some boys mimicking the mannerisms and gestures of the ""blood-stained woman"" in a very amusing way. If they wish, our cartoonists could learn a lot by watching these boys' imitations!",6.176,5.641,"The Hampstead area is currently experiencing exciting days due to a series of developments similar to the events known as the ""Kensington Horror"" or the ""Stabbing Woman"" or the ""Woman in Black"" in the headlines. In the last two or three days, there have been numerous incidents involving small children who have wandered away from home or gone to play on the Heath and not returned. In all these cases, the children were too young to properly express themselves, but the common point in their supposed explanations was that they were with a ""beautiful"" lady. They all disappeared late at night, and in two cases, the children were not found until the early hours of the next day. There was a widespread belief that the first of the missing children used the excuse that ""the beautiful lady said she wanted to take a walk with him,"" and the others followed this example as an excuse. These days, it is very understandable since the favorite thing of the little ones is to distract each other with small games. One of the reporters writes that it is extremely funny to see the little children playing ""beautiful lady."" He adds that some of our cartoonists could take lessons from these children on the fine satire of the grotesque that emerges when reality is compared to representation. The fact that the ""beautiful lady"" is the favorite role in these alfresco games is in harmony with the general principles of human nature. Our reporter naively states that even Ellen Terry could not have the charming appeal of some of these dirty-faced little children who are acting - and even believe themselves to be - the ""beautiful lady.""",14.867,14.439,"The neighborhood of Hampstead is currently being harassed by a series of events that seem to run parallel to those known by headline writers as ""The Horror of Kensington,"" or ""The Dagger Killer,"" or ""The Woman in Black.""

897,"There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been instructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog which may be about.","However, the matter does not seem to be without serious issues, as two of the children, that is, the children who ran away overnight, had small bites on their necks. It appears that these were bites from a large rat or a small dog. Although nothing serious has occurred yet, the wounds all indicate one thing: whether it is a rat or a dog, the animal always bites people in the same consistent manner.

918,"25 September.—I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect that it will throw some light upon Jonathan’s sad experience; and as he attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about her. That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may understand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs. Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too, Dr. Van Helsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety of late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.","• September 25 I really can't sit still while waiting for Dr. Van Helsing. I don't know why I'm so anxious, but I understand one thing very clearly: he might shed some light on the sorrowful truth that Jonathan had to endure. Moreover, as the doctor who has been directly caring for Lucy over the past few days, he will surely tell me what he has perceived about her illness. Oh! I am truly a fool! Perhaps Van Helsing is coming here just to tell me about Lucy and her sleepwalking, not to talk about Jonathan. So I can only resign myself to never knowing the full truth about his journey. His diary haunts me so much that I have imagined all sorts of things, and I even foolishly hoped for Van Helsing's help! Clearly, he is here to talk to me about Lucy! Surely, she has had new episodes of sleepwalking recently. And perhaps the sleepwalking to the cold cliff in the dead of night—a truly terrifying memory for me!—has made her seriously ill. Indeed, over the past few days, being so busy with my own affairs, I completely forgot that she always has troubles that we cannot help but worry about! Surely Lucy has told Van Helsing about how she sleepwalked to that precarious cliff and how I frantically ran to find her. Perhaps Van Helsing intends to come here to ask for additional details to supplement his medical records. I hope I did the right thing by not telling Mrs. Westenra about her daughter's terrifying night. I would never forgive myself if Lucy's health deteriorated because of that. I also hope Dr. Van Helsing does not resent me for what I have done. Anyway, over the past time, I have had so many troubles that sometimes I felt I couldn't bear it, but in the end, I still had to overcome it!",8.473,7.993,"September 25 - As Dr. Van Helsing's visit approaches, I can't help but feel an overwhelming excitement because somehow, I hope this visit will shed light on Jonathan's distressing experience; since he took care of Lucy during her last illness, he can tell me everything about her. The reason for his visit is this; it is not about Jonathan, but about Lucy and her sleepwalking. Then, I can never learn the truth now! How foolish I am! That dreadful journal has captured my imagination and is slowly coloring everything in its own hue. Of course, this visit is about Lucy. Poor thing, she had reverted to her old habit and that dreadful night on the hill must have made her sick. She must have told Dr. Van Helsing about the sleepwalking adventure on the hill and that I knew about it; and now the Doctor wants me to tell him about it so he can understand the situation. I hope I did the right thing by not mentioning this to Mrs. Westenra; if any of my actions, or even inactions, have harmed poor dear Lucy, I will never forgive myself. I also hope Dr. Van Helsing will not blame me; I have been subjected to such distress and anxiety lately that I feel I can no longer bear any more.",25.896,25.559,"September 25. I can't help feeling terribly anxious as the time for Dr. Van Helsing's visit approaches, for I hope he will enlighten me about Jonathan's sad experience; and since he attended poor Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me many things about her. That is the reason he is coming; it is because of Lucy and her sleepwalking, and not about Jonathan. Then I will never know the true reality! How foolish I am! That horrible diary takes over my imagination and colors everything with something of its own hue. Of course it is something about Lucy. The illness returned to the poor girl, and the terrible night on the cliff must have made her sick. Due to all the matters I have at hand, I had almost forgotten how ill she had been afterward. She must have told him about her sleepwalking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about it; and now he wants me to tell him what I know, so that he can understand it. I hope I have done the right thing by not telling Mrs. Westenra anything; I could never forgive myself if any of my actions, even if by accident, had caused harm to my poor Lucy.

919,"I suppose a cry does us all good at times—clears the air as other rain does. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I do hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will occur to upset him. It is two o’clock, and the doctor will be here soon now. I shall say nothing of Jonathan’s journal unless he asks me. I am so glad I have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case he asks about Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.","Surely, Lucy has cried a lot. I hope that her tears have somewhat alleviated her sorrow and pain in these last days... This morning, Jonathan had to temporarily leave me, he will only return tomorrow morning. Since we got married, this is the first time we have been apart for so long. I hope he takes care of his health and pray that he does not encounter any trouble. The clock just struck two, Dr. Van Helsing should be arriving soon. If he hadn't suggested it, I wouldn't have told him about Jonathan's diary. As for myself, I can easily make a copy of my own diary for him. I will let him read it if he wants to know more details about Lucy, that will save me from having to give long and complicated explanations about her.",8.866,7.87,"I think crying from time to time does us a lot of good - it clears the air like rain. Perhaps what upset me was reading the journal yesterday and Jonathan not being by my side for the first time since the beginning of our marriage, for an entire day and night. I hope my dear husband takes care of himself and that nothing happens to upset him. It is now two o'clock, the doctor will be here soon. Unless he asks me something about it, I will not tell him anything about Jonathan's journal. I am very glad that I am typing my own journal, so that if he asks about Lucy, I can give him the journal; this will save us from many questions.",27.546,26.889,"I suppose that crying every now and then does us all some good... Tears cleanse the environment, just like rain. Perhaps it was reading yesterday's journal that unsettled me, and then Jonathan left this morning not to return for an entire day and night, this being the first time we've been apart since our marriage. I truly hope my beloved husband can take care of himself, and that nothing happens to distress him. It's two in the afternoon, and the doctor should be arriving soon.

920,"Later.—He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it all makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be all possible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan’s journal first, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be even a consolation and a help to him—terrible though it be and awful in its consequences—to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did not deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter which—waking or dreaming—may prove the truth, he will be more satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur’s friend and Dr. Seward’s, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he is good and kind and of a noble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan; and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan’s friend on “The Exeter News” told him that memory was everything in such work—that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare interview; I shall try to record it verbatim.","• A moment later He came and then left again. It was indeed a touching and interesting conversation! My mind is still spinning and reeling! I feel like I just went through a trance. Could it possibly be true, even if only in part! If I hadn't read Jonathan's diary, I certainly wouldn't have believed a single word of this bizarre story! Poor, poor Jonathan! Now I understand that behind those tormented emotions, he has endured so much. God wants me not to cause him any more excruciating pain after what I have just learned. I need to restrain myself to keep secret what Van Helsing just told me. As a physician, Dr. Van Helsing must be a very kind person, for he is a friend of Arthur and Dr. Seward, and it was they who invited him from Holland to take care of Lucy. Moreover, only by meeting him did I understand his generous heart. Tomorrow, when he returns, perhaps I should tell him about Jonathan's condition and what has happened to him. May God bless us so that we can live peaceful days again. I always thought that journalism would bring me joy. A friend of Jonathan's who works for the Exeter News once told me that in journalism, the important thing is to have a good memory, that is, to be able to accurately recall every word spoken by the interviewee before editing the content of the issue. Surely the content of my conversation with Dr. Van Helsing is not ordinary, but I will try to piece together every detail of the story:",8.311,7.776,"Later. - Dr. Van Helsing came and went. Oh, what a strange meeting it was and how it made my head spin! I feel like I'm dreaming. Can all this, even a part of it, be possible? If I hadn't read Jonathan's journal first, I wouldn't accept even the slightest possibility. Poor, poor dear Jonathan! How much he must have suffered! Please, dear God, don't let all this unsettle him again. I will try to protect him from it; but knowing for certain that his eyes, ears, and mind did not deceive him, that it was all real - even though it is terrible and has bad consequences, it might be a comfort to him and help him. Perhaps what troubles him is doubt; maybe when this doubt is removed, when it is proven that all this is real, he will be more content and better able to endure this shock. If he is a friend of Arthur and Dr. Seward and they brought him from Holland to take care of Lucy, Dr. Van Helsing must be as wise as he is good. After seeing him, I feel that he is a good, kind, and noble person. When tomorrow comes, I will ask him about Jonathan; and then, please God, let all this sorrow and worry come to a good end. I always thought I would want to do interviews; Jonathan's friend at the Exeter News told him that in such a job memory is everything - that is, you need to be able to put every word spoken on paper exactly as it was said, even if you need to correct some parts later. This was a rare interview; I will try to put it on paper word for word.",29.662,29.401,"Later. He came, and now he's gone. Oh, what a strange encounter, and how it makes everything spin in my head! I feel as if I were in a dream. Can it all be possible, or even part of it? If I hadn't read Jonathan's diary first, I would never have accepted even a possibility... Poor, poor dear Jonathan! How he must have suffered! May God grant that all this does not unsettle him again. I will try to save him from it, but it may even be a comfort or help to him, though it is very terrible and horrifying in its consequences, to know for certain that his eyes, his ears, and his brain did not deceive him, and that it is all real. It may be that it is doubt that unsettles him; that when the doubt ends, regardless of the truth, whether awake or dreaming, he will be more satisfied and more capable of bearing the impression. Dr. Van Helsing must be a good and intelligent man, if he is a friend of Arthur and Dr. Seward, and if they brought him from Holland just to take care of Lucy. I have the impression, after having seen him, that he is good, kind, and noble. When he returns tomorrow, I will ask him about Jonathan; and then, I hope that all this sadness and anxiety will lead us to a happy conclusion. I used to think that I liked interviews; Jonathan's friend at the Exeter News told him that memory was everything in a job like that; that one must be able to write down almost every word that is said, even if it has to be refined later.

922,"I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight, strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face, clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart; such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it, but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man’s moods. He said to me:—","I bowed my head to greet the esteemed guest. He was a medium-built man, quite robust.

The Doctor approached me; a medium-height, broad, strong-built man with shoulders set on a deep chest and a neck well-balanced on his body, just like the head balanced on his neck.

His clean-shaven face revealed a bony chin, a large, determined mouth, a straight but sharp, sensitive nose of good proportions with wide nostrils that seemed to widen when his mouth tensed, and thick, bushy eyebrows. His forehead was broad and beautiful, rising almost straight up at first and then sloping back over two distinct protrusions and elevations; a forehead that his reddish hair could never quite cover, naturally falling back and to the sides.

988,"26 September.—Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week since I said “Finis,” and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to think of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as he ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he had just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any trouble to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is with him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows, too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o’clock, and thrust last night’s “Westminster Gazette” into my hand.","• September 26 After all, nothing ever really ends. Since the day I wrote the word ""end"" in my diary, it hasn't even been a week, yet I have had to pick up the pen again to continue recording my concerns, and the unfortunate thing is that I still cannot avoid the matters that I thought should have ended. Indeed, until this afternoon, I had no reason to think about anything from the past. Patient Renfield has become more docile than ever. For the past few weeks, he has only been taking care of his swarm of flies. And now, he seems to be mesmerized by the spiders, so I am no longer disturbed by him. I just received Arthur's letter written on Sunday. According to what he said in the letter, I understand he is gradually getting better. Quincey Morris is with him to help him return to normal life after the recent severe blows. Morris has always been an energetic and enthusiastic young man. He also just sent a letter informing me that Arthur has somewhat regained the joy of life. That puts my mind at ease. As for myself, I also tried to get to work with my usual enthusiasm.

Renfield, from any perspective, is more sane than ever.

I received a letter from Arthur written on Sunday, and from this letter, I understand that he is coping perfectly with what he has been through. Quincey Morris is with him, which is a great help, as he is a great source of morale. Quincey also wrote a line, and from him, I learned that Arthur is starting to regain his old vitality; thus, I was relieved about this matter. As for me, I was sitting down to my work with the enthusiasm I once had; thus, I could honestly say that the wound left by poor Lucy was beginning to heal.

Then how should I explain it? Please don't forget that I am also an expert in mental illnesses! Regarding your acceptance of the theory of somnambulism, yet completely denying telepathy! My friend, let me tell you: in this day and age, people are well aware that electricity is generated from the very materials for which the inventors of the past paid with their lives. Back then, their inventions were considered fraudulent witchcraft, a blasphemous act, and thus they were burned at the stake. Life is always full of mysteries. Why did Methuselah live for nine hundred years, while our poor little Lucy, despite receiving blood transfusions from four people, couldn't live for another day? Because if she had lived just one more day, perhaps we could have saved her! Do you thoroughly understand the mystery of life and death? Do you also have a comprehensive knowledge of comparative anatomy? Now, tell me, why are some men violent while others are not? Are you sure you can explain the phenomenon that while other spiders die young, the giant spider that lived for centuries in the tower of an old church in Spain kept growing and growing until it was strong enough to crawl down and drink all the oil from the lamps in the temple? Moreover, how do you explain to me why, in the vast plains of South America, and in other places as well, bats not only roam at night to suck the blood of small animals but also dare to pierce the arteries of large horses to drink to their heart's content?

1026,"We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the similarity to those which had been on Lucy’s throat. They were smaller, and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of London. “Out of so many harmless ones,” he said, “there may be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from the Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in the place until this ‘bloofer lady’ scare came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the ‘bloofer lady.’”","When we entered the hospital room, the young victim boy was awake. Previously, he had been asleep after drinking a glass of condensed milk, so his overall health condition had somewhat recovered. Dr. Vincent gently peeled off the bandage on the boy's neck to show us two tiny wounds. Clearly, these wounds were exactly like the ones on Lucy's neck, except that they seemed fresher and slightly smaller. We asked Vincent how he explained the cause of the wounds, and he believed the boy had been bitten by an animal, perhaps a rat. However, he also mentioned that it couldn't be ruled out that the bite was from a bat, as there are many bat colonies residing in the highlands north of London. He explained: — Living among gentle, harmless bats, occasionally there is a wild, aggressive bat coming from the south. It is also possible that some sailor caught and brought home such a bat and then accidentally let it escape, or it could be a bat that escaped from the zoo. In this case, who can guarantee that it is not a blood-sucking bat? Because in the zoo, there are many species of bats being kept. Moreover, less than ten days ago, the zoo let a wolf escape, and someone glimpsed it lurking somewhere around here. Not only that, for the past week, people have been talking about how children no longer enjoy any game other than ""Little Red Riding Hood"". There would be nothing noteworthy if this game did not coincide with the appearance of the blood-stained woman and the overnight disappearance of the children. So the kids, including this boy, just woke up and asked the nurse if he could leave. When she asked where he wanted to go, he immediately said he wanted to play with that mysterious woman.",13.074,12.685,"We found the child awake. He had slept and eaten a little; his condition was entirely improving. Dr. Vincent removed the bandage from his neck and showed us the punctures on his skin. There was no doubt about the similarity with those on Lucy's neck. They were smaller and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent what he attributed these to; he said it must be an animal bite, perhaps a rat bite; but for his part, he tended to think it was one of the bats that are found in large numbers in the northern heights of London. “Among so many harmless species,” he said, “it could be a wild type from the more harmful species of the South. A sailor might have brought it home and it managed to escape; or a young bat might have been freed from the zoo or mated with a vampire bat there and caused a breeding. Such things happen, you know. Just ten days ago, a wolf escaped from the zoo and I believe it was tracked in this direction. A week later, children in all the alleys around here were playing nothing but Little Red Riding Hood in Heath until the fear of this ‘beautiful lady’ emerged. Even this little child, when he woke up this morning, asked the nurse, ‘Can I go?’ When the nurse asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the ‘beautiful lady’.”",32.242,31.992,"We found the child awake.

1031,"We dined at “Jack Straw’s Castle” along with a little crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o’clock we started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty—for it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us—we found the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door, and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring, one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle, proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life—animal life—was not the only thing which could pass away.","We went to have dinner at the ""Jack Straw's Castle"" pub, where a group of cyclists were noisily eating and drinking with some young people. Around ten in the evening, we left the inn. Outside, the street was pitch dark. Clearly, Van Helsing had already scouted the path we needed to take, as I saw him striding confidently without fear of stumbling over any obstacles. As for me, to be honest, I would be very embarrassed if someone asked me where I was. The road became increasingly deserted, although at one point we did encounter a patrol of mounted police. But finally, we reached the cemetery. Since the cemetery gate was locked, we had to climb over the wall to get inside. The task was not easy at all, as it was much darker here than on the street, so we couldn't determine where we were standing. Yet Van Helsing quickly found the Westenra family mausoleum. He took out a key to open the mausoleum door, and the heavy door creaked, making my hair stand on end. The professor politely stepped back to let me go in first. I felt that in such a situation, his courteous gesture was somewhat humorous. He carefully closed the door, then took a matchbox and a half-burnt candle from his pocket to light the way. The mausoleum, which had once left me with a feeling of close familiarity, now suddenly made me shiver with cold. The pure white flowers meant for Lucy had now withered, fallen to the ground, and given way to a web of cobwebs. The dust of a thousand years continued its silent work of erasing all traces of this fleeting life. The nighttime scene in the mausoleum was so eerie! I feared I was about to imagine the most terrifying things possible on a pitch-dark night, in a lonely cemetery, things I had only known from mysterious and mythical stories.",5.826,5.122,"We had our dinner at an inn called ""Jack Straw's Castle"" along with a group of cyclists and another group making noise cheerfully. We left the inn and set out on our way around ten o'clock. At that time, the weather was very dark, and the lamps scattered here and there made the darkness even greater as we moved out of each of their spheres of influence. The Professor had clearly noted the way we were to go, because he was moving forward without hesitation; but as for me, I was quite confused about where we were. As we progressed, we encountered fewer and fewer people, until we were surprised to meet a mounted policeman on his usual suburban patrol. Finally, we reached the wall of the churchyard and climbed it. With some difficulty - because it was very dark and the whole place felt very unfamiliar to us - we found the Westenra family tomb. The Professor took out the key and opened the creaking door; he gently but quite unconsciously stood back and gestured with his hand for me to enter ahead of him. There was a delightful irony in his making such a polite choice even in such a dreadful situation. My friend quickly followed me in and, after making sure that the lock was not spring-loaded but the falling type, carefully closed the door. If it had been otherwise, we would have been in a difficult situation. Then he fumbled in his bag and, taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle, began to light it. The tomb had looked ugly and frightening enough even in daylight and adorned with fresh flowers; but now, a few days after the ceremony, as the white parts of the flowers turned to rust color and the green parts to brown, with spiders and insects regaining their usual dominance, the stones faded with time and the concrete covered with dust, the rusty, moldy iron, the stained brass and silver plating reflecting the weak light of the candle, the effect was much more pitiable and miserable than could be imagined. It irresistibly reflected the thought that the only thing that could pass away was not life - the life of the living.",22.563,22.318,"We had dinner at the Jack Straw's Castle, along with a small group of cyclists and others who were cheerfully noisy. Around ten o'clock at night, we left the inn. It was already quite dark by then, and the scattered lamps made the darkness even greater once one stepped out of their individual radius. The professor had evidently studied the path we were to follow, as he continued with full determination; in contrast, I was quite confused about the locality. As we advanced, we encountered fewer people, until we were finally surprised when we even found the mounted police patrol doing their normal suburban round. At last, we reached the cemetery wall, which we climbed. With some but not much difficulty (as it was dark, and the whole place seemed strange to us), we found the Westenra crypt. The professor took out the key, opened the creaking door, and stepping aside courteously, but without realizing it, gestured for me to go ahead. There was a delightful irony in this gesture; in the kindness of yielding the way on such a gloomy occasion. My companion followed me immediately and carefully closed the door, after ensuring that the lock was open and not shut. In the latter case, we would have been in quite a mess. Then, he fumbled in his bag, and taking out a box of matches and a piece of candle, proceeded to make light. The tomb, during the day and when adorned with fresh flowers, was already sufficiently gloomy; but now, some days later, when the flowers hung withered and dead, with their wilted petals and their brown calyxes and stems; when the spider and the worm had resumed their usual work; when the stone discolored by time, the dust-covered mortar, and the rusty and damp iron, and the tarnished metals, and the dirty silver filigree reflected the faint glimmer of a candle, the effect was more horrifying and sordid than can be imagined. Irresistibly, I thought that life, animal life, was not the only thing that came and went.",33.057,32.854

Occasionally, drops of wax fell onto the lid of a coffin, as if to push my tension to its peak. In front of Lucy's coffin, the professor suddenly bent down and took a screwdriver from his bag.",5.305,3.048,"Van Helsing began to work with a certain system.

1034,"“To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.” Straightway he began taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: “You shall see,” and again fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to look.","— Open the coffin lid. Maybe only then will you believe! He diligently unscrewed each screw and laboriously lifted the heavy wooden lid to one side, revealing a lead lining inside the coffin. Perhaps my endurance had reached its limit; his actions made me feel ashamed, as if I were witnessing someone undressing a woman in a deep sleep. I raised my hand to stop him, but he calmly responded: — Don't worry, you will see everything soon! He took a small hacksaw out of his bag. Before I could understand what was happening, he quickly stabbed a screwdriver into the lead casing and twisted it to make a fairly wide hole, just enough to insert the saw blade. I was shocked and jumped back a few steps, fearing the stench from the coffin was about to waft out. But the professor remained engrossed in his work, unconcerned with anything other than his ultimate goal. He sawed the lead casing along a square path, then pulled out a fairly wide piece. Seeing me still standing there dumbfounded, he waved me over. I cautiously took each step towards the coffin.",6.464,5.594,"“I will open the coffin. You still need to be convinced.” He immediately started unscrewing the bolts and finally lifted the lid to reveal the lead lining underneath. The sight affected me almost unbearably. This situation seemed like an insult to the dead, as if stripping someone of their clothes while they slept; in fact, I held Van Helsing's hand to stop him. The only thing he said was, “You will see,” and rummaged through his bag again to take out a fine wire saw. With a swiftness that frightened me, he brought the screwdriver down on the lead and made a small hole, just large enough for the tip of the saw to enter. I had expected gas to escape from the week-old corpse. We doctors, who have to be aware of the risks of our work, are accustomed to such things, so I stepped back towards the door. But the Professor did not stop for a moment; he cut a slit about sixty centimeters long along one side of the lead coffin with the saw, then cut the opposite side of the coffin, and then one of the other sides. He tilted the lifted part towards the foot of the coffin, holding it, and signaled for me to look by holding the candle towards the opened part.",29.052,28.716,"–I am going to open the coffin.

1056,"27 September.—It was two o’clock before we found a suitable opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless. Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however, and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road, no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy’s coffin, and I followed. He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me.","• September 27 Two hours had passed since we decided to take the risk with this second plan. The burial of some unfortunate person, which had started at noon, had just ended; friends and family of the deceased were gradually leaving. Sitting hidden behind a bush, we clearly saw the gravedigger—the last person in the cemetery—preparing to wrap up his final tasks. In just a moment, he would lock the gate, and we would be free to do whatever we wanted until the next morning. But the professor told us that we only needed a maximum of one hour. Just like the previous day, I began to experience an indescribable, vague sense of dread, even though it was daytime now, and despite my efforts to imagine the best possible scenarios. I fully understood that to complete this perplexing task, we might have to face legal punishment. Moreover, to be honest, I still believed that what we were about to do was utterly pointless! If opening the coffin to see if the body that had been placed there for over a week was truly dead was a disgusting act, then the effort to return to the tomb once more to prove that the coffin was empty as I had seen with my own eyes—now that was an entirely insane action! But I had no intention of commenting on what I was thinking, because I always understood that once Van Helsing had something in his mind, it was hard for anyone to change it. Therefore, I remained silent as I watched him take out the key to open the tomb door. Just like before, he stepped aside as a polite gesture to let me go in first. The scene inside the tomb seemed less eerie than it did late at night, but the sunlight filtering through the door cracks was still so weak and fragile! Van Helsing approached Lucy's coffin, and I trudged along behind him. He bent down to lift the coffin lid and the piece of lead that had been cut before, placing them aside. I could hardly believe my eyes: yes, once again I was astonished, astonished to the point of terror!",7.299,6.831,"September 27 - By the time we found the right opportunity for our venture, it was two o'clock. The funeral ceremony at noon had completely ended, and the last members of the grieving community were lazily drifting away; when we carefully looked from behind the maple grove, we saw the sexton locking the door behind them. At that moment, we realized that if we wanted, we could move freely here until morning; but the Professor said we would need at most an hour. Once again, I was seized by that dreadful feeling where the efforts of imagination to grasp the reality of events seemed futile; I was aware of the legal dangers we would face as a result of this most unholy task. Moreover, I felt that all of this would be in vain. Opening a lead coffin to see if a woman who had died almost a week ago was really dead was very grotesque; now, even though we had witnessed with our own eyes that the coffin was empty, opening it again seemed the height of folly. But I shrugged my shoulders and stood silently because Van Helsing had a way of proceeding on his own path, no matter who opposed him. He took the key, opened the grave, and with a noble gesture, signaled for me to enter first. It was not as frightening as the night before, but oh, when the daylight entered, it looked indescribably worse. Van Helsing moved towards Lucy's coffin, and I followed him. He bent down and pried open the lead layer again; at that moment, I was filled with great astonishment and horror.",21.091,20.74,"September 27. It was two in the afternoon before we found an opportunity to make our attempt. A funeral held at noon had ended, and the last lingering mourners were lazily drifting away in groups, when, carefully looking from behind a clump of alder trees, we saw the gravedigger closing the gate behind him. We knew we would be safe until morning if we wished; but my master told me we would need no more than an hour, at most. Once again, I felt that horrible sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of the imagination seems out of place; and I distinctly realized the threats of the law that hung over us due to our impious work.

Then he turned to me and said:—","— Well, let's just say that's the case, but Lucy has been dead for over a week now. Is it possible that after all those days, the corpse's appearance hasn't changed?

1065,"“Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance, sleep-walking—oh, you start; you do not know that, friend John, but you shall know it all later—and in trance could he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when the Un-Dead sleep at home”—as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was “home”—“their face show what they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.” This turned my blood cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing’s theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in my face, for he said almost joyously:—","— It seems there is something very different from everything I have known until now. We are facing a phenomenon of life bifurcation that is very rarely encountered; this girl was bitten by a ""vampire"" while she was in a state of hypnosis, sleepwalking... Oh dear! Did I startle you? John, indeed you don't know, but I will explain so you can understand. When the girl fell into a hallucinatory state, surely that vampire came and drained all the blood from her body. She died in a state of trance. On the other hand, she also became an undead in the same state due to the power of that vampire. That is the reason why she is not at all like other cases. Usually, when the immortals sleep at their homes, - the professor said, gesturing as if to remind me that some ""vampires"" are at their homes in the cemeteries - their faces always reveal the characteristic hideous features that they cannot lack. But in this case, Lucy's face remains strangely gentle and does not bear any mark of the devil at all. That is why killing Lucy while she is sleeping like this is extremely difficult for me. The blood in my veins seemed to be freezing. It seemed that Van Helsing's reasoning was gradually convincing me. But if Lucy was truly dead, what was there to fear in deciding to help her rest in peace once more? The professor looked at me, and for some reason, his voice seemed happier than before; perhaps his emotions were changing:",7.082,6.466,"“There is something here different from all the records; here is a dual life that is not ordinary.

She died while she was not herself and became the Undead while she was not herself again. In this respect, she is different from the others. Usually, the Undead sleep at home,” -while speaking, he gestured with his arm to indicate a broad area to show what “home” meant for a vampire- “their faces reveal what they truly are, but this girl, who was so sweet in the past, returns to the void of ordinary dead when she is not the Undead. There is no malice here, see, that’s why it is hard for me to kill her while she sleeps.” This chilled my blood and the realization that I accepted Van Helsing’s theories began to dawn on me; but if Lucy was truly dead, what was so terrifying about the thought of killing her?

If I did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the wounds on Lucy’s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child’s at the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week, after she die—if you know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard, and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all, an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet.

To-morrow night you will come to me to the Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too, and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we shall all have work to do.

If I follow my own bias, I would definitely have to take action immediately! Yes, right now. But we can't ignore the unforeseen consequences that we can't even imagine. Clearly, Lucy hasn't killed anyone yet, but it's only a matter of time. If I act now, I will permanently remove her from being a threat to so many people. But on the other hand, we also can't ignore Arthur's opinion. Honestly, I still don't know how to explain the whole story to him right now. If he has seen the wound on Lucy's neck and the wounds on the necks of the young victims in the hospital; if he has witnessed the coffin, which just yesterday was empty, but today contains a girl who, more than a week after her death, has become fresher and more beautiful than ever; if you, who directly saw a faint white figure dragging a child into the cemetery in the dead of night yesterday, still find it hard to believe your own eyes, then how can we expect Arthur - who hasn't seen anything firsthand - to believe the story I'm telling? He will doubt and ask why I prevented him from kissing Lucy when she was about to die. If he forgives me, it will only be because he believes I prevented him from saying goodbye to her due to a mistaken diagnosis. And now, he might believe that because of that mistake, she was buried alive. In short, he will think that we killed her due to compounded mistakes. And he will think that we are just ignorant frauds, the culprits who killed her to prove our actions were right. As a result, he will feel increasingly unhappy, and the unfortunate thing is that he will never be certain of anything. That is the worst part. Sometimes he will think his beloved was buried alive, and then some nightmares will become so terrible that he can't help but imagine the worst things she might have endured; other times he will tell himself that maybe we did the right thing, and in the end, she was indeed an immortal as I said. Well! I did hint to him once about the worst that could happen, but perhaps he never imagined such a contradictory and tragic situation as this. And now I can only be sure of one thing: Arthur will have to go through difficult and bitter moments before he can have a completely peaceful life later on. Oh Lord! That poor guy will continue to experience sorrowful moments where, for him, the sky will seem to be falling. However, after that, we will have to find a way to bring him back to peace and tranquility in his heart. It has to be that way...Now, perhaps we should go back. You will return to your patients. As for me, I will spend the night here, in this cemetery. At six o'clock tomorrow evening, come find me at the Berkeley Hotel.

Then he will respond to us, saying that it was our thoughts that killed her; thus, he will always be very unhappy. Yet he will never be sure, and this is the worst part.

No! I told you once, and since then I have learned a lot. Now, since I know that everything is true, a hundred thousand times more I know that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet ones. The poor boy must have an hour that will make the very face of heaven seem black; then we can act decisively and thoroughly, and put him at peace with himself. I have decided. Let's go. You go back to your home, at night, to your asylum, and see that everything is well. As for me, I will spend this night here in the cemetery. Tomorrow night come to pick me up at the Berkeley Hotel at ten. I will notify Arthur to come as well, and also that fine young American who gave his blood. Later, we will all have much to do. I will go with you to Piccadilly and have dinner there, for I must be back here before sunrise.",40.753,40.638

1076,"“I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in that churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager. Therefore I shall fix some things she like not—garlic and a crucifix—and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead, and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise, and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss Lucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that she is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter. He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy’s life, and we lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always the strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength to Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and I know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall find me; but none other shall—until it be too late. But it may be that he will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; his hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the Un-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.","I have to write a few lines to you, in case something unfortunate happens and I don't get the chance to see you again. I have to return to the cemetery to monitor the situation that I have predicted. I want to prevent the immortal being, that is Lucy, from leaving the mausoleum tonight, so that tomorrow night she will be even more eager to escape from there. I will attach to the mausoleum door things that the immortal being dislikes, such as garlic and a crucifix, which should be enough to keep her in. However, garlic and the crucifix only have the effect of preventing Lucy from escaping, not guaranteeing that she will give up the desire to get out. I will stay in the mausoleum all night, from sunset until dawn, so that if anything happens, I can report it to you. Regarding anything related to Lucy, either concerning herself or originating from her, I have no worries. The worrying thing originates from a certain force that was the cause of turning Lucy into that immortal being. That force now has the power to find her grave and take refuge in it. He is extremely cunning. I say this not just based on Jonathan's account, but also on the many tricks that cunning being has used against us when he interfered in Lucy's life and made us the losers. In reality, the immortal is always very strong. One of his hands might be stronger than ten people. The fact that the four of us took turns donating blood to Lucy ultimately was a futile effort. Moreover, that dark force also has the power to summon wolves and possibly other wild beasts that I am not yet aware of. In short, if he comes to the cemetery tonight, he will encounter me. But it is also possible that he will not come. His hunting grounds surely have many more foolish prey than this desolate graveyard, where only an immortal young girl, Lucy, is sleeping and an old man, me, is awake.",6.804,6.27,"I am leaving this note in case something happens. I am going alone to keep watch in that churchyard. I am pleased that Miss Lucy, who is Undead, will not leave tonight and thus will be more eager tomorrow night. Therefore, I will place some things she will not like - garlic and a cross - and thus seal the door of the tomb. As an Undead, she is still young and will avoid these. Moreover, these are only to prevent her from getting out; if she wants to get in, they may not work; for then the Undead are desperate and must encounter the least resistance, no matter what. I will be nearby from sunset to after sunrise and will learn whatever there is to be learned. I am not afraid for Miss Lucy or of her; but the other one who turned her into an Undead now has the power to seek her grave and take refuge. From mr Jonathan's experiences and from how cunningly he played with us for Miss Lucy's life and made fools of us all that time, I know that the Undead are strong in many ways. They always have the strength of twenty people; within Miss Lucy is the combined strength of us four who gave her our power. He can also gather his wolves and who knows what else. Therefore, if he comes there tonight, he will find me; but no one else - until it is too late. But he may not try here. There is no reason for him to come; there would be more to hunt in the churchyard where the Undead woman sleeps and an old man keeps watch than in this hunting ground.",19.867,19.535,"""I write this in case something happens.

Moreover, these things are meant to prevent her from coming out, as they cannot overcome her if she wishes to enter; because, in that case, the undead is desperate and must find the path of least resistance, whatever it may be. I will stay alert throughout the night, from sunset until dawn, and if there is anything to observe, I will do so. I am not afraid of Miss Lucy nor do I fear for her; as for the cause of her being undead, we now have the power to search her tomb and protect ourselves. She is intelligent, as Mr. Jonathan has told me, and by the way she has deceived us all the time she fought with us to take control of Miss Lucy. The best proof of this is that we lost. In many ways, the undead are strong. They have the strength of twenty men, and even of us four, who gave our strength to Miss Lucy. Furthermore, she can call her wolf and I don't know what might happen. Therefore, if she goes there tonight, she will find me there; but no one else will see me, until it is already too late.

In a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her—I am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness—I gave what you gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights and days—before death, after death; and if my death can do her good even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.” He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected by it. He took the old man’s hand and said in a broken voice:—","— But I beg you, please don't be angry with me anymore! Throughout my life, I have rarely had the chance to do pleasant things. There were even times when I had to face heart-wrenching matters that I couldn't ignore. Do you think I don't have thoughts? I am also very sad, very heartbroken! But that's life! How many people always get what they want? However, I must admit that I have never had to fulfill a duty as difficult as the one awaiting me. Believe in me, my friend, believe that if one day, everyone's feelings towards me suddenly change, and only the feelings of a friend like you remain... For me, that would be more than enough to dispel the sorrows of this sad moment, because I have done what a person can do to ease some of your heart's wounds. Just think about it! Why do I have to struggle like this! Why do I have to take on such troublesome matters? I came from the Netherlands to wholeheartedly care for a patient. At first, I came only to respond to the invitation of our friend John here. After that, I tirelessly treated a girl—who gradually inspired in me the feelings of a true friendship. I know it's not good to bring this up, but I still have to say that I also donated blood to her, just like you did with the blood from your heart. Yes, I gave the girl a part of my blood. But the only difference is that to her, you are a fiancé, while I am just a doctor and at most, a friend. I devoted many days, even many nights, to her, and I did so not only before she died, but also throughout the time she was no longer alive. If my death could somehow ease the cruel fate of the girl, who has now become immortal, I would be ready immediately. It is not difficult to recognize that Van Helsing's voice contained something truly bitter, yet it was not lacking in sympathy. I understand that Arthur was also very emotional and in a state of turmoil, because after a moment of silently listening to the professor's confession, he trembled as he stood up to shake his hand as a gesture of regret, and responded in a breathless voice: — Oh my God!",4.602,3.757,"“But I beg you, do not come at me in anger.

I gave her - I am ashamed to tell you this much, but I say it delicately - what you gave her: I gave her the blood in my veins, like you, who is not her lover, but only her doctor and friend. I gave her my days and nights - before death, after death, and even now, if my death will benefit her, she will have it willingly.” He said this with a very serious, sweet pride, and Arthur was deeply moved.

The night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door. He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:—","Near midnight, we climbed over the wall into the cemetery. The sky was pitch black, except for the rare moments when a crescent moon would unexpectedly appear, peeking out from behind the drifting giant clouds. Van Helsing led the way, and we closely followed behind. As we approached the grave, I had to keep an eye on Arthur, fearing that sad memories might overwhelm him. But fortunately, he managed to keep his composure. Perhaps the puzzling story that Van Helsing had just told somewhat distracted him from his worries. Seeing our hesitation, the professor went in first. After we all entered, he closed the door, lit a lamp, and pointed to where Lucy's coffin was placed. Arthur hesitated to go ahead, while Van Helsing engaged me in conversation.",6.542,5.221,"When we climbed over the low wall and entered the churchyard, it was only a quarter past twelve. Despite the moonlight occasionally shining through the cracks between the heavy clouds drifting across the night sky, it was dark. In some way, we all walked close to each other; Van Helsing was a bit ahead of us, showing us the way. As we approached the grave, I looked at Arthur carefully, because I feared that approaching a place filled with such sorrowful memories would upset him; but he was holding up well. I concluded that the mystery of the task at hand somehow prevented his grief. The professor unlocked the door and, seeing that we all had a natural hesitation for various reasons, resolved the issue by entering first himself. We others followed him and he closed the door behind us. Then he lit a dim light and pointed to the coffin.

When we got near the tomb, I looked closely at Arthur, because I feared that the proximity of a place filled with such sad memories would deeply affect him; but he managed to control himself. I thought that the very mystery surrounding all of this was mitigating his anger. The professor opened the door and, seeing that we hesitated, which was very natural, resolved the difficulty by entering first himself. We all imitated him, and the old man closed the door. Next, he lit a dim lantern and illuminated the coffin. Arthur took a step forward, not very decisively, and Van Helsing said to me:",26.218,25.721

Arthur looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or, at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead, the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent. Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and recoiled.","Yet, there are still people who don't believe me! Van Helsing approached the coffin again, bent down to unscrew it, and lifted the wooden lid aside. Arthur stood silently, wide-eyed, his face pale. When the wooden lid was placed aside, he anxiously moved closer. Clearly, he did not know that there was a lead lining inside the coffin. Seeing the cut on the lead lining, his face suddenly flushed red, then turned pale again. Van Helsing lifted the cut piece of lead, and we stared in astonishment:",11.703,10.695,"“Yes.” The Professor turned to the others, saying: “You hear, and yet there is someone who still does not believe me.” Then, he took his screwdriver and lifted the lid of the coffin. Arthur watched with a very pale face but silently; when the lid was lifted, he stepped forward. It was clear that he did not know the coffin was lead, or at least he had not thought about it. When he saw the crack in the lead, blood rushed to his face for a moment, but then it withdrew just as quickly; so much so that he remained pale and white as a sheet; he was still silent. Van Helsing threw back the lead flap and we all recoiled as we looked inside the coffin.",33.424,32.89,"–You hear it already, and besides, I don't think there's anyone who doesn't believe it. He took out the screwdriver and removed the lid from the coffin again. Arthur watched, very pale, but in silence. When the lid was removed, he took a step forward. Evidently, he did not know that there was a lead box or, in any case, did not think about it. When he saw the light reflected on the lead, the blood rushed to his face for an instant; but, with the same speed, it receded, leaving his face extremely pale. He still remained silent.

Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic, which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be. So”—here he shut the dark slide of his lantern—“now to the outside.” He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the door behind him.","— The first night, we arrived just in time. Another boy had gone missing, but thank God, we found him among the graves and fortunately, he was unharmed. Yesterday, after coming here once during the day, I returned just before sunset, because during sunset, the immortals can leave their graves. I sat here waiting from then until morning, but saw nothing unusual. Simply because I had hung garlic and a crucifix, which are things that the immortals are very afraid of, on the door of the mausoleum. The other night, the immortal had left. Today as well, before sunset, I removed the garlic and crucifix from the door. That's why the coffin is empty like this. But follow me, there are even stranger things about to happen. Let's hide in a spot not far from here, and you will see whether I am telling the truth or lying. Come on, let's get out of here. He closed the lantern lid, waited for us all to leave, and then locked the door.",6.135,4.843,"“We arrived just in time that night. A small child had gone missing again, and thank God, we found him unharmed among the graves. Yesterday, I came here before sunset because the Undead move at sunset. I waited here all night until the sun rose, but I saw nothing. This was very reasonable because I had covered the edges of the door with garlic, which the Undead cannot stand, and other things they avoid. No one came out last night, so before sunset tonight, I removed my garlic and other things from there. And thus, we found this coffin empty. But listen to me patiently. So far, very strange things have happened. Wait with me outside, unseen and unheard, much stranger things will happen. Therefore,” -here he closed the cover of his lamp- “now outside.” He opened the door, walked behind us, closed the door behind him, and we went out in single file.",30.107,29.676,"–That night we arrived just in time.

Perhaps it is because I placed garlic in the gaps of all those doors, which the ""undead"" cannot stand, and other things they try to avoid. This morning I removed the garlic and the rest. And now we have found this empty coffin. But believe me: so far there are already many things that seem strange; however, stay with me outside, waiting, without making noise or letting ourselves be seen, and even stranger things will happen.

He opened the door and we all hurried out; the professor was the last to leave and, once outside, he closed the door.",17.371,16.774
1131,"Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passing—like the gladness and sorrow of a man’s life; how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing’s conclusions. Quincey Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near also, as they too were curious. He answered:—","Wow! Coming out here, I can feel the air is much cooler and more breathable than in that eerie mausoleum. It's so pleasant to be back under the indifferent clouds drifting across the night sky. I suddenly feel that the pale moonlight peeking through those strangely shaped clouds is a rare, soothing moment, cutting through the heavy worries weighing on my heart. It's also a relief to breathe the air outside, which is less tainted with the stench of decay and death. I feel somewhat reassured when I notice the first slender rays of light about to break over a distant hill and the faint sounds echoing from a large city. But even so, our faces still couldn't hide the tension as we left the mausoleum. Arthur remained silent; I guessed he was racking his brain trying to understand why such absurd things were happening. As for me, I increasingly felt convinced by the conclusions Van Helsing had drawn. Meanwhile, Quincey showed no reaction, or rather, he had the look of someone who had accepted everything others said, but with a lingering doubt in his heart. Knowing he couldn't light a cigarette, he took a piece of tobacco and chewed it. As for Van Helsing, he was still engrossed in his work. He took out something that looked like a biscuit or a thin communion wafer, carefully wrapped in a piece of white cloth, followed by two handfuls of some white powder, probably flour. He crumbled the biscuit and mixed it with the powder into a lump. Then, he rolled the dough into long, thin strands to seal the cracks in the mausoleum doors. What he was doing didn't surprise me, but I still asked him what his purpose was. Both Arthur and Quincey also curiously came closer to hear his explanation: — I did it so that the immortal could not return there.",6.85,6.21,"Ah! After the grave, the night air felt fresh and pure. How sweet it was to see the passing clouds and the moonlight filtering through the swiftly moving clouds - like the joys and sorrows in human life; how sweet it was to breathe the clean air untouched by death and decay; how humanizing it was to see the red glow in the sky behind the hill and to hear that muffled hum, a sign of the great city's life. Everyone was very serious in their own way and was coping with what had happened. Arthur was silent, trying to grasp the purpose and spiritual meaning of this mystery. I was quite patient and seemed half-inclined to set aside doubt and accept the conclusions Van Helsing had reached. Quincey Morris was in a calm state of someone who accepts everything and accepts everything with a cool courage, along with the things he must risk. Since he couldn't smoke, he had cut himself a large piece of chewing tobacco and was chewing it. As for Van Helsing, he was busy with a special task. First, he took out a thin, biscuit-like thing carefully wrapped in a white napkin from his bag; then he took two handfuls of a white substance that looked like dough or paste. He crumbled the biscuit finely and mixed it with the substance in his hand. Then he took this and, after rolling it into thin strips, began to place them in the gaps between the door and the door frame of the grave. I was a bit surprised by this and, being close to him, asked what he was doing. Arthur and Quincey had also come close to us because they were curious too. The professor replied:",24.932,24.658,"Oh! How fresh and pure the night air seemed to us after those horrible moments! It was very pleasant to see the clouds moving across the sky and the moonlight filtering through the occasional gaps in the clouds... like the joy and sadness in a man's life. How pleasant it was to breathe the pure air that did not have that unpleasant smell of death and decay! How reassuring to see the reddish glow of the sky behind the hill and hear in the distance the dull noise that signifies the life of a big city! All of us, each in our own way, remained serious and full of solemnity. Arthur still kept obstinate silence and, as far as I could infer, he was striving to understand the purpose and deep meaning of the mystery. I myself felt quite calm and patient, inclined to reject my doubts and accept van Helsing's conclusions. Quincey Morris remained phlegmatic, in the manner of a man who accepts everything with a cool head, bravely exposing himself to whatever may happen. Since he couldn't smoke, he took a rather large handful of tobacco and began to chew it. As for Van Helsing, he was busy with something specific. He took from his briefcase an object that seemed to be a biscuit similar to a wafer and that was carefully wrapped in a white napkin; then, he took out a good handful of a whitish substance, like dough or paste. He broke the wafer, carefully crumbling it, and mixed it all with the dough he had in his hands. Next, he cut narrow strips of the product and set about placing them in all the cracks and openings that separated the door from the wall of the crypt. I felt somewhat confused and, since I was near him, I asked him what he was doing. Arthur and Quincey also approached, driven by curiosity. The professor replied:",20.815,20.499

This time the question came from Arthur. Van Helsing answered, lifting his hat respectfully:",31.693,28.538,"–What are you using? This time, it was Arthur who asked the question.

1136,"“The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.” It was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor’s, a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night.","— Holy wafer. I took the trouble to bring it from Amsterdam. The Pope gave it to me. Van Helsing's answer cleverly addressed our skepticism, and naturally, everyone had to feel that with such a serious intention from the professor, an intention that required him to use the most sacred object, we could no longer have any doubts. After sealing the door gaps with that sacred charm, he pointed out hiding spots around the mausoleum for each of us. The spots he chose were indeed clever. From our hiding places, we could cover a fairly wide area, but conversely, no outsider could detect us. Suddenly, I felt concerned for my two companions, especially Arthur. After all, I was more accustomed to the eerie and ghastly surroundings of the cemetery than they were, thanks to my previous visits. However, if less than an hour ago I had denied the evidence Van Helsing presented, now I felt my heart was about to leap out of my chest. I vaguely felt that the truth was increasingly becoming undeniable. Never before had I seen the graves at night appear so eerily white and ghostly. Never before had the cypress trees, yew trees, and red-berried pines seemed so mournful. Every bush and blade of grass before my eyes had never swayed in the wind with such a ghostly appearance. Everywhere I looked, I saw mystery, coldness, and desolation; even the distant howling and yelping of the house dogs made me think of some ominous sign about to descend upon this hellish place. We sat waiting in silence, a profound silence that made me feel as if I could clearly hear the lamenting cries of the spirits beneath the ground.",4.935,4.26,"“Communion bread. I brought it from Amsterdam. I had my sins forgiven.” This was a response that surprised even our most skeptical member, and each of us individually felt that it was impossible to display distrust in the face of such a serious purpose as the Professor's, a purpose that could use even the most sacred objects. In a respectful silence, we took our places near the grave, but in spots where we could hide from the eyes of any approaching person. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. Due to my previous visits, my inexperience in this vigil of horror had ended; but still, even I, who had rejected the evidence until an hour ago, felt my heart sinking. The graves had never seemed so terrifyingly white to me; the cypress, yew, or juniper had never appeared so much like the embodiment of funeral sorrow; the trees or grass had never rustled and swayed so ominously; a tree branch had never creaked so mysteriously, and the howling dogs in the distance had never sent such mournful signals into the night.",21.093,20.56,"–The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have authorization to use it here. It was an answer that impressed all of us, even the most skeptical, and we individually felt that in the presence of such an honorable purpose as the professor's, who used in this task what was most sacred to him, it was impossible to distrust. Amidst a respectful silence, each of us took the place that had been assigned to us, around the grave; but hidden, so that no person approaching could see us. I felt sorry for the others, especially for Arthur. I myself had become somewhat accustomed, because I had already made other visits and had been in contact with that horror; and even so, I, who had rejected the evidence about an hour ago, felt my heart pounding. The graves had never seemed so ghostly white to me; never had the cypresses, yews, or junipers seemed to be, as on that occasion, the embodiment of the spirit of funerals. Never before had the trees and the grass seemed so threatening to me. Never before had the branches creaked so mysteriously, nor had the distant barking of dogs ever sent such a horrendous omen in the middle of the darkness of the night.",21.067,20.644
1137,"There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the Professor a keen “S-s-s-s!” He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advance—a dim white figure, which held something dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave. We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We were starting forward, but the Professor’s warning hand, seen by us as he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice, and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the concentrated light that fell on Lucy’s face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.","I suddenly started when I heard the soft whisper of the professor: ""Shh... shh shh!"" He raised his hand, pointing towards a shadowy figure, white like mist, that had suddenly appeared among the red-fruited pine trees and was moving towards us. Yes, a figure dressed in white was holding something dark against its chest. The floating figure suddenly stopped just as the moon unexpectedly appeared between two dark clouds: it was a woman draped in a shroud. We couldn't clearly see her face, as she was bowing her head over what she was holding in her arms. In the dim moonlight, we immediately recognized a blonde-haired child. We were startled when we heard a shrill cry in the moonlit night. The sound was like a child waking up startled from sleep, or a dog panicking in a dream near a fire. We were about to leap towards her, but Van Helsing, who was still hiding behind a pine tree within our sight, signaled us to stop. The white figure continued to move as the clouds covered the sliver of the moon. In a flash, she appeared right before our eyes. Under the moonlight that once again unexpectedly shone through the clouds, her face became quite clear. My heart seemed to stop, and at the same time, I heard Arthur's terrified cry: we had just recognized the familiar features of Lucy. Lucy Westenra, but how had she changed so much? The gentleness we once knew in her had given way to hardness, cruelty, and malice. The once innocent face was now deeply marked by carnal desire. Van Helsing stepped out from his hiding place, and we sprang up, the four of us standing guard at the entrance of the tomb. Van Helsing opened the lantern's lid, raising it to chest height, letting the light shine on the woman before us. My God! Her lips were wet with fresh blood, yes, blood was flowing down her chin and dripping onto her collar.",11.863,11.488,"There was a long silence, a great, painful void, and then a sharp ""shh"" sound came from the Professor. He pointed to a spot, and below, from the direction of the distant badger-tree road, we saw a white figure approaching - a barely discernible white figure holding something black on its chest. The figure stopped, and at that moment, a beam of moonlight filtered through the passing clouds; we were astonished to see a woman with dark hair, shrouded in burial clothes, revealed before our eyes. We couldn't see his face because he was bent over something we understood to be a fair-haired child. There was a pause, and then a sharp, short scream was heard, like that of a small child in sleep or a dog dreaming by the fire. We were just about to leap forward when we stopped at the warning hand of the Professor, whom we could see because he was standing behind the yew tree; then, as we watched him, the white figure began to move forward again. It was now close enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight was still in place. My heart turned to ice, and I could hear Arthur breathing heavily, for we had recognized the figure of Lucy Westenra. What we saw was Lucy Westenra, but how she had changed. Her sweetness had turned into diamond-like hardness, heartless cruelty, and her purity into wanton lust. Van Helsing stepped forward, and following his movement, we also advanced; we lined up at the entrance of the tomb. Van Helsing raised his lamp and lifted its cover; thanks to the intense light falling on her face, we could see that Lucy's lips were crimson with fresh blood and that the blood had trickled down her chin, staining her shroud of fine linen.",26.336,26.075,"There was a moment of profound silence: an almost painful void. Then, the professor ordered us to be quiet with a hiss. He pointed with his hand and, in the distance, among the yews, we saw a white figure approaching... A small white figure, holding something dark pressed against its chest. The figure stopped and, at that moment, a ray of moonlight filtered through the clouds, clearly showing a woman with dark hair, dressed in the waxed shroud of the grave. We couldn't see her face, as it was tilted over what we later identified as a blond-haired child. There was a pause and then a sharp cry, like that of a child in a dream or a dog lying near the fire, sleeping. We were about to rush forward, but the professor raised a hand, which we saw clearly against the yew that served as his hiding place, and we remained motionless; then, as we waited expectantly, the white figure began to move again. It was now close enough for us to see it clearly, and the moonlight still shone fully upon it. I felt my heart freeze, and I heard Arthur's exclamation and startle when we clearly recognized the features of Lucy Westenra. It was her. But, how she had changed! Her sweetness had turned into a terrible and inhuman cruelty, and her purity into a voluptuous perversity. Van Helsing left his hiding place and, following his example, we all moved forward; the four of us found ourselves lined up in front of the crypt door. Van Helsing raised the lantern and switched it on, and thanks to the faint light that fell on Lucy's face, we could see that her lips were red, full of fresh blood, and that a stream of the liquid had trickled down her chin, staining the immaculate whiteness of her shroud.",22.792,22.497
1138,"We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even Van Helsing’s iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.","Once again, we felt a chilling shiver. In the flickering lantern light, I knew even Professor Van Helsing's steely nerves were somewhat shaken. Arthur stood beside me, and if I hadn't rushed to support him, he would have collapsed to the ground.",17.011,14.92,"We shuddered with horror. I could see that even Van Helsing's nerves were frayed in the flickering light. Arthur was standing beside me, and if I hadn't held his arm for support, he would have fallen.",41.612,40.278,"We shuddered, horrified, and I realized, from the convulsive trembling of the light, that even van Helsing's nerves of steel had faltered. Arthur was by my side, and if I hadn't taken him by the arm to support him, he would have collapsed to the ground.",17.239,14.903
1139,"When Lucy—I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her shape—saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy’s eyes in form and colour; but Lucy’s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God, how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his hands.","Meanwhile, Lucy - I call the figure standing before me Lucy, for she bears Lucy's form - stepped back and let out an angry snarl, like a trapped rat, casting a resentful gaze from one person to another. In appearance and color, those were indeed Lucy's eyes, but the gaze was not; the innocence and gentleness in the eyes of the girl I once loved had been replaced by the lecherous and spiteful fire of hell. Whatever remnants of my love instantly transformed into a feeling of hatred and disgust. I suddenly wanted to be the one to end her sinful existence with my own hands. With the same fierce and malicious look, she let out a twisted, naive, and lewd laugh. Looking at her made me feel nauseous!... And with the action of a she-devil, she unexpectedly threw the child she had been holding all this time to the ground in front of her, letting out a growl that was both angry and regretful. She looked just like a starving dog forced to give up a juicy bone. The child let out a terrified scream and then lay still, continuously moaning. The heartlessness of her action as she threw the child to the ground made Arthur gasp in pain. After that inhumane act, she slowly advanced towards Arthur: she was still smiling that seductive, inviting smile, extending her hands forward, her eyes sparkling as she looked at her past lover. Arthur could only retreat, covering his face in fear with both hands.",6.333,5.541,"Lucy -I call this thing in front of us ""Lucy"" because it had taken her shape- retreated with an angry growl like a cat caught off guard when she saw us; then her eyes roamed over us. These were Lucy's eyes in shape and color; but instead of the pure, gentle pupils we knew, there were sinful and hellfire-filled eyes. At that moment, what remained of my love turned into hatred and disgust; if she needed to be killed then, I could have done it with ruthless pleasure. When she looked, her eyes sparkled with malevolent light and her face was crowned with a lascivious smile. Oh God! How it made my hair stand on end to see this! With a careful movement, she threw the child she had been diligently holding to her chest to the ground with a heartless motion reminiscent of a demon, and as she did so, she growled at him like a dog growling at a bone. The child let out a high-pitched scream and lay on the ground moaning. There was a cold-bloodedness in the act itself that caused Arthur to groan; when Lucy approached him with open arms and a wanton smile, Arthur retreated and hid his face behind his hands.",24.925,24.497,"When Lucy… (I called the thing we had in front of us Lucy, because it retained her shape) saw us, she backed away with a growl of rage, like that of a cat when surprised; then, her eyes settled on us. They were Lucy's eyes in shape and color; but Lucy's eyes, perverse and full of infernal fire, not the sweet and kind eyes we had known. In those moments, what remained of my love for her turned into hatred and repugnance; if it were necessary to kill her, I would have done it at that very moment, with unimaginable delight. As she looked, her eyes shone with a demonic glow, and her face wrinkled into a voluptuous smile. Oh, my God, how I shuddered at seeing that smile! With a careless movement, like a she-devil full of wickedness, she threw the child she had been holding in her arms to the ground and remained growling over the creature, like a hungry dog beside a bone. The child screamed loudly and lay still, moaning. There was in that act such a monstrous display of cold blood that Arthur couldn't contain a cry; when the figure advanced towards him, with arms open and a smile of voluptuousness on her lips, he recoiled and hid his face in his hands.",18.253,17.816

She recoiled from it, and, with a suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter the tomb.","The woman's gentle yet eerie voice, like the clinking sound of glass colliding, kept resonating, resonating in my head. Meanwhile, Arthur seemed to be enchanted, his hands no longer covering his face but spreading wide as if to welcome her. Seizing the moment, the lascivious woman immediately rushed into the arms of the bewitched man as if seeking a safe haven. But at that very moment, Van Helsing jumped out, blocking her path with a golden cross held out in front of her. The immortal instantly recoiled, her face twitching in a fit of frantic rage, she leaped aside and quickly ran towards the mausoleum as if to hide inside.",4.457,3.088,"In her voice, there was a devilish sweetness that resonated in our minds - similar to the ringing sound you hear when you strike a glass - even though we knew the words were meant for someone else.

Then she turned, and her face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no quiver from Van Helsing’s iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusa’s snakes, and the lovely, blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death—if looks could kill—we saw it at that moment.","But when she was only one or two steps away from the mausoleum door, she suddenly halted, as if an irresistible invisible force had prevented her from moving further. Unable to do anything else, she quickly turned back to look at us, her eyes glaring fiercely under the clear moonlight and the lantern light held by the old professor. Never before had I seen such a face, both mournful and indifferent. I hope no one will ever have to witness such a face again. Her cheeks, which had been rosy just moments ago, now turned a pale gray; only her eyes remained the same, full of resentment and darkness, just like the eyes of someone who had escaped from hell. Her forehead was deeply furrowed with winding wrinkles like worms or snakes, and her mouth, with its sensuous, blood-red lips, was agape in a square shape, looking just like the masks symbolizing anger in Turkish or Japanese culture. If ever there was a face that announced a death sentence, or if there were looks capable of killing, then we had right in front of us such a face and such a look.",4.767,3.797,"But about half a meter from the door, he stopped as if caught by an irresistible force. Then he turned, and his face was revealed in the light of the clearly shining moon and the lamp whose light did not waver with Van Helsing's iron nerves. I had never seen such a malevolent astonishment on a face before, and I believe that such a sight will never again be seen by mortal eyes. The beautiful color of his skin came to life, his eyes seemed to spark with the fires of hell; his forehead wrinkled as if the folds of his flesh were Medusa's snakes, and his beautiful, bloody mouth opened squarely like the masks used by the Greeks and Japanese in religious plays. If it is possible for a human face to mean death -if looks could kill- we saw it at that moment.",18.642,17.852,"When she was thirty or sixty centimeters from the door, however, she stopped, as if paralyzed by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was exposed under the glow of the moon and the light of the lantern, which no longer trembled, because Van Helsing had regained control of his nerves of steel. Never before had I seen so much evil in a face; and never, I hope, will other mortal beings see it again. Her beautiful color disappeared and her face turned livid, her eyes seemed to spark with infernal fire, her forehead was wrinkled, as if her flesh were formed by the tails of Medusa's serpents, and her adorable mouth, which was then stained with blood, formed an open square, like in the theatrical masks of the Greeks and the Japanese. At that moment we saw a face that reflected death like no other before. If looks could kill!",26.229,25.749
1144,"And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:—","In front of me, she still stood defiantly between the golden crucifix that Van Helsing was holding in his hand on one side, and the mausoleum with its doors sealed shut with holy wafers on the other. After about half a minute, the old professor suddenly broke the silence by asking Arthur:",19.605,18.026,"And thus, for what seemed like an eternity of a full half minute, he remained between the cross held aloft and the sacred barrier at the entrance.

1147,"“Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like this ever any more;” and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door.","— Just do as you have planned... Go ahead and do as you have planned... There will never be anything more terrible than this. His sobs had now turned into painful groans, and if Quincey and I hadn't come to support him, he might have collapsed. Van Helsing placed the lantern on the ground and walked towards the mausoleum door, for some reason he removed the layers of talismans from the door crevice. And when he stepped aside, we couldn't help but be astonished and horrified by the scene unfolding before our eyes: the woman, in flesh and blood, easily slipped through a narrow door crevice that I thought even a knife blade would have difficulty fitting through, let alone something thicker. However, we were somewhat relieved when we saw the professor calmly resealing the door crevices with the powder fragments as before.",9.204,8.222,"“Do what you want, my friend; do what you want. Such a horror can never be seen again!” And he groaned with all his soul. Quincey and I moved towards him at the same time and held him by the arms. We heard the sound of the lamp being extinguished in Van Helsing’s hand; approaching the tomb, he took some of the holy symbols he had previously placed there from the gaps. When the professor stepped back, we stared in horror and amazement as we saw the woman's material body, which at that moment seemed as real as ours, pass through a crack only a knife's edge could fit through.

It's not possible that such a horror could exist - he moaned. Quincey and I simultaneously advanced towards him and grabbed him by the arms. We managed to hear the click produced by the lantern being turned off. Van Helsing moved even closer to the crypt and began to remove the sacred emblem he had placed in the cracks. We all watched, horrified and confused, as the professor stepped back, and the woman, with a human body as real at that moment as ours, passed through the crack where barely the blade of a knife could have passed. We all felt a huge relief when we saw the professor calmly place the mass he had removed back in its place.",22.977,22.351

It was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of fair weight.","• September 29 Around nearly two o'clock in the afternoon, we arrived at the hotel to find the professor. The strange thing was that none of us, without any prior agreement, were all dressed in black. Clearly, we were somewhat haunted by what had just happened, because Arthur was in mourning, but the rest of us were not affected at all. About an hour and a half later, we arrived at the cemetery but only dared to wander around the small secluded paths to avoid being seen before the cemetery gates were locked. Today, Van Helsing had replaced the small black bag he had carried on previous occasions with a much longer leather bag, looking just like a cricket bat case. I guessed the bag must contain a lot of things.",9.364,8.419,"September 29, night. - Just before midnight, the three of us - Arthur, Quincey Morris, and I - visited the Professor.

We arrived at the churchyard at half-past one and wandered around, staying out of sight of the officials, so that when the gravediggers finished their work and the sexton, believing everyone had left, locked the door, the entire place was left to us.

He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy’s coffin we all looked—Arthur trembling like an aspen—and saw that the body lay there in all its death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy’s shape without her soul. I could see even Arthur’s face grow hard as he looked. Presently he said to Van Helsing:—","Waiting for the last footsteps to leave the cemetery and being sure that we were the only ones left, we followed the professor towards the Westenra tomb, without anyone saying a word to each other. He took out the key to open the door and signaled for me to close it, as I was the last one to enter. He lit a lantern, then lit two more candles and placed them at the heads of the two coffins beside us. It seemed like this time he needed more light. As before, he lifted the lid of Lucy's coffin and set the square piece of lead aside, in our presence. Poor Arthur, he trembled like a leaf when he recognized the familiar form of the woman lying inside. Yes, that woman lying in the coffin looked fresher and more stunningly beautiful than ever.

First he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps.

1158,"“Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died, have become nosferatu, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror. The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free. To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not: ‘It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?’ Tell me if there be such a one amongst us?”","— Before starting the work, I would like to explain to you some additional details. In fact, my knowledge is not extensive nor profound; it is derived from science and the experiences of the ancients, or from those who have diligently researched the powers of the immortal. The state of not dying is always associated with the curse of immortal destiny. These entities cannot die; fate and they always seek to create new victims, new calamities for the earth from century to century, because if anyone dies as the prey of an immortal, they will surely become another immortal. And so, the new immortal will seek new prey to spread more disasters. The circle of calamity keeps growing, growing, like the circles on the water's surface when a stone is thrown into the lake. My friend Arthur, if that day you had kissed your girlfriend for a moment before she passed away to fulfill her wish, or if last night you had let her fall into your arms, sooner or later you would have shared the same fate, specifically becoming a nosferatu as the Eastern Europeans call it. And surely, year after year, you would become the cause of new immortal entities, terrifying many people. Fortunately, the wretched life of the unwilling immortal Lucy has just begun. The kids she sucked blood from have not yet fallen into a state of despair, but if that immortal continues to ""live,"" the kids will lose more and more blood, as they must obey the power she has cast upon them, and they will increasingly seek her out. Her filthy mouth will suck the last drops of blood from the children. On the contrary, if she truly dies, all crimes will be stopped, the minor wounds on the children's necks will disappear, and they will return to their daily games, forgetting all those dangerous adventures. But more importantly, true death will come to the immortal, and her haunted soul will be freed. Instead of committing evil deeds in the dark and enduring increasing disgrace, she will be granted a place in heaven with the angels. But it requires a hand like a blessing for her. I am very willing to do that. But isn't there anyone among us more deserving of that privilege than me? How happy it would be from now on, whenever we wake in the stillness of the night, to think: ""She has gone to the stars thanks to my own hand, the hand of the one who loved her most in the world, the hand she would choose if she could still choose. "" Tell me, friends, doesn't anyone want to have a dream with such words?",7.24,6.642,"""Before we start, let me tell you this; what we are about to do comes from the knowledge and experience of everyone who has studied the power of the ancients and the Undead. When they transform into the Undead, the curse of immortality comes with it; they cannot die, but they must live through the ages, adding new victims to their ranks and multiplying the world's evils; because those who are hunted and killed by the Undead also turn into the Undead and feed on their own kind. And thus the circle widens forever, like the ripples created by a stone thrown into water. My friend Arthur, if you had accepted that kiss from Lucy before she died or if you had kissed her when you opened your arms to her last night, you would have become, as they say in Eastern Europe, a nosferatu44 upon her death and would have continued to create those Undead that fill us with fear. The career of this very unfortunate lady has just begun. The condition of those children whose blood she has sucked is not yet very bad; but if Lucy continues to live as an Undead, the children will lose more of their blood and come to her because of the power over them; thus she sucks their blood with her very sinful mouth. But if she truly dies, then it will all end; the wounds on their throats will disappear and they will return to their games without ever knowing what happened. But best of all, this thing that is now the Undead will be put to rest as a true dead, and then the soul of that poor lady we love will be free again. Instead of doing evil at night and degrading herself further by absorbing it during the day, she will take her place beside the other angels. Therefore, my friend, the hand that delivers the blow to set her free will be a holy hand. I am willing; but is there no one among us who has more right to it? Afterwards, in the silence of the night, won't it be a joy to think, 'It was my hand that sent her to the stars, it was the hand of the one who loved her the most; if she had a choice, it would be the hand she would choose among all,'? Tell me if there is such a person among us.""",25.208,24.977,"–Before doing anything, let me explain something that comes from the wisdom and experience of the ancients and all those who have studied the powers of the ""undead"". When they become undead, the change implies immortality; they cannot die and must continue through the ages taking new victims and increasing all the evil in this world; since all who die from the attacks of the ""undead"" themselves become those horrible monsters and, in turn, attack their fellow humans. Thus, the circle widens, like the ripples caused by a stone falling into water. Friend Arthur, if you had accepted that kiss before poor Lucy died, or last night, when she opened her arms to receive you, in time, upon dying, you would become a nosferatu, as they are called in Eastern Europe, and would continue producing more and more ""undead"", like the one that has horrified us. The career of this unfortunate lady has just begun. Those children whose blood she sucks are not yet the worst that can happen; but if she continues living, as an ""undead"", they will lose more and more blood, and because of her power over them, they will come to seek her; thus, she will suck their blood with that horrendous mouth. But if it truly dies, then everything ceases; the throats' openings disappear, and the children can continue with their games, without even remembering what has been happening to them. But the best of all is that when we make this corpse that is now ""undead"" truly die, the soul of the poor lady whom we all love will be free again. Instead of carrying out her horrendous crimes at night and spending the days digesting her dreadful meal, she will take her place among the other angels. So, my friend, it will be a blessed hand by her that delivers the blow to free her. I feel ready to do it, but isn't there someone among us who has a greater right to do it? Wouldn't it be a joy to think, in the silence of the night, when sleep refuses to envelop him: ""It was my hand that sent her to heaven; it was the hand of the one who loved her the most; the hand she would have chosen above all others, if she could have done so.""? Tell me, is there someone like that among us?",28.34,28.145
1159,"We all looked at Arthur.

We were so focused on him that no one paid attention to the coffin anymore, but about ten minutes later, a strange, indescribable feeling suddenly surged within us, causing everyone to turn their eyes to that place.

And I continued to keep my eyes glued to the lines of the diary. When I reached the last lines of Harker's diary, she walked in.

Hearing me, Seward immediately turned the machine back on, but this time he set it to run slower so that I could easily type out the contents of the diary from the beginning. I made three copies so that others could read them without wasting time waiting unnecessarily. Seward had to visit some patients, but he quickly returned. He said he needed to continue reading the remaining pages of my and my wife's diary, and moreover, he wanted someone in the room working with me to avoid feeling lonely. He truly is a gallant man. This world still seems to have many such people, but it is not without its demons. Before returning to my room, I suddenly remembered the diary entry that Seward mentioned about the newspapers - the latest issues of the Westminster Gazette and Pall Mall Gazette, which Jonathan had bought for Van Helsing when he was preparing to board the train at Exeter station - so I asked to borrow them to read in my room before going to sleep. I recalled that back home, the Dailygraph and Whitby Gazette had provided us with some very useful details for further understanding the horrific events that had occurred in Whitby when Count Dracula landed there.

If his diary is written truthfully, then he must also be a very brave person. For it takes an extremely courageous person to dare to venture down into the crypt of that ancient castle twice. After reading those lines of his narrative, I thought I would meet a very tough person, not someone with the calm demeanor and full qualities of a businessman sitting across from me having lunch.",4.897,3.395,"September 30 - Mr. Harker arrived at nine o'clock.

Descending into the tomb chamber for the second time is a considerable act of courage.

But anyway, what's done is done!... Jonathan is still buried in his work. At dinner, the couple summarized for us the logic of the seemingly very disparate events that had occurred. According to Jonathan, I will understand the whole issue if I keep an eye on Renfield, as he is an unconscious signal indicating the comings and goings of the old count. I have not yet visualized the possibility of this matter, but it may be possible when comparing the dates.

1229,"I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire’s ultimate triumph? Stay; he is himself zoöphagous, and in his wild ravings outside the chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of “master.” This all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think, and then—! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.","When I visited Renfield, he was sitting quietly in a corner of the room. Seeing me enter, he gave a very gentle smile. At that moment, I had the feeling that he was completely sane like a normal person. I sat down and talked to him about countless things, and he responded to me just like a person with a sound mind. Then he suddenly mentioned that he wanted to go home - something he had never mentioned since he was admitted to the institution. I believe that if it weren't for the conversation with Jonathan and hadn't read the letters he had in his possession, or hadn't reviewed the dates when Renfield had his fits, I would have discharged him in the next few days. But to be honest, from a logical standpoint, I still can't understand what happened. Let's say that Renfield's fits coincided with the appearance of the count at the neighboring house, but what is his current state of mind? Could it be that ""vampires"" have such great power? I can't forget how Renfield ravenously chewed on both flies and live spiders, and in a fit of madness, he went to the door of the abandoned house and shouted ""master"". This could confirm our hypothesis. If so, I must keep him here. He seems lucid enough to answer questions that he might guess my purpose: to understand more about the count. He has never been this clear-headed!... Yes, I will keep him here. I suddenly feel suspicious when he is obedient. I must remind the warden to keep an eye on him and restrain him with a very secure straitjacket.",8.138,7.526,"I found Renfield in his room, sitting quietly with his hands clasped, laughing harmlessly. At that moment, he looked as sane as anyone I had ever seen. I sat down and talked with him about many subjects, all of which he approached naturally. Then he spontaneously began to talk about returning home—a topic he had never mentioned during his stay here, as far as I knew. In fact, he spoke quite confidently about being released immediately. If I had not spoken with Harker and read the letters detailing the dates of his sudden outbursts, I would have been ready to sign off after a short observation. In this situation, I am quite suspicious. All those outbursts are somehow connected to the Count's proximity to here. Then, what does this absolute calmness mean? Could it mean that his instinct is pleased with the vampire's certain victory? Wait; he is a zoophagous, and in his wild ramblings at the chapel door of the abandoned house, he always spoke of ""my Master."" All this seems to confirm our thoughts. Still, after a while, I left him; my friend is currently too sane for me to examine deeply with questions. He might start thinking, and then!.. Thus, I walked away from him.

Indeed, he spoke to me confidently that he could be discharged immediately. I believe that if I had not spoken with Harker beforehand and read the letters and the dates of his attacks, I would have been willing to sign his release after a short period of observation. As things stand, I suspect everything. All those attacks were somehow linked to the presence of the count in the vicinity. What did that absolute satisfaction mean then? Does it mean that his instincts are satisfied because of the conviction of the vampire's final triumph?

1231,"29 September, in train to London.—When I received Mr. Billington’s courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the Count’s to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and brought me to his father’s house, where they had decided that I must stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality: give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes. It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had seen on the Count’s table before I knew of his diabolical plans. Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried out. To use an Americanism, he had “taken no chances,” and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it: “Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.” Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs officers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local tradition; but no one could add to the simple description “Fifty cases of common earth.” I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that the boxes were “main and mortal heavy,” and that shifting them was dry work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn’t any gentleman “such-like as yourself, squire,” to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of reproach.","• September 29 I wrote a diary on the train to London. When Billington enthusiastically promised to provide me with all the information he had, I immediately thought I would get lucky in Whitby. In fact, now I just want to know exactly one place in London that received the count's shady shipment. Billington's son, a kind-hearted young man, waited to pick me up at the station. They arranged for me to sleep overnight at their house. There, I was warmly welcomed in the unique Yorkshire way and allowed to do whatever I wanted. Knowing that I had to handle many tasks in a very short time, Billington had prepared all the documents related to the shipment of the dubious crates for me. I suddenly shuddered when I recognized one of the letters that I had seen on the Count's desk on the day I was still unaware of his dark plans. He had thought through every situation very carefully, acting with precision and method. It seemed he had anticipated every obstacle that might arise during the execution of his scheme. To present himself in the American business style, he ""did not accept any risk"" regarding the shipment, and the precision he demanded in the shipping instructions was merely the result of an extremely careful calculation for a shady deal. I noticed that the special delivery invoice had the line: Fifty boxes of soil commonly used for experiments. The landlord Billington also showed me a copy of the letter sent to the Carter, Paterson & Co. company and the reply from this company. Billington gave me a copy of the two letters. Knowing that this was the only information he could provide, I went down to the port to ask some security guards, customs officers, and the port manager. All of them had something to say about the unusual docking of the mysterious ship, which had now become a local legend. However, none of them could provide even the slightest explanation about what was contained inside those wooden crates, so I had to be content with the only information recorded on the invoice: Fifty boxes of common soil. After that, I sought out the station master. Hearing my inquiry, he immediately called those who had participated in transporting those crates. But these people could only tell me what I couldn't be sure of: that there were fifty wooden crates, and they couldn't say anything more except that ""those crates were terribly large and heavy,"" or ""lifting them up would make you die of thirst."" It's truly a waste of effort! • September 30",8.382,7.992,"29 September, on the train to London.- When I received Mr. Billington's kind letter, in which he said he would give me all the information he could, I thought it best to go to Whitby and conduct my desired research on site. My aim now was to trace the Count's dreadful cargo to its location in London. Then, we could deal with him. His pleasant son, Billington, met me at the station and brought me to his father's house, where they had decided I should stay the night. They showed true Yorkshire hospitality: giving the guest everything and leaving him free to do as he pleased. They all knew I was busy and that my visit would be short, and Mr. Billington had prepared all the documents related to the transport of the crates in his study. Seeing one of the letters I had previously seen on the Count's desk before learning of his diabolical plans almost caused me to have a fit. Everything was done carefully, systematically, and with sensitivity. He seemed prepared for any accidental obstacle that might arise on the path to achieving his goals. In modern terms, he ""left nothing to chance,"" and the absolute precision with which his instructions were carried out was merely the logical result of his meticulousness. I saw and noted the invoice: ""Fifty crates of ordinary soil for experimental purposes."" Additionally, there was a copy of a letter to Carter Paterson and their responses; I took copies of both. This was all the information Mr. Billington could give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coast guards, customs officers, and the harbor master. They all had something to say about the ship's strange arrival, which was already becoming part of local lore, but no one had anything to add to the simple description of ""fifty crates filled with ordinary soil. "" Then, with great courtesy, I met the station master who arranged for me to speak with the men who actually received the crates. Their cargo list was identical to mine, and they had nothing to add except that the crates were ""substantial and deadly heavy,"" and that loading them was a tedious job. One of them added that it was a great misfortune that no one else ""like me, a gentleman,"" had thanked them for their efforts in liquid form; another added that the thirst that arose at that time had not entirely subsided even with the passage of time. Needless to say, before leaving them, I did not neglect to forever and adequately address the source of their grievances.",29.103,28.938,"September 29, on the train to London. When I received the kind message from Mr. Billington, in which he told me that he was willing to provide me with all the reports in his possession, I thought it appropriate to go directly to Whitby and carry out all the investigations I desired on the spot. My objective was to follow the Count's horrible cargo to his house in London. We could deal with it later. Billington's son, a very pleasant young man, went to the station to meet me and took me to his father's house, where they had decided I should spend the night. They were hospitable, with the typical Yorkshire hospitality: giving everything to the guests and leaving them entirely free to do as they wished. They knew I had a lot to do and that my stay was going to be very short, and Mr. Billington had all the documents related to the consignment of the boxes prepared in his office. I was greatly impressed when I saw one of the letters that I had seen on the count's table again, before knowing about his diabolical plans. Everything had been carefully thought out and executed systematically and with precision. He seemed to have been prepared to overcome any obstacle that might arise by accident to prevent his intentions from being carried out. He had left nothing to chance, and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were followed was simply a logical result of his care. I saw the invoice and took note of it: ""Fifty boxes of common earth, for experimental purposes."" Also the copy of the letter addressed to Carter Paterson and his response; I made copies of both. That was all the information Mr. Billington could provide me, so I headed to the port to see the coast guards, the customs officers, and the port commander. All of them had something to say about the strange entry of the ship, which was already beginning to have its place in local traditions; but they could not add anything to the simple description ""fifty boxes of common earth."" Next, I went to see the station master, who kindly put me in touch with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their description matched the lists and they had nothing to add, except that the boxes were ""extraordinarily heavy"" and that their shipment had been very hard work. One of them said it was a pity that there hadn't been some gentleman present ""like you, sir,"" to reward their efforts in some way, with a cash tip; another expressed the same, saying that the effort had made them so thirsty that they still hadn't managed to quench it completely. It is not necessary to add that, before leaving them, I made sure they would have no further complaints in this regard.",32.132,31.981
1232,"30 September.—The station-master was good enough to give me a line to his old companion the station-master at King’s Cross, so that when I arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was compelled to deal with the result in an ex post facto manner.","The station master wrote a few lines of a handwritten letter introducing me to a colleague of his at Kings Cross so that when I arrived in London this morning, I could immediately discuss with him what I wanted to know more about the wooden crates when they were unloaded here. For his part, he also immediately called the porters who had participated in unloading these crates for me to inquire, but these people could only say that the number of crates was fifty. However, no one mentioned any unusual hunger. But whether there was anything unusual or not, I still had to dejectedly thank these porters.",6.985,5.689,"September 30. - The station master was kind enough to give me a note to take to his old friend, the station master at King’s Cross, so that when I arrived there the next morning, I could ask him questions about the arrival of the crates. He immediately introduced me to the clerks who were handling the matter, and I saw that the cargo lists matched the original invoice. Here, the opportunities for extraordinary thirst were limited; but they had been taken advantage of in a more noble manner, and once again I had to deal with the result in an expostfacto manner.",31.205,30.501,"September 30. The station master was kind enough to give me a few written lines for his colleague at King's Cross, so when I arrived there in the morning, I was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes. He also immediately put me in touch with the appropriate employees, and I saw that their explanations matched the original invoice. The opportunities to have an abnormal thirst had been few in this last case; however, they had been generously taken advantage of, and I found myself forced to deal with the result in an ex post facto manner.",44.915,44.433
1233,"From thence I went on to Carter Paterson’s central office, where I met with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King’s Cross office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing exactly; the carriers’ men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity, through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:—","From Kings Cross station, I wearily made my way to the Carter, Parterson office in Cie, where they welcomed me very courteously. After locating my transaction records, the staff called the Kings Cross branch to ask for the exact details. The truck drivers had just returned from their deliveries. As requested, they immediately provided us with a report on the shipment. One of them was given a delivery note and other documents related to the transportation of the crates to Carfax. The number of crates here matched the number listed on the invoice. Additionally, the drivers agreed to provide me with any supplementary details they knew. The relevant details, if they can be called that, I received were merely the very unpleasant inconveniences of the job - dust and parching thirst. But when I let the drivers take a break and handed them a few small bills, one driver suddenly exclaimed loudly, in a thick rural accent: — That house, sir, is nothing but dust, just dust!",4.093,3.069,"From there, I went to the central office of Carter Paterson, where I was received with great courtesy. They searched the daybooks and letter registers for the transaction and immediately called their King’s Cross office for more details. By chance, the men who made up the team were waiting for work at that time, and the clerk promptly sent all the documents related to the delivery of the bill of lading and the crates to Carfax with them. Here, I also saw that the cargo lists matched exactly; the men from the transport company were able to cover the inadequacy of the written words by adding a few words. Soon I realized that these were only related to the dusty nature of the work and the thirst it created in the men. Upon seizing the opportunity to remedy this useful evil at a later date with the currency of the Kingdom, one of the men said:",23.145,22.58,"From there, I headed to the headquarters of Carter Paterson, where I was received with the utmost courtesy.

Fortunately, the men who handled the hauling were waiting for work, and the official sent them immediately, also sending with one of them the transit certificate and all the documents related to the delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Again, I found that the duplicate corresponded exactly; the carriers were able to supplement the scantiness of the documents with a few details. Soon I learned that these details were related to the dirtiness of the job and the terrible thirst it caused the workers.

1240,"30 September.—I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself. It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had: that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has, however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, good Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life and hope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. I feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity any thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not human—not even beast. To read Dr. Seward’s account of poor Lucy’s death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in one’s heart.","• September 30 I felt so happy that I could temporarily be content with myself. Perhaps that was a normal reaction to the extreme anxiety that constantly lingered within me: I was always afraid that when reminded of the emotional wound, Jonathan would have another breakdown. When preparing to go to Whitby, he seemed to have completely mastered himself, but that didn't stop me from worrying to death. Thank God! All his efforts and work were carried out smoothly with the enthusiastic help of the people he needed to meet. I had never seen him so healthy, determined, and resolute to see things through to the end. The kind old professor Van Helsing was right: Jonathan is indeed a very brave person, the more difficulties and obstacles he faces, the more eager he is to confront the challenges. When he returned, he seemed full of hope and showed more determination. He helped me finish organizing the documents he had just obtained in chronological order. Now, everything is well-prepared. I feel much more relieved and excited than before. To be honest, at first, I wondered whether, after all, it was necessary to pity a hunted creature like the Count. For this creature had nothing that could be called human, yet he was not like an animal either. However, whenever I remember Lucy's death and the events that followed, I get infuriated!",4.032,3.135,"September 30 - I am so happy that I almost don't know how to control myself. I think I am reacting this way to the fear that won't leave me: the fear that this terrible event and the reopening of the old wound could harm Jonathan. I watched his departure to Whitby with as much courage as I could muster, but I felt as if I were sick with worry. But this effort did him good. He has never been as determined, as strong, or possessed such fierce energy as he does now. Just as dear kind-hearted Professor Van Helsing said: It was a true example of courage, and he is getting better while experiencing a tension that could kill someone of weaker constitution. When he returned, he was full of life, hope, and determination; we have arranged everything for tonight. I feel like I am going mad with excitement. One must pity something that hunts like the Count. Here it is: This Thing is not human - not even an animal. Reading Dr. Seward's writings about Lucy's death and what happened afterwards is enough to dry up the source of compassion in one's heart.",19.121,18.535,"September 30. I am so happy that it is difficult for me to contain myself. I suppose it is the natural reaction after the horrible fear I had: that this terrible matter and the reopening of his old wounds could act to Jonathan's detriment. I saw him leave for Whitby with as animated a face as possible; but I felt sick with apprehension. However, the effort had done him good. He had never been so resolute, strong, and with such volcanic energy, as now. It is exactly what the excellent Professor Van Helsing told me: he is truly resilient and improves under strains that would kill a person of a weaker nature. He has returned full of life, hope, and determination. We have arranged everything for tonight. I feel very excited. I suppose it is necessary to pity someone who is as persecuted as the Count. Only that… that thing is not human… It is not even a beast.

1241,"Later.—Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we expected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with him, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it brought back all poor dear Lucy’s hopes of only a few months ago. Of course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van Helsing, too, has been quite “blowing my trumpet,” as Mr. Morris expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post them in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward’s diary that they had been at Lucy’s death—her real death—and that I need not fear to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order. I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got his and turned it over—it does make a pretty good pile—he said:—","• A moment later Lord Godalming and Morris arrived earlier than we expected. Dr. Seward had to take Jonathan to visit some patients, so I was the one who directly received them. To be honest, I felt a bit uneasy about this, because seeing them reminded me of Lucy's hopes a few months ago! Yes, Lucy had talked to me about them many times, and I also remember that Van Helsing had once ""given a speech"" praising Quincey Morris. Poor fellows! They didn't understand that I knew all about each of them proposing to Lucy! It seemed they still thought I was unaware of the tragic circumstances surrounding her death, because in front of me, they only talked about the weather and other trivial matters. Therefore, I had to explain the current situation to them. Through Seward's diary, I know that they were also present at the death - I mean the true death of Lucy, so there's nothing to keep secret here. I told them that my wife and I had read all the documents in our possession and typed them all out in chronological order. And I gave each of them a copy to read in the library.

Since they didn't know how much I was aware of the matter, they were unsure of what to say or do; therefore, they had to continue talking about ordinary topics. Still, I thought about the matter and concluded that the best thing I could do was to inform them about what had happened so far. From Dr. Seward's journal, I knew that they were present at Lucy's death - her real death - and that I didn't need to fear revealing a secret prematurely. Thus, I told them that I had read all the documents and journals as best as I could and that my husband and I had just finished arranging all the documents after typing them up. I gave each of them a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming took his copy and turned it over in his hands - it formed quite a thick bundle - he said:",35.083,34.824,"Later.

1244,"“I don’t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy—” Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the room. I suppose there is something in woman’s nature that makes a man free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I hope he didn’t think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I know he never will—he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I could see that his heart was breaking:—","— I am not quite clear about the purpose of everyone's actions, but I see that you are all very kind to me and very dedicated to me. The enthusiasm of everyone from the beginning until now seems to have brought about many results. Now, all I can do is trust and reciprocate everyone's help. I acknowledge the events and know that everyone also loves Lucy very much... He suddenly bowed his head, covering his face with his hands, his voice sobbing in between the sobs. Morris placed his hand on his shoulder for a moment, as a gesture of comforting his distressed friend, then quietly stepped outside. Surely there must be something in the instinctive nature of us women that makes a man easily express his emotions and painful feelings like that without fearing to lose face. Seeing that there were only the two of us left in the room, he collapsed onto the couch and didn't bother to hide the pain in his heart. I came over and held his hand tightly. I hoped that my gesture wouldn't be seen as too intimate for another man. And if later on, when he recalls this moment, he would never think of me that way. But perhaps I was overthinking, because I knew he was a gentleman, noble, and would never think that way. — I also care deeply for Lucy, - I confided - and I understand the feelings she had for you as well as what you did for her.",8.351,7.75,"“I don't quite understand the purpose of this; but you are such good and refined people, and you work with such seriousness and effort that the only thing I can do is to blindly accept your thoughts and try to help you.

Also, I know that you love my poor Lucy...” Here, he turned his head away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris instinctively placed his hand on his shoulder for a moment and quietly left the room. I think there is something in the nature of women that makes men feel the freedom to express their feelings about their sensitive, emotional sides and cry without feeling that their masculinity is diminished, because as soon as Lord Godalming found himself alone with me, he sat on the couch and completely, openly let himself go. I sat next to him and held his hand. I hope he didn't think I overstepped, and if he ever thinks about this moment in the future, such a thought doesn't cross his mind.

I sat down beside her and took her hand. I hope she didn't think it was presumptuous of me, and that if she thinks about it later, nothing of the sort will ever occur to her.

1258,"30 September.—I got home at five o’clock, and found that Godalming and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the carriers’ men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I have lived in it, this old house seemed like home. When we had finished, Mrs. Harker said:—","Dr. Seward's Diary I returned home at five in the afternoon, when Lord Godalming and Morris were already present and they were informed about the letters and the diaries that Jonathan and his admirable wife had meticulously copied. Jonathan had not yet returned; he had to visit some truck drivers that Mr. Hennessey mentioned in his letter. Mina made each of us a cup of tea; to be honest, since becoming a doctor, this was the first time I truly felt that this hospital was ""my home"". While sitting and drinking tea, Mina asked me:",12.839,11.533,"September 30. - I returned home at five o'clock and saw that not only had Godalming and Morris arrived, but they had also already examined the various journal and letter texts prepared and organized by Harker and his excellent wife. Harker had not yet returned from the transporter's men, as Dr. Hennessey had informed me by letter. Ms. Harker gave us each a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that for the first time since I started living here, this old house felt like a home.

1259,"“Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr. Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary interests me so much!” She looked so appealing and so pretty that I could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: “Why?”","— Dr. Seward, may I make a request of you? I would like to meet your patient Renfield for a moment. What you mentioned about him in your diary has caught my attention. Her voice, her eyes almost pleading, made it impossible for me to refuse. Besides, I saw no reason to do so. And I agreed to take her to meet Renfield immediately afterward. Entering his room, I told him that a lady wished to visit him, and he mumbled in response: — For what purpose?",15.347,14.097,"""Dr. Seward, may I ask you for something? I want to see your patient, Mr. Renfield. I want to see him. The things you mentioned about him in your journal intrigued me a lot!""

I wish to see your patient, Mr. Renfield. Let me see him. I am very interested in what you say about him in your diary. She looked so pleading and so pretty that I couldn't refuse her; consequently, I took her with me. When I entered the room, I told the man that there was a lady who would like to see him, to which he simply responded: –Why?",43.331,42.781
1260,"“She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,” I answered. “Oh, very well,” he said; “let her come in, by all means; but just wait a minute till I tidy up the place.” His method of tidying was peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting task, he said cheerfully: “Let the lady come in,” and sat down on the edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunatic—for easiness is one of the qualities mad people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and held out her hand.","— She intends to visit the hospital, - I explained - and wants to interact with the inpatients to understand some issues, that's all. — That's good! Then just tell her to come in! But wait a minute, I need to tidy up a few things first. For him, cleaning up meant devouring all the flies and spiders stored in the boxes scattered around the room before anyone could stop him. Clearly, he was afraid of others finding out about those insects. After ""cleaning up,"" he cheerfully told me: — Bring her in! Then he sat down on the edge of the bed, head bowed, but his eyes still tried to look up, waiting for the strange guest. Looking at him, I suddenly felt anxious because he could go into a deadly rage at any moment. I remember there was a time when he appeared completely docile in my office, yet just a few minutes later, he suddenly lunged at me as if he wanted to finish me off immediately. Therefore, I had to sidle up to sit next to him so that if anything happened, I could kill him before he had a chance to attack Mina. With his consent, Mina stepped in cheerfully and extended her hand towards him.",10.608,9.969,"“She is wandering around and wants to see everyone inside,” I replied. “Oh, very well,” she said, “of course, let her in; but wait a minute until I tidy up here.” The tidying method was unusual: Before I could stop her, she swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes. It was very clear that he was afraid of interference in his work or felt jealousy. When he completed his disgusting task, he cheerfully said, ""Let the lady come in,"" and sat on the edge of his bed, raising his eyes so he could see the lady's entrance. For a moment, I thought he might have the intention to kill; I remembered how calm he was just before attacking me in my study, and I made sure to stand in a place where I could catch him if he tried to jump on Ms. Harker. Ms. Harker entered the room with a natural grace that would suddenly earn the respect of any madman. She walked towards Renfield with a pleasant smile and extended her hand.",25.263,24.874,"–He is visiting the entire house and wants to see everyone in it -I replied. –Ah, very well! – he said-. Let her in, no matter what; but wait a minute, until I put the place in order. His method of tidying the room was very peculiar. He simply swallowed all the flies and spiders that were in the boxes before he could be stopped. It was obvious that he feared or was jealous of any interference. When he had finished his unpleasant task, he said kindly: –Let the lady in. And he sat on the edge of his bed with his head bowed down; but with his eyelids raised, so he could see the lady as soon as she entered the room. For a moment, I thought that perhaps he had homicidal intentions. I remembered how calm he had been shortly before attacking me in my own studio, and I positioned myself in such a way that I could restrain him immediately if he tried to jump on her. Mrs. Harker entered the room with a natural grace that would have immediately earned her respect from any lunatic... since poise and grace are the qualities most respected by the insane. She approached him, smiling pleasantly, and extended her hand.",27.081,26.688
1261,"“Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,” said she. “You see, I know you, for Dr. Seward has told me of you.” He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he said:—","— Hello, Renfield. - She said. - You see, I have been informed about you, Dr. Seward has told me about you. He frowned, staring intently at the strange woman and did not bother to answer immediately. He even showed a mix of surprise and a bit of skepticism, but he also surprised me with a question I could never have anticipated:",13.667,12.016,"“Good evening, Mr. Renfield,” she said. “You see, I know you because Dr. Seward has told me about you.” Renfield did not respond immediately, but with a sullen expression, he examined her carefully from head to toe. This gaze turned into a curiosity mixed with suspicion; then, to my great surprise, he said:",33.613,32.652,"–Good afternoon, Mr. Renfield -he said-. As you can see, I know you. Dr. Seward has spoken to me about you. The alienated one did not respond immediately, but examined her with a furrowed brow. His expression changed, his face reflected astonishment and then doubt; then, to my profound surprise, I heard him say:",22.557,21.314

You can’t be, you know, for she’s dead.” Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:—","— Isn't she the woman the doctor here wants to marry? No, it can't be her, because that girl is already dead. Mina smiled and replied:",8.826,5.091,"“You are not the young girl the Doctor wants to marry, are you?

Afraid that this kind of conversation might upset Mina, I had to choose my words carefully to steer the conversation in a different direction.",9.367,6.335,"“But why?” I thought that this kind of conversation might not be very pleasant for Ms. Harker, just as it wasn't for me, so I joined in:",46.881,45.289,"–But, why not?

He responded to me with a disdainful tone, his eyes shifting from Mina to me, then immediately turning away:",10.254,7.599,"""How did you know that I wanted to marry someone?"" In the brief moment when he shifted his gaze from Ms. Harker to me and then immediately back to her, his response was very dismissive:",18.521,15.824,"–How do you know that I wanted to get married?

He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as he had shown contempt to me:—","— I don't think so, Renfield! - Mina said as if to defend me. Unlike his disdainful attitude when talking to me, he was very polite and respectful when conversing with Mina:",6.414,3.52,"“I don't understand anything, Mr. Renfield,” said Ms. Harker, immediately defending me.

1271,"“You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors of non causa and ignoratio elenchi.” I positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet lunatic—the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met with—talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker’s presence which had touched some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or power.","— Mrs. Harker, you must understand that for a man who is esteemed and loved like the doctor here, everything related to him concerns our small community. Not only do the friends who love Dr. Seward, but even some of his patients, due to their mental imbalance, can alter the nature of cause and effect. Since being in this asylum, I cannot help but notice that the sophistry of some inmates always tends to make them commit errors of non-causality and consequence, causing them to be confused not only due to a lack of substance awareness but also about the cause itself. I stared at him in astonishment. He was the patient who concerned me the most, so I always understood that one of the things contributing to his condition was his frequent talk about philosophy. But indeed, I had never seen him speak in such a manner: he spoke as if he were a truly distinguished philosopher. Could Mina's presence have struck a chord in his memory? If the sudden awakening of these intellectual abilities was spontaneous, or at least stemmed from the unconscious influence of that young woman, then she must surely possess a natural talent or an unusual capability.",10.806,10.098,"“When a man is loved and honored as our host is, you will of course understand, Ms. Harker, that everything about him greatly interests our small community.

I used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his blood—relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, ‘For the blood is the life.’ Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn’t that true, doctor?” I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs. Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: “Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often, under auspices pleasanter to yourself,” to which, to my astonishment, he replied:—","— If you pay attention, you will see in me a very different essence. I say this without jest, it is not surprising that my relatives always show concern for me and place me under their supervision. Occasionally, I still imagine life as a practical, eternal entity, and by consuming countless living entities, even those at the bottom of the creation ladder, one can extend their life indefinitely. I have always believed in immortality, to the extent that there will come a time when I must truly prove myself to be a man. Surely, there will be a time when the doctor here will tell you that there was once a moment when I intended to kill him to rejuvenate myself, I mean to say that I would attain immortality by absorbing his very blood, because I remember a verse in the Bible: “The blood flows, that is life.” Yet the physicians have deliberately trivialized this obvious truth to the point where he deserves to be spat in the face. Am I right, doctor? I nodded slightly, feeling very astonished to be able to find a word or even a thought about what he had just explained. Could this really be a man who, just five minutes ago, had swallowed who knows how many flies and spiders!... I glanced at the clock, as it was time to go to the station to pick up Van Helsing. Seeing me mention it, Mina immediately stood up to leave with me, but before stepping out the door, she smiled and said to Renfield: — Goodbye!

From time to time, this belief was so strong that I even attempted to take human life. The Doctor here will confirm that once, I tried to kill him to increase my vital forces by assimilating his life through his blood - Of course, based on the phrase from the Holy Bible, ‘For the life of the flesh is in the blood.’ But in reality, the person selling certain old wives' remedies vulgarizes the matter to the point of insulting reality.

Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are determined—nay, are we not pledged?—to destroy this monster; but it is no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer—both in waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides, she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and we go alone.” I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed to come on him. “Oh that we had known it before!” he said, “for then we might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, ‘the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards,’ as you say. We shall not think of that, but go on our way to the end.” Then he fell into a silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:—","— Oh my! This Miss Harker keeps surprising me more and more every day! She truly has the mind of a man, a man with natural talent, but carries within her the gentle heart of a woman! I tell you, don't laugh, God created her: it must be for some special divine purpose. My dear friend, fortune has brought her here to help us. However, after today, we should not let her get involved in this dreadful story anymore. Otherwise, she will have to face unforeseeable dangers. We have promised each other that the destruction of that demon is our task, the task of brave men, not of a woman, right? Even if she doesn't encounter any risk, her compassionate heart shouldn't have to endure the pressures of one horror after another. In any case, we must not allow her to have nights full of nightmares in the future. Moreover, since she is still young and has just gotten married, if not now then soon, she will have many things to arrange. You just said she has typed all the documents, so she has already participated quite a lot with us. Tomorrow, you should tell her to rest! Don't let her do any more work. We will continue the work ourselves without letting her... I completely agree with the professor's opinion and inform him of what we have just discovered during his absence: the house that Count Dracula bought is the one adjacent to the grounds of my asylum. Van Helsing seemed very surprised, but could not hide his worried expression. — Oh my God! Why didn't we know sooner? - He lamented. - If we had known earlier, we could have saved Lucy! But never mind, it's all in the past now, we shouldn't dwell on it, the issue now is to try our best to reach that final goal! He suddenly fell silent and remained that way until they got home. Before going upstairs to take off his coat and prepare for dinner, he said to Mina:",4.942,4.016,"“Ah, the wonderful Madam Mina! She has a man's brain - a brain that, if a man is lucky, he might possess - and a woman's heart. When the kind-hearted God made such a good mixture, believe me, He created her for a specific purpose. My friend John, so far, luck has allowed that woman to help us; after tonight, she should have no further involvement with this dreadful affair. It is not good for her to take such a great risk. We men are determined to destroy this monster - moreover, we have promised, haven't we? But this is not a woman's duty. Even if she is not harmed, her heart might fail her amidst all this horror, and she might suffer afterwards - because of her nerves while awake and because of her dreams while asleep. And besides, she is a young woman and has not been married long; there might be other things to consider, if not now, then later. You told me she has written everything down, so she should exchange views with us, but tomorrow she will bid farewell to this matter, and we will continue alone.” I wholeheartedly agreed with him and then told him what we had found in his absence: the house Dracula had bought was the one right next to mine. He was very surprised by this and seemed to be filled with great doubt. “Ah, if only we had known this sooner!” he said, “Because then we could have reached poor Lucy in time to save her. But as you said, ‘There is no use crying over spilled milk.’ We should not dwell on this and must proceed on our path to the end.” Then, he fell into silence until we reached the garden gate. Before going to prepare for dinner, he said to Ms. Harker:",24.518,24.223,"–Oh! That wonderful lady Mina! She has the brain of a man; a very well-endowed man, and the heart of a woman. God created her with some exalted purpose, believe me, when He made such a good combination. Friend John, so far good luck has made that woman of great help to us; after tonight she should have nothing to do with this terrible matter. It is not convenient for her to run such a great danger. We men, since we have committed to it, are willing to destroy that monster; but there is no place in that plan for a woman. Even if she does not suffer physical harm, her heart may fail her on many occasions, due to that multitude of horrors; and then she may suffer from insomnia because of her nerves, and when sleeping, due to nightmares. Besides, she is a young woman and has not been married for long; there may be other things to think about at other times, though not currently. You have told me that she has written everything; therefore, she will consult with us; but tomorrow she will step away from this work, and we will continue alone. I sincerely agreed with him, and then I told him everything we had discovered in his absence and that the house Drácula had acquired was next to mine. He was very surprised and seemed to fall into deep reflections. –Oh! If we had known before! – he exclaimed. We could have reached in time to save poor Lucy. However, ""there's no use crying over spilled milk,"" as you say. We must not think about it, but continue our journey to the end. Then, he fell into a silence that lasted until we entered my house.

1291,"“There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. ‘See! see! I prove; I prove.’ Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know—nay, had I even guess at him—one so precious life had been spared to many of us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The nosferatu do not die like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and the bat—the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward become foul things of the night like him—without heart or conscience, preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again? We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God’s sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no; but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What say you?”","First, I affirm that ""vampires"" truly exist in this world, simply because some of us have accidentally obtained evidence! Even if we hadn't gone through the painful reality just now, the past would still provide us with enough evidence to conclude their existence. To be honest, at first, I didn't believe it either. For many years, if I hadn't forced myself to broaden my perspective on the world and life, I would never have believed in this seemingly mythical story until a thunderbolt struck my ears: ""See! I will make you see! I will give you undeniable evidence!"" That's it! If from the beginning, we had known everything as we do now, Lucy's precious life might not have had such a sad ending! In the end, we failed. Now, all our efforts can only be to save other souls. It should be known that this nosferatu species cannot die like bees do after injecting their venom into a person's body. On the contrary, it only gets stronger, and the stronger it gets, the more dangerous it becomes. The ""vampire"" we are facing has the strength of twenty men. He is more cunning than any similar entity, as his deceitful skills have been honed over centuries. He knows how to use necromancy, a magic in its original sense of summoning the spirits of the dead to predict the future, and all the dead can come to him at his command. He is extremely ruthless, and sometimes even worse than ruthlessness. He is a demon without humanity, without a heart in many lands, he can appear anywhere, in any form he desires. Even to some extent, he has the power to control the forces of nature such as summoning storms, fog, thunder, or commanding lower animals like rats, owls, bats, moths, weasels, foxes, and wolves to obey him. He can make himself larger or smaller, and in some cases, he can disappear as if he never existed. Under such conditions, how are we to find him? And once we find him, how can we permanently destroy him? It's not easy, my friends, not easy at all. It will be an extremely difficult and terrifying task, sometimes just thinking about the consequences of that task is enough to make the bravest man shudder. Why is that? Because if we plunge into the battle, he will surely win. And then what will happen? For me, losing my life is not scary at all. The problem is that our failure carries a completely different meaning from life or death: we will become heartless, unconscious beings like him, creatures of the night, and then turn the people we love most into our prey. The gates of heaven will never close for us, because who will open the gates for us? We will be scorned and cursed by people forever. That's it! The most terrible challenge is being posed. We are facing a task entrusted by God, an arrow to be driven into the immortal for humanity. The task is there, can we retreat? As for me, I do not mind anything. Anyway, I am already old, life, the radiant sunlight, houses, gardens with chirping birds, music, love, longing... all, all are receding behind. But you, you are still very young. Some of you, although you have endured many sad things, happy days will still open their arms to welcome you. What do you decide?",7.838,7.496,"There are beings called vampires; some of us have evidence that they truly exist.

If I had known at the beginning what I know now - even if I had made an assumption - such a precious life would have been spared for those of us who love it. But that is in the past; we must work so that other souls we can protect do not perish. Nosferatu, like a bee, does not die because it stings once. It only grows stronger and, because it grows stronger, it has more power to do evil. This vampire among us has the strength of twenty men, is more cunning than mortals because its cunning has developed over centuries; still, with the help of necromancy and as the root of the word indicates, it means seeing the future through the dead and that the dead it can approach come under its command, it is a ruthless and more than ruthless, a heartless demon, and it has no emotion in its heart, within certain limits, it can appear at any time, in any place, and in any form it desires, within a certain distance, it can control the air: it can create storms, mist, lightning, it can command lesser creatures - rats, owls, and bats - moths, foxes, and wolves; it can grow and shrink and at times disappear and become unknown. Then, how shall we begin our struggle to destroy it? How shall we find its place and, when we find it, how can we destroy it? My friends, this is too much; the task we have undertaken may have a dreadful outcome that would make the bravest tremble. For if we fail in this struggle, surely it will have won; then what will become of us? Life is not important; I do not care about it. But failing here is not just a matter of life and death. We would become like it; henceforth, we would be among the vile creatures of the night - heartless, merciless, feeding on the bodies and souls of those we love the most... The gates of Heaven would be closed to us forever, for who would ever open them for us again? Everyone would despise us forever, a black stain in the daylight of God, an arrow in the side of Him who died for humanity. But we are faced with duty, and should we shrink from such a cause? As for me, I say no, but I am old and life with its daylight, its beautiful places, its birdsong, its music, and its love is far behind me. You others are young.

If, alas, I had known before what I know now and even what I guess, we might have been able to save a life that was so precious to all of us who loved her. But that is beyond remedy now, and we must continue working so that other poor souls do not perish, as long as we can save them. The nosferatu does not die like bees when they have stung, leaving their stinger. He is much stronger and, because of that, has much more power to do evil.

But, failing in this case does not mean only life or death. It is that we would become like him; that henceforth we would be nefarious beings of the night, like him... Beings without heart or conscience, who dedicate themselves to the plunder of the bodies and souls of those they love most.

1300,"“All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death—nay of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the first place because we have to be—no other means is at our control—and secondly, because, after all, these things—tradition and superstition—are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for others—though not, alas! for us—on them? A year ago which of us would have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific, sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never! He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand—witness again Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create—that noble ship’s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust—as again Jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small—we ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with fire—solder you call it. He can see in the dark—no small power this, in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell. He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of nature’s laws—why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come; though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset. These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of, lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest. We have seen it with our eyes.","To do this, we need to refer to tradition and belief. But in reality, tradition and belief do not bring anything significant when it comes to life and death... or more specifically, the issues at hand are far more important than life and death. However, we need to be content with ourselves, first because we are forced to act, and second because tradition and belief do not leave anything too important. Let me ask, about a year ago, in this nineteenth century with its peak of scientific development, who among us dared to admit what we have just learned now? We once loathed a belief, only to soon witness a reality that was not at all irrational. Believe that the “vampire” - a character that makes many people believe in its existence and its powers as well as its limitations - has also provided evidence of its existence in the eyes of many outside of us. We can see this wherever there are people on this earth. “Vampires” are mentioned everywhere: ancient Greece, ancient Rome, Germany, France, India, even the Chersonese islands. In China, a country very far from us, even today many people are so terrified just by hearing about it that they quickly hide under their blankets. Its bad reputation quietly follows the footsteps of the Irish, Hungarians, Slavs, Saxons, and nomadic Magyars across all continents. So we know everything we need to know, and we have all the necessary data to take action. But I must also say that there are still many beliefs about this character that have not been verified during the time we experienced the recent misfortune. “Vampires” live without fearing that time will gradually bring them closer to death. They will continue to expand as long as they are nourished by the blood of the living. We can see them become younger, stronger, and able to revive immediately if they find their preferred source of nourishment. They must follow this lifestyle and cannot live like ordinary people. As our friend Jonathan saw, during the many weeks at Dracula's castle, did he ever see it eat a meal? Never! Another equally strange thing: it has no shadow; its form is not reflected in mirrors, as Jonathan has also seen. Moreover, it has tremendous strength, as Jonathan described in his diary when it closed the castle gate to keep the wolves out and when it helped him down from the carriage. It can transform into a wolf, as seen when a certain ship docked at Whitby or when it attacked and tore apart a house dog, or into a bat as Mina saw on the window ledge at Whitby, as John saw when it flew from the neighboring house, or as Quincey saw when it perched on Lucy's window. It can approach the brave captain sitting at the helm by creating a thick fog around itself, but we can easily determine its limited space by that very fog. “Vampires” can appear as dust particles mingling with moonlight, as in the case of the three women Jonathan saw several times in Dracula's castle. You know, it can shrink itself to fit through a hair-thin crack in the Westenra family tomb. Once it finds its way, it can enter any place and see through the darkness, which is not a power to be underestimated in a twilight world. It can do all the things I just mentioned, but that does not mean it has free choice. It is truly a prisoner of itself, a prisoner sentenced to lifelong hard labor, a madman locked in a confined room. Going to all the places it wants is impossible for it. It is not a natural living entity but one that must live according to certain specific rules of its own. Not every door is open to it. Like other evil forces, its powers cease as soon as the first rays of dawn appear. It has the right to freedom, but only at specific times. If it is not at the place it wants to be, it cannot return there before sunset. We know this from folklore and documentary books, and we can also find similar evidence from what we have gathered here. Thus, although it can often show off its power as it pleases, “vampires” cannot ignore the limitations imposed within a specific range: coffins, hell, or an unblessed grave of a suicide in the Whitby cemetery, for instance, and it can only move at very specific times, or cross the ocean during high tide. And as we know, there are certain things that can nullify its powers, like me, or a symbolic object like a golden cross: seeing this sacred object, it must retreat and find a way to escape. There are other things you should know in case of necessity, such as wild rose placed on the coffin lid to prevent it from escaping, a holy bullet shot into the coffin will kill it, I mean a true death. And when a stake is driven into its heart, just like beheading it, we will give it eternal sleep, never to wake up again. We all understand this case, right?",5.937,5.654,"The only thing we can rely on is traditions and superstitions. When it comes to matters of life and death - even more than life and death - these may not seem very apparent at first glance. Nevertheless, we should be glad about it, because firstly, we are compelled to - we have nothing else under our control - and secondly, because ultimately these - tradition and superstition - mean everything. For others - but not for us - isn't the belief in vampires based on these? A year ago, in the midst of the scientific, realistic nineteenth century, which of us would have accepted such a possibility? We even rejected the belief confirmed right before our eyes. Then, assume for a moment that the belief in the vampire, its boundaries, and its cure are also based on this foundation. Because, let me tell you, it is recognized wherever mankind exists. It shines in ancient Greece, ancient Rome, all of Germany, in France, India, even in the Thracian Peninsula, in China, in places far from us under any circumstances, and even today people fear it. The Icelandic wild warrior, the son of the devil Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Hungarian came into the world after their revival. At that time, all we could base our actions on was this, and let me tell you that many of these beliefs have been confirmed by our own very unfortunate experiences. The vampire continues to live and cannot die merely with the passage of time; by feeding on the blood of the living, he can become even healthier. Moreover, we have seen that he can even rejuvenate over time; his vital abilities become more functional and seem to renew themselves when he has plenty of his special food. But without this diet, he cannot maintain his health; he does not eat like others. Even our friend Jonathan, who stayed with him for weeks, never saw him eat, not even once! He had no shadow, and as Jonathan observed, he has no reflection in the mirror. He possesses the strength of many men - Jonathan witnessed this again when he closed the door to the wolves and helped him down from the carriage. When he tore apart the dog, as we understood from the ship docking at Whitby, he can transform into a wolf; as Madam Mina saw him at the window in Whitby, and our friend John saw him flying very close to the house, and our friend Quincey saw him at Miss Lucy's window, he can also become a bat. He can come within the mist he creates - the captain of that noble ship proved this, but as far as we know, the distance of this mist is limited and can only be around him. He comes like pure dust particles in the moonlight - just as Jonathan saw those sisters at Dracula's castle. He can become very small - we saw him pass through the hair-thin gap in Miss Lucy's tomb door before finding peace. Once he finds his way, no matter how tightly bound it is or even if it is melted and fused with fire - you call it soldering - he can get out of anywhere and enter anywhere. He can see in the dark - this is no small power in a world half deprived of darkness. But listen until I finish. He can do all this but is not free. No! More captive than a galley slave, more captive than a madman in his cell. He cannot go wherever he wants; though he is not of nature, he still has to obey some natural laws - why, we do not know. He cannot enter any place for the first time unless invited by one of the household, but then, he can come as he pleases. With the dawn of day, as with all evil, his power vanishes. He has limited freedom only at certain times. If he is not in the place he is bound to, he can change himself only at noon or exactly at sunrise or sunset. These are the things we have been told and what we have been able to find evidence for based on our record. Therefore, within the unblessed place, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide in Whitby, he can do as he pleases within its boundaries, but at other times he can only change when the time comes. It is also said that he can cross running water only when it is still or at rising tide. Then, there are things that worry him because he has no power against them; as far as we know, things like garlic, holy items, and this symbol among us when we have made a firm decision, that is, the cross, for him, these are nothing, and in their presence, he withdraws respectfully and becomes silent. There are other things I will tell you about, in case we need them in our search. A bunch of wild rose placed on his coffin will prevent him from getting out; a blessed bullet shot into the coffin will kill him and thus make him truly dead, and as for the stake that will pass through him, we already know the peace it brings, or the peace brought by the severed head. We have seen this with our own eyes.",23.87,23.764,"""All we have as points of reference are traditions and superstitions. These foundations do not seem, at first, to be very important when life and death are at stake. We have no way to control other means, and secondly, because, after all, these things, tradition and superstitions, are something. Isn't it true that others maintain the belief in vampires, even if we do not? A year ago, who among us would have accepted such a possibility, in the midst of our nineteenth century, scientific, skeptical, and realistic? We even refused to accept a belief that seemed justified before our very eyes. Let us then accept that the vampire and the belief in its limitations and the remedy against it rest for the moment on the same basis. For let me tell you that it has been known in all places inhabited by men. In ancient Greece, in ancient Rome; it existed in Germany, in France, in India, even in the Chersonese; and in China, which is so far from us in every respect, it still exists, and people fear them even to this day. It has followed the trail of the Icelandic navigators, the accursed Huns, the Slavs, the Saxons, and the Magyars. So far, we have everything we might need to act; and let me tell you that many of the beliefs have been justified by what we have seen in our own unfortunate experience. The vampire continues to live and cannot die simply because of the passage of time; it can grow stronger when it has the opportunity to feed on the blood of living beings. Even more: we have seen among us that it can even rejuvenate; that its vital faculties become more powerful and seem to refresh when it has a sufficient supply of human blood. But it cannot thrive without that regimen; it does not eat like others. Not even our friend Jonathan, who lived with it for several weeks, ever saw it eat. It casts no shadow, nor is it reflected in mirrors, as Jonathan also observed. It has the strength of many in its hands, as Jonathan also testified, when it closed the door against the wolves and when it helped him down from the coach. It can transform into a wolf, as we know from its arrival in Whitby and from our friend John, who saw it fly out of the neighboring house, and from my friend Quincey who saw it at Miss Lucy's window. It can appear in the midst of a mist that it itself produces, as attested by the noble captain of the ship, who tested it; but, as far as we know, the distance to which it can extend that mist is limited and can only be found around it. It arrives in the moonlight rays like cosmic dust… As Jonathan again saw those sisters at Dracula's castle. It becomes so small… We ourselves saw Miss Lucy, before she regained peace, enter through a crack the size of a hair in the door of her tomb. Once it has found the way, it can exit or enter any place, no matter how hermetically sealed, or even joined by fire…, welded, we might say. It can see in the dark…, which is no small power in a world that is always half-submerged in darkness. But, listen to me well: it can do all these things, though it is not free. No, it is even more a prisoner than the slave in the galleys or the madman in his cell. It cannot go wherever it wants. Although it does not belong to nature, it must nevertheless obey some of the natural laws… We do not know why. It cannot enter any place at first, unless there is some inhabitant of the house who lets it in; although afterwards it can enter whenever and however it wants. Its powers cease, like those of all evil things, upon the arrival of day. “Only on some occasions can he enjoy a certain margin of freedom. If he is not exactly in the right place, he can only move at noon or at the precise moment of sunset or sunrise. These are things we have known, and which we have proven in our records by inference. Thus, while he can do as he pleases within his limits, when he is in the place that belongs to him, on land, in his coffin or in hell, in a profane place, as we saw when he went to the suicide’s grave in Whitby; in other places, he can only move when the opportune moment arrives. It is also said that he can only cross running waters at the ebb of the tide. Furthermore, there are things that affect him in such a way that he loses his power, like garlic, which we already know, and sacred things, like this symbol, my crucifix, which was among us even now, when we made our resolution; for him all these things are nothing; but he keeps his distance and remains silent, with respect. There are other things as well, which I will tell you about, in case we need them in our investigation. The branch of wild rose placed over his coffin prevents him from leaving it; a consecrated bullet shot into his coffin kills him, so that he is truly dead; as for driving a wooden stake through him or cutting off his head, that makes him rest forever. We have seen it with our own eyes.",24.746,24.648
1301,"“Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time, and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the ‘land beyond the forest.’ That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the records are such words as ‘stregoica’—witch, ‘ordog,’ and ‘pokol’—Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is spoken of as ‘wampyr,’ which we all understand too well. There have been from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.”","— Thus, - Professor Van Helsing continued - for Count Dracula, when we find his dwelling, we will do everything to keep him in his lair to destroy him right there. But don't forget that he is extremely cunning and also very intelligent. I once asked my friend Arminius at the University of Budapest to provide information about Dracula's life, and he told me everything he knew about this monstrous character. It is possible that he is the infamous leader Dracula who went down in history for crossing the river to fight the Turks right at the border with Turkey. If that is indeed the case, then he is not an ordinary person, because in that century of war, and even in many centuries thereafter, people spoke a lot about him as the most talented, boldest, and bravest son of the ""land beyond the forest"". His extraordinary intelligence and unshakable willpower went with him to the grave, and now, he is using them against us. According to Arminius, the Dracula family belonged to a famous noble lineage, some members of which in subsequent generations had dubious relations with the devil. They began to establish schools and preach their occult magic at Scholomance, a place in the mountains by Lake Hermannstadt, where the devil trained one out of ten disciples to become like him. There are many documents that refer to this being with names like stregoica: meaning witch; ordog: Satan; pokol: hell. And one of those documents mentioned our Count Dracula as a vampir - that is, ""vampire"", whose characteristics are exactly what we have come to understand so well. Dracula is the seed that created numerous other notorious male and female figures who, even in their graves, always considered this earth as the only possible dwelling place for evil...",7.194,6.517,"Therefore, when we learn the resting place of what was once human, if we adhere to what we know, we can imprison it in its coffin and destroy it. But it is clever. I asked my friend Arminius from the University of Budapest about its past, and he used all his resources to tell me what it was like in the past. Indeed, it must be Vlad the Impaler, Dracula, who earned his name fighting against the Turks on the great river at the border of Turkish lands. If so, then he is no ordinary person, because it was said that during those times and in the following centuries, he was the smartest, most cunning person and also the bravest of the sons of the 'land beyond the forest.' This great mind and steel-like determination went to the grave with him, and even now they stand against us. According to Arminius, the Draculas were a great and noble race, believed by their contemporaries to have dealings with the devil from time to time. They learned the secrets of the Devil at Scholomance, located among the mountains over the lake in Hermannstadt, which the tenth scholar of the devil claimed as his right. The records contain words like stregoica, meaning witch, ordog and pokol, meaning Devil and Hell, and in one of these manuscripts, Dracula is referred to as a wampyr - which we all understand very well what it means. From these seeds came great men, good women, and their graves sanctify the soil where only this evil can live. Because the fact that this evil is found at the root of all goodness is not the least terrifying aspect, it cannot find peace in the soil where sacred memories do not reside.""",18.168,17.755,"""Thus, when we find the place where that man from the past resides, we can make him remain in his coffin and destroy him, if we use all our knowledge on the matter. But he is intelligent. I asked my friend Arminius, from the University of Budapest, to give me information to establish his profile and, by all means at his disposal, he communicated what he knew to me. In fact, it must be the Voivode of Dracula who earned his nobility fighting against the Turks, over the great river that lies on the very border of Turkish lands. If so, then he was not an ordinary man; because in that time and for several centuries afterward, he was spoken of as the most intelligent and wise, as well as the bravest of the sons of the ""land beyond the forests."" That powerful brain and that iron resolution accompanied him to the grave and now confront us. The Draculas were, according to Arminius, a great and noble family; although, from time to time, there were offspring who, according to their contemporaries, had dealings with the evil one. They learned their secrets at the Scholomance, among the mountains above Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claimed the tenth student as his own. In the records, there are words like..., sorcerer, and... Satan and hell; and in a manuscript, this very Dracula is spoken of as a ""wampyr,"" which we all understand perfectly. From that family emerged many great men and women, and their graves consecrated the land where only this evil being can dwell. For it is not the least of his horrors that this evil being is rooted in all good things, but that he cannot rest in soil that has holy relics.""",32.303,32.076

There was an unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own existing sanity. “I appeal to your friends,” he said, “they will, perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have not introduced me.” I was so much astonished, that the oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and, besides, there was a certain dignity in the man’s manner, so much of the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: “Lord Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr. Renfield.” He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:—","Indeed, Renfield was very agitated, but I had never seen him so clear-headed and calm in his manner of speaking to me.

He claimed that he was now completely recovered and no longer had the slightest mental disorder. ""I will talk to your friends,"" he said, ""who knows, they might have a good assessment of my current state. By the way, you haven't introduced me to them yet...” I was so stunned that I forgot that introducing others to an inmate in my asylum was not a very usual thing to do, but honestly, at this moment, Renfield had something about him that deserved to be treated with the social courtesies of everyday life.

He supported this with arguments that he was completely cured and presented his current sanity as evidence. “I appeal to your friends,” he said; “perhaps they will not hesitate to judge my case. In the meantime, you have not introduced us.” I was so surprised that the oddity of introducing an inmate of a mental hospital did not occur to me at that moment; moreover, there was a kind of dignity in the man's manner, as if he were equal to the others, and so I immediately performed the introductions: “Lord Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris from Texas; Mr. Renfield.” He shook hands with each and said: “Lord Godalming, I had the honor of testifying for your father in Windham, and I am saddened to understand from your holding the title that he is no longer alive.",28.242,27.917,"We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but much more reasonable in his way of speaking and his manners than I had ever seen him before.

It is possible that they would not mind sitting down to examine my case. By the way, you have not introduced me to them.

The power of Treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter, conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties. And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances.” He made this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own charm.","— Lord Godalming, in Windham, I had the honor of assisting your father, and I am deeply sorry that he is no longer with us, now you bear his title. He was always respected and loved by everyone who knew him. I heard that in his youth, he invented a type of punch that was very popular among connoisseurs in Derby. Mr. Morris, you have many reasons to be proud of your great state. The annexation of Texas into the Union set a precedent, resulting in significant outcomes, as other states also wish to join under the Star-Spangled Banner. One can easily recognize the strength of the Union Treaty when the Monroe Doctrine gains a real foothold as a political agreement. How can I express my honor in meeting Professor Van Helsing? It is truly remiss of me not to have inquired about you with the usual courtesies. When someone revolutionizes diagnostic methods through discoveries about the continuous development of the human brain, all ordinary forms of politeness are altered, for if such courtesies were applied to oneself, it might seem as though one wishes to diminish the positions of others. All of you here, either by nationality, inheritance, or by nature's own favor, hold a place in our wildly spinning world. Let me give an example: I am as physically and mentally sound as the vast majority of those who are entirely free out there. Dr. Seward, I absolutely believe that as a very kind scholar, who has studied law as well as practiced medicine, you will understand that thoroughly re-examining my case is a moral duty of yours. Speaking the last sentences, he tried to put on an act, showing himself to be very confident and no less polite towards me.",13.677,13.246,"He shook hands with each and said: “Lord Godalming, I had the honor of testifying for your father in Windham, and I am saddened to understand from your holding the title that he is no longer alive.

Mr. Morris, you must be proud of your great state. The admission of your state to the union will serve as a significant example when the Polar and Tropical Regions are also bound to the United States Flag. When the Monroe Doctrine takes its rightful place among political truths, the Treaty will prove to be a very broad instrument of growth. What can one say about the happiness of meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I do not apologize for not using traditional prefixes. When an individual revolutionizes the science of treatment by discovering the constant evolution of the brain, traditional forms become inappropriate, as they seem to limit that person to being a member of a certain class. I want to testify that I am at least as sane as the majority of those who, like you gentlemen, are fully entitled to the freedoms of holding respectable positions in a dynamic world due to your nationality, hereditary traits, or natural talents. And I am sure that, besides being a scientist, you, Dr. Seward, who is also a humane person and a forensic expert, will consider it a moral duty to treat me as someone under special circumstances.

When an individual has revolutionized therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of cerebral matter, traditional forms are not appropriate, as they would give the impression of limiting him to a specific class. To you, gentlemen, who by nationality, heritage, or natural gifts, are destined to occupy your respective places in the moving world, I take you as witnesses that I am as sane as, at least, the majority of men who are in full possession of their freedom. And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanist and forensic physician, as well as scientist, will consider it a moral duty to treat me as someone who must be considered under exceptional circumstances.” He made this final plea with an air of conviction that did not lack its own charm.",44.842,44.666
1324,"I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the conviction, despite my knowledge of the man’s character and history, that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable. So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said quickly:—","I think that even though my friends have never had a chance to interact with Renfield like I have, they are also very surprised. As for myself, despite knowing about the stages of his illness, I still believe that he is clearly trying to justify his intentions. Honestly, I just want to tell him that his condition has indeed made good progress and I will complete all the procedures so that he can be discharged tomorrow morning. But recalling his sudden and erratic changes, I want to do the opposite, I want to advise him to think carefully before making such an important decision. Therefore, I have to tell him that his condition is improving day by day, and I will talk to him more tomorrow morning, after which I will make a specific decision regarding his request. He seemed dissatisfied with my answer, as I saw him retort immediately:",5.503,4.129,"I think we were all taken aback. For my part, despite my knowledge of the man's personality and history, I was of the opinion that he had come to his senses and felt a strong urge to say that I was convinced he was in his right mind and that I would handle the necessary discharge procedures in the morning. But I thought it would be better to wait before making such a serious statement, because from the past, I knew the sudden changes this patient was prone to. Therefore, I contented myself with making a general statement that he was making rapid progress and said that I would have a longer conversation with him in the morning and then see what I could do to fulfill his wishes. This did not satisfy him at all, because he immediately said:",33.666,33.19,"I think we were all astonished. For my part, I was convinced, despite knowing the man's character and history, that he had regained his sanity, and I felt compelled to tell him that I was satisfied regarding his sanity and that I would do everything necessary to release him from the asylum the next day. However, I thought it preferable to wait before making such a serious statement, since I had long been aware of the sudden changes that this particular patient experienced. Thus, I contented myself with making a statement to the effect that he seemed to be healing very quickly; that I would have a long conversation with him in the morning, and that I would then decide what could be done to satisfy his wishes. That did not satisfy him at all, as he hastened to say:",29.71,29.162
1325,"“But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to go at once—here—now—this very hour—this very moment, if I may. Time presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.” He looked at me keenly, and seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:—","— But doctor, I'm afraid you still don't understand me. What I want is to go home immediately, right now... right this moment, as I'm speaking, if possible. Time is very urgent, and time is the most crucial factor in our implicit agreement with Death. I think it would be best if you go ahead and do what you just mentioned. He stared at me intently as if waiting, seeing that I showed no sign of agreement, he turned to plead with someone else. Not receiving any answer, even just a nod, he pressed on:",4.388,2.579,"“But I am afraid, Dr. Seward, that you did not understand my wish very well. I wish to leave as soon as possible - right now - at this very moment, if possible. Time is running out, and this is the essence of the contract in our implicit agreement with the old reaper. I am sure that presenting such a simple, yet at the same time so important, wish to a good doctor like Dr. Seward ensures that it will be fulfilled.” He looked at me sternly, and upon seeing the negative expression on my face, he turned to the others and examined them carefully. Not finding a sufficient response, he continued:",27.431,26.721,"–But, I fear, Dr. Seward, that you have not understood what my desire is. I wish to leave now… Immediately…, at this very moment…, without waiting another minute, if possible. Time is pressing, and in our implicit agreement with the old Scythian, that is the essence of the contract. I am sure that it is enough to communicate to such an admirable doctor as Dr. Seward a desire so simple yet so impulsive, to ensure that it is fulfilled. He looked at me intelligently and, seeing the refusal on my face, turned to the others and examined them closely. Not finding a sufficiently favorable reaction, he continued saying:",32.167,31.56

1327,"“You have,” I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally. There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:—","— That's right, you were wrong, and very wrong at that. - I replied bluntly. He remained silent for a long time, then leisurely continued:",7.748,4.27,"“Yes,” I said plainly, but at the same time, I felt like a savage. There was a considerable silence, and then he slowly said:",46.965,45.2,"–That's right, I told him frankly, but at the same time, as I immediately realized, with brutality. There was a rather long pause, and then he said slowly:",54.244,52.953
1328,"“Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for this concession—boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look, sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of your friends.” Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it afterwards—for it was as of one addressing an equal:—","— If that's the case, then perhaps I must make another request of you. This time, I would like to ask everyone to make a concession for me, to grant me a favor or a priority, as you would put it. This time, I beg you not for my own personal motives, but for the happiness of others. I don't have much time to explain to you all the reasons that compel me to implore you, but please believe that they are valid, undeniable reasons, and completely devoid of any personal gain. I am inspired by the noble meaning of the duty that I feel I must fulfill. Doctor, if you could read the thoughts from the bottom of my heart, you would surely fully support the sentiments driving me. And you might even consider me one of your closest and most loyal friends. Finishing his words, he once again cast a scrutinizing glance at all of us. At this moment, I began to suspect that his sudden change in behavior was merely another form, or more precisely, another phase of his madness. And I told myself that I needed to wait and see what would happen, because with the many years of experience I had accumulated with madmen, I understood that his illness was about to relapse. I didn't understand what Van Helsing was thinking, because from earlier until now he had been frowning while observing him from head to toe. Suddenly, he asked him in a tone that, at first, I found unremarkable, but later, upon reflection, I sensed something peculiar. Clearly, he was regarding him as a completely sane person rather than a mental patient:",8.681,8.113,"“Then I must only change the basis of my request. Let me ask you for this privilege -kindness, favor, whatever you call it. In such a case, I am willing to plead not for personal reasons, but for the good of others. I am not free to present all my reasons to you, but I assure you, you can believe that they are good, rational, and selfless reasons, and that they stem from the highest sense of duty. If you could look into my heart, sir, you would approve of all the feelings that drive me. Moreover, you would count me among your best and truest friends.” He looked at us again with piercing eyes. I had begun to believe that this sudden change in his entire mental approach was another form or phase of his madness; therefore, from past experiences, knowing that like all madmen he would eventually reveal himself, I decided to let him continue speaking a little longer. Van Helsing was looking at him with great attention; his brush-like eyebrows almost merging with the intensity of his gaze. In a tone that did not surprise me at the time, but later did when I thought about it -because it was as if he was addressing an equal- he said to Renfield:",30.7,30.358,"–Then, I suppose I will have to change only the way I have formulated my request. Let me beg you for that concession..., gift, privilege, whatever you want to call it. In such a case, I am happy to implore, not for personal reasons, but for the love of others. I am not at liberty to provide you with all my reasons, but you can, I assure you, take my word that they are good, sound, and unselfish, and that they stem from a high sense of duty. If you could look into my heart, sir, you would wholeheartedly approve of the feelings that motivate me. Furthermore, you would count me among your best and most sincere friends. He looked at us anxiously again. I was increasingly convinced that his sudden change in intellectual method was merely another form or phase of his madness and, therefore, I decided to let him talk a little more, knowing from experience that, in the end, like all lunatics, he would reveal himself. Van Helsing was observing him with a look of extraordinary intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost touching each other due to the fixed concentration of his gaze. He spoke to Renfield in a tone that did not surprise me at the moment, but did when I thought about it later... since it was that of someone addressing an equal:",34.472,34.175

I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me—a stranger, without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind—Dr. Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the privilege you seek.” He shook his head sadly, and with a look of poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:—","— Can you not explain to us why you want to leave here tonight? I am sure that you are not hiding anything from me. I say that I, a foreigner who always tries to understand everything and has no prejudice against you: then surely Dr. Seward will be responsible for letting you out of the hospital. He shook his head sadly. Seeing his expression, I knew he was regretting something. The professor, not showing any concern for his despondency, continued speaking:",9.854,8.375,“Won't you honestly tell me the real reason you want to be free tonight? If you can satisfy even me -a stranger with a habit of being unbiased and open-minded- I promise that Dr. Seward will take the risk and responsibility upon himself and grant you the privilege you seek.” Renfield shook his head sorrowfully with a sad expression on his face. The professor continued his words:,20.667,19.446,"–Can you not frankly tell us what your reasons are for wanting to leave the asylum tonight? I am sure that if you wish to satisfy even me, who am an unprejudiced foreigner and accustomed to accepting all kinds of ideas, Dr. Seward will grant you, under his responsibility, the privilege you desire. Renfield shook his head sadly and with an expression of immense feeling. The professor continued saying:",15.698,14.132

Be wise, and help us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.” He still shook his head as he said:—","— So, my friend? Just think it over carefully. You say that you have recovered, you want to prove to us that your mind has returned to normal, but we still have doubts because you haven't done anything to prove it. If you don't help us in this test, how can Dr. Seward agree with you?

If you do not help us in our effort to choose the wisest path, how can we fulfill the task you have assigned to us? Be smart and help us; we, in turn, will help you achieve your wish if we can.""

I can only ask you to trust me.

Your argument is indeed irrefutable, if it were just for me, I certainly wouldn't hesitate to tell you, but because I am not the only one involved in this matter. I can only ask you to trust me.

1333,"As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing, and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised, for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:—","However, just as I was about to open the door, the patient's demeanor suddenly changed. He rushed towards me, causing me to cry out in alarm, thinking he intended to kill me again. But I was mistaken; he merely extended both hands, urgently repeating his request to me. Although it seemed he understood that such pleading was a bit excessive, he became increasingly desperate and earnest. Yet, I still firmly refused his request, pushing him back and telling him not to waste his time. This wasn't the first time I had seen him humble himself to the utmost when he wanted to immediately obtain a favor he deemed crucial, such as the day he begged me to bring him a cat. Just like that day, I thought he would eventually accept my refusal, despite his seemingly indifferent attitude. But this time, he did not. Seeing that his requests to me were in vain, he began to go mad. He knelt down on the ground, raised his hands before me, and bowed repeatedly, hoping to appeal to my compassion. Tears streaming down his face, his expression utterly miserable, he continued his lengthy speech to me.",3.91,3.087,"But as I approached the door, there was a new change in the patient. He came at me with such speed that I feared, at that moment, he would attempt murder again. But my fears were unfounded, because he extended both hands in supplication and demonstrated his plea through action. When he saw that the intensity of his emotions, by rekindling our past relations, was working against him, he became even more emotional. I looked at Van Helsing and saw my view reflected in his eyes; therefore, in my demeanor, I became a bit more resolute, if not more stubborn, and indicated that his efforts were in vain. I had previously seen the same, ever-growing excitement when he was about to make a request he had long pondered, as when he wanted a cat; this time, I was ready to see the same gloomy acceptance. My expectation did not come true, because when he realized his plea would not succeed, he went mad. He threw himself on his knees, raised his hands in a tearful plea, tears streaming down his cheeks, and his entire face and body expressing his deepest emotions, he poured out a torrent of supplication:",22.574,22.214,"However, when I approached the door, a new change occurred in the patient.

Seeing that the very excess of his emotion worked against him, making us revert to our old ideas, he became even more demonstrative.

I had previously seen part of the same emotion that was constantly growing when he directed some request at me that, at those moments, meant a lot to him, such as, for example, when he wanted a cat; and I expected to witness the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion. What I expected did not happen, since, when he realized that his plea was in vain, he became quite frantic.

1342,"1 October, 5 a. m.—I went with the party to the search with an easy mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work. Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward:—","• October 1, 5 AM I, along with everyone else, went to Carfax House in a very relaxed state of mind, as I had never seen Mina so healthy and confident. If she were to directly participate in our work, she would likely find it hard to avoid nightmares, but fortunately, she now agrees to let us act on our own, so I am somewhat relieved. Moreover, I hope she is thinking that she has already done what needed to be done: all the smallest details have been gathered, and if they are useful to us, isn't it thanks to her effort and intelligence? I believe that all of us were haunted after visiting Renfield. From the moment we left his room, none of us spoke a word to each other. It was only when we returned to Seward's office that I heard Morris speak:",3.392,1.994,"October 1st, 5 AM. - I joined the search with the group with peace of mind, because I think I have never seen Mina so strong and well before. I am very pleased that she agreed to stay behind and let us men do the work. For some reason, it was horrifying for me to have her involved in this dreadful task, but now that her duty is over and thanks to her energy, intellect, and foresight, the whole story has been brought together in a way that every point is explained, she can understand that her role is over and she can now leave the remaining work to us. I think we were all shaken up because of the scene we experienced with Mr. Renfield. When we left his room, we didn't speak until we returned to the study. Then Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward: “Tell me Jack, if that man wasn't bluffing, he is almost the sanest madman I've ever seen until today.",27.432,26.963,"October 1st, at five in the morning. I left with the group to carry out the investigation with a calm mind, because I believe I had never seen Mina so firm and so well. I am very glad that she agreed to step aside and let us men take charge of the work. In a way, it was like a nightmare for me that she was involved in such a terrible matter, but now that her work is done and it is due to her energy and intelligence, as well as her foresight, that the whole story has been gathered, in such a way that every detail has meaning, she can rightfully feel that she has already done her part and that, from now on, she can let us take care of the rest. I think we were all a bit upset by the scene that had taken place with Mr. Renfield. When we left his room, we all kept silent until we returned to the study. Once there, Mr. Morris said, addressing Dr. Seward:",26.979,26.524

I’m not sure, but I believe that he had some serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a chance.” Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:—","— John, if Renfield isn't a fraud, then he is the most rational madman I have ever seen! I don't dare to make hasty judgments, but it seems like he is seriously contemplating something, so you should keep an eye on him! I and Lord Godalming did not notice anything remarkable, but Dr. Van Helsing was different; he said:",13.526,11.754,"Then Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward: “Tell me Jack, if that man wasn't bluffing, he is almost the sanest madman I've ever seen until today.

But we live and learn, and in our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say. All is best as they are.” Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of way:—","— My friend John, I am truly delighted to see that you understand the stages of mental illness in patients better than I do, because if it were up to me to make the decision, I might have released Renfield right before he became so agitated. But up until now, the more we understand what concerns us, as our friend Quincey has said, we cannot afford to act recklessly when the task we are undertaking is extremely dangerous. Everything is unfolding in the sequence it is meant to. It seems that Dr. Seward intended to answer both people at the same time:",8.34,6.57,"“My friend John, you know more lunatics than I do and for that I am glad, but I fear, if it had been up to me, I would have released him before that final outburst where he lost control.

1345,"“I don’t know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can’t forget how he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count ‘lord and master,’ and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way. That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him, so I suppose he isn’t above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand, help to unnerve a man.” The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:—","— That's exactly right. If he were like many other patients, I wouldn't hesitate to show him that I trust him very much. But in this case, his behavior seems to depend a lot on the movements of the old count. If I let him go without paying attention to his erratic temperament, I would be making an unforgivable mistake. Once, standing in front of me, he kept babbling, calling the old count “My Lord” and “His Master.” I suspect he might be preparing to help Dracula carry out some demonic mission, this demon who can command wolves and filthy rats, not to mention other entities just like him: so how could he not think of making a madman obey him? Yes, it seems that Renfield was speaking very seriously, I realized that even though I also know very well about his illness. I hope we are doing the right thing. But this is happening just as we are conducting our mournful searches, so I fear it will dampen everyone's spirits. The professor smiled, walked over, patted Seward on the shoulder, and reassured him:",3.501,2.445,"“I won't be able to do anything except say that I agree with you.

I cannot forget how he begged with almost the same fervor to get a cat and then tried to tear my throat with his teeth. Moreover, he refers to the Count as 'My Lord' and 'Master' and might want to get out of here to help him in some diabolical way. That dreadful thing has wolves, rats, and his own kind to help him, so I don't think he would hesitate to use a respectable lunatic. Still, it is true that he seems sincere.

Moreover, he called the count ""lord and master"" and it is possible that he wishes to go out to help him in some diabolical plan. That horrible thing has wolves, rats, and its kind to help it, so I suppose it is capable of using a poor lunatic. However, it is true that he seemed sincere. It is only unfortunate that we have done the best we could in this case. Those things, along with the hard work that awaits us, are enough to affect a man's nerves.

Therefore, it's better to be a bit cautious. Wear this on your chest - he handed me a small cross, as I was the one standing closest to him - and this garland too - he handed me a garland of dried garlic to wear around my neck. - Take this handgun and knife as well, we still don't know if there are any other enemies.

Presently he got one to suit; after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in Dr. Seward’s diary of the opening of Miss Westenra’s tomb; I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they shrank back.

Which is the way to the chapel?” I had an idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands. “This is the spot,” said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified its loathsomeness.","— Jonathan, you are the one who knows this house better than anyone else. You have the blueprints of the house, or at least copies of them, and you have surely spent a lot of time studying them. So, do you still remember where the altar of this house is located? Of course, I know very well where the church is located, even though on my first visit to this house, I didn't have the chance to go inside. I led everyone through a few winding corridors, arriving at an oak door with an arch above it. — This is it! - The professor said as he shone the light to inspect the copy of the map that I had used when purchasing the house. He had to try a bunch of keys before he found one that fit the lock. We were waiting for something very unpleasant to happen. Indeed, as soon as the door was slightly ajar, a strong stench immediately wafted out, making us instantly imagine the disgusting air we would have to breathe when stepping inside. Except for me, no one in the group has seen the old count yet. As for myself, when I saw him, he was either lurking somewhere in his dusty rooms or fully engorged with blood in an almost outdoor dilapidated house. But the place where we are standing now is completely cramped and sealed off, with a stifling atmosphere that seems to have been there for ages. I could smell the earth, and increasingly felt a pervasive stench filling the air. I really don't know how to describe the true nature of that foul odor. Not only were all the evils that cause death in the world gathered there, but it seemed as if decay itself was transforming to create this hell. Just thinking about it is enough to make me sick!

We found the key in the bunch without much trouble and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasant situations, because as the door opened, it seemed as if a slight, foul smell was coming from the gap, but none of us expected to encounter such a smell when we faced it. None of the others had encountered the Count this closely, and I had seen him either in his room during his hunger phase or in an open, ruined building in the pleasure of fresh blood, but here the room was small and airless, and its long disuse had made the air foul and malodorous. From the even worse smelling air came a dry, germy, earthy smell. But as for the smell itself, how can I describe it? It not only consisted of every kind of ailment of mortality and the sharp, acrid smell of blood, but also, as if decay itself had decayed. Ah! Thinking about it makes me sick.

None of the others had found the count in their vicinity, and when I had seen him, he was either in his rapid existence in the rooms or, when he was full of fresh blood, in a ruined building, open to the sky, where fresh air could penetrate; but here, the place was small and enclosed, and the long time it had remained undiscovered made the air stagnant and smell rotten. There was a smell of earth, like that of some dry miasma, that stood out from the stale air. But, as for the smell itself, how could one describe it? It wasn't just that it was composed of all the evils of mortality and the acrid, penetrating smell of blood, but it gave the impression that corruption itself had rotted. Oh! I feel sick just remembering it. Every time that monster had breathed, its breath seemed to have stagnated in that place, intensifying its repugnance.",33.136,32.927
1354,"Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.","Perhaps in other situations, just thinking like that would have made us give up already. But before us was an important and significant goal, to the extent that we had to overcome the most disgusting obstacles. After standing still and reflexively jumping back, we suddenly remembered our task and had to view this place as a rose garden.",4.4,2.464,"Under ordinary circumstances, such a foul smell would have ended our endeavor, but this was no ordinary case, and the sacred, dreadful purpose we were involved in gave us a power that overcame mere physical factors. After the involuntary first breath that made us nauseous, we all set to work as if that disgusting place were a rose garden.",25.721,24.455,"Under ordinary circumstances, such a smell would have put an end to our endeavor, but this was no ordinary case, and the lofty and terrible task we were engaged in gave us strength that overcame physical considerations.

There could be no mistake!",4.021,2.263,"“The first task is to see how many crates are left; the next task is to examine every hole, corner, and nook to see if we can find any clues about what happened to the other crates.” A single glance was enough to see how many were left because the large earthen crates were very big, and it was impossible to be mistaken about this.",15.558,13.536,"–First of all, we need to see how many boxes are left; next, we should examine all the corners, holes, and crevices to see if we can find any indication of what happened to the others.

1357,"There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright, for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to see the high lights of the Count’s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for, as Lord Godalming said, “I thought I saw a face, but it was only the shadows,” and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction, and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for him. I took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.","The total number according to the documents was fifty crates, but here there were only twenty-nine! While counting, I was startled and frightened when Lord Godalming suddenly turned to check the slightly ajar door leading to a dark hallway. My heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest. I had the feeling that the Count's piercing eyes were looking through the seemingly tangible darkness, and I imagined beneath those eyes was a hooked nose, red plump lips standing out on an always pale face... About a minute later, Lord Godalming returned, muttering: ""I thought it was some damned person, but it turned out to be just some silly shadows."" I carefully shone the light towards the door and into the hallway, but clearly, there was no one there. There were no corners, no hidden doors, nor any crevices, just walls thickly covered in dust. I had to check to make sure there was no place inside where someone could hide - not even him. Fear had turned me into a victim of my own imagination. However, who would be foolish enough to mention this?",9.287,8.514,"Only twenty-nine of the coffins were there. At one point, I was startled because Lord Godalming suddenly turned and looked into the dark corridor extending beyond the arched doorway; I looked too, and for a moment, my heart stopped. Somewhere, when I focused on the shadow, it seemed to me that I saw the prominent features of the Count's demonic face, the protrusion of his nose, his red eyes, his red lips, his terrifying pallor. This lasted only a moment because Lord Godalming said, ""I thought I saw a face, but it was only a shadow,"" and when he returned to his examination, I turned my lamp in that direction and entered the corridor. There was no sign of anyone; there couldn't have been a place for anyone to hide because there were no corners, doors, or gaps, only the solid walls of the corridor. I concluded that fear had aided my imagination and said nothing.",28.394,27.951,"Only twenty-nine remained, out of fifty! At one point, I got quite a scare, as seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look through the entrance door towards the dark passageway beyond, I also looked and, for an instant, it seemed to me that I saw the most notable features of the Count's evil face: the pointed nose, the reddish eyes, the red lips, and the terrible pallor. That happened only for the space of a second, as Lord Godalming summarized: –I thought I had seen a face, but it was just the shadows. And he went back to dedicating himself to his research. I turned my lamp in that direction and headed towards the passageway. There were no signs of anyone's presence, and since there were no doors, no corners, no openings of any kind, only the solid walls of the passageway, there could be no hiding place, not even for him. I supposed that fear had fueled the imagination, and I said nothing.",30.098,29.623
1358,"A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which he was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.","A few minutes later, while glancing around to check a corner of the church, Morris suddenly jumped back in panic. We were startled and all eyes turned towards him. Cold sweat ran down my body as I caught a glimpse of flickering lights, like phosphorescent glows, darting past in front of me. We instinctively stepped back. In the blink of an eye, countless rats were scurrying chaotically in the abandoned church.",7.677,5.695,"A few minutes later, I saw Morris suddenly pull back from a corner he was examining. We all watched his movements with our eyes, because undoubtedly a kind of unease was descending upon all of us, and we saw a pile of phosphorescence shining like a star. Instinctively, we all pulled back. The entire place was coming alive with rats.",38.231,37.143,"A few minutes later, I saw Morris suddenly back away from the corner he was examining. All of us followed his movements with our eyes, because, undoubtedly, a certain nervousness was taking hold of us, and we saw a phosphorescent mass flickering like stars. Instinctively, we all backed away. The whole place was becoming populated with rats.",39.19,38.082
1359,"For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside, and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered from behind Dr. Seward’s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house. Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.","The scene before us truly terrified us. Only Lord Godalming remained calm as if he had anticipated the event. He quickly rushed to the oak door, unlatched it, flung it open, and blew a single note on a silver whistle. Hearing the whistle's wheezing sound like a sick cat, the dogs behind the asylum barked loudly, filling the area with noise. About a minute later, three hunting dogs immediately ran around the corner of the abandoned house. We instinctively stepped back. As we backed near the door, I noticed that the dust here had also been trampled by many footprints: surely the missing wooden crates had been moved through this way. But that was also when another swarm of rats suddenly rushed in to join the previous group, creating a chaotic and horrifying scene before our eyes. They swarmed all over the church with their chilling squeaks, each one with eyes glowing like fireflies on the ground. The aggressive dogs tried to leap in, but for some reason, as soon as they reached the threshold, they all suddenly halted, growling and howling like wolves. The swarm of rats, easily numbering in the thousands, continued their frenzied rampage inside the church. We frantically leaped out the door.",8.549,7.843,"For a moment, all of us were struck with horror, except for Lord Godalming, who seemed prepared for such an emergency. Dr. Seward ran to the iron-embossed oak door he had described and I had seen from the outside, turned the key in the lock, pulled the large bolt, and opened the door. Then, he took a small silver whistle from his pocket and blew a low, sharp note. This sound was answered by barking dogs from behind Dr. Seward's house, and within a minute, three terriers came running around the corner of the house. Unconsciously, we all walked towards the door, and as we moved, I noticed that the dust was greatly disturbed: the boxes that had been taken out were carried through this way. But in that one minute, the number of rats had greatly increased. The light of the lamp shining on their dark bodies and bright, sinister eyes made the place look like a mound of earth adorned with fireflies as they swarmed there quickly. The dogs ran quickly, but suddenly stopped at the threshold of the door, growled, and then simultaneously lifted their noses and began to bark sharply. The number of rats was increasing by the thousands, and we went outside.",30.444,30.096,"For a moment we remained motionless, astonished, all except Lord Godalming who, apparently, was prepared for a similar contingency. Rushing towards the heavy oak door with iron bands, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, removed the enormous bolts, and flung the door open. Then, taking a silver whistle from his pocket, he blew it slowly and sharply. From behind Dr. Seward's house, the barking of several dogs responded, and a minute later, three terriers came running around one of the corners of the house. Unconsciously, we had all turned towards the door and, in doing so, saw that a lot of dust had been stirred up; the boxes that had been taken out had been taken out through there. But even in the single minute that had passed, the number of rats had increased greatly. They seemed to appear in the room all at once, to the point that the light from the lamps, reflecting off their dark, moving bodies and shining on their malevolent eyes, made the whole room seem filled with fireflies. The dogs appeared quickly, but at the threshold of the door, they suddenly stopped and sniffed; then, simultaneously, they raised their heads and began to howl in an extremely mournful manner. The rats were multiplying by the thousands, and we left the room.",34.9,34.623
1360,"Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished.","Lord Godalming grabbed a dog and threw it into the church. As soon as its feet touched the ground, the hunting dog immediately regained its inherent courage and began mercilessly slaughtering its arch-enemies. In the blink of an eye, it had killed more than twenty rats, but in that same amount of time, the rats had scattered, fleeing so quickly that they left no chance for the two other dogs that had just entered the church. The sudden disappearance of the rats made us feel as if the devil had just retreated.",6.982,5.206,"Lord Godalming picked up one of the dogs and carried it inside, laying it down on the ground. As soon as the dog's feet touched the ground, it seemed to regain its former courage and leapt at its natural enemies. The rats fled so quickly from the dogs that the first dog to enter took the lives of twenty, and when the other dogs were brought in the same way, there was only a small group of rats left to hunt.",13.303,11.561,"Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs and, carrying it inside the room, gently placed it on the floor. The very moment its paws touched the ground, it seemed to regain its courage and rushed at its natural enemies. The rats fled before him with such speed that before he had finished with a considerable number, the other dogs, which had been transported to the center of the room in the same way, had few prey to catch, since the entire mass of rats had vanished.",25.915,24.92
1361,"With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise. Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit. Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.","The dogs were still bustling around the house, tails wagging as if they were very pleased with their recent victory. They seemed to take great pleasure in looking at the corpses of the unlucky rats on the floor. We felt as if we had just been infused with courage. It was unclear whether it was due to the appearance of the hunting dogs, the release of the stifling atmosphere in the room when the church doors were flung open, or the sigh of relief we felt when we realized we were no longer trapped, but in any case, the heavy threat weighing on us was somewhat lifted, much like shedding a filthy, uncomfortable garment. With the rats gone, we locked the church doors again, bolted them, chained them, and began to search the entire house. There was nothing special except for the dust, which covered all the remaining rooms thickly, and notably, there were no human footprints except for those I had left during my previous visit to handle the brokerage procedures. The dogs showed no particular signs, even when we returned to the church. They just ran around as if they were hunting hares on a beautiful day.",7.443,6.622,"With their departure, it seemed as if the evil presence had also left, for the dogs wagged their tails and barked joyfully as they made sudden attacks on their weakened enemies, flipping them over and shaking them violently before tossing them into the air. It seemed as if all our spirits had lifted. I don't know if it was the opening of the chapel door that cleared the deadly air or the relief of finding ourselves in the open, but the shadow of great fear had certainly flowed away from us like a veil, and although our resolve had not diminished in the slightest, the dreadful significance of our reason for coming here had somewhat lessened. We closed, bolted, and locked the outer door, and began to search the house with the dogs by our side. We found nothing except an extraordinary amount of dust, and nothing had been disturbed except my own footprints from my first visit. The dogs did not show a single sign of unease, and even when we returned to the chapel, they wagged their tails as if they were hunting rabbits in the forest during the summer.",23.189,22.689,"With its disappearance, it seemed that something diabolical had ceased to be present, since the dogs began to frolic and bark joyfully, while they rushed upon their prostrate enemies, shook them, and sent them into the air with fierce jerks. All of us felt emboldened. Whether it was due to the purification of the atmosphere of death, because we had opened the chapel door, or the relief we felt upon finding ourselves at the opening, I do not know; but the fact is that the shadow of fear seemed to abandon us, as if it were a shroud, and the occasion of our visit to the house lost part of its grim significance, although we did not lose our resolve at all. We closed the outer door, barred it, and slid the bolts; then, taking the dogs with us, we began to search the house. We found nothing but large amounts of dust, and everything seemed to have been untouched, except for the trace of my footsteps from my first visit. The dogs showed no signs of uneasiness at any time, and even when we returned to the chapel, they continued to frolic, as if they were hunting rabbits in the forest on a summer night.",23.899,23.502

Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket when he had done.","When we went out the gate of the house, it was also when a new day was about to begin. Van Helsing carefully locked the door and put the key in his pocket. I do not know when he removed this key from the key ring in the house. — Good! - He said. -",9.542,7.197,"When we stepped out the door, the day was coming to life from the east.

1363,"“So far,” he said, “our night has been eminently successful. No harm has come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our first—and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous—step has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have learned, if it be allowable to argue a particulari: that the brute beasts which are to the Count’s command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mother’s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster—he has not used his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night. So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity to cry ‘check’ in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand, and we have reason to be content with our first night’s work. It may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril; but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.”","So our investigation tonight went smoothly! We now know how many wooden crates were transported. Moreover, we didn't have to face any danger as I had feared. But what makes me happiest is that we completed the first step of our work without Mina's involvement, so she won't be haunted by nightmares from the church earlier. Furthermore, this investigation also revealed something quite interesting to us, if not a definite conclusion about a completely different matter: the disgusting creatures under the Count's command do not always obey his pure psychic power. Just look at the rats, and you'll see they appear in droves at his command, just like when he summoned the wolves when you wanted to leave Dracula's castle, Jonathan, but then they immediately disappeared when they saw those little dogs! Indeed, we are only beginning to face a challenge. This is not the only time or the last time this demon will command the animal world with his power. He only temporarily disappeared before giving us a chance to cheer that ""he has failed!"" The game will be long. Now, let's go home. It's almost dawn. So today, we can be satisfied with our first night's work.",4.004,3.163,"“So far,” he said, “our night has been extremely successful. None of us have been harmed as I feared, and yet we have determined how many crates are missing. What pleases me even more is that our first - and perhaps most difficult and dangerous - step has been accomplished without disturbing our sweet Madam Mina with the terrifying sounds and smells that she would never forget, whether awake or asleep, before bringing her here. We have learned another lesson, if we can discuss it in particular: That is, these wild animals under the Count's command do not yet possess his spiritual power, because look, just like the wolves that appeared upon your departure from the castle or the ones that came out upon the poor mother's scream, these rats that came at his call, even if they came by his command, fled hastily from our friend Arthur's tiny dogs. There are other matters, other dangers, other fears ahead of us, and that monster - he did not use his power over animals for the first or last time tonight. Well, let him have gone somewhere else. Good! This situation has given us the opportunity to shout 'Check!' in this chess game we are playing for the human soul in some way. Let's go home now. Dawn is approaching, and we have reason to be pleased with our work on the first night. If it is full of dangers, we may have many more nights and days to follow, but we must continue and fear no danger.”",21.574,21.211,"–So far -he said-, the night has truly been a success for us. We have not received any harm, as we might have feared, and moreover, we have been able to ascertain how many boxes are missing. Above all, I am very glad that this first step we have taken, perhaps the most difficult and dangerous of all, we have been able to carry out without our sweet lady Mina accompanying us, and without the need to disturb her thoughts, all the more so since she would be awake and asleep thinking of visions, noises, and smells that she could never forget. Likewise, we have learned a lesson, if we can say it particularly: that the beasts that are at the count's orders are not, however, docile to the count's spirit, since those rats would come at his call, just as he called the wolves from the tower of his castle, to come out to meet him and that poor mother. Although the rats came, they fled a moment later in disorder, at the presence of our friend Arthur's little dogs. We have other matters, other dangers, and other fears ahead of us; and that monster has not used his powers over the animal world for the last or only time tonight. Whether he has gone somewhere else... Well! He has given us the opportunity to give ""check"" in this chess game we are playing in the name of the good of human souls. Now, let's go back home. Dawn is already near, and we have reasons to feel pleased with the work of our first night.

1365,"I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep dark over to-night’s doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.","I tiptoed back to the room. Mina was still deep in sleep, her breathing so slow and light that I had to lean in close to hear it. Only at this moment did I suddenly notice that she looked paler than usual. I hope yesterday's meeting didn't make her worry too much! Thankfully, she no longer participates in our investigations, searches, or decisions. She might get scared if she heard us discussing certain things. However, who knows if our keeping things from her might cause her even more distress if, at some point, she starts to suspect that we want her to stay silent about one thing or another. It is possible that in the near future, we will strive to ensure that you have absolutely no doubts about our decisions and work - at least until we can inform you that the bloodthirsty demon has been permanently eradicated from this earth. For me, keeping silent is not an easy task, especially when the two of us have the habit of sharing everything with each other. But I have decided, when she wakes up, I will definitely not tell her anything about what happened during the night. If she insists on asking, I will just mumble to brush it off. The sky was about to fully brighten, I tiptoed to lie down on the couch to avoid disturbing her sleep.",8.068,7.473,"When I tiptoed into our room, Mina was asleep; she was breathing so softly that I had to lean in to hear it.

I didn't think so at first, but now I understand better. Therefore, I am glad that it was decided this way. There might be things she would be afraid to hear; yet, if she suspects there is a secret, hiding it from her could be worse than telling it. From now on, our duty, at the very least, should be to remain a sealed book to her until the time comes when we can tell her that everything is over and the world is rid of a monster from hell. I think it will be hard to start keeping silent after the trust between us, but I will act decisively and tomorrow, I will not reveal any secrets about what happened tonight and will refuse to talk about it. I'm sleeping on the couch so as not to disturb her.",28.5,28.136,"I entered my room on tiptoe and found Mina asleep, breathing so softly that I had to strain my ears to catch the sound.

It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not think so at first, but now I know much better what to expect. Therefore, I am glad that this has been resolved. There may be things that would frighten her if she heard them; however, hiding them from her would be worse than revealing them, if she comes to suspect that there is something we are not telling her. From this moment on, we must be like closed books to her, at least until we can announce that everything is over and that the land has been freed from that monster of the darkness. I suppose it will be difficult to keep silent, due to the trust that reigns between us, but I must continue in my resolution and completely silence everything related to our actions during that night, refusing to speak of what has happened.

1366,"1 October, later.—I suppose it was natural that we should have all overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no rest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the sooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas Snelling to-day.","• October 1, a little later It's probably not unusual that we slept straight through until noon, because the whole day and night before, we hadn't had a moment to rest. Mina must have been very tired too, because I - the first one to wake up - had to shake her two or three times before she finally woke up. She slept so deeply that she didn't immediately realize there was someone in front of her. She looked at me bewildered and frightened, as if she had just gone through a terrible nightmare. Seeing her complain of fatigue, I told her to stay in bed for a few more minutes before getting up... Now, we know that twenty-one wooden crates have disappeared from the abandoned house. Therefore, I have to investigate where those missing crates have been taken. Today, I will go to Thomas Snelling's house.",7.714,6.876,"October 1, later. - I suppose it is natural for all of us to have slept more than usual, because the day had been intense and we had not rested at all during the night. Even Mina must have felt her exhaustion, for although I slept until the sun was up, I had risen before her and had to call her two or three times before she woke up. Indeed, she slept so deeply that for a few seconds she did not recognize me and looked at me with a kind of empty terror, as someone awakened from a bad dream might do. She complained of feeling a bit tired, and I allowed her to rest until later in the day. We now know that twenty-one crates have been moved, and if most of them were transported together in these operations, we can trace them. Such a situation, of course, will make our task easier, and the sooner the matter is resolved, the better. Today I will visit Thomas Snelling.",31.712,31.285,"October 1st, later. I suppose it is natural that we all slept until a late hour, as the day was filled with hard work and the night was heavy and sleepless. Even Mina must have felt the exhaustion, since, although I slept until the sun was very high, I woke up before her. In fact, she was so deeply asleep that for a few seconds she didn't even recognize me and looked at me with deep terror, as if she had been awakened in the middle of a terrible nightmare. She complained a bit about being tired and I let her rest until a later hour in the day. We now knew that twenty-one boxes had been removed, and in the event that several were taken at once, it was possible that we could find them. Of course, this would considerably simplify our work and the sooner we resolved this matter, the better it would be. I had to go see Thomas Snelling.",25.073,24.555

1368,"1 October.—It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it is quite evident that last night’s work has helped to take some of the brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said:—","• October 1 I woke up when it was almost noon. Van Helsing had been in my room for some time, but I didn't know when he arrived. He looked visibly cheerful, which was a rare sight for him. Perhaps what we had just discovered had put his mind at ease. He began the conversation by briefly recounting last night's investigation, then moved on to discuss the matter of patient Renfield:",4.12,2.302,"October 1st. - When the Professor entered my room and woke me up, it was almost noon.

It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy, and reason so sound.” I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against getting any false impression from my patient. “But,” he answered, “I want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?”","— Your patient's hand caught my attention. Can I see him again today? If you're busy, you can just let me visit him alone. I find his case quite interesting. It's fascinating how a madman can speak so accurately about logic and philosophy! Indeed, I am very busy today, so I had to ask you to go to Renfield's room alone because I didn't want you to waste time waiting. I called a warden and gave him some necessary instructions, and asked him to lead you there. But before you left the room, I still reminded you to be cautious. — I was just going to talk about him - He replied - and the passion that drove him to swallow insects alive. Yesterday, I read your diary and found out that he had spoken to Mina. But what are you laughing at, John?",5.511,4.35,"“Your patient interests me a lot. Can I come with you to visit him this morning? Or if you are very busy, I can go alone if possible. Finding a mental patient who talks philosophy and reasons so healthily is a new experience for me.” I had some tasks to attend to, so I told him I would be pleased if he went alone, so I wouldn't have to keep him waiting later; I called a nurse and gave the necessary instructions. Before the professor left the room, I warned him not to get any wrong impressions from my patient. “But,” he said, “I want to hear him talk about himself and his madness about eating live things. From yesterday's part of the journal, I understand that he once told Madam Mina about such a belief. Why are you laughing, my friend Jonathan?”",32.18,31.749,"–Your patient interests me a lot. Is it possible for me to visit him with you this morning? Or, in case you are very busy, I can go see him alone, if you permit me. It is a new experience for me to find a lunatic who talks about philosophy and discourses so sensibly. I had some urgent work to do and I told him that I would like him to go alone, so that I wouldn't be forced to make him wait. Therefore, I called one of the assistants and gave him the necessary instructions. Before my teacher left the room, I advised him not to get a false impression about my patient. ""I wish you would tell me about yourself and your disappointment regarding your consumption of live animals.""

I should have remembered. And yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise. Who knows?” I went on with my work, and before long was through that in hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was Van Helsing back in the study. “Do I interrupt?” he asked politely as he stood at the door.","— I'm sorry, but the answer to your question lies here - I said, placing my hand on the stack of typed papers - When our rational and educated mad patient discussed the habit of eating living creatures with me, indeed his mouth was still smeared with spider legs and fly legs that he had just eaten right before Mrs. Harker entered the room. Van Helsing chuckled. — You have an excellent memory, my friend! I should have remembered this detail myself. However, it is precisely such flaws in thinking and memory that draw people to study mental patients. Who knows, by understanding the madness through Renfield's strange behavior, I might learn more about human wisdom! Who can say? Speaking of which, I have to go to the office to start work. Time flies so fast; before I knew it, the professor had already returned. — Am I bothering you?",11.972,11.309,"""Excuse me,"" I said, ""but the answer is here.

""Good!"" he said. "" Your memory does not deceive you, my friend John. I should have remembered that. But still, what makes the study of mental illness such a fascinating field is the way thought and memory can go astray like this. Perhaps I can gain more knowledge from this man's madness than from the teachings of the wisest person. Who knows? ""I continued my work and finished what I had in hand shortly thereafter.

Your memory is good. I should have remembered it. And yet, that very deviation of thought and memory is what makes the study of mental illnesses so fascinating. It is possible that I may gain more knowledge from the madness of that poor lunatic than I could from the wisest of men. Who knows?

When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. “Don’t you know me?” I asked. His answer was not reassuring: “I know you well enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed Dutchmen!” Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina.

When I entered, he was squatting on a stool placed in the middle of the room, his hands supporting his chin, his face stubborn and unpleasant. I tried to talk to him with a cheerful attitude and great respect, but he still didn't bother to reply. “Don't you know me?” I asked. His response was clearly inappropriate: “Of course! It's that silly old Van Helsing, who else. I want you to find somewhere else to play. Go study your stupid brain! Damn you, you stupid Dutchman!” I couldn't say anything more, and he kept his stubborn, scowling face, completely forgetting my presence. So the chance to learn something more from this intelligent patient was gone. To comfort myself, perhaps I should go talk to the gentle Mina.

1378,"1 October.—It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day; after Jonathan’s full confidence for so many years, to see him manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the Count’s house. And yet he must have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it must have distressed him even more than it did me.

They all unanimously decided to leave me out, and I can only accept it. But just thinking about my husband harboring many secrets from me makes me feel upset!

Everything that one does seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored. If I hadn’t gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear Lucy would be with us now. She hadn’t taken to visiting the churchyard till I came, and if she hadn’t come there in the day-time with me she wouldn’t have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn’t gone there at night and asleep, that monster couldn’t have destroyed her as he did.

I wasn't sleepy, just terribly worried. I suddenly thought about what had happened since the day Jonathan first visited me in London, everything seemed like a horrible play where the fates were cruelly moving towards their inevitable end. It seemed that any action we took, no matter how well-intentioned, resulted in terrible outcomes. If I hadn't gone to Whitby, Lucy might not have died. Before I arrived, she never went to the cemetery, did she? If she hadn't walked there with me, she wouldn't have sleepwalked there, and thus wouldn't have been harmed by that monster. Oh my God! Why on earth did I decide to go to Whitby? Yes... and so I cried again. I wondered what was wrong with me today. Jonathan surely doesn't know that I - who have never cried out of self-pity, and have never shed a tear in front of my husband - have cried twice today.

1381,"I can’t quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield’s room, which is somewhere under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window. All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said, I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears. I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.","Yesterday, I don't know when I fell asleep. I only remember suddenly hearing the loud barking of the house dogs and numerous strange murmurs coming from the room of the patient Renfield, which is the room directly below mine. Then there was a deep silence that made me feel anxious. A vague feeling of discomfort made me get up and look out the window. The silence and darkness, occasionally punctuated by a bit of faint moonlight, made the late night even more mysterious. There was nothing moving out there, everything was enveloped in a mournful and still atmosphere like in a dead world, except for a pale mist drifting very slowly, so slowly that I could barely perceive its movement across the grass towards its house; it seemed that only this mist was the embodiment of life at that moment. The mist lingered in my mind, making me feel more at ease, for when I returned to bed, I felt myself starting to drift off as if I were falling asleep. However, I still couldn't sleep; the mist was still floating in my thoughts, making me get up and look out the window once more. By now, the mist had spread out and was hovering close to the house: I could see the dense mist clinging to the walls as if trying to climb through the windows. At that moment, Renfield suddenly screamed like a mad dog; I couldn't understand what he was saying, but it was so pitiful. Then I suddenly had the feeling that I heard someone fighting, perhaps the warden had entered the room and was being fiercely resisted by him, leading to a struggle. Frightened, I went back to bed, pulled the blanket over my head, and tightly covered my ears. At this point, I no longer felt sleepy. But eventually, I gradually fell asleep, for after a dream, I couldn't remember what had happened until noon today, when Jonathan woke me up. It took me a moment to gather my thoughts and realize where I was and who was standing in front of me. In my deep sleep, I had a really bizarre dream, which showed how much I had been thinking and worrying. Indeed, I had just gone through a deep, exhausting sleep!",10.202,9.71,"I can't remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember suddenly hearing dogs barking and a lot of strange noises coming from Mr. Renfield's room somewhere below this room, as if someone was praying very loudly. And then, silence fell over everything, a silence so deep that it frightened me, and I got up to look out the window. Everything was dark and quiet, and the dark shadows cast by the moonlight seemed filled with their own mystery. Not a single thing was moving, everything seemed as terrible and still as death or fate; so much so that the thin line of white mist that seemed to be crawling towards the house across the grass at an almost imperceptible speed seemed to have a consciousness and life of its own. I think it did me good to get away from the subject because when I returned to bed, a heaviness had settled over me. I lay down for a while, but I couldn't sleep much, so I got up again and looked out the window. The mist was spreading and had now come very close to the house, so much so that I could see it clinging to the wall in a thick layer as if it were secretly reaching for the windows. The poor man was making more noise than ever, and although I couldn't distinguish a single word he was saying, I could detect a peculiar passionate plea in his voice. Then, the sound of a struggle came; I knew the nurses were attending to him. I was so scared that I crawled into bed and covered my head with the blankets, plugging my ears with my fingers. At that moment, I wasn't sleepy at all, or at least I thought so; but I must have fallen asleep because I don't remember anything until Jonathan woke me up in the morning, except for the dreams I had. I think it took me some effort and time to understand where I was and to realize that it was Jonathan leaning over me. My dream was quite unusual and was almost an example of thoughts conceived while awake blending into or continuing in the dream.",28.492,28.266,"I can't stop remembering how I fell asleep. I remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a clamor of strange sounds, like prayers in a tumultuous range, coming from Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhere below mine. Then, silence reigned again, so deep that it startled me, and I got up to look out the window. Everything was dark and silent. The dark shadows cast by the moonlight seemed to be filled with a mystery of their own. Nothing seemed to move, but everything appeared gloomy and eerie, so that a slight wisp of white fog, advancing with a slowness that made its movement almost imperceptible, towards the house, over the lawn, seemed to have a life of its own. I believe that these thoughts, by making me forget the previous ones, did me good, since when I went back to bed I felt a lethargy that gently enveloped me. I remained in bed for a while, but I couldn't fall asleep, so I got up again and looked out the window. The fog was spreading and was already very close to the house, so much so that I saw it cling heavily to the walls, as if it were climbing towards the windows. The poor man was speaking more forcefully than ever and, although I couldn't quite make out his words, I understood that it was a passionate plea on his part. Then, I heard the sound of a struggle and realized that the nurses were taking care of him. I felt so scared that I covered my head with the sheets, plugging my ears with my fingers. I wasn't sleepy at all or, at least, so I thought, but I must have fallen asleep, since, except for the dreams, I don't remember anything else until morning came, when Jonathan woke me up. I think it took me some effort and time to remember where I was and that it was Jonathan who was leaning over me. My dream was very peculiar, and it was something typical, in the way that upon waking, thoughts intermingle with dreams.",30.629,30.424
1382,"I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I could see it like smoke—or with the white energy of boiling water—pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words “a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.” Was it indeed some such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary’s Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became black darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one’s reason if there were too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night’s sleep. Last night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.","... I fell into a deep sleep, dreaming that I was waiting for Jonathan to return. I was terribly worried about him, but I couldn't move to get up and follow my own will: my limbs, and even my head, suddenly felt numb under a very heavy weight pressing down on me. In the dream, I felt very uncomfortable and couldn't control my thoughts. At that moment, I had the sensation that the air around me had a heavy, damp, and chilling smell. I threw off the blanket and was astonished to find the room engulfed in darkness. The lamp I had dimmed while waiting for Jonathan was now just a small, reddish dot, emitting a light barely enough to see through an increasingly thick fog in the room. Even though I clearly remembered closing the window before going to sleep, I still wanted to check it again, but my limbs felt as if they were made of wood, unable to move. What could I do now? I had closed my eyes, but it seemed as though I could still see through my eyelids (dreams often have such peculiarities). The fog kept getting thicker, and now I realized how that eerie mist had entered the room: it didn't come through the window like smoke or steam, but through the gaps in the door. A moment later, the fog gradually transformed into a column of cloud - yes, if I could call it that - rising high to the ceiling, and at the top of the cloud, there seemed to be the light of a small, blood-red eye. Everything suddenly went topsy-turvy in my head. The denser the column of cloud became in the room, the more clearly I could read the words ""Pillar of cloud by day, pillar of fire by night"" through the fog, as written in the Bible. Could this be a warning I received in my sleep? The pillar of cloud was formed by two elements, day and night, because there was a fiery light in the red eye. The more I thought about it, the more I felt captivated by that image. A moment later, the red dot of fire suddenly split into two, like two eyes. That image reminded me of Lucy's words about the rays of the setting sun shining through the stained glass windows of St. Mary's Church when she and I sat on the cliff at Whitby. I was also shocked to recall Jonathan's experience of witnessing three monstrous creatures suddenly turning into dust under the moonlight and gradually transforming into three lascivious women. After that, I sank into a dark, murky sleep. In a final effort of imagination, I saw a pale face emerge from the mist and lean down close to me. Perhaps I should be wary of such dreams, because if they recur frequently, my mind will surely be seriously affected. I intend to ask Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward why I am sleeping so heavily, but I am just afraid they will worry unnecessarily. If I tell them about my dream, they will surely be even more worried about me. Tonight, I will try to sleep as comfortably as possible. If I still can't sleep, maybe tomorrow night I will ask them for a sedative pill. I think using it just once won't do any harm, and I will have a really peaceful night. A dream like the one I just had can only make me tired if I continue to suffer from insomnia.",13.512,13.285,"I thought I was asleep and waiting for Jonathan to arrive. I was very worried about him and had no strength to move; my feet, hands, and mind were heavy, so nothing could progress at its usual pace. Because of this, I slept a troubled sleep and thought. Then, it occurred to me that the air was heavy, humid, and cold. I covered my face with the blankets again and, in astonishment, saw that my surroundings were dim. The gas lamp I had left on for Jonathan but then dimmed, clearly appeared like a tiny red dot in the thickening mist seeping into the room. Then, I remembered that I had closed the window before getting into bed. Actually, I would have gotten up to be sure, but a kind of leaden weight seemed to chain my arms, legs, and even my will. I lay still and endured it; that was all; I closed my eyes but could still see through my eyelids. (How marvelous are the tricks our dreams play on us and our ability to imagine accordingly.) As the mist thickened more and more, I could now see how it was entering because it was seeping in not from the window but from the joints of the door, like smoke - or the white steam of boiling water. It continued to thicken until it seemed to form a column of cloud in the room, at the top of which I could see the gas lamp glowing like a red eye. The things in my head were swirling around just like the cloudy column in the room; among this, the phrase ""Pillar of cloud by day, pillar of fire by night"" from the Holy Bible came to mind. Was it really a kind of spiritual guide coming to me in my sleep? But this column was composed of both the guidance of night and day, because the fire, which gained a new allure for me upon reflection, was in the red eye; until, as I watched, the fire split and shone through the mist above me, just like the two red eyes Lucy mentioned during her momentary mental lapse when the setting sun's light hit the windows of Saint Mary Church on the slope. Suddenly, I was terrified, remembering that Jonathan had seen those dreadful women transform from mist into reality in the moonlight. The last conscious effort of my imagination was a very angry white face emerging from the mist and leaning over me. I must be careful of such dreams, for if they become numerous, they can take one's mind. If I weren't afraid of worrying them, I would ask Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe me a sleeping aid. Such a dream right now would be woven into the fears they have for me. Tonight, I will try to sleep naturally. If I can't sleep, I will have them give me a dose of chloral tomorrow night; using it once won't harm me, and it will give me a good night's sleep. Last night tired me so much that I wouldn't be this exhausted even if I hadn't slept at all.",29.473,29.345,"I thought I was asleep, waiting for Jonathan to return. I felt very anxious about him and couldn't do anything; my legs, arms, and body felt weighed down, so much so that I couldn't move as usual. Thus, I slept very restlessly and kept dreaming strange things. Then, I began to feel that the air was heavy, humid, and cold. I removed the sheets from my face and, to my great surprise, saw that everything was dark. The little gas lamp I had left on for Jonathan, though very dim, seemed like a tiny red spark through the mist, which had evidently grown denser and entered the room. Then, I remembered that I had closed the window before going to bed. I wanted to get up to make sure of it, but a leaden lethargy seemed to hold my limbs and my will. I remained motionless; that was all. I closed my eyes, but I could still see clearly through my eyelids (it's wonderful to see what tricks dreams have, and how logically our imagination sometimes works). The mist grew thicker and I could already see how it entered the room, as I saw it as if it were smoke... or like the white vapor of boiling water... entering, not through the window, but from under the door. It kept getting thicker until it seemed to concentrate into a column of vapor over which I could see the little light of the gas lamp shining like a reddish eye. Ideas crowded into my brain as the column of vapor began to dance in the room, and among all my thoughts came the phrases from the scriptures: ""A column of vapor by night and of fire by day. "" Was it some spiritual guide coming to me through the dream? But the column was composed of both the day guide and the night guide, for the fire was in the red eye which, thinking about it, fascinated me in a way, for as I watched it, the fire seemed to split and I saw it as if it were two red eyes, through the mist, just as Lucy had told me she had seen them in her mental wanderings, on the cliff, when the setting sun reflected in the windows of St. Mary's Church. Suddenly, I remembered in horror that this was how Jonathan had seen those horrible women of the mist materialize, spinning under the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for I found myself in the deepest darkness. The last conscious effort my imagination made was to make me see a livid face leaning over me, emerging from the mist. I must be careful with those dreams, as they can make a person's reason waver if they occur too frequently. I'm going to see Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe me something that will make me sleep deeply; the only bad thing is that I fear alarming them. A similar dream would mix at this moment with her fears for me. Tonight I must strive to sleep naturally. If I don't succeed, I must ensure that I get a dose of chloral for tomorrow night; that won't harm me for once and a good night's sleep will do me well. Today I woke up more fatigued than if I hadn't slept at all.",30.564,30.43
1383,"2 October 10 p. m.—Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing. In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be miserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till dinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan’s manner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so sleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night before. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.","• October 2, 10 PM Last night, I slept very deeply and did not have any dreams. However, the deep sleep still did not refresh me, and today I still feel quite tired and exhausted. All day yesterday, I tried to read but couldn't because of drowsiness. In the afternoon, Renfield asked to see me. The poor man was very kind when talking to me, and even when saying goodbye, he kissed my hand and prayed for God's blessing upon me. Suddenly, I felt such pity for him that I almost cried. Once again, I told myself to hide this weakness, because if Jonathan knew I cried, he would be immensely sad. Jonathan and his friends only returned close to dinner time with very tired faces. I did everything I could to help them feel less tired, and considered it a comfort that helped me gradually forget my own fatigue. After dinner, they advised me to go to bed and rest, while they would go outside to smoke and relax, but I knew well that they wanted to go out and inform each other about the work each had done during the day. Looking at Jonathan, I guessed that he had just discovered something very important. Lying in bed, I felt that I couldn't sleep, so I asked Dr. Seward for a mild sedative. I explained to him that I hadn't slept well the previous night. He gave me a pill that he said was very mild and had no side effects...I took it and lay down waiting for sleep. Not long after, I felt as if I was about to fall asleep...But that was also when I was gripped by a fear: was I sure I hadn't made a mistake in taking that pill? Perhaps it would be better if I stayed awake all night! But it was too late...I was sinking into an unavoidable sleep...Goodbye!",12.053,11.579,"2 October, 10 PM. - I slept last night, but I didn't dream. I must have slept deeply; I didn't wake up when Jonathan came to bed; but the sleep didn't refresh me, because today I feel terribly weak and unwell. Yesterday, I spent the whole day either trying to read or lying down and dozing. In the afternoon, Mr. Renfield asked if he could see me. The poor man was very kind and kissed my hand, wishing God's protection upon me as he left. This affected me greatly in some way; whenever I think of him, I cry. This is a new weakness I need to be careful about. If Jonathan knew I was crying, he would be devastated. He and the others were out until dinner and they all returned tired. I did my best to cheer them up and I think this effort did me good, because I forgot how tired I was. After dinner, they sent me to bed and said they were all going out to smoke together, but I knew they wanted to tell each other what had happened to them during the day; from Jonathan's demeanor, I could see he had something important he wanted to share. I wasn't as sleepy as I should have been; therefore, before they left, I asked Dr. Seward to give me some kind of sleeping medicine because I hadn't slept well the previous night. He kindly prepared a sleeping draught for me, assuring me it was very mild and wouldn't harm me... I took the medicine and am still waiting for the distant sleep to come. I hope I haven't made a mistake because when sleep starts to court me, a new fear arises: I hope I haven't been foolish by depriving myself of the power to wake up. I might want to wake up. Here comes sleep. Good night.",32.591,32.38,"October 2nd, at ten o'clock at night. Last night I slept, but I did not dream. I must have slept deeply, since I did not wake up when Jonathan went to bed, but the sleep did not do me as much good as I would have wished, since today I have felt weak and discouraged. I spent all of yesterday trying to sleep or lying down, dozing. In the afternoon, Mr. Renfield asked if he could see me. Poor man! He was very kind, and as he left, he kissed my hand and prayed to God to bless me. In a way, that affected me a lot, and tears come to my eyes when I think of him. This is a new weakness that I have to worry about and take care of. Jonathan would be very sad if he knew that I had been crying. He and the others were out until dinner time, and they returned very tired. I did my best to cheer them up, and I think the effort did me good, since I forgot how tired I was myself. After dinner, they sent me to bed and all went out to smoke together, as they said, but I knew perfectly well that what they wanted was to tell each other what had happened to each of them during the day; I understood from Jonathan's attitude that he had something very important to communicate to them. I wasn't as sleepy as I should have been; therefore, before they left, I asked Dr. Seward to give me some kind of sleeping pill, as I hadn't slept well the night before. With great skill, he prepared a sedative drug for me and gave it to me, telling me that it wouldn't cause any harm, as it was very mild... I have taken it and am waiting for sleep to overcome me, which still seems somewhat distant. I hope I haven't done anything wrong, as when sleep begins to take hold of me, a new fear assails me; it is possible that I have made a mistake by depriving myself of the power to wake up.

1386,"1 October, evening.—I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the responsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a saucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog’s-eared notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick, half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at 197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical scheme—let alone the City itself and the very heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from Carfax.","• October 1, evening I met Thomas Snelling at home, but unfortunately, he is a very forgetful person. Even though I had informed him in advance, he still went out to drink beer until he was completely drunk, not caring whether I would come or not. But in return, he had a very kind wife. After hearing my explanation, she advised me to go to Joseph Smollet's house to inquire. So I had to head up to Walworth Street again. I arrived when Smollet was sitting and having tea. He was a good-natured and intelligent worker, trustworthy enough for others to confide in about personal matters. He remembered very clearly the brawl that occurred when he came to pick up the goods at Carfax. After checking a tiny, frayed notebook, he immediately told me the address where the boxes of soil were received. He had transported a total of six boxes from Carfax to 179 Chicksand Street in Mile End New Town, and another six boxes to Jamaica Lane in Bermondsey. So if the plan was to distribute a few dirty boxes of soil in each location in London as a hideout, then Chicksand Street and Jamaica Lane were the first transit points that the Count used to later disperse them to other places. From this, it can be inferred that he was not just looking for a hideout in two areas of London. Therefore, I had to continue asking Smollet about the boxes of soil that had been transported away from Carfax.",7.101,6.642,"October 1, evening. I found Thomas Snelling at his home in Benthal Green, but unfortunately, he was in no condition to remember anything. Knowing that I would go there and give him beer money had tempted him, and he had gotten drunk early. However, from his wife, who seemed to be an honest, poor woman, I learned that the man carried the boxes together and that the authoritative Smollet was merely his assistant. Therefore, I went by carriage to Walworth and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at home, with his jacket off, drinking tea from a saucer. An honest and intelligent man, evidently a good and reliable worker, with a mind of his own. He remembered the entire incident regarding the boxes and gave the destinations of the boxes from a perfect notebook with curled corners, which he took out from a mysterious pocket at the back of his trousers, containing thick, semi-faded hieroglyph-like notes written with a pencil. He said there were six boxes he picked up from Carfax and loaded into the carriage, which he left at 197 Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six boxes he left at Jamaica Road, Bermondsey. If the Count intends to distribute these hideous refuges all over London, these places were chosen as the first delivery points, so that he could complete the distribution in more detail later. This systematic approach in the execution of this task made me think that he did not intend to limit himself to the two sides of London. Now he had settled at the eastern end of the north shore and the eastern end of the south shore and to the south. The north and west were never meant to be excluded from his diabolical plan - especially not the very center of the city and the favored parts of London, the southwest, and the southern hub. I started talking to Smollet again and asked him if he could tell me whether there were any other boxes taken from Carfax.",28.93,28.7,"October 1st, at night. I found Thomas Snelling at his house in Bethnal Green; but, unfortunately, he was not in a condition to remember anything. The very lure of the beer that my anticipated visit had opened before him proved too strong, and he began to drink too soon, before my arrival. However, I learned from his wife, a decent and timid person, that he was only Smollet’s assistant, who was the responsible one of the two. So I headed towards Walworth and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at his house, in his shirtsleeves, having a late cup of tea, which he was lifting from a saucer. He is an honest and intelligent man, a trustworthy worker with an intelligence and personality of his own. He remembered everything about the incident with the boxes, and, pulling from a mysterious place at the back of his trousers a notebook with dog-eared pages covered in hieroglyphics drawn with a thick-tipped pencil and very heavy writing, he informed me of the destination of the boxes. There were six he had taken from Carfax and deposited at number one hundred and ninety-seven Chicksand Street, in Mile End New Town, and another six he had deposited in Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. In the event that the Count wished to distribute his ghostly refuges throughout London, those places would have been chosen as starting points, so that he could then completely distribute the boxes. The systematic way in which all that was being carried out made me think that this could not mean that the monster wished to confine itself to two places in London. It was already situated in the eastern part of the north bank, to the east of the south coast, and to the south of the city. It was certain that it did not intend to leave out of its diabolical plans the north and the west... not to mention the City itself, and the very heart of elegant London, to the southwest and the west. I went back to see Smollet and asked him if he could tell us if any other box had been taken from Carfax.",29.09,28.868

1388,"“Well, guv’nor, you’ve treated me wery ’an’some”—I had given him half a sovereign—“an’ I’ll tell yer all I know.

There ain’t a-many such jobs as this ’ere, an’ I’m thinkin’ that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut.” I asked if he could tell me where to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search then and there. At the door he stopped, and said:—","— Yes, sir, - He replied - you have been quite generous to me (since I slipped him half a gold coin) so I will tell you everything I know! Four days ago, while drinking at the Hare and Hounds pub in the Pincher valley, I heard a guy named Bloxam say that he and another driver had entered an old house in Purfleet to work and ended up swallowing kilos of dust! You see, this kind of dirty work doesn't happen every day. I think Sam Bloxam might also be able to provide you with some information about what you want to know! — If Smollet tells me the address of the guy named Sam Bloxam, - as I promised him - I will give him the remaining half of the gold coin. Hearing my promise, he quickly drank the remaining tea in the cup and stood up, declaring that he would go everywhere to find that driver. Seeing me to the door, he told me:",6.227,4.956,"""Well boss, you treated me very well,"" -I had given him half a gold coin- ""and I will tell you everything I know. I heard a man named Bloxam telling his friend at the Hare and Hounds Tavern in Pincher’s Alley about four nights ago that he did a very dusty job at the old house in Purfleet. There aren't many such jobs around here, and I think maybe Sam Bloxam can tell you something."" I asked him where I could find this man. I told him that if he could find the address for me, it would be worth another half gold coin. So, he finished the rest of his tea in one gulp and stood up, saying he would start investigating right away. He stopped at the door and said:",25.884,25.295,"""Well, sir, you have treated me very well,"" he had given him half a sovereign, ""and I am going to tell you everything I know.""

""Jobs of that kind are not frequent here, and I think Sam Bloxam might be able to tell you more about it."" I asked him if it was possible for him to tell me where I could find him. I told him that if he could get me the address, I would be very happy to give him another half-sovereign. So he took the rest of his tea in one gulp and stood up, saying he was going to start his inquiries. He stopped at the door and said:",25.333,24.804

1390,"This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way to home. We’re on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep. Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as though she had been crying. Poor dear, I’ve no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the others. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.","Listening to this guy talk, it seemed to make sense, so I asked his daughter to quickly run and buy an envelope and a stamp for me. In just a moment, the girl returned with what I needed in her hands. I carefully wrote the address, affixed the stamp, and handed the envelope to the kind homeowner. Before leaving, I repeatedly reminded him that as soon as there was any news, he had to inform me immediately. So finally, the mystery is beginning to be unraveled! Gradually, step by step, one step at a time. Tonight, I suddenly feel so tired, just wanting to go to sleep immediately. Mina is deeply asleep, she looks even paler than the day before, and her eyes are swollen as if she had just cried. Poor girl, ever since we stopped informing her about our plans and intentions, she seems even more worried and restless than before. However, we were right to make such a decision! It's better for her to be disappointed and anxious for a few days than to experience extreme tension when participating in our work. The two doctors were really right when they advised me to keep her out of this dangerous game. The important thing for me right now is to keep everything secret, no matter the reason, I must not let anything slip out. I fully understand the burden of silence that is placed on my shoulders. But after all, I don't believe it's something terribly difficult to do, because at this moment, it seems Mina herself doesn't want to mention our work anymore. Indeed, since we decided to let her rest, I haven't seen her mention or hint at anything about Dracula and his schemes anymore.",7.374,6.703,"This was very convenient; thus, one of the children went to get an envelope and a sheet of paper with a penny and kept the change for themselves.

One way or another, we are on the trail. I am tired tonight and want to sleep. Mina is in a deep sleep and looks a bit too pale; her eyes look as if she has been crying. Poor darling, I have no doubt that the thought of secrets being kept from her worries her; this might cause her to worry twice as much for me and the others. But this is for the best. Experiencing disappointment and worry in this way is better than having her nerves shattered. I must be resolute as I carry this special burden of silence on my shoulders. Under no circumstances should I discuss this matter with her. To be honest, this might not be a difficult task, as she has been reticent about this matter for a while and has not spoken about the Count or his actions since we explained our decision to her.",22.17,21.747,"That turned out to be practical, so one of the children went out with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and I gave him the change.

Anyway, we are on the trail. Tonight I feel tired and wish to sleep. Mina is deeply asleep and looks too pale; her eyes give the impression that she has been crying. Poor woman, I am sure it is very hard for her to remain in ignorance and that it may make her feel doubly anxious for me and for everyone else. But it is better this way. It is better to feel disappointed and anxious than to have shattered nerves. The doctors were right to insist that she should stay out of this whole terrible matter. I must remain firm, since the burden of silence must weigh mainly on me. I cannot even mention the subject to her, under any circumstances.

I determined not to wake her, but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for her going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home, with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and in ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should have found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some difficulty, Potter’s Court. Mr. Smollet’s spelling misled me, as I asked for Poter’s Court instead of Potter’s Court. However, when I had found the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran’s lodging-house. When I asked the man who came to the door for the “depite,” he shook his head, and said: “I dunno ’im. There ain’t no such a person ’ere; I never ’eard of ’im in all my bloomin’ days.

In her sleep, she looked even paler and more exhausted than when she was awake. Waking her now would be wrong, but another thought came to mind: after today's investigation, I will try to persuade her to return to Exeter. I think at home, even if she has to be busy with household chores, she would feel happier than being here with us without the right to know what is happening. Before leaving the house, I only met Dr. Seward and informed him where I was going today, what I was doing, and when finished, I would try to return as early as possible to report the results to the whole group. When I arrived in Walworth, I suddenly became confused about finding the Potter Court. Smollet's sloppy and misspelled writing made me search for the wrong address all over the place. However, once I found the Potter Court, I just had to go straight to the Corcoran house. The homeowner informed me that yesterday, Bloxam came here, got drunk, and slept over, but at five o'clock this morning, he went straight to his workplace in Polar. Corcoran couldn't remember the exact location of the storage warehouse I wanted to ask about to find Bloxam; he only vaguely recalled that it was a ""new and modernly built house."" This was the only information I could get before heading to Polar.

1394,"“I’m the depity,” he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the deputy’s knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at Corcoran’s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o’clock that morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a “new-fangled ware’us”; and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve o’clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a new “cold storage” building; and as this suited the condition of a “new-fangled ware’us,” I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my suggesting that I was willing to pay his day’s wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly, and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes—“main heavy ones”—with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to which he replied:—","They were indeed very difficult and rude people. However, when I slipped each of them a coin, their attitudes changed immediately. And when I promised to pay the foreman a day's wage if he allowed me to meet Bloxam to ask him a few personal questions, he sent someone to fetch Bloxam right away. Bloxam was a rough and straightforward young man. I proactively promised to pay him for all the information he provided. Just waiting for that, he immediately told me that on the route from Carfax to a house in Piccadilly, he had to make two trips to transport all nine brand-new crates - all large and very heavy - using a rented horse-drawn carriage. But when asked about the house number in Piccadilly, he couldn't answer.",2.617,2.276,"“I am an assistant,” he said. I immediately realized I was on the right track; the way Smollet had written it had misled me once again. A half-crown tip made the assistant share what he knew, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who was recovering from the beers he drank the night he spent in Corcoran, had left for his job in Poplar at five o'clock this morning. He couldn't tell me where that place or job was, but he had a vague idea that it was one of those ""newfangled warehouses,"" and with this weak clue, I had to set off for Poplar. It was twelve o'clock by the time I found a satisfactory indication of such a building, and I found it in a restaurant where some workers were having their lunch. One of these men suggested that a new ""cold storage warehouse"" was being built on Cross Angel Street; and since this fit the description of a ""newfangled warehouse,"" I immediately went there by carriage. A tense conversation with a grim-faced guard and an even grimmer-faced foreman, whose cooperation I secured by offering to pay his daily wage, led me to Bloxam; the man was summoned after I indicated I was willing to pay the foreman to allow me to ask a few personal questions. Despite his rough speech and demeanor, he was a fairly intelligent man. When I told him I would pay for the information and gave him an advance, he said he had made two trips between a house in Carfax and one in Piccadilly, transporting nine large crates - ""really heavy things"" - from the first house to the second with a horse and cart he had hired for this purpose. When I asked him to tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, he responded:",27.104,26.84,"–I am the sheriff -he replied. I immediately understood that I was on safe ground. The spelling with which the letter was written deceived me again. A half-crown tip made the constable's knowledge available to me, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam had slept at the Corcaran house to dispel the fumes of the beer he had drunk the night before, but had gone to his work in Poplar at five in the morning. He could not tell me the exact place where he worked, but he had a vague idea that it was some new warehouse, and with that extremely slight clue, I set off for Poplar. It was already twelve before I managed to get directions to a similar building, and it was in a café where I got the information. There were several women eating in the lounge. One of them told me that they were constructing a new ""refrigerated warehouse"" building on Cross Angel Street, and since it matched the constable's description, I headed there immediately. An interview with a rather surly guard and an even more ill-tempered foreman, whose mood I improved slightly with the help of some coins, put me on Bloxam's trail; they sent for him when I suggested that I was willing to pay the foreman his full day's wages for the privilege of asking him a few questions about a private matter. He was a fairly intelligent fellow, though somewhat rough in manner and speech. When I promised to pay him for his reports and gave him an advance, he told me that he had made two trips between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly and that he had taken nine large boxes, ""very heavy,"" from the first address to the last with a cart and horse he had rented for the job.

I had gained a new painful experience; the Count could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining. Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards, whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house.","— No, sir, but it should be easy to find! The house is tall, with a stone facade, low windows, and steps outside. I remember these steps because I had to carry the boxes up with three country lads who offered to help me in hopes of earning a few coins. The old man gave them a few shillings. Seeing an opportunity, they tried to ask for more, but the old man wouldn't have it. They were almost kicked down the stairs by the old man if they hadn't run away in time, cursing as they went. Thinking like that was enough to find the house, so I paid Bloxam and made my way to Piccadilly. What I had just learned left me bewildered: the count could lift the wooden crates filled with earth by himself! Every minute passing now was very precious to me. Because it was very likely that he had already scattered the crates, one in each place, at the time he had chosen beforehand so that no one would notice. Upon reaching Piccadilly Circus, I got off the carriage and headed straight towards the west of the neighborhood. Just past the Juvenile Court, I immediately recognized the house I was looking for. I had no doubt that it was one of Count Dracula's lairs in England. The house seemed to have been abandoned for a very long time. The arched windows were all open, but every window was covered in a layer of dust. The dust of time had turned the wooden panels black and the iron decorations into objects that looked like they were made of earth. Looking at the balcony wall, I guessed there must have been a sign with the address and house name that had just been torn off, as the traces were still very fresh. I would have more information if that sign were still intact: it would tell me the name of the house's owner. I still remember how I gathered information to secure the brokerage contract for the Carfax house for Dracula before, and now I also believe that if I knew the previous owner of the house, I would be able to get inside.",9.483,9.034,"“No, sir. But you won't have any trouble finding it. It's a tall building with an arched entrance and high steps leading to the door. I know those steps because I carried crates up them with three idlers who came to earn a few pence. The old man gave them each a shilling, and when they saw how much they got, they wanted more; but the man grabbed one of them by the shoulder and almost threw him down the stairs until they cursed and ran away.” I thought I could find the house with this description, so I paid my friend for the information and set off for Piccadilly. I had learned a new, painful fact: Apparently, the Count could carry the earth boxes by himself. If so, time was very precious, because now that he had ensured a certain number of distributions, he could complete the task unnoticed by choosing his own timing. I got out of the cab at Piccadilly Circus and walked west; behind the Junior Constitutional, I came across the described house and was convinced that this was the next refuge arranged by Dracula. The house looked like it hadn't been lived in for a long time. The windows were covered in dust, and the shutters were open. All the frames had darkened over time, and most of the paint on the iron had peeled off. It was clear that there had been a large signboard in front of the balcony until recently, but it had been roughly removed, with the posts that held it still standing there. Behind the balcony railings, I saw some loose boards with unpolished white edges. I would have given a lot to see the signboard in its entirety, as it would probably have given some clues about the owner of the house. I recalled my experiences with the investigation and sale of Carfax and couldn't help but think that if I could find the previous owner, there might be a way to enter the house.",29.227,29.011,"–No, sir. But you will have no difficulty finding it. It is a tall building, with a stone facade and a coat of arms, and quite high stairs that lead up to the entrance door. I remember those stairs because I had to climb them with the boxes, along with three boys who came over to earn a few pennies. The old man gave them shillings and, seeing that he had given them a lot, they wanted even more, but the old man grabbed one of them by the shoulder and almost threw him down the stairs; then, they all left, insulting him. I thought that with those reports I would have no trouble finding the house, so after paying my informant, I headed towards Piccadilly. I had acquired a new and painful experience. The count could apparently handle the boxes alone. If so, time was precious, since having carried out certain distributions, he could carry out the rest of his work, choosing the opportune time for it, going completely unnoticed. At Piccadilly Circus I got off and walked west; after passing the Junior Constitutional, I arrived at the house that had been described to me and was satisfied with the idea that this was the next refuge Dracula had chosen. The house seemed to have been unoccupied for a long time. The windows were full of dust and the shutters were raised. The entire structure was blackened by time, and the paint had disappeared from the metal parts. It was evident that there had been an advertisement on the upper balcony for some time, which had been abruptly removed, so that the vertical supports still remained. Behind the balcony railing, I saw several loose boards protruding, whose edges appeared white. I would have given much to see the advertisement intact, as it might have given me some indication as to the identity of its owner. I remembered my experience investigating and purchasing the Carfax house and couldn't help but think that if I could find the former owner, I might discover some means of entering the house.",22.99,22.722
1410,"There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been taken, but he couldn’t say from whom. He told me, however, that up to very lately there had been a notice-board of “For Sale” up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in Sackville Street.","So there's no reason to stay here any longer, what more can I know and do now? But I still made a round around the house, because who knows, I might find something interesting! The stables on the other side of the house were indeed bustling. I met a horse caretaker and asked him about the house. The information I received was that the house had been bought, but he didn't know who bought it. He also mentioned that about two or three days ago, there was a for-sale sign on the balcony, and if I asked the Mitchell, Sons & Candy agency, I might get the necessary information, as he clearly remembered reading the name of this real estate agency on the sign. Not wanting to attract attention, I had to thank the kind old man and leave without daring to ask more questions. It was getting dark, so I couldn't afford to waste time. Moreover, it's not like I didn't know the address of Mitchell, Sons & Candy; it's a brokerage with an office on Sackville Street. I needed to go there right away.",9.165,8.322,"At the moment, there was nothing more to learn or do on the Piccadilly side; therefore, I wandered to the back of the house to see if anything could be obtained from this area. Since most of the houses on Piccadilly were occupied, the stables were busy. I asked a couple of grooms and servants I saw if they could tell me anything about the empty house. One of them said he had heard that the house had been purchased recently, but he couldn't say from whom. But until recently, there had been a signboard saying ""For Sale,"" and he suggested that the real estate agents Mitchell, Sons & Candy might be able to tell me something, as he thought he remembered seeing their name on the board. Not wanting to appear too eager or have my source guess too much, I thanked him in my usual manner and left. It was now beginning to get dark, and the autumn evening was setting in, so I wasted no time. Shortly after learning the address of Mitchell, Sons & Candy from an address book in Berkeley, I reached their offices on Sackville Street.",29.611,29.257,"For the moment, there was nothing to discover on the Piccadilly side and nothing could be done, so I headed to the back to see if anything could be seen from that side. The stables were full of activity, as most of the houses were occupied. I asked a couple of servants and stable hands, whom I could find, if they could tell me anything about the unoccupied house. One of them told me he had heard that someone had bought it recently, but he did not know who the new owner was. One of them, however, told me that until very recently there had been a sign that said ""for sale"" and that it was possible that Mitchell, Sons Candy, the moving agents, could provide more details, as he believed he remembered that this was the name on the sign for all inquiries. I did not want to seem too eager to my informant, nor let him guess too much, so after giving him my most sincere thanks, I walked away. It was getting dark and the autumn night was setting in, so I did not want to waste time. After finding the address of Mitchell, Sons Candy in a Berkeley telephone directory, I headed immediately to their offices, which were located on Sackville Street.",27.9,27.533

1431,"1 October.—I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny. He was, in fact, commanding destiny—subjectively. He did not really care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked him:—","• October 1 Once again, I cannot help but talk about the case of patient Renfield. First, his temperament suddenly changed just when I managed to grasp the reason why he behaved one way at one moment and another way at another moment. On the other hand, when his mood changes are not solely dependent on his inner comfort, studying the irregularities in his behavior seems to bring me considerable professional benefit. This morning, when I went to see him after he had an unpleasant conversation with Van Helsing, his behavior was exactly that of a person who is completely in control of his destiny according to his subjective inclination. Indeed, he did not bother with worldly matters at all. He was living on cloud nine, and from that lofty place, he looked down on us with disdain. I thought of asking him in the hope of understanding something more:",14.539,13.885,"October 1st. - Renfield surprised me once again. His mood changes so quickly that I find it difficult to keep up, and each time they signify more than just his own well-being, making them a subject of study that is more than merely interesting. This morning, after he turned Van Helsing away, when I went to see him, his demeanor was like that of a man who commands fate. In fact, he was commanding fate - subjectively. He was not interested in anything related to mere health; he was pensive and scornful of the needs of us poor mortals with our weaknesses. I thought I might learn something by seizing the opportunity, and so I asked him:",27.628,26.937,"October 1st. I am absolutely astonished by Renfield. His mood swings are so sudden that I have difficulty recording and adapting to them, and since they always have a meaning that goes beyond his own well-being, they form a more than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him, after he had rejected van Helsing, his manners were those of a man who was directing destiny. Indeed, he was giving orders to destiny, subjectively. He was not concerned at all with any earthly matters; he was in the clouds and looked from his watchtower at all the weaknesses and desires of us poor mortals. I decided to take advantage of the occasion and learn something, so I asked him:",40.569,40.133

He didn't know how to reason anymore, but he still shook his head vigorously and firmly replied:",5.934,4.002,"“Ah, so now you're after the soul, are you?” His madness was obstructing his reason, and with a determination I rarely saw in him, he shook his head from side to side as a look of astonishment spread across his face; he said:",22.158,19.901,"–Oh!

I could not at the moment recall Enoch’s appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:—","— Oh, no!

Van Helsing has gone to the British Museum looking for certain authorities on ancient medicine. The ancient doctors took certain things into account that their followers did not accept and the professor is looking for cures against demons and spells, which may be useful to us later.",33.91,33.349

If the traces of the old count are clearly discovered, then perhaps tomorrow will mark the beginning of the end of this terrible story.

If we could get an idea of what went through his mind in the time between our discussion today and his resumption of catching flies, it might have given us a valuable clue.

1492,"When I came to Renfield’s room I found him lying on the floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries; there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the floor—indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned him over:—","When I arrived at Renfield's room, he was still lying sprawled in a pool of blood on the floor, his body slightly tilted to the left. As I bent down to lift him up, I realized that he was severely injured, especially on his face: his face was the source of the blood pooling on the floor, it seemed as though he had been repeatedly slammed face-first into the ground.

I saw a young woman do it once at the Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward kink. But for the life of me I can’t imagine how the two things occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn’t beat his head; and if his face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of it.” I said to him:—","- Of course, he was injured because his face was repeatedly slammed into the floor. In the past, when I worked at Eversfield Hospital, I once saw a woman in a similar condition before someone managed to intervene in time. If his neck was broken, one could say he fell because he missed a step getting out of bed, but in this case, he was injured in the face and had a broken spine, it's really hard to understand... If his back was broken like this, how could he have slammed his face into the ground, and if he was already badly injured in the face before falling off the bed, there should be bloodstains on the bedding, right?",11.007,9.885,"“There are two things I can’t understand.

But I assure you that it is impossible for me to imagine how both things could have happened at the same time.

1505,"The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing’s face I gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded the words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think; but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men who have heard the death-watch. The poor man’s breathing came in uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it.","Each minute passed by slowly and terrifyingly. We all fixed our eyes on Dr. Van Helsing, everything now depended on his diagnosis. As for myself, to be honest, I didn't believe Renfield could tell us anything. I didn't even dare to think about it. The breathing of the unfortunate man was becoming more and more interrupted, although there were moments when he gave me the impression he was about to open his eyes to say a few words. His groans also became more labored, he was sinking into a complete coma. I felt I could no longer bear the overwhelming emotions surging within me because of him. Looking at the beads of sweat on my friends' foreheads, I understood that they were sharing the same feeling as I was.",3.267,2.523,"The minutes we waited passed with a dreadful slowness. There was a terrible sinking feeling in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face, I concluded that he too felt fear or anxiety about what was to come. I was afraid of the words Renfield might say. I was definitely afraid to think, but from what I had read about those who sense the death throes, I had an idea of what was going to happen. The poor man's breath was barely perceptible. She seemed as if she could open her eyes and speak at any moment, but then this was followed by long, rattling breaths, and then she would lapse into an even more stagnant stupor. Despite being accustomed to sickbeds and death, this doubt grew and grew within me. I could almost hear my own heartbeat, and the sound of blood rushing to my temples felt like hammer blows. The silence eventually turned into torture. I looked at my friends one by one and realized from their flushed faces and wet foreheads that they were enduring the same torture. Over all of us, there was a disturbing doubt, as if a terrible bell would ring above our heads at the most unexpected moment.",22.069,21.603,"The minutes during which we were waiting passed with dreadful slowness. I had a terrible thought, and from van Helsing's expression, I understood that he felt a certain fear or apprehension about what was going to happen. I feared the words that Renfield was going to utter. I truly feared thinking, but I was aware of what was happening, since I had heard of men who had heard the death clock. The poor man's breathing became labored and irregular. It seemed at every moment that he was going to open his eyes and speak, but then, there would be a prolonged and stertorous breath, and he would calm down, becoming even more insensible. Although I was accustomed to the beds of the sick and the dead, that expectation became increasingly intolerable for me. I could almost clearly hear the beats of my own heart, and the blood flowing in my temples resounded as if they were hammer blows. Finally, the silence became unbearable. I looked at my companions and saw in their flushed faces and the way they furrowed their brows that they were enduring the same torture as I was. A nervous suspense floated over all of us, as if a powerful bell were about to ring over our heads when we least expected it.",23.61,23.177
1506,At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he spoke:—,It is clear that death could come to Renfield at any moment. I turned back and looked straight into the old professor's eyes for a long time. — Don't waste another minute! - He said.,11.556,9.376,The moment finally came that indicated the patient's rapid decline; he could die at any moment.

1508,"Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments the breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest. Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare. This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved convulsively, and as he did so, said:—","The section where he immediately began his surgical work. The patient occasionally let out painful roars, then suddenly screamed a heart-wrenching cry.

I didn't think about it at the time, but after he left, I started to think, and knowing that He was taking ms Harker's life drove me crazy.” I could feel that the others were trembling like me, but we still remained silent. “That's why I was ready for Him when He came tonight. I saw the mist slipping in and grabbed it tightly. I've heard that madmen have supernatural strength, and knowing that I am mad - at least, from time to time - I decided to use my strength. Yes, and He felt it too, because He had to emerge from the mist to fight me. I held Him tightly and thought I would win; because I wouldn't let Him take ms Harker's life any longer; until I saw His eyes. His eyes burned inside me and my strength melted away like water. He escaped from my grip and when I tried to cling to Him, He lifted me up and threw me to the ground. There was a red cloud and a sound like thunder in front of me, and the mist seemed to be escaping under the door.” His voice was getting weaker and his breath more wheezing. Van Helsing instinctively stood up.",30.225,29.924,"–I didn't know she was here until she spoke to me, and she didn't seem the same. I'm not interested in pale people; I like them when they have a lot of blood, and it seemed like she had lost it all. I didn't think about it at the moment, but when she left here, I started to reflect on it and became enormously furious upon realizing that he was stealing her life. I noticed that everyone present shuddered, just like I did; but, apart from that, we all remained motionless. –So, when he came tonight, I was waiting for him. I saw the fog seeping through the window and grabbed him forcefully. I've heard it said that madmen have supernatural strength, and knowing that I was mad, at least sometimes, I resolved to use my power. He felt it too, as he had to step out of the fog to fight me. I held him tightly and thought I was going to defeat him, because I didn't want him to continue stealing her life away. Then I saw his eyes. His gaze pierced through me, and my strength abandoned me. He broke free, and when I tried to grab him again, he lifted me into the air and let me fall. There was a red cloud in front of me and I heard a noise like thunder. The mist seemed to escape under the door. Her voice was growing weaker and her breathing more labored. Van Helsing instinctively stood up.",25.364,25.013
1525,"“We know the worst now,” he said. “He is here, and we know his purpose. It may not be too late. Let us be armed—the same as we were the other night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare.” There was no need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words—we shared them in common. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we had when we entered the Count’s house. The Professor had his ready, and as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:—","- So he is here, not far away, and we also know who he is looking for. Perhaps it is not too late yet. Let's find weapons, just like the other night, but quickly, don't delay even a minute longer! There is no need to find words to describe our shock and fear at this moment. We ran frantically back to our room, looking for the items that had been used the day we entered the old count's house.

1533,"The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor. Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black. His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised the Count—in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left hand he held both Mrs. Harker’s hands, keeping them away with her arms at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck, forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man’s bare breast which was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten’s nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth, champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet, and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up under Quincey’s match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the Count’s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant despairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:—","The bright moonlight cast a golden glow on everything outside, even though it was blocked by the orange curtain hanging on the window, it was still bright enough to illuminate the room. We could clearly see everything happening inside. John Harker was lying there, on the bed near the window, but his face was as red as a gấc fruit, his breathing heavy in a state of unconsciousness. Kneeling on another bed, at the edge of the bed near us, was the figure of a woman dressed in white, and standing right next to her was a tall, thin man dressed in black. Although they were not facing each other, we immediately recognized him as the old count. His left hand was gripping the woman's outstretched arms tightly, while his right hand grabbed her neck roughly. Seeing us burst in, he turned around abruptly: before us was a pale face full of demonic features, exactly as Jonathan had described in his diary. Yes, I recognized in that face two eyes blazing with anger, a hooked nose like a hawk's beak breathing heavily, and two sharp, white fangs behind bright red lips. In a fit of rage, he pushed the woman down onto the bed and lunged at us. But Van Helsing managed to raise the holy wafer in front of him, forcing him to stand still and retreat, just like with Lucy outside the tomb the other night. The more we advanced, the more he retreated and shrank. Outside, a huge black cloud suddenly drifted across the moon, plunging the scene into darkness. When Quincey managed to turn on the light, all that was before our eyes was a thin mist slipping through the crack in the door. Van Helsing, Arthur, and I rushed to Mina's bedside. Her desperate scream echoed endlessly in my mind, making me feel that I would never be able to forget it for the rest of my life. She collapsed like a withered leaf, her face pale and twitching continuously, revealing sheer terror, while her eyes were vacant and lifeless like those of a mad person, and a small stream of blood was still trickling from her neck. Recognizing us, she covered her face as if to hide her shame and heartbreak. I understood that her scream was merely a temporary outburst of an emotion of boundless pain and despair. Quincey stood dazed, looking at Mina, then quietly went outside without understanding why, while Van Helsing gently pulled the blanket over her and whispered in my ear:",7.22,6.87,"The moonlight was so bright that even through the thick yellow curtain, the room was illuminated enough to see the surroundings. Jonathan Harker was lying on the bed next to the window; his face was flushed, and he was breathing heavily as if he had fainted. On the side of the bed facing us was his wife, with her face turned outward, her face as white as chalk. Beside her stood a tall, thin man dressed in black. His face was not turned towards us, but as soon as we saw him, we all recognized the Count - in every aspect, down to the scar on his forehead. With his left hand, he had grasped both of Mrs. Harker's hands, holding them away from her body; with his right hand, he had seized Mrs. Harker by the nape of her neck, pressing her face against his chest. Mrs. Harker's white nightgown was stained with blood, and a thin strip of blood was flowing from the man's bare chest, visible through his torn-open clothing. Their posture was eerily reminiscent of a child plunging a kitten's nose into a bowl to make it drink milk. As soon as we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and that previously described demonic look seemed to appear on his face. His eyes were glowing red with a demonic passion; the wide nostrils of his white, arched nose were flaring and trembling; the white sharp teeth behind his blood-dripping mouth's full lips clashed together like those of a wild animal. He flung his victim onto the bed with a violent jerk as if he had been thrown from a height, then turned and leaped at us. But during this time, the Professor had stood up and was holding the envelope containing the blessed bread towards him. The Count, just like Lucy had done outside her tomb, suddenly stopped and recoiled in fear. As we raised our crosses and advanced, he retreated further and further. A large, black cloud drifted across the sky, causing the moonlight to suddenly vanish, and when the gas lamp was lit by Quincey's match, we could see nothing but a faint wisp of smoke. It seemed to be slipping under the door, which had quickly opened and then returned to its original state. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved towards Mrs. Harker. By that moment, she had taken a deep breath and screamed with it. It was such a wild, ear-piercing, and despair-filled scream that I think it will continue to ring in my ears until the day I die. For a few seconds, she lay there helpless and disheveled. Her face was as pale as death, highlighted by the blood smeared on her lips, cheeks, and chin; a thin line of blood was flowing from her throat. Her eyes were wild with fear. Then, she brought her poor, clenched hands, which bore the red marks of the Count's terrible grip on their whiteness, to her face, and from behind her hands came a low, mournful moan that expressed that horrifying scream as a brief outburst of endless pain. Van Helsing stepped forward and gently covered her body with the bedspread, while Art, after looking at Mrs. Harker's face in despair for a moment, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:",27.197,27.047,"The moonlight was so strong that, through the thick yellowish curtains, the room could be seen clearly. On the bed, next to the window, lay Jonathan Harker, with a flushed face and breathing heavily, as if in a stupor. Kneeling on the nearest edge of the bed that faced outside, the white figure of his wife could be distinguished. Beside her was a tall, thin man, dressed in black. His face was turned to the other side, but as soon as we saw him, we all recognized the count..., with all the details, including the scar on his forehead. With his left hand, he held Mrs. Harker's two hands, pulling them along with her arms; his right hand grasped the back of her neck, forcing her to tilt her head towards his chest. Her white nightgown was stained with blood, and a slight trickle of the same precious liquid ran down the man's bare chest, which appeared through a tear in his clothes. The posture of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten to dip its nose into a saucer of milk, to make it drink. When we rushed into the room, the count turned his head, and on his face appeared the infernal expression I had heard described so many times. His eyes shone, reddish, with a demonic passion; the large windows of his white, aquiline nose were distended and trembled slightly; and his sharp, white teeth, behind the thick lips of his blood-sucking mouth, were clenched, like those of a wild animal. Turning abruptly, so that his victim fell onto the bed as if she had a weight, he lunged at us. But by then, the professor had already stood up and was holding out the envelope that contained the Sacred Host towards him. The count stopped suddenly, just as poor Lucy had done outside her tomb, and retreated. He retreated as we, with crucifixes held high, advanced towards him. The moonlight suddenly disappeared when a large black cloud moved across the sky, and when Quincey lit the gas lamp with a match, we saw nothing but a slight vapor that disappeared under the door, which, with the natural recoil after being abruptly opened, was back in its original position. Van Helsing, Art, and I hurried towards Mrs. Harker, who by then had caught her breath and let out a scream so sharp, so piercing, and so full of despair that it seemed to me I would be able to hear it until the last moments of my own life. For a few seconds, she remained in her posture full of helplessness and despair. Her face was ghostly, with a pallor that was accentuated by the blood that stained her lips, her cheeks, and her chin; a thin stream of blood flowed from her neck; her eyes were wide with terror. Then, she covered her face with her poor injured hands, which bore the red mark of the terrible pressure exerted by the count on them, and from behind her hands came a moan of desolation that made the terrible scream of a few moments earlier seem only the expression of endless pain. Van Helsing stepped forward and gently covered the lady's body with the sheets, while Art, looking at her pale face for a moment, with despair reflected in his countenance, left the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:",31.151,31.024
1534,"“Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers herself; I must wake him!” He dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was heart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the window. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the instant I heard Harker’s quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well be, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he started up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly, however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.","— According to my experience, Jonathan is also falling into a state of extreme terror that only “vampires” can create. We cannot do anything for this poor woman until she regains consciousness, but as for Jonathan, we must wake him up. The professor dipped a cloth into cold water and gently patted Jonathan's cheeks, while Mina continued to sob incessantly with her face in her hands. I pulled the curtain and looked out the window. The cloud drifted away, and the bright moonlight returned. I suddenly noticed Quincey walking and then running across the lawn in the garden, disappearing under a cluster of pine trees. What could be happening? I really don't understand. At the same time, Jonathan's half-awake, half-asleep cry startled me and made me turn back. I could read the surprise on his bewildered face. It took him at least a minute to return to reality before sitting up. Perhaps his sudden cry and jerky movements woke Mina up. She quickly turned towards him, her arms outstretched as if to embrace her beloved husband, but then she hastily pulled them back to cover her face, her whole body trembling violently.",4.784,3.851,"“Jonathan is in a fainting spell that we know could be caused by the Vampire.

I lifted the curtain and looked out the window. The moonlight was very bright, and as I looked out, I could see Quincey Morris running to the other end of the lawn and hiding behind a large yew tree. I was puzzled as to why he did this; but I heard the sound Harker made as he partially came to and returned to the bed. There was an expression of tremendous bewilderment on his face. He seemed dazed for a few minutes and then suddenly sprang up as if he had fully regained his senses. His wife was excited by his sudden movement and turned to him with her arms outstretched as if to embrace him, but instantly drew her arms back and brought her hands to her face, sobbing until the bed began to shake.",22.517,22.108,"–Jonathan is a victim of a stupor as we know only the vampire can cause.

Meanwhile, his wife covered her pale face with both hands and sobbed in such a way that it was heartbreaking to hear her. I lifted the curtains and looked out the window, and at that moment I saw Quincey Morris running across the lawn and hiding behind a yew tree. I couldn't imagine what he was doing there; but, at that moment, I heard Harker's quick exclamation as he partially regained consciousness and turned towards the bed. On his face, as was very natural, there was an expression of total astonishment. He seemed dazed for a few moments and then it seemed that full consciousness returned to him, and he began to sit up. His wife sat up due to the sudden movement and turned towards him, with her arms extended as if to embrace him; however, she immediately drew them back, brought her elbows together, and covered her face again, trembling so violently that the bed shook under her body.",23.474,23.052
1535,"“In God’s name what does this mean?” Harker cried out. “Dr. Seward, Dr. Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear, what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to this!” and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly together. “Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!” With a quick movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,—all the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. “What has happened? Tell me all about it!” he cried without pausing. “Dr. Van Helsing, you love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too far yet. Guard her while I look for him!” His wife, through her terror and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:—","— Oh my God! - Jonathan knelt down on the bed and lamented. - What is happening? Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, what is happening? What has happened? Mina, what is wrong with you? Why is your body covered in blood? Oh Lord! Oh God! Please help us, please help her! Then he leaped onto the floor as if ready to take action in response to the urgent demands of the situation. — What has happened here? Tell me! - He asked insistently, as if he couldn't believe the truth, his face still showing signs of shock. - Dear Dr. Van Helsing, I know you have devoted your noble friendship to Mina. Please save her! You can do it, it's not too late yet, right doctor? Please take care of her, so I can chase after him!

Help Mina! Oh, help Mina!” With a swift movement, he jumped out of bed and began to dress, - all his manhood awakened for a moment of effort. “What happened? Tell me everything!” He was shouting without stopping. “Dr. Van Helsing, you love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too far yet. While I search for him, you keep an eye on Mina!” Amid all his fear, horror, and sorrow, his wife saw the danger he would face; she immediately forgot her own pain, grabbed Jonathan, and cried out:",37.292,36.959,"–In the name of heaven! What does this mean? – exclaimed Harker-. Doctor Seward, Doctor Van Helsing, what does this mean? What has happened? Mina, dear, what is happening? What does that blood mean? My God, my God!

All his manly resolve awoke suddenly, feeling the need to spring into action immediately. –What has happened? Explain everything to me! – he said, without pausing at all-. Doctor van Helsing, I know you love Mina. Do something to save her! It can't be too late. Take care of her, while I go to find him! – his wife, in the midst of her terror, horror, and despair, saw some certain danger for him, because, immediately, forgetting her own pain, she clung to him and screamed:",29.563,29.154

1538,"“Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm and take counsel together.” She shuddered and was silent, holding down her head on her husband’s breast. When she raised it, his white night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking sobs:—","— Don't be afraid of anything, my friends, we are here, as long as the cross is with you, you will not be unfortunate. Tonight, you are protected. Don't worry too much, we need to stay calm to think about what needs to be done. Mina rested her head on her beloved husband's lap and did not complain any further, but her body trembled as if with fever. When she stood up, I suddenly noticed the piece of Jonathan's shirt on his chest stained with blood from her lips and other blood stains running down from her neck. As if realizing she had just been a victim of the Count, she startled and stepped back with a choking sob:",7.452,5.918,"“Don't be afraid, dear. We are here and no harm can come to you while we are near. You are safe for tonight, stay calm and we should discuss this matter together.” Ms. Harker, resting her head on her husband's chest, trembled and remained silent. When she lifted her head, the places on her husband's white nightshirt where her lips had touched and the open wound on his neck were stained with blood. Upon seeing this, she recoiled with a feeble moan and whispered amidst the sobs that choked her:",19.688,18.683,"–Do not worry, dear lady. We are here with you, and as long as this crucifix is by your side, no monster like those can come near you. You are safe tonight, and we must calm down and console each other. Mrs. Harker shuddered and fell silent, keeping her head resting on her husband's chest. When she raised her face, her husband's white shirt was stained with blood where her lips had touched and where the small open wound on her neck had let out a few drops. As soon as Mrs. Harker saw him, she recoiled with a low moan and a whisper, amidst tremendous sobs:",21.229,20.366
1539,"“Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have most cause to fear.” To this he spoke out resolutely:—","— Filthy, I have become a filthy person!... So I will never be able to embrace and kiss him again! Oh my God! Now I have become the most despicable enemy of him and everyone, I am the most contemptible person! — Don't say that, Mina!",4.579,2.321,"“Sinner! Sinner! I must not touch her again, I must not kiss her again. How terrible it is that I am her worst enemy and the one she should fear the most!” In response, Jonathan resolutely said:",7.79,5.3,"–Dirty, dirty! I must not touch or kiss him again. Oh! It is possible that I am now his worst enemy and that it is me whom he should fear the most. Upon hearing that, Jonathan spoke with resolve.",19.276,16.706
1540,"“Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour, if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!” He put out his arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous power to the utmost:—","— Don't say that, Mina! - Jonathan comforted in a determined voice - Why are you saying that? I won't allow you to say such things for any reason. No matter what kind of suffering I have to endure, there's no way I would abandon you. He hugged his petite wife tightly and held her close. She bit her lip, trying to stifle the sobs that seemed never-ending. Finally, when the sobs of the gentle wife had subsided, Jonathan tried to calmly ask me again, although his voice could not hide the tension:",2.393,1.356,"“This is nonsense, Mina. How shameful it is for you to say such a thing. I would not have expected to hear such a thing from you, and I don't want to hear it again. May God judge me as I deserve, and if anything comes between us through any action or desire of mine, may He punish me with a greater penalty than I now endure!” He extended his arms and drew his wife to his chest; for a while, Ms. Harker sobbed there. Over his wife's bowed head, he looked at us with wet eyes above his trembling nostrils; his mouth was as hard as steel. After a while, Ms. Harker's sobs became less frequent and weaker; then, Jonathan, with a forced calmness that I felt strained his nerves to the utmost, said to me:",23.903,23.223,"–Nothing of the sort, Mina! I am ashamed to hear those words; I don't want you to say anything like that about yourself, nor do I want you to even think such a thing. May God judge me harshly and punish me with suffering even greater than that of these moments, if by any act or word of mine there is a separation between us! He extended his arms and drew her to his chest. For a few moments, his wife remained embraced by him, sobbing. Jonathan looked at us over his wife's bowed head, with bright eyes that blinked incessantly, while the windows of his nose trembled convulsively and his mouth took on the hardness of steel. After a few moments, Mrs. Harker's sobs became less frequent and softer, and then Jonathan said to me, speaking with a studied calm that must have been putting his nerves to a severe test:",23.41,22.851
1541,"“And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad fact; tell me all that has been.” I told him exactly what had happened, and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to the open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door. They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence to him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming answered:—","— Dr. Seward, please tell me what happened. I only see that she seems too... Even though I didn't want to, I still tried to recount all the details of what had happened. He listened to me in silence, his eyes blazing with anger and a desire for revenge against that bastard. Despite that, he did not forget to caress the disheveled hair of his young wife. As I had just finished the story, Quincey and Lord Godalming knocked on the door and walked in. Van Helsing gave me a look as if to remind me to take advantage of their reappearance to divert the conversation, so that the unfortunate young couple would no longer be too preoccupied with each other.

Even then, while passion was evident on the white face above the bowed head, I was struck by the sight of his hands gently and tenderly stroking her disheveled hair. I had just finished speaking when Quincey and Godalming knocked on the door. Upon our invitation, they entered the room. Van Helsing looked at me with questioning eyes. I understood that he wanted to ask if we could use Quincey and Godalming's arrival to divert the attention of this unhappy couple from each other and themselves, if such a thing were possible; thus, upon my nod of agreement, Van Helsing asked them what they had seen and done. Lord Godalming responded to this:",28.372,27.954,"–And now, Dr. Seward, tell me everything that happened. I already know all too well what occurred, but please recount all the details. I explained to him exactly what had happened and he listened to me with forced impassibility, but his nostrils trembled and his eyes shone when I explained how the count's hands held his wife in that terrible and horrendous position, with his mouth pressed against the open wound on her throat. It interested me, even at that moment, to see that, although the face white with passion was convulsively contorted over Mrs. Harker's bowed head, the hands gently and lovingly caressed his wife's curly hair. When I finished speaking, Quincey and Godalming knocked on the door. They entered after we gave them permission to do so. Van Helsing looked at me questioningly. I understood that he wanted to indicate to me that it might be convenient to take advantage of the arrival of our two friends to distract the attention of the troubled spouses, so that they would not focus on each other for the moment; thus, when I gave him a nod of agreement, the professor asked the newcomers what they had seen or done.

Then she raised her head proudly, and held out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and kissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly. After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she began:—","Mina shuddered and leaned into her poor husband; I understood very well her tense state of mind at that moment.

1551,"“I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind—all of them connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.” Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly: “Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence. I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist—or rather as if the mist had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared—stood a tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of the others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of St. Mary’s Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was paralysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper, pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:—","On the contrary, the more time passed, the harder it was for me to sleep. My mind started to become chaotic and confused, filled with countless terrifying thoughts, and all those bizarre thoughts led me to envision death at the hands of the ""vampire,"" with blood, pain, and bitter sorrow. Jonathan was shocked to hear his wife recount her feelings of sorrow and humiliation; clearly, he was also very tense, but she turned to gently comfort him: — Don't think too much, my love. You have to be brave and strong so that you can help me get through this difficulty. If you understand that I had to try very hard to tell the terrible story tonight, then you will see how much I need your help and everyone's help.- Saying this, she turned to look at us.- Yes, I said I wanted to sleep, and I did everything I could to sleep. Surely at first, sleep must have come to me quickly, because I don't remember anything else. I don't even know when Jonathan came back. I just suddenly woke up and realized he was lying asleep a moment later. And the white mist once again drifted into the room...Forgot, I don't understand if everyone knows what I'm about to say...When you read what I just wrote, surely everyone will know about that white mist. Indeed, I had a premonition of the presence of a stranger in the room, and a vague feeling of fear began to surge within me. I turned to wake Jonathan but couldn't. He slept so soundly that I felt like he was the one who took the sleeping pills, not me. I felt my legs go weak as I stealthily glanced around the room, wondering what was happening. I was terrified when I suddenly realized that right next to my bed, there seemed to be a man's shadow, tall but thin, just stepping out of the mist, or rather, the mist suddenly dissipated, revealing a figure dressed entirely in black. According to the description I had read in Jonathan's diary, I immediately recognized it as Dracula. I intended to scream but couldn't, the fear had paralyzed my entire body. He pointed at Jonathan and ordered me in a whispering, ghostly voice: ""Shut up!",10.547,10.192,"""I took the sleeping pill you gave me with great delicacy, but it didn't take effect for a long time. It was as if my sleep had become even more alert, and my mind began to fill with countless horrific thoughts - all related to death, vampires, blood, pain, and distress."" Her husband groaned involuntarily and turned to her lovingly, saying: ""My concerns, my dear. You must be brave and strong and help me in this dreadful task. If you knew how much effort it took for me to recount this terrifying event, you would understand how much I need your help. Well, if it would be of any benefit to me, I realized that I needed to help the medicine work with my own will, and so, I resolutely went to sleep. I must have fallen asleep shortly after, because I don't remember the rest. Jonathan's arrival did not wake me, because in the next moment, Jonathan was lying beside me. There was a thin, white mist in the room, which I had noticed before. But now I forgot whether you knew this; you will find it in my journal, which I will show you later. I once again felt the same inexplicable fear and the same sense of someone's presence that I had felt before. I turned in bed to wake Jonathan, but I saw that he was sleeping quite deeply, as if he had taken the sleeping pill instead of me. I tried to wake him but could not succeed. This frightened me greatly, and I looked around in terror. Then my heart truly leaped into my mouth: Beside the bed, as if emerging from the mist - or rather, as if the mist had turned into a person, because the mist had completely disappeared - stood a tall, thin man dressed entirely in black. I recognized him from the descriptions of others. A face as white as a candle; a face where the light fell as a thin white line, an arched nose; lips parted to reveal sharp white teeth; the red eyes I seemed to have seen in the window at sunset in St. Mary's Church in Whitby. I also knew the scar on his forehead that Jonathan had left when he struck him. For a moment, my heart stopped, I would have screamed but I was paralyzed. He spoke in a sharp and harsh whisper, pointing to Jonathan:",26.781,26.582,"–I took the drug that you so kindly gave me, but for quite some time it had no effect. I seemed to be more and more awake, and countless phantoms began to fill my imagination... All of them related to death and vampires, to blood, pain, and despair -her husband involuntarily grunted, while she turned to Jonathan and lovingly said-: Don't get upset, darling. You must be brave and strong to help me through this terrible ordeal. If you knew what a great effort it takes for me to simply talk about this horrible matter, you would understand how much I need your help. Well, I realized that I had to try to help the medicine take effect through my own willpower if I wanted it to be of any use to me. Therefore, resolutely, I tried to sleep. I'm sure I must have fallen asleep immediately, as I don't remember anything else. Jonathan, upon entering, did not wake me, as my next memory is that he was beside me. There was the same light mist in the room that I had seen before. But I don't remember if you are aware of it; you will find everything about it in my diary, which I will show you later. The same vague terror as before seized me, and I had the same feeling that there was someone in the room. I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he was sleeping so deeply that it seemed it was he, not I, who had taken the drug. I tried as hard as I could, but I couldn't get him to wake up. That made me very scared and I looked around, terrified. Then, my heart skipped a beat: beside the bed, as if he had emerged from the mist or rather, as if the mist had transformed into him, since it had completely disappeared, there was a tall and thin man, dressed in black. I recognized him immediately from the description given to me by the others. By his wax-like white face; the long, aquiline nose, over which the light formed a thin white line; the slightly parted lips, between which appeared sharp, white teeth and the red eyes that I seemed to have seen at sunset in St. Mary's Church, in Whitby. I also knew the red scar he had on his forehead, where Jonathan had struck him. For a moment, my heart stopped and I wanted to scream, but I was paralyzed.

You may as well be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have appeased my thirst!’ I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not want to hinder him.

It is now six o’clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God knows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However, we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our faith is tested—that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us up to the end.

Today, who knows, there might be something that requires us to put in a lot more effort. I grabbed a pen and wrote a few lines here because if I stop, I'm afraid I'll start thinking all sorts of things. Indeed, everything we know so far hasn't been used for anything yet. But anyway, Mina and I still have to trust and hope for a good outcome in the end.

1562,"Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had heard anything. He said that he had been sitting down—he confessed to half dozing—when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield had called out loudly several times, “God! God! God!” after that there was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing asked if he had heard “voices” or “a voice,” and he said he could not say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as there was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear to it, if required, that the word “God” was spoken by the patient. Dr. Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As it was, he thought that on the attendant’s evidence he could give a certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily to the same result.","In fact, Dr. Seward had previously instructed a hospital attendant to watch over and stand guard in the hallway outside his room. The attendant had not fulfilled his duty, as he admitted that during his watch, he had dozed off. It was during this dozing off that he was startled by Renfield's frantic cries from the room: “Oh God! Oh God!... Oh God!...” Following that was a heavy thud on the floor. When he rushed in, he saw Renfield lying sprawled on the ground, exactly as Seward had witnessed. Van Helsing asked the attendant if there had been the voice of one person or many, but he could not answer. At first, he felt that the room could not have contained only Renfield, but when he rushed in immediately after hearing the thud, he saw no one else. And he swore that only Renfield had cried out “Oh God!” Dr. Seward told us that he didn't want to push the matter too far, as the authorities would surely conduct an investigation, and any further inquiry on our part would be of no use in revealing the truth, because no one would believe the truth we presented. He said it would be best to have the warden issue a death certificate for Renfield, concluding that he had an accident after falling headfirst from his bed. If an investigation were conducted, the authorities would only be able to reach such a conclusion anyway. But then, what will we have to do?

Dr. Seward, when we were alone, said he didn't want to delve into the matter, that the issue needed to be evaluated, and that the truth would never come out because no one would believe it. In this case, based on the nurse's testimony, he said he could issue a death certificate stating that the death was due to a fall from the bed.

1563,"When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next step, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full confidence; that nothing of any sort—no matter how painful—should be kept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of despair. “There must be no concealment,” she said, “Alas! we have had too much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can give me more pain than I have already endured—than I suffer now! Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!” Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly but quietly:—","All the men among us agreed on one decision: if we cannot return to Exeter, Mina will once again directly join our group, and she will be informed of all our actions. Thus, she will have the opportunity to share in the joy, sorrow, and anxiety with us during each discussion, and it will also be an occasion for her to demonstrate her courage. — Please, everyone, don't hide anything from me anymore, can you? I have had to remain silent and ignorant about many things already. Moreover, from what I have just learned, please don't think that I cannot endure anything more beyond the misfortunes I have experienced so far!

""There should be no more secrets from now on,"" she said, ""Unfortunately, we have had many secrets up until now. And besides, there is nothing in the world that could cause me more pain than what I have endured so far - and what I am enduring now! No matter what, it should give me new hope or new courage!""

Unfortunately, too many things have already been hidden from me. Besides, there is nothing in the world that can cause me greater pain than what I have had to endure… that I am still suffering!

The professor was sitting, but now he stood up and approached Mina, putting his hand to his head and said seriously:",8.127,5.673,"–I will do it, if there is no friend who wishes to save me, sparing me that pain and that desperate effort. Mina looked at the professor gravely as she spoke. Van Helsing was seated, but suddenly stood up, approached her, and, gently placing his hand on her head, solemnly declared:",17.582,15.67

He will act if you fall into danger. God will bear witness to this, I will never back down from danger for my friends, if necessary, I can act right now. But, madam...

1571,"“There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not die. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own.

You must struggle and strive to live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the night; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you do not die—nay, nor think of death—till this great evil be past.” The poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all silent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:—","— There is someone who has stood between you and death. You should not die like this. No hand can push you towards death, except your own hand. Until the day the one who tainted your life truly dies, you will not be able to die! As long as there is an immortal being alive to commit crimes like him, your death will make you become like him. You must live! You must fight, fight for life, even when you think that death would be a good thing to do. You must fight against death itself, whether it comes to you in times of sorrow or joy, day or night, peace or danger! To liberate your soul, I suggest you do not die... or never think of death, until that demon is destroyed! Mina's whole body was trembling violently as if she had a fever, her face pale like a real corpse. We remained silent, as no one knew what to say at that moment. It was only after a while, when she had calmed down, that she looked up and spoke to the professor in a sad voice:",12.753,12.11,"“There are some who will stand between you and death here.

Whether it comes to you with pain or joy, by day or by night, in safety or in danger, you must fight against Death itself! Until this great evil is buried in the past, I charge your living soul with this duty; you must not die - moreover, you must not even think of death.” My poor darling turned as white as a corpse, trembling and shaking as I have seen in the marshes with the rising tides. At last, she calmed a little and turned to Van Helsing, extending her hand to him sweetly but with great sorrow, and said:",24.664,24.203,"–There are several people here who would stand between you and death. You must not die in any way, and even less so by your own hand.

No! You must live! You must fight and strive to live, as death would be an unspeakable horror. You must fight against death, whether it comes to you in the midst of sadness or joy; by day or by night; safe or in danger. For the salvation of your soul, I beg you not to die and not even to think of death, as long as that monster has not ceased to exist! My poor and beloved wife turned pale as a corpse and shuddered violently, just as I had seen the quicksand shudder when someone fell into it. We all remained silent; there was nothing we could do.

I told her that she was to have all the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before. She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do—if “pleased” could be used in connection with so grim an interest.","— I promise you, our dear friend, that if God wants me to live, I will try my best until those terrible things come to an end.

I told Mina that she had to store all the documents in the safe and all the papers, journals, or phonograph cylinders that we might use later, and that she should take charge of keeping everything in order, as she had done before.

1574,"“It is perhaps well,” he said, “that at our meeting after our visit to Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay there. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our intentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours; and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must retain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out all his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be, in time, sure.” Here I started up for I could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so preciously laden with Mina’s life and happiness were flying from us, since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up his hand warningly. “Nay, friend Jonathan,” he said, “in this, the quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly. The Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have deeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he write on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings that he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet, where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt ‘stop the earths’ and so we run down our old fox—so? is it not?”","— After entering the abandoned Carfax house, - he began to get to the point - I think we were right not to rush to touch the crates of earth in there. Otherwise, the Count would easily guess our intentions and would certainly find a way to prevent us from finding the remaining crates. Until now, he has no suspicion about our purpose, he doesn't even know that we have the ability to neutralize all his crates of earth, leaving him without a single safe haven. Now we have enough information so that after breaking into the house in Piccadilly, we will also easily find the remaining wooden crates. Thus, today will be very important for us, perhaps this will be the day that decides our final victory. The rising sun will illuminate our misfortune and will protect us until the last rays of the day fade away! Indeed, until then, that demon will not be able to change shape. He will only be able to hide within the layers of earth for shelter, he cannot blend into the air or squeeze through narrow gaps. If he wants to pass through a door, he will have to open it like any other person. Therefore, we will have an entire day to find and destroy his lairs. Tonight, even if we haven't caught him to destroy him, we must drive him into a place where he cannot escape from us anymore. Hearing this, I could no longer remain silent: the thought that we were wasting every precious minute and second to reclaim joy and life for Mina was unbearable to me. — When we talk, it is also the time we do not act! As if understanding my impatience, Van Helsing waved his hand dismissively: — Wait a moment, just a little longer, my dear friend Jonathan! - He said. - For something this important, we should not rush if we want to achieve ultimate victory. When the time is right to act, we will act! Think about it, considering all possibilities, the house in Piccadilly is likely the place that will help us clarify many issues. Dracula may have bought many houses. If so, he must have many house purchase receipts, checkbooks, and keys for each house he bought... All of those things must be kept somewhere. Why not in the quiet house in the middle of London, where he can come and go through the main gate or the side door at any convenient hour without being noticed? We will have to explore the Piccadilly house, and once we discover what is stored inside, we can completely hunt the old fox down to its den. What do you all think?",6.91,6.334,"“Maybe,” he said, “it was good that we decided not to do anything about the soil boxes standing there during the meeting we held after our visit to Carfax. If we had done something, the Count would have guessed our purpose and undoubtedly taken precautions in advance to thwart our efforts regarding the other boxes, but now he does not know our purpose. No, moreover, he does not know that we have the power to purify his refuges, so he cannot use them as he used to. What we know about the locations of the boxes has increased so much that when we examine the house in Piccadilly, we can even trace the last boxes. So, today belongs to us, and our hope lies in today. The sun rising over our sorrow will protect us during its course. Until the sun sets tonight, that monster must maintain its current form. It is confined within the boundaries of its earthly outer shell. It cannot dissolve into the air, pass through cracks or crevices, and disappear. If it is to pass through the door, it must open the door like any mortal. And for this reason, we have today to search all its refuges and purify them. If we have not yet caught and destroyed it, we will undoubtedly catch and destroy it somewhere in time.” Here, I jumped to my feet because I could not control myself when I thought of these very precious minutes and seconds filled with Mina's life and happiness slipping away while we talked about possible actions. But Van Helsing raised his hand to warn me. “No, my friend Jonathan,” he said, “In this matter, as your proverb says, the fastest way home is the longest way. When the time comes, we will all take action and act very quickly. But think, the key to the situation is most likely in the house in Piccadilly. The Count may have bought many houses. He has purchase documents, keys, and other things related to them. There will be papers he will write on; there will be a checkbook. He has many items he needs to keep somewhere; why shouldn't these be in such a central, such a quiet place where he can enter through the front or back door at any moment, even at the busiest time of traffic, without anyone noticing! We will go there, search that house, and when we find out what is inside, as Arthur's hunting saying goes, we will ‘block the den’ and weaken our old fox - right?” “Then let's start immediately,” I shouted, “we are wasting precious, precious time!”",22.091,21.892,"–It is perhaps very convenient that when we visited Carfax we decided not to touch the boxes of earth that were there -he said-. If we had done so, the count could have guessed our intentions and, without a doubt, would have taken the pertinent measures in advance to thwart a similar effort regarding the other boxes, but now, he does not know our intentions. Moreover, in all likelihood, he does not know that we have the power to sterilize his refuges, so that he cannot use them again. We have advanced so much in our knowledge about the arrangement of those boxes that when we have visited the house in Piccadilly, we will be able to trace the last of the boxes. Therefore, today is ours, and in it rest our hopes. The sun that rises over us, amidst our sorrow, guides us in its course. Until the sun sets tonight, the monster must retain the form it now has. He is confined within the limitations of his earthly shell. He cannot turn into air, nor disappear through holes, openings, cracks, or crevices. To pass through a door, he has to open it, like all mortals. Therefore, we must find all his refuges today, to sterilize them. Then, if we have not yet caught and destroyed him, we will have to trap him in some place where his capture and annihilation will be certain, at the appropriate time. At that moment I stood up, because it was impossible for me to contain myself thinking that the seconds and minutes that were charged with the precious life of my beloved Mina and her happiness were passing, since while we were talking, it was impossible for us to take any action. But Van Helsing raised a hand, restraining me. –No, friend Jonathan -he told me-. In this case, the quickest way to get home is the longest, as you say. We will all have to act with desperate speed when the time comes to do so. But I believe that the key to this whole matter is, in all probability, in his house in Piccadilly. The count must have acquired several houses, and we must have the purchase receipts, the keys, and various other things for all of them. He will have paper to write on and his checkbook. There are many things he must have somewhere and, why not in that central, quiet place, where he can enter or leave, from the front or the back, at any time, in such a way that in the midst of the intense traffic, no one even notices him? We must go there and search that house and, when we know what it contains, we will do what our friend Arthur would say, referring to the hunt: ""close the grounds,"" to chase our old fox. Does that sound good to you?",25.315,25.138

Your police must indeed be zealous men and clever—oh, so clever!—in reading the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done, no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice; and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all they can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done en règle; and in our work we shall be en règle too. We shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem it strange; but we shall go after ten o’clock, when there are many about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house.”","Additionally, the success of the operation also depends on the gullibility of the local police officers. But my dear friend Jonathan, sometimes you can still use a hook to unlock hundreds of houses in London or anywhere else in the world without any trouble, as long as you create the right circumstances and do it at the right time. I can tell everyone a story that I once read. The story goes like this: There was a gentleman who owned a beautiful mansion in London. That summer, due to having to go to Switzerland for quite a long time, about five to seven months, he carelessly locked the house before leaving and didn't ask anyone to look after it. As a result, shortly after he left, a thief broke the glass of a window facing the garden and broke in. Once inside, he opened all the windows at the front of the house and boldly walked out the front door right in front of the police. After that, he openly advertised the sale of all the furniture in the house with a huge advertisement board posted on the wall outside the gate. He hired an auction representative to sell all the belongings of the gentleman who was in Switzerland. Then, he even sold the house itself to a building contractor because he found the ownership papers stored in the house. The contractor discussed with him to demolish the house on a specific day to build a new building. The police and city authorities thought he was the real owner of the mansion, so they facilitated this construction contract handover. Unfortunately for the real owner of the house, when he returned from Switzerland, all he saw was a giant hole in place of his familiar house. But what could be done, everything happened legally, following the city's buying and building regulations. Perhaps our work should also follow similar principles. We shouldn't arrive at Piccadilly too early to avoid the scrutiny of the police; only then will they not accidentally notice that our presence is unusual. At the earliest, we should only start from ten o'clock onwards, because by then, passersby will think we are the real owners of the house.",6.666,6.193,"""Then,"" he said, looking at me with sharp eyes while speaking, ""the only uncertain thing is the employer's conscience and your police officers' belief regarding whether that employer has a clean conscience or not. Your police officers, given that they trouble themselves with such a matter, must be willing and smart - oh, how smart - in reading the human heart. No, no, my friend Jonathan, even if you unlock a hundred empty houses in your London or any other city in the world and do the job as it should be done, no one will interfere with your work. I had read the story of a gentleman who had a very nice house in your London and went to Switzerland for a few months in the summer, closing up his house, only for a thief to break in through the back window. Then, the thief went and opened the shutters in the front and entered and exited through the door right in front of the police. After that, he held an auction in the house, announced it, placed a big advertisement, and on the day it came, sold everything the other man owned through a major auctioneer. Then he went to a contractor and sold the house to him, agreeing to demolish it and clear it all away within a certain period. And your police and other authorities provided him with all the help they could. And when that homeowner returned from his Swiss vacation, he found nothing but a big empty space where his house used to be. All of this was done en règle, and we will act en règle while doing our job. We won't go so early that the police, who don't have much to think about at those hours, will find the situation strange; we'll go after ten, at a time when there will be many people around and such things would be done by the real owners of the house.""",21.29,21.005,"–Then -he looked at me intently, while continuing -, all that will be in doubt is the conscience and opinion of the police as to whether it is the owner who called the locksmith and the opinion of the police as to whether the craftsman is working in accordance with the laws or not. Your police must be composed of careful and intelligent men, extraordinarily intelligent to read the human heart, if they are to be sure of what they should do. No, no, my friend Jonathan, you can go and open the locks of a hundred empty houses in your London or any city in the world, and if you do it in such a way that it seems correct, no one will intervene at all. I have read something about a gentleman who had a beautiful house in London and when he went to spend the summer months in Switzerland, leaving his house closed, a criminal broke one of the back windows and entered. Then he went to the front, opened the windows, raised the shutters, and walked out the front door, right in front of the police. Next, he held a public auction in the house, advertised it in all the newspapers, and when the appointed day came, he sold all the possessions of the gentleman who was away. Then, he went to see a builder and sold him the house, establishing the agreement that it should be demolished and all the debris removed before a certain date. Both the police and the rest of the English authorities helped him as much as they could. When the real owner returned from Switzerland, he found only an empty lot where his house had been. That crime was carried out in régle, and our work must also be carried out in régle. We must not go so early that the police suspect our actions; on the contrary, we must go after ten in the morning, when there are many officers around us, and we will behave as if we were really the owners of the house.",20.491,20.212

I did not mention this last, lest it should give her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood.

However, she still looks very pale and gaunt, and her lips are so dry that they reveal both rows of her teeth.

1594,"As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that, after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly; that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them. It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be able to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to follow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would not listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter in which I could be useful; that amongst the Count’s papers might be some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania; and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the Count’s extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina’s resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for her that we should all work together. “As for me,” she said, “I have no fear. Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present.” So I started up crying out: “Then in God’s name let us come at once, for we are losing time.

The two doctors among us will stay there, while Quincey and Lord Godalming will head to Walworth and Mile End to destroy Dracula's remaining hideouts. Van Helsing believes that there is a possibility that during the day, he might be at Piccadilly, and if that is the case, we will catch him. But no matter what, we must join forces to pursue him relentlessly. As for me, I do not entirely agree with his plan: I want to stay home to care for and protect Mina, but Mina is adamant about not listening. She says that the group might very well need me to resolve legal matters. She argues that among the Count's documents, there will surely be things that only I—who am familiar with Dracula—can understand, and in any case, to confront his extraordinary strength, we need as many people as possible. Her reasoning seems logical, so I cannot be stubborn. — Only if everyone goes together will I have something to hope for. - She told me. - As for myself, I have nothing to fear. The most horrifying thing is over, and all that can come to me now is a bit of hope and comfort. You must go with everyone, my love! If God is merciful, then even if I am left alone, He will protect me as safely as everyone is protecting me now! — Then in the name of God, - I said - let us set off immediately!

In any case, we could track him with all our might. Since my departure was also in question, I opposed this plan with all my strength, saying, ""Because I intend to stay here and protect Mina."" I thought I was determined on this matter, but Mina did not listen to my objection. She said that there might be a legal situation where I could be useful, that due to my experiences in Transylvania, there might be a clue among the Count's documents that only I could understand, and in that case, we needed all the strength we could gather to deal with the Count's extraordinary power. Since Mina's decision was final, I had to give in; she said that working together was her last hope. ""As for me,"" she said, ""I am not afraid of anything. Everything is already as bad as it can be, and there must be an element of hope or consolation in everything that could happen. Go, my dear husband!

Van Helsing had not intended to recall her frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort.

And oh, Madam Mina, dear, dear, we who love you hope to be there to see that the red scar, which is a sign that God knows what has happened, has passed and left your forehead as clean as the heart we know. Because we know as well as our own lives that when God finds it right to lift the great burden from us, that scar will also pass. Until then, we will carry our Cross just as His Son obeyed His will. Perhaps we are the instruments chosen for His sweet joy, and just as the other rose with blows and shame, with tears and blood, with doubts and fears, and with everything that separates man from God, we too will rise by His command.”",22.106,21.553,"–It is possible that you may have to bear that mark until God Himself wills it or for you to see it during the Final Judgment, when He rectifies all the wrongs of the earth and of His children whom He has placed upon it. And my dear Mrs. Mina, I wish that all of us who love you could be present when that reddish scar disappears, leaving your forehead as clean and pure as the heart that we all know! For I am as sure as I am alive that this scar will vanish as soon as God decides that the burden that overwhelms us should be lifted. Until then, we will bear our cross as His Son did, obeying His will. It is possible that we are chosen instruments of His good will and that we obey His command amidst stigmas and shames; amidst tears and blood; amidst doubts and fears, and through all that makes God and men different.",25.674,25.207
1605,"There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation. Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old man’s hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each other. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.","The sincere encouragement from the professor helped us understand that we need to endure when we must endure, and it seemed that behind that endurance, there was still a little something for us to hope for. Mina and I both felt it, we were truly moved, each of us bowed down, took one of his hands, and placed a kiss on it as a gesture of gratitude towards the heart of an old father. And before the sacred Lord, our whole group, without anyone telling anyone, knelt down together and swore to live and die together, united in strength and spirit, praying together for the Lord to help us overcome the calamity to complete our mission.",10.21,9.072,"There was hope and solace in his words, and it led to resignation.

It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew.

We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last. Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:—","We did not encounter any obstacles when entering the Carfax house. Everything in the house remained the same as the last time.

It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to God.” As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention was concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.","We will have to neutralize the soil contained in the wooden boxes. This is the soil that has been sanctified by devout memories and was transported here by the demon Dracula as a place of refuge. The reason he chose this soil is because it has been sanctified. Whether he fails or not partly depends on the effectiveness of these boxes of soil. Now, we will return this soil to God! He took a screwdriver and a universal key out of his bag to open the soil crates. A lid of a crate was pried open. The soil in the crate immediately emitted a musty, pungent odor that assaulted our noses.

At the corner of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green Park. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours.

The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the others.","— Sounds good! - Van Helsing praised.

I felt my heart pounding as if it were about to leap out of my chest when I caught a glimpse of the house in which we had placed so much hope for our success.

1618,"At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done. The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered along. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly fashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and turning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others entered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van Helsing’s went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock. This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and gave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction.","Finally, we noticed a horse-drawn carriage stopping in front of the house. Lord Godalming gracefully alighted along with Morris, followed by a locksmith carrying a toolbox. They slowly walked towards the steps. At the door, Godalming pointed to the lock that needed to be opened. The locksmith took off his outer coat, draped it over the railing, and turned to explain something to a policeman passing by on the street. The policeman nodded, said a few words, and then left, leaving the locksmith to start his work. He bent down, blew into the keyhole, and tried a large bunch of keys, finally finding one that fit after several attempts. Somehow, with just a slight nudge, the door swung open. The three of them immediately stepped into a hallway. We sat still, waiting. I kept puffing on my cigarette, while the cigar on Van Helsing's lips had gone out at some point. Nothing is more nerve-wracking than waiting. Finally, the locksmith swaggered out with his toolbox. He propped the door ajar with his knee, inserted a key, and handed it to Lord Godalming. After receiving his payment, he bowed to the ""homeowner"" and walked away. Clearly, no one had paid any attention to what had just happened in front of the house.",7.678,7.128,"Finally, we saw a four-wheeler arriving. Lord Godalming and Morris slowly got out of the carriage; a stout worker with a cross-woven tool basket in his hand got down from beside the coachman. Morris paid the coachman, who touched his hat and drove away. The two of them climbed the stairs together, and Lord Godalming showed what needed to be done. The worker slowly took off his jacket and, saying something to a passing policeman, hung it on one of the sharp points of the railings. The policeman nodded approvingly, and the man, kneeling on the ground, placed his bag beside him. After searching inside for a while, he took out some tools and arranged them neatly beside him. Then, he stood up, looked through the keyhole, blew into it, and turned to his employers to say something. Lord Godalming smiled, and the man took a large bunch of keys in his hand, selected one, and began to test the lock as if trying to feel his way with it. After trying and failing for a while by feel, he tried a second one, then a third. Suddenly, the door opened with a slight push, and he and the locksmith entered the hall. We waited without moving; my cigar was burning brightly, but Van Helsing's had completely gone out. We waited patiently when we saw the worker go out and bring his bag inside. Then he kept the door ajar and steadied it with his knee while placing the key in the lock. Finally, he handed this key to Lord Godalming, who took out his wallet and gave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat, and left; not a single person saw this entire process.",37.66,37.45,"Finally, we saw a four-wheeled car stopping nearby. From it, lord Godalming and Morris calmly disembarked, and from the driver's seat descended a stout man dressed in work clothes, carrying a box with the necessary tools for his task. Morris paid the coachman, who touched the brim of his cap and left. They ascended the steps together, and lord Godalming told the worker exactly what he wanted him to do. The worker took off his jacket, placed it calmly over the porch railing, and said something to a police officer who happened to be passing by at that precise moment. The police officer nodded, and the man knelt down, placing the toolbox beside him. After searching through his work tools, he took out several tools which he placed in order beside him. Then, he stood up, looked through the keyhole, blew, and, turning to our friends, made some remarks to them. Lord Godalming smiled, and the man raised a bunch of keys; he chose one of them, inserted it into the lock, and began to try it, as if blindly finding his way. After some time, he tried a second and a third key. Suddenly, as the employee pushed the door a little, both he and our two friends entered the vestibule. We remained motionless, while my cigar burned furiously and van Helsing's, on the contrary, went out. We waited patiently until we saw the locksmith come out with his toolbox. Then, he kept the door ajar, holding it with his knees, while he fitted a key to the lock. Finally, he handed the key to Lord Godalming, who took out his wallet and gave him something.

1620,"“The place smells so vilely,” said the latter as we came in. It did indeed smell vilely—like the old chapel at Carfax—and with our previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the place pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the house. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought! Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable, pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had treated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for any of his effects.","— This house is disgusting! - The Lord told us as the whole group went further inside. Indeed, the air in the house was filled with a smell exactly like the one we had first experienced in the Carfax house. There was no doubt about it, we were venturing into one of the count's hideouts. We checked each room one by one and carefully stayed close to each other, as the count could very well be hiding somewhere in the house. In the dining room at the end of the hallway, we found a total of eight wooden crates, while we had hoped to find nine! We slightly opened the small windows looking out onto a narrow stone-paved courtyard, separating the room we were in from a row of outbuildings—perhaps the stables—with no windows at all, so there was no fear of being seen. With that, we quickly took out the tools we had brought and opened each crate one by one, placing a piece of holy bread inside, just as we had done in the Carfax house. Having finished with the eight wooden crates, we continued our search.",8.466,7.809,"As we entered, ""This place smells disgusting,"" said Lord Godalming.

In the dining room at the back of the hall, we found eight boxes of earth. Only eight of the nine boxes we were looking for! Our work was not finished, and it would never be until we found that missing box. First, we opened the shutters of a window overlooking a narrow courtyard with stone paving, on the empty side of a barn painted to look like the front of a small house. There were no windows in the barn, so we had no fear of being watched. We did not waste time examining the boxes. With the tools we had brought, we opened them one by one and did to them what we had done to the boxes in the old chapel.

Indeed, the atmosphere was very unpleasant and foul-smelling, like the old chapel of Carfax, and, with our previous experience, we had no difficulty in understanding that the count had been using that place with complete freedom. Next, we set about exploring the house, and we all stayed together, anticipating some attack, as we knew we were facing a strong, cruel, and ruthless enemy and still did not know whether the count was in the house or not. In the dining room, which was located behind the vestibule, we found eight boxes of earth. Eight out of the nine we were looking for! Our work was not yet finished and would not be until we found the missing box. First, we opened the shutters that faced a courtyard enclosed by stone walls, at the back of which there were whitewashed stables that looked like a small house. There were no windows, so we were not afraid of being seen. We did not waste time examining the drawers. With the tools we had brought with us, we opened the boxes, one by one, and did exactly the same as we had done with those in the old chapel. It was evident that the count was not in the house at that moment, and we searched the entire building, looking for any of his belongings.",34.189,33.907
1621,"After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic, we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle; deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey; note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin—the latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to the other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us are, with what patience we can, waiting their return—or the coming of the Count.","After carefully inspecting every nook and cranny, we came to the conclusion that everything related to Dracula in this house was located in the dining room. Seemingly not satisfied, we told each other to meticulously check every item in the room again. Everything was thrown haphazardly on a very large dining table. There were many types of documents: deeds for the Piccadilly house, as well as the remaining houses in Mile End and Bermondsey, then writing paper, envelopes, ink bottles, and quill pens. A dust-covered piece of wrapping paper, a clothes brush, a hair comb, a jar, and a porcelain basin filled with dirty water that was red like blood. Finally, there were keys of all kinds and sizes, which I guessed were the keys to the other houses. Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris carefully noted down the exact addresses of the houses in Mile End and Bermondsey and took all the keys, putting them in their pockets to prepare to set off and continue destroying the remaining boxes of earth. Now, we will wait either for their return or for the appearance of the Count.",17.773,17.31,"After quickly glancing through all the rooms from the basement to the attic, we concluded that everything that might belong to the Count was found in the dining room, and thus we began to carefully examine them.

All of them were covered with a thin wrapping paper to protect them from dust. Additionally, there was a clothes brush, a brush and comb, a jug, and a bowl - the latter containing dirty water that appeared red, as if stained with blood. Finally, there was a bundle of keys of various types and sizes, likely belonging to the other houses. After examining this last finding, Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris, who were taking notes on the various addresses of the houses in the east and south, took a large bunch of keys and set out to destroy the boxes in those places.

There were property titles for the house in Piccadilly in a small pile; bills for the purchase of the houses in Mile End and Bermondsey; writing paper, envelopes, pens, and ink. Everything was wrapped in fine paper to protect it from dust. There was also a clothes brush, a brush and a comb, and a washbasin... The latter contained dirty water, reddened, as if it had blood in it. Last of all was a keyring with keys of all sizes and shapes, probably those belonging to the other houses. When we examined that last discovery, Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris took notes on the addresses of the houses to the east and south, took the keys with them, and set off to destroy the boxes in those places.

1624,"3 October.—The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep our minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker. The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see. Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn, haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in fact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, if all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then, in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his——! The Professor knows this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So well as I can remember, here it is:—","• October 3 Time seemed to stretch endlessly as we waited for Godalming and Quincey Morris to return. Van Helsing tried every way to boost our spirits. I could sense his good intentions, as he occasionally glanced at Harker. How miserable he looked at that moment. Just recently, he was so lively, quick, cheerful, and full of vitality, yet now he looked like a decrepit old man, with hair almost half gray, eyes sunken deep in worry and sorrow. However, I believe that within him still lies a great deal of strength that will flare up whenever life's realities demand it. Poor fellow! How can we console him now? Professor Van Helsing also understood his state of mind very well, so he did everything he could to help him temporarily forget the constant worry in his heart. What he said to him seemed to be for the highest benefit of all of us. — I have studied it a hundred times since I got the document about the demon.",5.795,4.7,"October 3. - Time seemed to pass terribly slowly while waiting for the arrival of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep our minds constantly engaged to keep them active. From his occasional sideways glance at Harker, I could see his good intentions. The poor man was crushed under a pain that was terrible to witness. Last night, he was a man with a strong, young face, full of energy and with dark brown hair, looking sincere and happy. Today, however, he is a weary, grim-faced man with white hair, sunken, burning eyes, and deep lines of pain etched into his face. His energy is still intact; in fact, he is like a living flame. This might still be his salvation, because if everything goes well, it will help him in this desperate situation; then, somehow, he will awaken again to the realities of life. Poor man, I thought my own troubles were bad enough, but his! The Professor knows this very well and is doing his best to keep Harker's mind occupied. The things he was saying were interesting under these circumstances. As far as I can remember, it went like this:",36.272,35.988,"October 3rd. The time seemed extremely long to us as we waited for Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. The professor tried to keep us distracted, using our minds without rest. I perfectly understood the beneficial objective he was pursuing with this, from the glances he occasionally cast at Harker. The poor man is overwhelmed by a sorrow that causes pain. Last night he was a frank man, with a cheerful appearance, a young and strong face, full of energy and with dark brown hair. Today, he looks like a withered and gaunt old man, whose white hair fits well with his bright eyes deeply sunken in their sockets and his facial features marked by pain. His energy remains intact, in fact, it is like a living flame. That may still be his salvation, because if all goes well, it will help him overcome the period of despair; then, in a way, he will reawaken to the realities of life. Poor guy! I thought my own despair and problems were severe enough; but this...! The professor understands it perfectly and is doing everything he can to keep him active. What he was saying was, under the circumstances, of extraordinary interest. These were more or less his words:",31.736,31.405
1625,"“I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of it. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth, he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and alchemist—which latter was the highest development of the science-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete. In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of man’s stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yet—he may be yet if we fail—the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must lead through Death, not Life.”","The more I study, the more I feel the need to destroy it by any means necessary. Everywhere I look, I see evidence of its growth; it grows not only in power but also in its own understanding of its power. According to what I have learned from my friend Arminius in Budapest, when it was alive, it was a man, a warrior, a general, and an extraordinary alchemist. Alchemy at that time was always a high-level expression of science. It must have been a person of extraordinary intelligence, unparalleled culture, and a heart of stone that knew neither fear nor remorse. In its being, the strength of its intellect remained intact even after its physical body perished, although its memory was not complete. To be precise, its mind was only comparable to that of a child. Yet it kept developing, some of its attributes suddenly matured from nothing and became perfected. It successfully experienced this through its own sinful life. If not stopped, it would surely become the progenitor or guide for a race of beings that only know existence steeped in death, unable to understand the true meaning of life.",4.9,3.871,"“Since the day they came into my hands, I have repeatedly examined all the documents related to this monster, and the more I worked on them, the greater the necessity of its complete destruction seemed. In all of them, there are indicators of how it progressed; not only of its power but also of its knowledge of that power. From the research of my friend Arminius in Budapest, I learned that he was a perfect man while alive. A soldier, statesman, and alchemist - the latter being the greatest advancement in the science of his time. He had a great mind, an education incomparable to anyone else, and a heart that knew neither fear nor remorse. He even dared to enter Scholomance and there was no branch of knowledge he did not engage in during his lifetime. Well, his mental powers survived physical death; although, his memory seemed incomplete. In some aspects of the mind, he was like a child, and still is, but he is growing now, and some traits that were initially childish have now become fitting for a man. He is conducting experiments and doing it well, and if we had not stood in his way, he could have been the father or supporter of a new species whose path lies through Death, not Life - if we fail, he still might be.”",24.613,24.208,"–I have been studying, systematically and repeatedly, ever since they came into my hands, all the documents related to that monster, and the more I have examined them, the greater seems the need to erase him from the face of the earth.

He even allowed himself to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he had not tried.

Regarding some mental faculties, he has been and is like a child, but he is growing, and certain things that were childish at first are now of manly stature.

However, he is determined to succeed, and someone who has left behind centuries like him can always wait and gradually move forward without any need to rush.

1630,"“Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has been making use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friend John’s home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by an inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he might not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he found that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he progress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where they are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his hiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him; and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he can move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is there not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are five of us when those absent ones return.”","— Alright, I'll be more explicit for you to understand, my friend! Have you noticed that over time, that demon has been increasingly enhancing its knowledge through practical experiences? You probably still remember that it used the name of the patient Renfield to infiltrate your friend John's asylum, because if a ""vampire"" wants to enter a stranger's house for the first time at any time, it can only be guided by an acquaintance. But that's not the most important thing. We know that initially, those heavy wooden crates were carried by others - not by it. It didn't realize that it could do much more than that. However, the utmost intelligence of a child gradually developed within it, to the point where it had to ask itself if it could lift the crates. It started by helping others lift the crates, and when it realized it was too easy a task, it tried to carry them alone. It succeeded and is now plotting to spread the crates around as hiding places, only it knows where they are hidden. It might plan to bury them deep underground. In the evening, or when it can change its form, these graves are very suitable for it to hide in, and no one can detect its movements. But don't be disheartened, my friend! Even if that knowledge is applied now, it's already too late. All the crates, except for one that we haven't found, have been rendered useless. I hope that before the sun sets, the last crate will meet the same fate. It wasn't until this morning that I had such confidence. But right now, the outcome is still uncertain. According to my watch, it's now one o'clock; if everything goes smoothly, our friends Arthur and Quincey should be on their way back. We must proceed ahead, perhaps slowly, but surely, and above all, not miss any opportunity. Just think about it! When those friends return, we will be five in total!",5.959,5.362,"The professor gently placed his hand on Harker's shoulder as he spoke: ""Ah, my child, I will speak plainly. Don't you see how this monster has recently been infiltrating knowledge in an experimental manner? How he used the zoophagous patient to enter our friend John's house; because your Vampire, although he could enter whenever and however he wanted later, could only enter initially when invited by someone from inside. But these are not the most important experiments. Don't we see how these large boxes were initially carried by others? At that time, he didn't know it had to be that way. But that great, childlike mind of his kept evolving, and then he thought about whether he could carry the box himself. So, he started helping the carriers, and then, seeing there was nothing to it, he tried to carry them alone. And thus he made progress and distributed his graves; now no one but him knows where they are hidden. He might have intended to bury them deep. Thus, he would only use them at night or when he could change form, both of which would suit his purpose, and no one would know these were his hiding places! But my child, do not despair; this knowledge came to him far too late! We have already purified all but one of his sanctuaries, and this will be dealt with before sunset. Then, he will have no place to move and hide. I did not allow us to act hastily this morning so that we could be sure. Don't we have much more at stake compared to him? Then why shouldn't we act more cautiously than him? According to my watch, it is one o'clock, and if all is well, our friends Arthur and Quincey have already set out towards us. Today is our day, and we must proceed with sure steps, even if slowly, and not miss any opportunity. Look! When those who are not with us now return, we will be five.""",18.796,18.484,"–Very well, my friend, I will be more explicit. Don't you see how, lately, that monster has acquired knowledge experimentally? He has been using the zoophagous patient to gain entry into friend John's house. The vampire, although he can enter as many times as he wishes afterward, can only enter a building initially if one of the inhabitants invites him in. But those are not his most important experiments. Didn't we see that at first all those heavy boxes of earth were moved by others? I didn't know what to make of it then, but afterward, everything changed. During all this time, his infantile brain has been developing, and he began to think about whether he could move the boxes himself. Consequently, later, when he discovered that it wasn't difficult for him to do so, he tried to move them alone, without anyone's help. Thus, he progressed and managed to distribute his tombs in such a way that only he now knows where they are located. It is possible that he thought of burying the boxes deeply in the ground so that he only uses them at night or at times when he can change form; it is equally convenient for him, and no one can know where his hiding places are! But do not despair, my friends, he acquired that knowledge too late! All the hiding places, except one, must have already been sterilized, and before sunset, they all will be. Then, he will have no place left to hide. I delayed this morning to be sure of it. Aren't we risking something much more precious than he is? Then, why aren't we more careful than he is? From my watch, I see that it is already one o'clock, and if all goes well, our friends Arthur and Quincey should already be on their way to join us. Today is our day, and we must proceed with confidence, albeit slowly, taking advantage of every opportunity that presents itself. Look!

Hopefully, our two friends will arrive before them.",8.4,7.294,"“Ah, hush, hush, my child!” said Van Helsing. “God does not buy souls in this way, and even if the devil does, he does not keep his word.

Do not fear any of us; we have all dedicated ourselves to this cause and will see it through to the end today. The time for action is coming; today this Vampire is limited by human power and will not be able to change until sunset. It will take time for him to arrive here - look, it is twenty past one - and there is still time before he can get here, he will never be that quick.

The time has come to take action; today, that vampire is limited by human powers and, until sunset, he cannot change.

1638,"About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker’s telegram, there came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made the Professor’s heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various armaments—the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood back, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the hall:—","About half an hour after receiving Mina's call, we were startled once again when we heard the light but determined knocks on the door. We nervously stepped into the hallway, weapons in hand, and the professor gently pulled the latch and stepped back with me, ready to defend.

They quickly stepped in and slammed the door shut.",6.151,5.457,"About half an hour after receiving Ms. Harker’s telegram, the hall door was knocked on quietly but firmly.

We looked at each other and went out into the hall together; both of us ready to use our various weapons - the spiritual ones in the left hand, the deadly ones in the right hand. Van Helsing drew the bolt and opened the door halfway, stepping back with both hands ready for action. When we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris on the threshold, close to the door, the joy in our hearts must have shown on our faces. They quickly came inside and closed the door behind them; as they moved through the hall, Lord Godalming began to speak:",35.127,34.676,"Approximately half an hour after we received Mrs. Harker's telegram, we heard a loud and resolute knock on the front door, similar to the one hundreds of gentlemen would give on any door. We looked at each other and headed towards the hall; we were all prepared to use all the weapons at our disposal... the spiritual ones in the left hand and the material ones in the right. Van Helsing removed the latch and, keeping the door ajar, took a step back, with both hands ready for action. The joy in our hearts must have been clearly reflected on our faces when we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris near the door. They entered quickly, and closed the door behind them, and the last of them said, as we all advanced through the hall:",29.896,29.405

That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only suspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would suspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a short time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to Mile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be carried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not have long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your arms! Be ready!” He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.","- Van Helsing said while looking at his watch. - According to the telegram Mina just sent, he left Carfax heading south, which means he has crossed the river, that is, a little before one o'clock. If he is heading south, we can conclude that he still suspects our interference and from Carfax, he will first go straight to the place he suspects. You must have arrived in Bermondsey shortly before him. Since he hasn't shown up here yet, it proves that he then went around to Mile End. That detour cost him quite a bit of time, as he needed to find a way to cross the river. So we won't have to wait much longer. We should probably prepare our attack plan now, let's not waste any more time. Shh! He's here! Grab your weapons! Indeed, we heard the sound of the lock turning outside the main door.",8.448,7.434,"“He will be here soon,” said Van Helsing, who was looking at his pocket notebook at the time. “Nota bene, Madam’s telegram says he went south of Carfax, which means he will cross the river and can only do so when the tide is low, which should be before one o’clock. His going south has significance for us. He is still only suspicious and went first to the place where he would encounter the least obstacles from Carfax. You must have been in Bermondsey just a little before him. The fact that he hasn’t come here yet indicates that he then went to Mile End. This must have taken some of his time, because after that, he must have been transported by some means on the river. Believe me, my friends, we won’t have to wait much longer from now on. We need to have an attack plan ready so that we don’t miss any opportunity. Shh! We have no more time. Get all your weapons!

The fact that he headed south has some significance for us. He still only suspects, and he went from Carfax to the place where he least suspects he might encounter any obstacle. You must have been in Bermondsey very shortly before him. The fact that he hasn't arrived here yet shows that he went to Mile End first. That will take some time, since he will have to cross the river again somehow. Believe me, my friends, we won't have to wait much longer now.

1644,"I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door. Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise—at least he feared it.","Although it was a tense moment, I still secretly admired Quincey's calm bravery. In all our adventures, he was always the one to organize the action plans, and Arthur and I always followed his arrangements to the letter. Now, as well, we immediately reverted to that daily habit. After scanning the room, he pointed to where each person in the group should stand. Van Helsing, Harker, and I stood right behind the door so that as soon as it opened, we could immediately block the intruder's retreat. Arthur and Quincey hid in a spot, ready to jump in front of the window. We anxiously, tensely waited as each nightmarish second passed. Slow, cautious footsteps began to echo quite clearly in the hallway outside. It was clear that the Count was expecting an attack, or at least he was afraid of one.",16.35,15.848,"Even in such a moment, I couldn’t help but admire the way the dominant spirit manifested itself. In all our hunting parties and adventures around the world, Quincey Morris has always been the one to draft the plan of action, and Arthur and I had become entirely accustomed to following him.

Godalming behind and Quincey in front, were ready to head to the windows, hidden for the moment where they could not be seen.

1645,"Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something so panther-like in the movement—something so unhuman, that it seemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door leading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of lion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single impulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what we were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would avail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count’s leap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne through his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold fell out. The expression of the Count’s face was so hellish, that for a moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity—of anger and hellish rage—which came over the Count’s face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous dive he swept under Harker’s arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw himself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass, he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the shivering glass I could hear the “ting” of the gold, as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging.","Suddenly, he burst into the room, catching us off guard. His leap had a certain grace and an inhuman quality that left us stunned. The first to act was none other than Harker. He leapt like lightning to block a doorway leading to the front room. Seeing us, he tilted his head back and laughed contemptuously, baring his sharp, jagged fangs, but he immediately fell silent, his terrifying laugh replaced by a malicious and sinister glare. His malevolence became more apparent as we slowly approached him. To be honest, at that moment, I no longer knew what to do. I didn't know if the weapons we carried would have any effect on him. Clearly, Harker intended to find out, as he angrily thrust a knife straight at him. The count could only escape thanks to a lightning-fast, demonic leap backward. Instead of piercing his chest, the knife's tip merely tore through his coat, spilling a stack of banknotes and a pile of gold coins. The old man let out an angry, furious roar, which made me worry for Harker, even though I saw him raise a long, sharp knife, ready for a new attack. Instinctively, holding the cross and a piece of holy bread in my left hand, I quickly stepped forward to protect my brave companion. I felt my arm being guided by an invisible force, and it did not surprise me to see the demon stagger backward within our encirclement. The hatred and ferocity, anger and madness on the demonic face of the count were indescribable. His face gradually changed from purple-red to pale, in stark contrast to his fiery eyes filled with hatred. In an instant, he ducked under Harker's arm like a cat before he could deliver another powerful blow. He bent low, quickly grabbed a handful of gold coins, and then hurled himself through the window, shattering the shutters into countless glittering pieces. Amidst the sound of breaking glass was the clattering of gold coins rolling on the ground.",7.941,7.603,"Suddenly, with a single leap, he burst into the room; before any of us could raise a hand to stop him, he passed among us. There was something panther-like in his movement -something very inhuman that seemed to rouse us from the shock of his arrival. The first to act was Harker, who, with a swift motion, flung himself in front of the door leading to the front of the house. When the Count saw us, a terrible expression appeared on his face, showing his long and sharp canine teeth, but the demonic grin quickly gave way to a lion-like pride. When we all advanced on him with a single impulse, his facial expression changed again. It was a pity that we had not made a more organized plan of attack, for even at that moment, I was wondering what we would do. Personally, I did not know whether our deadly weapons would be of any help. Harker, clearly wanting to test this, prepared the large kukri and delivered a ruthless and unexpected blow to the Count with it. It was a powerful strike; however, the demonic speed of the Count's backward leap had protected him. If he had been a second late, the sharp blade would have cut through his heart. As it was, the kukri only cut through the fabric of his coat, and from the wide gash, a bundle of paper money and plenty of gold spilled out. The Count's expression was so diabolical that, even though I saw the terrible kukri being raised for another blow, I feared for Harker, and instinctively, with a protective impulse, I leaped forward with the cross and blessed bread in my left hand. I felt a great power flow from my arm to my hand, and it did not surprise me at all to see the Count recoil in fear as we all made similar spontaneous movements. It is impossible for me to describe the expression of hatred and thwarted malice -the rage and demonic fury- on the Count's face. His pale face turned a greenish-yellow, contrasting with his blazing eyes, and the red scar on his forehead seemed to pulse like a heartbeat on his pallid skin. The next moment, with a serpentine dive, he slipped under Harker's arm before the blow could land, grabbed a bundle of money from the floor, and darted to the other side of the room, throwing himself out the window. Amid the crash and sparkle of the falling glass, he fell to the stone-paved area below. Amid the crash of the glass, I could hear the clinking of some of the gold coins as they hit the stone ground.",29.79,29.621,"Suddenly, with a huge leap, he entered the room, passing between us before any of us could even raise a hand to try to stop him. There was something so feline in the movement, something so inhuman, that it seemed to wake us all from the shock his arrival had caused. The first to take action was Harker, who, with a quick movement, positioned himself in front of the door leading to the front room of the house. When the count saw us, a kind of sinister mocking gesture appeared on his face, revealing his long and pointed fangs; but his malignant smile quickly vanished, replaced by a cold expression of deep disdain. His expression changed again when, all together, we advanced towards him. It was a pity that we hadn't had time to prepare some good attack plan, as at that very moment I wondered what we were going to do. I was not at all convinced that our lethal weapons would protect us. Evidently, Harker was willing to try, as he prepared his large kukri knife and delivered a terrible slash at the count. The blow was powerful; only the count's diabolical speed of movement allowed him to escape unharmed. One more second and the sharp blade would have pierced his heart. In reality, the tip only cut through the fabric of his jacket, creating a huge hole from which a bunch of banknotes and a stream of gold coins spilled out. The expression on the count's face was so infernal that for a moment I feared for Harker, even though he was already prepared to deliver another slash. Instinctively, I stepped forward with a protective impulse, holding the crucifix and the Sacred Host in my left hand. I felt a great power coursing through my arm and was not surprised to see the monster retreating at the similar movement made by each and every one of my friends. It would be impossible to describe the expression of hatred and terrible malignancy, of infernal rage and fury, that appeared on the count's face. His waxy skin turned yellowish-green, contrasting with his red, burning eyes, and the red scar on his forehead stood out sharply, like an open, throbbing wound. An instant later, with a sinuous movement, he slipped under Harker's armed arm before he could deliver his blow, grabbed a handful of the money on the floor, crossed the room, and hurled himself at one of the windows. Amid the tinkling of broken glass, he fell into the courtyard below the window. Amid the noise of the shattered glass, I managed to hear the sound of several sovereigns hitting the ground, on the asphalt.",30.385,30.22
1646,"We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door. There he turned and spoke to us:—","Looking out the window, I saw him calmly stand up as if nothing had happened.

That's how it is! The old man threw his head back and laughed triumphantly and disdainfully, then slammed the door shut. We clearly heard the sound of him sliding the bolt behind the door. After that, there was the sound of the door opening and closing once more. We understand that chasing him into the stable at this moment is very difficult. So, we have failed!

1654,"We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry people—for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast—or the sense of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to her husband’s arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could protect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however, till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up to the present time. Then without letting go her husband’s hand she stood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our teeth—remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and purity and faith, was outcast from God.","We returned home in a gloomy mood.

Staying true to our word, we told Ms. Mina everything that had happened, and although she paled even more at times when the danger seemed to threaten her husband and blushed at other moments when her husband's devotion to her was mentioned, she listened bravely and calmly. When we got to the part where Harker unhesitatingly attacked the Count, she clung to her husband's arm and held on tightly as if her grip could protect him from any danger that might come. But she did not say anything until the entire account was finished and the events were brought up to the present moment. Then, without letting go of her husband's hand, she stood up among us and spoke.

Keeping our promise, we recounted to Mrs. Harker everything that had happened, and although she turned intensely pale at times, when her husband was in danger, and blushed at other times, when the devotion he felt for her was evident, she listened to the entire story bravely and remained calm. When we reached the moment when Harker had lunged at the count with such determination, she grasped her husband's arm tightly and remained that way, as if by holding his arm she could protect him from any danger he might have faced. However, she said nothing until the narration was finished and when she was fully aware of everything that had happened up to that precise moment, then, without letting go of her husband's hand, she stood up and spoke to us.

1662,"3-4 October, close to midnight.—I thought yesterday would never end. There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must now be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one earth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If he chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in the meantime!—the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now. This I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that one is my poor wronged darling. I love her a thousand times more for her sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster seem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is sleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might be like, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been so calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March. I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy myself, though I am weary—weary to death. However, I must try to sleep; for there is to-morrow to think of, and there is no rest for me until....","• October 3 - 4, after midnight It seemed like yesterday would never end. There was something urging me to fall asleep, a vague belief telling me that when I woke up, I would witness a change and from now on, everything would change favorably for us. Before wishing each other good night, we had a discussion about the next step but did not come to any conclusion. All we knew was: there was still a wooden crate where the old count could hide, and only he knew where it was hidden. If he chose to remain in hiding, he would force us to fail for many years, but what we needed right now... The prospect before us was truly terrifying, making me afraid to make any guesses. I am not sure about one thing, that is if there ever was a perfect woman, but with a tragic fate, it would be my beloved wife. The more I thought, the more I loved her to the point of heartache and the more I hated that demon a thousand times over. Surely God would not let this world be impoverished by the loss of a creation like her. So within me surged a hope of certain victory. Now we are lost and have only one anchor left, which is faith. Thank God, Mina slept without any troubling dreams. I am very afraid of what might be in her dreams stemming from her terrifying memories. Since dusk until now, I have not seen her show any signs of pain or distress. In a moment, I recognized the peace on her face, like the spring weather after the sudden rains of March... I did not feel sleepy, even though I felt utterly exhausted. However, I forced myself to sleep, needing to think about tomorrow. I will not be at ease until...",13.995,13.58,"3-4 October, near midnight. - I thought yesterday would never end. I fell asleep with a blind belief that everything would be different when I woke up and that any change would now be for the better. Before parting, we discussed what our next step would be, but we couldn't reach a conclusion. All we knew was that there was one more of the earth boxes and only the Count knew where it was. If he chose to hide, he could keep us at bay for years, and in the meantime... The thought is so terrifying that I dare not even think of it now. This I know: If there is a perfectly virtuous woman, it is my poor, wronged beloved. Because of the sweet pity I felt last night—a pity so profound that it made even my hatred for the monster seem base—I love her a thousand times more. God will surely not allow the world to become more wretched by losing such a creature. This is my hope. Now we are all caught in the current, heading towards the shallow rocks, and faith is our only assurance. Thank God! Mina is sleeping and not dreaming. I fear what her dreams might be like, based on such terrible memories. From what I can see, she hasn't been very calm since sunset. Then, for a while, a peace settled on her face, like the calm that follows the sudden winds of March. At the time, I thought it was the softness of the red sunset falling on her face, but now I think it has a deeper meaning somehow. Despite being very exhausted—dead tired—I am not sleepy. But I must try to sleep because there is a tomorrow I need to think about, and there is no peace for me until then...",36.462,36.259,"October 3-4, near midnight. I thought yesterday would never end.

The only thing we knew was that there was still one box of earth left and that only the count knew where it was. If he wishes to remain hidden, he can confuse us for years on end and, in the meantime, the thought is too horrible; I cannot allow myself to think about it at this moment. What I do know is that if there has ever been an absolutely perfect woman, it is my beloved and wounded wife. I love her a thousand times more for her sweet compassion last night; a compassion that made even the hatred I have for the monster seem despicable. I am sure that God will not allow the world to be impoverished by the loss of such a creature. That is a hope for me. We are all heading towards the rocks, and hope is the only anchor I have left. Thank God, Mina is asleep and not having nightmares. I dread to think what her nightmares could be, with such terrible memories that could provoke them. She hasn't been this calm, as far as I could see, since sunset. Then, for a moment, a calm spread over her face, like spring after the storms of March.

We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men, since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but that sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the Count’s mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan’s so fierce knife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear me, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He have take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. He think to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would say when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and we must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a little while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters between us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he would—unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or slack tide.

That ship, even if it exists, has already set sail. Indeed, at this moment, there are ships setting sail from the port of London. But do you know which ship to look for? Thank God we have this information, even though we don't know where the ship is headed. Sometimes we are blind, as blind as mere mortals. Now we understand why the count was so determined to gather those banknotes even when Jonathan threatened him with a knife. He wants to flee, flee from England! He has only one crate containing filthy earth that can protect him, with many people hunting him like hounds chasing a fox. He has thrown that remaining crate of earth onto the ship and abandoned this country. He intends to escape us, but no, we will pursue him! He is truly cunning, and it is because of this cunning that we must track his footsteps. So am I, I am no less cunning, I understand his thoughts very well. In the meantime, we can rest comfortably without worry, for the sea has separated us from him. Come on! The sun is up, the whole day, until dusk, is ours. Take a bath, rest, and then have a little breakfast to feel better, for the count is no longer on the same ground as us.

We were partly blind; blind because of people's attitudes, because if it was possible for us to have seen what we might have seen, when we look back, we see what we can see when we look forward. Alas! But this sentence turned out like mud; didn't it? Despite Jonathan's furious knife scaring him, we now know what went through the Count's mind as he grabbed that money. He is thinking of escaping. Listen to me, ESCAPING! With only one remaining soil box and a pack of men chasing him like dogs chasing a fox, he realized that this London is not a place for him. He loaded his last soil box onto a ship and left the country. He thinks of escaping, but no! We are going after him. As our friend Arthur would say when he puts on his red coat, Tally Ho! Our fox is cunning, ah! So cunning that we must also pursue him cunningly. I am also cunning, and I will think with his mind for a while. During this time, we can rest and be at peace because there are waters between us that he does not want to cross and cannot cross even if he wanted to - of course, unless the ship runs aground and this can only happen at full or slack tide.

But do you stay and take care of her to-day. This is your best and most holiest office. This day nothing can find him here. Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already, for I have tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away; he have gone back to his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand of fire wrote it on the wall. He have prepare for this in some way, and that last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took the money; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun go down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb that he think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him. But there was not of time. When that fail he make straight for his last resource—his last earth-work I might say did I wish double entente. He is clever, oh, so clever! he know that his game here was finish; and so he decide he go back home. He find ship going by the route he came, and he go in it. We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound; when we have discover that, we come back and tell you all. Then we will comfort you and poor dear Madam Mina with new hope. For it will be hope when you think it over: that all is not lost. This very creature that we pursue, he take hundreds of years to get so far as London; and yet in one day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He is finite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do. But we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong together. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This battle is but begun, and in the end we shall win—so sure as that God sits on high to watch over His children.

We will continue the investigation, if it can be called that, because we all know: we simply want a definite confirmation of the count's current status. Today, you don't need to do anything. That is the most worthwhile task for you at this moment. Today we didn't find him here, but I think it's necessary to tell you everything the four of us know. Dracula has gone, he is returning to his castle in Transylvania. He has had time to prepare everything, and the remaining box of earth is ready to be loaded onto a ship somewhere. Previously, he grabbed some money and ran because he was afraid we would catch up with him before sunset. That was his last hope, unless he had the chance to hide in Lucy's tomb, which he thought was still open. But he didn't have time. After being defeated, he planned to go straight back to his final lair. He is indeed clever! He understood the game was over here and he had no choice but to return to the place he had left. He knew he had to find a ship to escape. Now, we also have to find his ship. As soon as we complete the task, we will return to comfort you and your wife with new hope. It's not all over yet, Jonathan. The monster we are hunting took hundreds of years to reach London, yet in just one day we have driven him away. He has failed, although he is still strong enough to cause more harm. But we are not weak or cowardly. We are all determined to fight against his schemes, and our unity will give us a significant advantage over him. Be brave, dear friends! The battle has just begun, and victory will be ours.

We are going to conduct our research - if I can call it research, because it is not research but a state of knowing, and we are only in pursuit of proof. But stay here today and take care of Madam Mina. This is your best and most sacred duty. Nothing can keep the Count here today. Allow me to tell you the things that the other four have already learned because I told them. Our enemy has gone far away; he has returned to his Castle in Transylvania. I know this as well as if it were written on the wall in fire. He prepared for this in some way, and the last soil box is waiting somewhere ready to be loaded onto a ship. He took the money for this; he hurried the last time for this so that we would not catch him before sunset. This was his only hope, apart from being able to hide in the grave of poor Miss Lucy, which he always thought would be open for him. But there was no time. When this failed, he resorted to his last chance - that is, to the last soil house, which I hope was a double entendre. So clever, ah! So clever! He knew his game here was over, and so he decided to return home. He will find a ship going in the direction he came from and board it. Now we are going to find that ship and its route; once we learn this, we will come back and tell you everything. Then we will relieve you and poor dear Madam Mina. Because this will give hope when you think everything is over: Not everything is lost. It took hundreds of years for this creature we are pursuing to come to London, and yet in one day, when we learn where he has settled, we are driving him out of here.

Let me bring you up to date on what the four of us already know, because I have communicated it to the others. The monster, our enemy, has left; he has returned to his castle in Transylvania. I know this as surely as if a gigantic hand of fire had written it on the wall. In a way, he had prepared for it, and his last box of earth was ready to be shipped. That's why he took the money and hurried so much; to avoid being caught by us before sunset. It was his only hope, unless he could hide in the grave of poor Lucy, whom he thought was like him and therefore open to him. But he didn't have time. When that failed him, he went straight to his last resort... to his last earthly work, I might say, if I desired a double entendre. He is intelligent; very intelligent. He realized he had lost the game here, and decided to return home. He found a ship that followed the route he desired, and left on it. Now we are going to try to discover which ship that was and, without wasting time, as soon as we know, we will return to inform you. Then we will console you and also poor Mrs. Mina, with new hopes. Since it is possible to keep hope, thinking that not all is lost. That same creature we are chasing took several hundred years to reach London and yet, in a single day, as soon as we learned of his doings, we made him flee from here. He has limitations, for he has the power to do much harm, though he cannot endure it as we can. But we are strong, each in our own way; and we are even stronger when we are all together.

The memory of that mark reminds us that we were not dreaming. I fear that today's idleness will cause both Mina and me to constantly think about all of our diary entries. However, as the memory of that terrible reality increases, it seems that the pain and fear within us gradually diminish, because we know the constant threat is no longer near. The thread running through the diary entries gradually appears in our thoughts as a silent comfort. Mina even joked that she would use those diary entries as material for a novel.

1716,"“As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that he must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since by that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. Omne ignotum pro magnifico; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what ships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in your list of the shipping in the Times, and so we go, by suggestion of Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd’s, where are note of all ships that sail, however so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go out with the tide. She is the Czarina Catherine, and she sail from Doolittle’s Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the Danube. ‘Soh!’ said I, ‘this is the ship whereon is the Count.’ So off we go to Doolittle’s Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood so small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire of the goings of the Czarina Catherine. He swear much, and he red face and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he still better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.","When I knew he intended to return to Transylvania, I was certain he would follow the route of the Danube estuary or some port on the Black Sea, because when he came to England, he had also taken that route. Omne ignotum pro magnifico. What is unknown is vast. We searched for ships heading to the Black Sea the night before with heavy hearts. According to Mina's description during hypnosis, it was a sailing ship, and such ships are not significant enough to be listed in the departure schedules of the Times. Lord Godalming advised us to go to the Hoyd dock to identify departing ships, including the smaller ones. Upon arrival, we learned that there was only one ship heading to the Black Sea at high tide, the Tsarine Catherine, anchored at Doolittle dock, bound for Varna and other ports upstream of the Danube. ""Here it is,"" I thought to myself, ""this is the ship with the Count."" So we had to make our way to Doolittle dock, where we met a man sitting in a small, shabby hut. We asked for information about the voyages of the Tsarine Catherine. He was a man with a face as red as a fighting cock, a voice that thundered like a storm, and he was always cursing. But anyway, he was quite kind. Quincey pulled out some gold coins and slipped them into the cloth bag hidden behind the man's coat. Just waiting for that, the man immediately became a reasonable person and very attentive to us. He led the whole group to meet the rough and hot-tempered sailors, but these strong men quickly became gentle after we offered them refreshments. They talked a lot about thunder and hell and many other things I didn't understand. However, they also told us everything we wanted to know.",9.514,8.961,"""Since I knew that he wanted to return to Transylvania, I was sure that he had to go from somewhere in the Black Sea, because he came from the mouth of the Danube or that route.""

""Madam Mina mentioned that the sails were set, so he was on a sailing ship."" ""Since these were not important enough to be included in your list in The Times, upon Lord Godalming's suggestion, we went to Lloyd's office, where the records of all ships, no matter how small, were kept."" ""There, we learned that there was only one ship that set sail with the tide and headed for the Black Sea."" ""Its name was Czarina Catherine; it had set sail from Doolittle's Wharf towards Varna and from there it would make stops at other places and go up the Danube."" ""Aha!"" I said, ""This is the ship the Count is on."" ""Therefore, we went to Doolittle's Wharf and there, we found a man sitting in a small wooden office; the office was so small that the man seemed bigger than the office."" ""We asked him about what was happening on the Czarina Catherine."" ""He swore a lot, red-faced and loud, but still a good man; when Quincey gave him something that rustled as he took it out of his pocket and put it into a very small bag he took from the depths of his clothing, he became an even better friend and respectful servant to us."" ""He came with us and asked a lot of rough and angry men; they also became better men when their thirst was quenched.""

I was sure he would go up the mouth of the Danube; or by some route of the Black Sea, since he came following that route. We had a very difficult task ahead of us. Omne ignotum pro magnifico; thus, with a great weight in our hearts, we began to search for the ships that left last night for the Black Sea. He was on a sailing ship, since Mrs. Mina told us about the sails in her vision. Those ships are not important enough to be listed in the Times and, therefore, we went, accepting a suggestion from Lord Godalming, to Lloyd's, where all ships that set sail are recorded, no matter how small they are. There we discovered that only one ship bound for the Black Sea had left taking advantage of the tides. It is the Czarina Catherine and it goes from Doolittle Wharf bound for Varna, to other ports and, then, will go up the Danube River. ""Then,"" I said, ""that is the ship on which the count sails."" Consequently, we went to Doolittle's Wharf and found a man in an office so tiny that the man seemed larger than it. We asked him everything related to the whereabouts of the Czarina Catherine. He cursed a lot, his face turned red, and his voice was very gruff; but he wasn't a bad guy, anyway, and when Quincey took something out of his pocket and handed it to him, producing a rustle when the man took it and put it in a small wallet he carried deep within his clothes, he became an even better guy, and our humble servant. He accompanied us and asked questions to several sweaty and rough men; they also turned out to be better guys when their thirst was quenched. They talked a lot about blood and other things I didn't understand, although I guessed what they meant. However, they communicated everything we wanted to know.",16.061,15.717
1717,"“They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five o’clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the time. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when told that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he agree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself driving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it take several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he can come and see where it shall be. But he say ‘no’; that he come not yet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quick—with blood—for that his ship will leave the place—of blood—before the turn of the tide—with blood. Then the thin man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again, polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell him that he doesn’t want no Frenchmen—with bloom upon them and also with blood—in his ship—with blood on her also. And so, after asking where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship forms, he departed.","They said that yesterday afternoon, around five o'clock, they saw a very thin man with a long nose, eyes that blazed like fire, and very white teeth, walking very hurriedly. He was dressed in black from head to toe, except for a felt hat that didn't suit him, nor the autumn weather. He gave everyone money and inquired about the ships going to the Black Sea, but to which port? They led him to the exchange office and then to the ship he needed. He didn't want to board but stood at the pier asking to speak with the captain. The captain agreed to come down to talk to him but was still annoyed and cursed a few times. The man promised to pay generously if the captain agreed to his request. The man quietly left after being told where to hire a carriage. He returned very quickly with a rickety carriage carrying a large wooden box. He unloaded the box by himself, while it took several strong young men to struggle to get it onto the ship. He explained at length about the position and method of placing the wooden box to the captain. The captain seemed displeased, as he was seen cursing with every word he could muster. He said if the man liked, he could supervise the work himself. The man shook his head and replied that he couldn't, as he still had too many things to do. Hearing that, the captain reminded him to be very quick - suddenly there was a thunderclap that echoed across the sky - as the ship was about to set sail - another thunderclap roared - when the tide came in - yet another thunderclap. The man smiled and nodded. Of course, the captain would decide to set sail whenever he saw fit. The thin man nodded and promised to board just before they set sail. Then he asked if there was any place near the port that sold paper forms to buy a few sheets and immediately ran off to find them. The captain, red-faced and irritable, cursed a few times and then went back on board.",6.411,5.927,"Among these, they tell us how a man came rushing in around five o'clock yesterday afternoon. A tall, thin, and pale man with an aquiline nose, very white teeth, and eyes that seemed to be burning like flames. He was dressed entirely in black, except for a straw hat that suited neither him nor the time. He spent his money to inquire about which ship was setting sail for the Black Sea and where it was going. Someone took him to the office and then to the ship; he did not board the ship and stood on the dock, asking for the captain to come to him. When told he would be well paid, the captain came; though he cursed a lot at first, he accepted the deal, and then the thin man left, asking someone where he could rent a horse and carriage. The man went there; shortly after, he returned driving a carriage with a large box on it; although many people were needed to load the box onto the ship, he unloaded it from the carriage himself. He had a long conversation with the captain about how and where the box should be placed; but the captain did not like this and cursed at him in many languages, telling him to come and deal with it himself if he wanted. But he said, ""No,"" stating that he had much to do and would not come yet. Upon this, the captain told him to hurry because his -damned- ship would leave before the tide changed -damned-. Then, the thin man laughed and said that of course the captain should leave whenever he thought appropriate, but if he left too quickly, he might encounter a surprise. While the captain cursed again in many languages, the thin man nodded, thanked him, and said he would board the ship before it set sail to take advantage of its hospitality and courtesy to some extent. Finally, the captain, angrier than ever and in even more languages, said he did not want any damned Frenchman on his damned ship. Upon this, the man asked if there was a shop nearby where he could get loading forms and then left.",14.175,13.839,"""They informed us, among other things, that yesterday, around five in the afternoon, a man arrived in a great hurry. A tall, thin, and pale man, with an aquiline nose, very white teeth, and eyes that seemed to be burning. He was dressed all in black, except for a straw hat he wore that did not suit him nor the weather, and he generously distributed his money, asking questions to find out if there was any ship heading towards the Black Sea, and to which point. They took him to the offices and to the ship, on board of which he did not want to go, but instead stopped at the dock and asked for the captain to come see him. The captain came when they told him he would be well paid, and although he cursed a lot at first, he struck a deal with him. Then, the tall and thin man left, but not before someone showed him where he could find a cart and a horse. Soon he returned, driving the cart himself, on which there was a large box, which he unloaded by himself, although it took several men to carry it to the crane and load it into the ship's hold. He gave many instructions to the captain regarding how and where that box should be placed, but the captain did not like it, cursed him in several languages, and told him to go see for himself how the damned box was stowed if he wanted. But he said he could not do it at that moment; that he would board later, as he had many things to attend to. Then, the captain told him to hurry… with blood… as that ship was going to set sail… with blood… as soon as the tide was favorable… with blood. Then, the man smiled slightly and said that, of course, he would go in due time, but it would not be too soon. The captain cursed again like a polyglot, and the tall man bowed to him and thanked him, promising to board before they set sail, so as not to cause any unnecessary trouble. Finally, the captain, redder than ever, and in many other languages, told him he did not want any damned lousy Frenchmen on his ship. Then, after asking where he could find a ship not too far away, where he could buy boarding passes, he left.",12.459,12.122
1718,"“No one knew where he went ‘or bloomin’ well cared,’ as they said, for they had something else to think of—well with blood again; for it soon became apparent to all that the Czarina Catherine would not sail as was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew, and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her. The captain swore polyglot—very polyglot—polyglot with bloom and blood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood, when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and asked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied that he wished that he and his box—old and with much bloom and blood—were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile on deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him. Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and all was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain’s swears exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.","No one knew where the man went, as they had other things to think about, possibly thunder and hell, because they immediately realized that the ship Tsarine Catherine couldn't set sail as planned. A mist suddenly rose on the river, then thickened into a fog that danced around the ship. The captain let out some vicious curses. The tide continued to rise, higher and higher. The captain began to worry about missing the tide, and he was getting angry when the old passenger suddenly reappeared at the pier. As soon as he saw the captain, he demanded to see where his wooden box was stored. Hearing that, the captain said he just wanted to throw both the man and the box into the river to vent his anger. The man wasn't offended but calmly went down to the hold to check the box and then immediately came back up. He stood still on the deck, amidst the thick fog. Surely, he disappeared somewhere alone and no one saw him, but honestly, no one paid attention to him, as the fog began to disperse, leaving a clear scene as it originally was. While enjoying free refreshments, our new friends laughed until they cried as they recounted the captain's curses, then they asked some sailors scattered on the river when the ship Tsarine Catherine was preparing to depart. These guys replied that they didn't see fog anywhere else on the river, except for the fog surrounding the man's ship. Finally, the ship set sail in the morning, when the tide had dropped quite low. When we were sitting and talking with the sailors, the ship was surely drifting far offshore after having sailed downstream to the lower reaches of the river.",5.538,4.508,"Nobody knew where they were going or, as they said, because they had other damn things to think about - because it soon became clear that the Czarina Catherine was not going to set sail as expected. A thin mist had silently drifted from the river and grown, grown; until a thick layer of fog enveloped the ship and everything around it. The captain cursed in many languages - many, many languages - cursed in many languages, but could do nothing. As the water continued to rise, the captain began to fear losing the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood when, as the sea rose completely, the frail man came back to the dock and wanted to see where his chest was stowed. Then the captain responded by saying he wished both he and his chest would go to Hell - damn it. But the frail man did not trust him and went down with the first mate to see where the chest was placed, then came back up and stood on the deck for a while, in the fog. He must have come there on his own, because no one noticed him. In fact, they did not think about him, because after a while the fog began to melt away and everything became clear again. My thirsty friends laughed as they recounted how the captain's curses, exceeding his usual multilingualism, and his colorful display when he asked other sailors moving on the river at the time and found that very few had seen the fog, and those who had only seen it around the dock. Still, the ship had set off before the waters receded and had undoubtedly reached the mouth of the river by morning. By that time, they must have set sail as they spoke with us.",19.635,19.314,"""No one knew where he had gone, as they said, since it soon seemed that the Czarina Catherine would not set sail as soon as they had thought. A light mist began to spread over the river and became increasingly thicker, until finally a dense fog covered the ship and all its surroundings. The captain cursed long and hard in all the languages he knew, but he could do nothing. The water kept rising and he began to think that he was going to miss the tide anyway. He was not in a very good mood when exactly at high tide, the tall and thin man reappeared and asked to be shown where his box had been stowed. Then, the captain told him he wished both he and his box were in hell. But the man was not offended and went down to the hold with a crew member to see where his box was. Then, he returned to the deck and stayed there for a while, wrapped in the fog. He must have come up from the hold alone, as no one saw him. In fact, they did not think about him anymore, because soon the fog began to lift and the weather cleared completely. My thirsty and foul-mouthed friends smiled as they explained how the captain cursed in more languages than ever and looked more picturesque than ever when, asking other sailors who were moving up and down the river at that time, he discovered that very few of them had seen any fog at all, except where he was, near the dock. However, the ship set sail with the ebb tide, and undoubtedly by morning it should be far from the river mouth. So, while they were explaining all this to us, it should already be far away, at sea.",24.573,24.292
1719,"“And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the Danube mouth.

Our best hope is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about where he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us invoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.

However, if he travels by sea, it will take quite a bit of time, I mean if he travels by land, we can catch up with him. Our best chance to strike a decisive blow is when he is lying in the box of earth, between sunrise and sunset. Because at that time, he cannot defend himself, and his fate will depend on us. We still have many days ahead to carry out our plan. We know where he is headed, because we met the owner of the ship Tsarine Catherine, who provided us with information related to his papers and destination. The wooden box must be unloaded at Varna and delivered to an agent named Ristics, as he is the one authorized by him to receive the goods directly from the captain. The kind ship owner also said that if we encounter difficulties, he could send a telegram to Varna to help. We replied that it was not necessary, because in the remaining journey, we must not let the police or customs get involved, otherwise everything will be ruined. We must complete our mission ourselves in our own way.",14.04,13.506,"And so, dear Madam Mina, we must rest for a while because our enemy, with the mist at his command, is at the mouth of the Danube, at sea.

We know everything about where he is going because we saw the ship's owner, who showed us the invoices and all possible documents. The box we are looking for will be unloaded at Varna and handed over to an agent named Ristics, who will present the necessary authority and identification; thus, our merchant friend will have done his part.

1720,"When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain that the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: “We have the best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this morning.” I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that he would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion, at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst men:—","After Van Helsing finished speaking, I dared to ask him if he was sure the count was on the ship. — We have the most solid evidence to assert that it exists. - He replied. — That is precisely the evidence confirmed from the moment I hypnotized her. I continued to ask if it was absolutely necessary to chase after the old man, because I was really afraid that Jonathan would leave me at this moment. I was certain that he would go if those other friends did the same.

At first, he answered quietly, then with growing passion.

1721,"“Yes, it is necessary—necessary—necessary! For your sake in the first, and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in darkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or in that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his own barren land—barren of peoples—and coming to a new land where life of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the work of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in some wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither. There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless, there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in himself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain, more braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and thrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from, and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have infect you—oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for good of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do no more, you have only to live—to live in your own old, sweet way; and so in time, death, which is of man’s common lot and with God’s sanction, shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God’s own wish: that the world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters, whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem more. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if we fall, we fall in good cause.” He paused and I said:—","— Yes, absolutely necessary! First of all, because of you, Mina, and then for all of humanity living in this world. This demon has caused untold suffering to those who exist within its reach and in a short period of time - I mean short compared to its potential eternal existence - when it was just a corpse groping to discover itself in the dark, not yet fully aware of its powers. I have told everything to our friends. And you too, Mina, you will understand this through Dr. John's phonograph or through your husband's diary. I told them: the decision to leave the barren, desolate, and uninhabited land of the Count to come to a new, populous, and sunlit land is a task that must span centuries. To achieve what he has now, another demon among the immortals in this world would have to go through many more centuries to perfect its powers. But for him, all the forces of nature, of the mystical and the supernatural, have been gathered into a supernatural power in a miraculous way. For many centuries, in the place where he lived, that immortal being accumulated countless mysteries of geology and chemistry. And within himself, at the beginning, there existed some extraordinary qualities. In a time of brutal war, he was recognized for his steel nerves, enduring spirit, a braver heart than anyone else in the world, and a robust, tall, and strong physique as powerful as his mind. All of this existed independently of the demonic assistance that he later achieved, but his demonic soul must ultimately retreat before the good. Yes, now is the time he must confront us. He has marked you - oh, forgive me, dear Mina, if I say so, I only want to place him in your interest, that's all! He marked you so cunningly that even if he did nothing more to you, it would be enough for you to live normally like everyone else at first, but then death, a common fate decreed by God, would one day make you become like him. We must find a way to prevent that from happening. This world and God's faithful cannot fall into the hands of the evil demons. We will set out like Crusaders to fulfill the mission that He has entrusted to us. We will also go east like them, and if we fall, it will be an honor for the goodness of this world. Waiting for him to stop, I then asked:",8.603,8.305,"But as he continued speaking, he became more and more angry and furious; in the end, we had to witness at least a part of the personal dominance that allowed him to command people for so long: ""Yes, it is necessary - necessary - necessary! First for your well-being, and then for the well-being of humanity. This monster has already caused much harm, even as a mere being acting ignorantly in the dark within the narrow confines and short time he found himself. I have told all this to the others; you, dear Madam Mina, will learn from the phonograph of my friend John or your husband. I told them how it took centuries of work for him to leave his desolate lands - his desolate lands devoid of humans - and come to a new country where human life is as abundant as a cornfield. If another of the Undead like him tried to do what he did, perhaps all the centuries lived or to be lived in the world could not help him. Alongside him, all the mysterious, deep, and powerful forces of nature must have worked together in a remarkable way. The place where he lived as the Undead for all these centuries is itself full of various geological and chemical oddities. There are deep caves and cracks whose ends are unknown. There are volcanoes that still emit waters with strange properties, gases that kill or give life from their mouths. Undoubtedly, there is something attractive or exciting in some of these mysterious forces that work strangely for physical life; the Count himself had some great qualities from the beginning. He is praised for having nerves of steel, a more cunning mind, and a braver heart compared to everyone else in a time of hardship and war. Some essential principles reach their highest level in him in a strange way, and while his body remains strong and matures, his mind also matures in the same way. All this, of course, happens without any demonic assistance related to him, because he must surrender to the forces that come from goodness and symbolize goodness. And now, for us, he is this. He infected you - oh, forgive me, my dear, I must say this; but I speak for your well-being. He infected you with such wisdom that it is enough for you to live without him doing more - to live your old, sweet life and thus, in time, death, which is the common fate of humanity and the mandate of God, will make you resemble him. This must not happen! We have sworn together that it will not happen. Thus, we are the messengers of God's will: The world and the people for whom God's Son died will not be left to monsters who blaspheme God with their existence. So far, He has allowed us to save one soul, and we go out like the Crusader knights of old to save more. Like them, we will journey towards the sunrise, and like them, if we die, we will have died for a good cause."" When he stopped, I said:",21.818,21.624,"–Yes, it is necessary... Necessary! Necessary! For your own good first and foremost, and for the good of all humanity. That monster has already done too much harm, in the narrow space where it is and in the short time that has passed since it was just a body seeking its measure in darkness and ignorance. I have already explained all this to the others; you, my dear Mrs. Mina, will hear it on the phonograph of my friend John or on that of your husband. I have explained to them how the fact of leaving his arid land... arid in inhabitants... to come to this country where people live like grains of corn in a plantation, had been a work of centuries. If any other undead tried to do the same as he did, it would take all the centuries of the planet and still not be enough. In the case of the vampire we are dealing with, all the hidden forces of nature, deep and powerful, must have somehow united in a monstrous way. The very place where he remained as an undead for all those centuries is full of geological and chemical oddities. There are fissures and deep caverns that no one knows how far they go. There are also volcanoes, some of which still expel waters with strange properties, and gases that kill or vivify. Undoubtedly, there is something magnetic or electric in some of those combinations of hidden forces, which act strangely on physical life, and which in themselves were from the beginning great qualities. In hard times and wars, he was celebrated as the man with the best-tempered nerves, the most alert intelligence, and the best heart. In him, some strange vital principle found its maximum expression, and while his body strengthened, developed, and fought, his mind also grew. All this, with the diabolical help he surely has, since all of it must be attributed to the powers that come from good and are symbolic in him. And now, here is what he represents to us: he has infected you; forgive me for saying this, madam, but I do it for your own good. He contaminated you in such an intelligent way that even if he does not do it again, you could only live in your old and sweet way, and thus, in time, death, which is common to all men and sanctioned by God Himself, will turn you into a woman like him. That must not happen! We have sworn together that we will not allow it. Thus, we are ministers of God's own will: that the world and the men for whom His Son died, are not handed over to monsters whose very existence is a blasphemy against Him. He has already allowed us to redeem one soul, and we are ready, like the ancient knights of the Crusades, to redeem many more. Like them, we must go to the East, and like them, if we must fall, we will do so for a good cause. He was silent for a moment and then I said:",24.946,24.771

Since he has been driven from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from which he has been hunted?”","— But wouldn't the old count become wiser after this failure?

1723,"“Aha!” he said, “your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall adopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl unceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a tiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he is not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again. Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What does he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for him. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He study new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it help him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at the first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater world of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole peoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil, what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we are pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest strength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls for the safety of one we love—for the good of mankind, and for the honour and glory of God.”","— You speak well! - He replied, not sure if it was a compliment or a criticism. - Your Mr. Thirty, once he has tasted human blood, will no longer care about any other prey, but that doesn't mean he won't continue to lurk and prowl until he finds new prey, following the unchangeable instincts of a wild beast. The one we are hunting is no different from a tiger that never forgets to hunt. He is not the type to just curl up in a remote place. When he was alive, I mean living a real life, he crossed the Turkish border to attack enemy lands. He could be pushed back but never stopped. After each failure, he attacked, attacked, and attacked again. Just look at his stubborn and obstinate nature. His childish mind had long been brewing the idea of living in a big city. But for what purpose? He would find there the most promises to quickly test his strength and power. He learned foreign languages, explored a different social life to change his outdated habits, then studied politics, law, finance, science, as well as the customs and traditions of a new land, a new nation born long after him. The mere glimpse of these things stimulated his craving, and they seemed to merge into his being: because everything proved that his assumptions about this world were very accurate. He did everything alone, all by himself, from a desolate grave at the end of a forgotten land. How much more could he do when the whole world was expanding in his imagination! He could laugh at death, as we know. He was fully capable of commanding patients to kill all the peoples on earth. Heavens! If such a being were sent by God; not driven by demons, how much would this world benefit? But fortunately, life still has us. Our efforts must be kept secret, or rather, we must be silent in our mission, because in this age of enlightenment, when people no longer believe what they see, the lack of faith in seemingly mythical things is even greater. He will use that lack of faith as a shield, an armor, and at the same time a weapon to destroy us. We, his enemies, are ready to take risks for the peace of a beloved person, for humanity, for the honor and glory of God.",10.135,9.803,"“Aha!” said the Professor. “Your tiger analogy is good for me, and I will apply it to him. In India, once a tiger has tasted human blood, it is given a name; your man-eater no longer cares for other prey; it roams around ceaselessly until it is caught. The one we chased from our village is also a tiger, a man-eater, and it will never stop roaming around. Moreover, it is not one to retreat and withdraw. In its life, in its living life, it went to the Turkish border and attacked the enemy on their own land; was it defeated but did it retreat? No! It comes again, and again and again. Look at its persistence and endurance. With a child's mind, long ago, it conceived the idea of coming to the big city. What does it do? It finds the place on earth that promises the most for it. Then it willingly sets about preparing for this task. Patiently, it discovers its own strength, what its powers are. It studies new languages. It learns a new social life, a new environment based on old methods, the politics, law, economy, science, and habits of a new country and the new people formed during its lifetime. A glance here only whetted its appetite and intensified its desire. Moreover, it allows it to grow mentally; because all this confirms how right it was in its initial predictions. It does this alone; all alone! From a dilapidated grave in a forgotten country. What more could it do when a greater world of thought opens up to it! Flourishing amidst diseases that kill all humans, as far as we know, it can laugh at death. Ah! If such a one came from God instead of the devil, what a benevolent force it would be in our old world! But we have vowed to set the world free. We must work silently and continue all our efforts in secrecy; because in this enlightened age, where people do not believe even what they see, the doubts of wise men become its greatest strength. This doubt becomes its sheath, its armor, and its weapon to destroy us, its enemies, who are willing to risk even our souls for the sake of someone we love—for the good of humanity, for the honor and glory of God.”",21.218,21.012,"–Aha! Your image of the tiger is very good and I am going to adopt it. Your man-eater, as the inhabitants of India call tigers that have tasted human blood, disregards all other prey and stalks man until it can attack him. The monster we have expelled from our village is a tiger, a man-eater, that will never stop stalking its prey. No, by nature; it is not someone who retreats and stays away. During its life, its true life, it crossed the Turkish border and attacked its enemies on their own ground; it was repelled, but, did it give up? No! It came back again and again. Observe its perseverance and resilience. In its infantile brain, it had long conceived the idea of going to a great city. What did it do? It found the most promising place for itself in the whole world. Then, deliberately, it prepared for the task. It patiently discovered what its strength and powers are. It studied other languages. It learned the new social life; new environments of ancient regions, politics, legislation, finance, sciences, the customs of a new land and new individuals, who had come into existence since it lived. The glimpse it could take at that world only increased its appetite and sharpened its desire. That helped it to develop, at the same time as its brain, since it could verify how accurate it had been in its assumptions. It had done it alone, absolutely alone, emerging from a ruined tomb, located in a forgotten land. What could it not do when the wide world of thought is opened to it? It, who can laugh at death, as we have seen, who can grow stronger amidst epidemics and plagues that kill all individuals around it… Oh! If such a being came from God and not from the Devil, what a force for good it could be in a world like ours! But we must rid the world of it. Our work must be carried out in silence, and all our efforts must be carried out in secret. Since in this enlightened age, when men do not even believe in what they see, the doubts of wise men can constitute its greatest strength. They will be at the same time its protection and shield, and its weapons to destroy us, we who are its enemies, who are willing to endanger even our own souls to save the one we love… for the good of humanity and for the honor and glory of God.",21.292,21.088

1730,"It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way—even by death—and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker’s forehead that I was brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker’s tongue is tied. I know that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called “the Vampire’s baptism of blood.” Well, there may be a poison that distils itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker’s silences, then there is a terrible difficulty—an unknown danger—in the work before us. The same power that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!","The nature of humans is often to have very special sudden abilities. If we have to remove a formidable obstacle in any way, - even through death, we will somehow find a reason to be happy and hopeful. When sitting at the dining table, more than once I have widened my eyes, wondering if the events of the past days were real or just a dream. I have to look at the red mark imprinted on Mina's forehead to return to reality. Even now, when having to consider a very serious issue, I still can hardly acknowledge that the cause of all the misfortune continues to exist. Mina Harker seems to be lost in her own thoughts for a long while. Surely she cannot forget the stain on her forehead, as occasionally something happens to remind her of her memories. We sat discussing the plan of action in my office for about half an hour. I only recognized an immediate difficulty by instinct rather than reason: I suspected there was some mysterious cause blending into Mina's voice. After what had happened, she could draw her own conclusions, but she did not want to, or could not, speak out, leaving me to guess. I whispered to Van Helsing and arranged that when we were alone, the two of us would talk about her. I suddenly imagined some kind of toxin had been introduced into her bloodstream and was beginning to take effect. The old count had introduced something into her body that Van Helsing called ""vampire blood infusion. "" There you have it! In this world, there could exist a toxin spread by strange circumstances. But I only know one thing: if my instinctual feeling about the cause forcing Mina into repeated silence is not wrong, then the heavy task ahead presents us with a formidable difficulty, a vague danger that is not easily overcome. The invisible power that forces her to be silent is the same as the one that forces her to speak. However, I do not dare to think ahead of anything, for if I do so, I will lower the image of the gentle girl in my heart.",10.622,10.234,"The resilience of human nature is truly remarkable.

It is now but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?” I nodded acquiescence; he went on:—","— The tragic life of Lucy reminds us that this time we should not let things go too far. Indeed, our task at this moment is more difficult and arduous than ever, and the new worry depends crucially on time. I began to notice the characteristics of a ""vampire"" on her face. It was all just fleeting, but clear enough if we observed objectively. Her two fangs had grown longer and her eyes occasionally appeared more wild. That's not all. Mina too often remained silent: all the signs were just like Lucy's case back then. She even went so far as to write down what she wanted to say to others. But now I fear this the most: if while being hypnotized, Mina can tell us what the count sees and hears, it also means that he - who hypnotized her first, then drank her blood and made her drink his - can force her to reveal everything she knows to him if he wishes.

In the meantime we can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there. To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we four can set out on our journey.”","— Alright, - Van Helsing said, - there will be a hunting rifle. Quincey is indeed a person of great insight, especially for hunts like this. Now then, we have nothing to do here anymore, and none of us know what Varna is like, so why not go there first? The time here will certainly feel as long as it would there. The time tonight and tomorrow morning is more than enough for us to prepare everything. If nothing happens, all four of us can set off immediately.",7.355,5.519,"What wouldn't we have given for automatic weapons then!” “Good!” said Van Helsing, “Let it be Winchesters. Quincey always knows what to do, especially when it comes to hunting; but the damage my metaphor does to science is greater than what wolves would do to humans. Meanwhile, there is nothing we can do here, and considering that none of us know Varna, why don't we leave earlier? Waiting here is as long as waiting there. We can prepare tonight and tomorrow, and then, if everything goes well, the four of us can set off.”",16.649,15.581,"–Good! – said van Helsing. The Winchesters are very convenient. Quincey often thinks very accurately, but especially when it comes to hunting. Metaphors are more dishonorable to science than dangerous wolves are to man.

1746,"5 October, afternoon.—For some time after our meeting this morning I could not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina’s determination not to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not argue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from a solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us.

Thank God, there are such moments still for her.","• October 5, afternoon After this morning's group meeting, I suddenly felt an unusual emptiness in my mind. The new developments have put me in a state where I can no longer think of anything positive. The decision not to let Mina participate in the group discussions made me ponder a lot. And when I could no longer discuss anything with her, I became confused and lacked clarity. The way everyone treated me just now also made me lose my sense of direction.

At least she still gets to enjoy such moments of peace.",10.75,9.703,"October 5, afternoon. - After our meeting this morning, I couldn't think for a while.

We have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom; when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence.","I think none of us were surprised when we were invited to Mina's side just before dusk. We had just learned that sunrise or sunset for her were moments of a strange liberation phenomenon, meaning her true self would manifest with some invisible dominant force either preventing her from acting, or conversely, compelling her to act. This state appears about half an hour before sunrise or sunset and lasts until the sun is high or clouds come to obscure the last rays lingering on the horizon. It is the beginning of a negative effect, like a knot being untied, very quickly followed by a state of absolute freedom. When that freedom is interrupted, the state will repeat very quickly with a brief forewarning phenomenon of her silence.",13.184,12.339,"I suppose none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Ms. Harker shortly before sunset.

This mood or state begins about half an hour or a little more before the exact moment of sunrise or sunset, or it lasts until the sun has fully risen or until the minutes when the clouds are still painted red by the sun's rays hovering above the horizon. At first, a kind of restlessness appears as if a bond has been loosened, and this is quickly followed by absolute freedom; but when the freedom starts to fade, a rapid return or deterioration occurs swiftly after only a brief silence that serves as a warning.",26.024,25.461,"I believe none of us were surprised when we were asked to go see Mrs. Harker, shortly before sunset. We had all long since come to understand that the moments of sunrise and sunset were times when she enjoyed greater freedom; when her former personality could manifest without any external force subjugating, limiting, or inciting her to action. This condition or mood always begins about half an hour before sunset and sunrise, and lasts until the sun is high, or until the clouds, with the sun hidden, still shine from the rays of light that spring from the horizon. At first, it is a kind of negative condition, as if some grip were broken, and then absolute freedom quickly presents itself; however, when the freedom ceases, the regression happens very quickly, preceded only by a period of silence, which serves as a warning.",33.726,33.255
1778,"To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the signs of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so.

Everyone is so kind to allow me to join. I know that all the brave things a man can do for an unfortunate woman who has lost her soul to the devil,... no, not quite like that, but almost, you will do. But please remember that I am not like everyone else. My soul, the blood flowing in me, have all been tainted. I might die because of that, at least in the case that you no longer need me. Just like me, you surely understand that my soul is teetering on the edge of an abyss. I know, now there is indeed a wide road open before me, but it is not your road...

I cannot believe that to die in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be done, is God’s will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!” We were all silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The faces of the others were set and Harker’s grew ashen grey; perhaps he guessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:—","— Immediate death by one's own hand or the hand of another, before dying by the hand of the evil one.

I do not believe that my death at this moment aligns with the will of God, while you still have an important mission to complete. But I am still moving towards this darkness, the darkness that I believe can dispel the dark things in this world and on this earth. We sat in silence, listening, because everyone understood that this was just the prelude to unpleasant things.

I cannot believe that in a situation where we have hope and work to do ahead of us, dying would be God's will. Therefore, for my part, I am foregoing the undeniable reality of eternal peace here and stepping into the darkness where things that could never exist in this world or in Hell reside!” We all remained silent, instinctively knowing that this was only the introduction to her speech.

I do not believe it is God's will for me to die in this case, when there is still hope and a difficult task awaits us all.

1809,"17 October.—Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome the Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a similar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who was much impressed with Godalming’s kindly manner to him, and we are all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and drive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall have ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count’s body, it will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and a rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it were to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our intent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the Czarina Catherine is seen, we are to be informed by a special messenger.","I think everything has been carefully prepared to welcome Count Dracula's return. The plan has been set: we will tell the sailors on the ship that the wooden box contains items stolen by a thief from a friend of ours, and Godalming will be responsible for obtaining permission to open the box for inspection. From London, the ship's owner gave him a handwritten letter addressed to the captain, requesting that he facilitate the full execution of his duties. The ship's owner also granted similar authority to an employee in Varna. We met this employee, and thanks to Godalming's noble demeanor, we easily persuaded him to assist us to the best of his ability. We also agreed on the measures to prepare for opening the box. If the Count is inside, Van Helsing and Seward will immediately behead him and drive a sharp stake through his heart. Quincey Morris, Godalming, and I will stand by to provide support and use any necessary weapons. The professor assured us that if we do this, the Count's entire body will instantly turn to dust. In that case, no one would have evidence to accuse us of murder. Even if the outcome does not go as planned, we are willing to face all consequences, and perhaps one day, this book will exonerate us from the gallows. As for myself, I still feel honored to take action if given the opportunity. We decided to stir heaven and earth to achieve success by any means necessary. Anyway, everything has been securely arranged, and now we just await a special message as soon as the ship Tsarine Catherine comes into our sight.",12.48,12.037,"October 17. - I think everything is now nicely arranged to welcome the Count after his trip. Godalming told the transporters that he believed the crate sent abroad contained goods stolen from his friend, and he almost got approval on the condition that he takes responsibility. The owner of the ship gave him a letter addressed to the Captain, instructing that every convenience be provided to Godalming when he boards the ship; he also gave a similar directive to his representative in Varna. We saw the representative, who was quite impressed by the courtesy shown by Godalming, and we were convinced that everything possible would be done to assist our requests. We have already decided what to do if we find the lid of the crate open. If the Count is there, Van Helsing and Dr. Seward will immediately cut off his head and drive a stake through his heart. Morris, Godalming, and I will prevent any interference with this process, even if we have to use the weapons we have ready with us. The Professor says that if we do these things to the Count's body, he will instantly turn to dust. In such a case, if there is any suspicion of murder, there will be no evidence against us. But even if he does not turn to dust, we will either stand by our actions or collapse, and perhaps one day these journals might serve as evidence to clear some of us.

The shipowner gave him a paper indicating to the captain to give him all the facilities to do whatever he wanted on board the ship, and, likewise, a similar authorization intended for his agent in Varna. We have visited the agent, who was very impressed by Lord Godalming's manners towards him, and we are sure that he will do everything he can to satisfy our wishes.

In that case, there will be no evidence against us, in the event that there are suspicions of murder. But, even if it does not happen that way, we must face the consequences of our act, whether good or bad, and it is possible that someday in the future, these writings may serve to stand between some of us and the gallows.

1816,"25 October.—How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd’s. I know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs. Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any excitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We talk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. It would break poor Harker’s heart—certainly his nerve—if he knew that we had even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me, her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would be necessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have to be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should neither of us shrink from the task—awful though it be to contemplate. “Euthanasia” is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to whoever invented it.","• October 24 I deeply regret not bringing the phonograph. There is truly nothing that makes me feel more miserable than having to write a diary with a pen, but Van Helsing insists that it must be written. This morning, we thought we might go mad when Lord Godalming received a telegram from Hoyd. Now I understand the kind of emotions warriors must endure when waiting for the signal to attack. Among us, only Mina shows no sign of anything, because we still try not to let her know anything and try not to let her notice everyone's impatience. In the past, I was sure she would have noticed the expressions on each person's face, but since three weeks ago, everything has changed. Many times she looks dazed like a lost soul, and although she seems healthier, Van Helsing and I are still not satisfied. We often talk about her but do not tell others, for fear that it might reach Jonathan and cause him more distress. During hypnosis, Van Helsing carefully examined her two sets of teeth and said that they haven't grown any longer, which means that currently there is no change indicating an imminent danger looming over us. If we notice any signs of instability, we must take preventive measures immediately. We understand what those measures are, even though no one speaks out their thoughts. No one among us will cowardly retreat from the task, even if it is the most terrifying one. “Peaceful death” is a wonderful phrase that gives us strength!",9.203,8.767,"October 25. - How I miss my phonograph! Keeping a journal with a pen is very frustrating for me; but Van Helsing says I must do it. Yesterday, when a telegram came from Lloyd to Lord Godalming, we all went wild with excitement. I now understand how men feel when they learn it is time to take action in wars. Only Ms. Harker among us showed no sign of emotion. After all, it is not strange that she did not react; because we have been particularly careful to keep her uninformed about the situation and tried not to show any signs of excitement when around her. In the old days, I am sure she would have noticed no matter how much we tried to hide it, but in this regard, she has changed significantly in the past three weeks. The state of lethargy is increasing, and despite her appearing strong and healthy, and her color returning somewhat, Van Helsing and I are not pleased with her condition. We often talk about her, but we have not said a word to the others about it. Poor Harker would be hurt if he heard we had doubts about this - and undoubtedly his nerves would be shattered. Van Helsing says he carefully observes Ms. Harker's teeth while she is hypnotized, because according to him, as long as they do not sharpen over time, there is no danger of transformation. If this transformation occurs, some steps will need to be taken! Although we do not share our thoughts with each other, we both know what these steps are, and neither of us should avoid this duty - though it is terrible to think about, it is so. “Euthanasia” is a perfect and comforting word! I owe thanks to whoever coined this term.",26.285,26.005,"October 25. How I miss my phonograph! Writing a diary with a pen is exasperating for me. But Van Helsing says I must do it. We were all very nervous yesterday when Godalming received his telegram from Lloyd's. Now I completely understand what men feel in battles when they are ordered into action. The only one in our group who showed no sign of emotion was Mrs. Harker. After all, it is not surprising that she did not get emotional, as we took special care not to let her know anything about it and all tried not to appear disturbed in her presence. In the past, I am sure she would have noticed immediately, no matter how much we tried to hide it from her, but, in reality, she has changed a lot over the last three weeks.

True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would come; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen. The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things would not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the change would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know that they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if it be a will-o’-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we all took it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. Lord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our old wandering days it meant “action.” Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands meekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled—actually smiled—the dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great Kukri knife and rested there. “When does the next train start for Galatz?” said Van Helsing to us generally.","• October 28 When we received the telegram informing us that the ship was in Galatz, we were less shocked and more suspicious. We did not understand where and when this sudden change began to occur. We were waiting for some kind of surprise to happen. The ship's late delay forced us to believe that everything was happening differently from what we had planned. We could only tell ourselves that the ship might have changed its course. In reality, everything happened exactly as it should have, not as we had guessed it would. The sudden change caused each of us to react in our own way. Van Helsing raised his hands to the sky as if to explain something but couldn't say a word, after a moment he lowered his hands, his face still very calm. Lord Godalming sat down on the ground, his face pale, his breath broken. I was stunned, looking from one person to another. Quincey Morris jerked his belt tight; in this foreign land, I understood his action to mean: ""we need to take action!"" Meanwhile, Mina's face was as pale as a corpse, the scar on her forehead suddenly seemed to redden, and she clasped her hands as if praying. Jonathan laughed out loud, yes, a bitter, sarcastic laugh, tears streaming down as if he had lost all hope, but his hand still groped for the Kukri knife and gripped its handle with the mindset of someone harboring unresolved resentment. — What time does the next train to Galatz leave, I wonder? - Van Helsing asked aloud.",10.076,9.602,"October 28. - When we received the telegram announcing that the ship had arrived in Galaţi, I don't think it was as big a shock as it could have been for any of us. Okay, we didn't know where, how, or when it would come, but I think we were all expecting something strange to happen. The delay in arriving at Varna convinced us one by one that events would not unfold as we had expected; we only waited to learn where this change would occur. But still, it was a surprise. I think nature works on such a hopeful basis that, even against ourselves, we believe that everything will happen not as we know it will, but as it should. Though misleading for metaphysical people, it is a guide for angels. It was a strange experience, and we all perceived it differently. Van Helsing raised his hands above his head for a moment as if lamenting to God, but said not a word and stood up with a stern expression on his face within a few seconds. Lord Godalming's face turned pale, and he sat down, breathing heavily. I was half-dazed and looked at each person's face in curiosity. Quincey Morris tightened his belt with that quick motion I knew so well; in our old traveling days, this meant ""action."" Ms. Harker's face turned as white as a sheet, so much so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she meekly clasped her hands and looked upwards as if in prayer. Harker laughed - he really laughed - the dark, bitter laugh of a hopeless man; but at the same time, his actions contradicted his words because his hands instinctively searched for the hilt of the large kukri and grasped it. Van Helsing asked aloud, ""When does the next train to Galaţi depart?""",31.562,31.33,"October 28. When the telegram announcing the ship's arrival in Galatz came, I don't think it shocked any of us as much as one might have expected under the circumstances. It's true that none of us knew where, how, or when the difficulty would arise, but I believe we all expected something strange to happen. The day it was supposed to arrive in Varna, we all individually convinced ourselves that things were not going to happen as we had imagined; we were just waiting to know where the change would occur. Nevertheless, it was still a surprise. I suppose that nature works on such hopeful bases that we believe, against our better judgment, that things have to be as they should be, not as we should know they will be. Transcendentalism is a guide for angels, but a will-o'-the-wisp for men. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment, as if arguing with the Almighty, but he didn't say a word and, after a few seconds, he stood up with a hard expression on his face. Lord Godalming turned very pale and sat down, breathing heavily. I myself was absolutely stunned and looked at the others in astonishment. Quincey Morris tightened his belt with a quick movement that I knew very well: in our adventurous times, it meant ""action."" Mrs. Harker turned intensely pale, so much so that the scar on her forehead seemed to be burning, but she clasped her hands piously and looked up, praying. Harker smiled, with the dark and bitter smile of someone who has lost all hope, but at the same time, his action belied that impression, as his hands instinctively went to the handle of his large kukri knife and remained resting on it. –When does the next train to Galatz leave? – van Helsing asked us, addressing everyone in general.",30.002,29.749

Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning.

Three days ago, while I was hypnotized, the Count entered her soul to read her thoughts, or more precisely, he summoned her soul to meet him in the wooden box on the ship Tsarine Catherine, at the time he was freed by dawn or dusk. Now he knows we are here. Because clearly she, who has the freedom to move around and see and hear things, always knows more than someone confined in a cramped box of earth like him.

Now, with more experience, I know I have to trace back to the starting point of every half-formed thought, and I discover that it is something entirely different, a real thought, even though it is too nascent to have small wings. Yes, it is like the ugly duckling of my friend Hans Andersen, but it is not a complete thought-duck, but a thought-swan that glides gracefully on the lake's surface with its large wings when given the chance to try.

1844,"“What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count’s child-thought see nothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; my man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what it mean—what it might mean. Just as there are elements which rest, yet when in nature’s course they move on their way and they touch—then pouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and leagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever study the philosophy of crime? ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’ You, John, yes; for it is a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not—not but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not a particulari ad universale. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant, in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that it is. That is to be empiric. The criminal always work at one crime—that is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other. This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of child-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to him the ground to start from to do more. ‘Dos pou sto,’ said Archimedes. ‘Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!’ To do once, is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time, just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,” for Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:—","What do we learn from this? Is there nothing important? No! The childish mind of the old count does not understand anything significant, which is why he speaks so recklessly. No! But this is another answer from someone who speaks without thinking because they do not know what it means or what it could mean. Yes, let me explain. But have you studied the philosophy of crime? Yes and no. My friend John, yes, because this subject is an indispensable part of studying mental illness. As for Mina, no, because crime has nothing to do with her, except once. But her mind always follows a straight path and has its own way of reasoning about the world. In humans, criminals have a stable characteristic, everywhere and at all times, so much so that even police officers who do not know much about philosophy can affirm it based on experience. Criminals often pursue a single crime, at least for those who do not plan their crimes in advance and do not pursue anything else. The criminal does not have a fully adult mind. He is alert, cunning, and full of strength. But when it comes to the mind, his development is not yet complete. In many respects, he is still in a developmental stage of a child. In other words, our criminal commits crimes due to predestination, his mind is still naive because what he does is just child's play. Young birds, fry, and small animals are not raised according to principles, but only based on experience. And what they learn will propel them to continue doing what they have done in a rut. Archimedes once said: give me a fulcrum, and I will lift the earth. The first attempt is the fulcrum by which a child's brain develops into an adult, and when it tries again, it starts to do what it has done before. Dear Mina, I see your eyes are wide open and the sunlight is illuminating the entire realm for you? Indeed, Mina was waving her hands frantically, her eyes sparkling brightly. Van Helsing continued:",9.069,8.719,"What does this tell us? Not much, right? No! The Count’s childish mind understands nothing; that’s why he speaks so freely. Your adult mind understands nothing; my adult mind also understood nothing, until this very moment. No! A word came from someone who speaks without thinking because they do not know what their words mean - or could mean. Just like the elements in nature that progress in their paths and when they touch each other -Poof!- they cover the entire sky, blinding some, killing and destroying others, and revealing the depths of the earth with a sudden flash of light. Isn't that so? Anyway, let me explain. To start with, have you ever studied the philosophy of crime? ‘Yes!’; ‘No!’ You, John, yes; because this is a field of study within the subject of madness. You, no, Madam Mina; because crime has never approached you - except once. Still, your mind works correctly and does not argue particulari ad universale. Criminals have such a characteristic. This holds true in all countries and at all times so much so that even a policeman who does not understand much philosophy knows this experimentally. To know experimentally means this. A criminal works for only one crime - that is, the real criminal who seems to have crime in their destiny and does not think of other crimes. The criminal does not have a fully adult mind. They are intelligent, cunning, and alert; but when it comes to the mind, they are not on par with an adult man. In many ways, they are close to a child’s mind. Now, our criminal also has crime in their destiny; they also have a child’s mind and do things that only a child would do. A small bird, a small fish, a small animal learns not by principles but by experiments; once they learn to do something, they have the foundation to start doing more. ‘Dos pou sto,’ said Archimedes. ‘Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world!’ Once they do something, it is the foundation that will turn a child’s mind into an adult mind; until they aim to do more, they continue to do the same thing each time, just as they did before! Oh, dear, I see that your eyes have opened and the flashing light shows distances far away,” because Ms. Harker had started clapping her hands and her eyes were shining brightly. The professor continued his speech:",22.68,22.486,"""What does this suggest to us? Not much? No! The childish thought of the count hides nothing, that's why he spoke so freely. His human thoughts saw nothing, nor did my human thought, until now. No! But another word comes from a person who speaks without thinking, because she also does not know what it means... what it could mean. It is like the elements at rest that, nevertheless, in their natural course, follow their path, touch each other... and, poof!, a flash of light is produced that covers the entire sky, that blinds, kills, and destroys something or someone, but that illuminates the earth below, kilometers and more kilometers around. Isn't that so? Well, I better explain myself. To begin with, have you ever studied the philosophy of crime? ""Yes"" and ""no"". You, friend John, yes, since you are a student of madness. You, Mrs. Mina, no; because crime does not touch you... except once. However, your mind really works and does not argue from the particular to the universal. ""In criminals, there exists that peculiarity. It is so constant in all countries and times, that even the police, who do not know much about philosophy, come to know it empirically, that it exists. The criminal always works on a crime... that is the true criminal, who seems to be predestined for that crime and who does not wish to commit any other. That criminal does not have a complete human brain. He is intelligent, skillful, and full of resources, but he does not have an adult brain. At most, he has a child's brain. Now, this criminal we are dealing with is also predestined for crime; he, too, has a child's brain and it is childish to do what he has done. Little birds, small fish, little animals, do not learn by principle but empirically, and when they learn how to do something, that knowledge serves as a basis to do something else, starting from it. Dos pousto, said Archimedes, give me a point of support and I will move the world! Doing something once is the point of support from which the child's brain develops into a man's brain, and as long as it does not have the desire to do more, it will continue doing the same thing repeatedly, exactly as it has done before! Oh, my dear lady, I see that your eyes are opening and that for you, the lightning's light illuminates the whole terrain."" Mrs. Harker began to clasp her hands and her eyes sparkled. The professor continued saying:",21.532,21.337

It is precisely this selfishness that has somewhat freed my soul from the terrible power he cast upon me that night. Thank God, at this moment, my soul is indeed freer.

But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in God’s Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind, there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the sun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his; and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your suffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark hours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril ourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.”","That is why he abandoned us here, in this land of Varna, while the ship - shrouded in the fog he created - takes him to Galatz. Surely, when he gets there, he will have prepared everything to escape our pursuit. But his childish mind does not go beyond that. He could not foresee that what he considered an absolute advantage would become his greatest misfortune. And as the great Psalmist said, the hunter may have already set the snare. Indeed, at this moment, he thinks he has escaped our grasp and is hours ahead of us. His childish mind tells him that he can rest. Moreover, he believes that by severing the spiritual connection between him and her, she knows nothing about him. Thus, he has made another mistake. He has infused his cursed blood into her, binding her, though she can move freely, to always think of him as she did at sunrise and sunset. But fortunately, at such times, she follows my guidance and not his. This gift becomes even more precious as he is unaware of it and mistakenly believes he has severed the connection through us via her. On the contrary, we are not selfish and we believe that God will guide everyone through this dark moment. We will hunt down the demon, even at the risk of becoming like him. My friend John, this is a momentous, extremely important time for us. Do the work of a clerk and record everything that has just happened, so that when our friends return, you can easily recount to them what we have learned.",7.616,7.132,"“He used your mind in this way and by that means, while the ship carrying him was undoubtedly making preparations to escape us, swiftly heading towards Galaţi through the surrounding mist, he left us here in Varna. But a child's mind can only see so far ahead; by the providence of God, it is likely that the thing the wrongdoer relies on most for his own good will turn out to be the very thing that causes him the greatest harm. As the Prophet David has decreed, the hunter falls into his own trap. For now, thinking he has completely lost all trace and is hours ahead of us, his selfish child’s mind will whisper to him to sleep. He also thinks that because he has stopped reading your mind, you will not be able to gain any information about him; this is where he is mistaken! The terrible blood baptism he subjected you to allows you to go to him spiritually, just as you did freely at sunrise and sunset when you were free. At such times, you go not by his will, but by mine; you have gained this power, which is for your and others' benefit, through suffering at his hands. Now, it is more valuable than anything that he does not know this and disconnects the link in order to protect himself, so that he will not know where we are. But we are not entirely selfish and believe that God is with us in all this darkness and dark hours. Even if we risk becoming like him, we will follow him; we will not retreat.

But his childish mind did not go further, and it is possible that, as always happens according to Divine Providence, what the criminal believed was good for his selfish well-being turns out to be the greatest harm he receives. The hunter is caught in his own trap, as the great psalmist says. Since now he believes he is free from us and has left no trace and has managed to flee from us, having so many hours of advantage to do so, his childish brain will make him sleep. He also believes that by ceasing to know your mind, you cannot have any knowledge of him; that is his mistake! That terrible baptism of blood that he inflicted on you makes you free to go to him in spirit, as you have always been able to do until now, in your moments of freedom, when the sun rises or sets. In those moments, you go by my will, not by his. And that power, for the good of both you and so many others, you have acquired through your sufferings at his hands. That is all the more precious to us, as he himself has no knowledge of it, and to protect himself, he avoids being able to have knowledge of our doings. However, we are not selfish, and we believe that God is with us during all this darkness and all these terrible hours. We must follow him, and we will not fail; even if we put ourselves in danger of becoming like him. Friend John, this has been a magnificent hour; and we have gained much ground in our case.

1861,"“You see, my friends. He is close to land: he has left his earth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do not touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did at Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him. We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.”","— Friends, surely everyone understands by now. He is near a coast and has emerged from his box of earth. He needs to get ashore. In the evening, he can hide anywhere. But if he is not brought ashore or if the ship cannot dock, he will not be able to get ashore in the usual way. In such circumstances, when night falls, he can change form to jump or fly ashore as he did in Whitby in the guise of a dog. But if the sun rises before the ship docks, he can only remain in his wooden box. If he stays in there, he will surely be discovered by customs. In short, if he does not manage to get ashore tonight, specifically before dawn, he will lose an entire day and thus, we can arrive in time. Because if he cannot escape at night, we will meet him during the day, when he is still trapped in the box and his fate depends on us. He will not dare to reveal himself in his true form for fear of being discovered.",10.599,9.392,"“You see, my friends. The Count is near the shore: He has left his earth chest. But he still needs to come ashore. He can hide somewhere at night; but if he is not carried ashore or if the ship does not touch the shore, he cannot manage to reach land. If this happens at night, he can change form as he did in Whitby and leap or fly to land. But if it becomes daylight before he reaches the shore, then he cannot escape unless someone carries him. And if he is carried, then the customs officers might discover what is inside the chest. So, in short, if he does not escape to the shore tonight or before dawn, he will lose the entire day. Then, we can reach him in time, because if he does not escape at night, we can find him during the day, trapped in his chest, at our mercy, as he will not dare to be in his own form, awake and visible, to avoid being discovered.”",22.953,22.358,"–Do you see, my friends?

In that case, if it is night, he can change form and jump or fly to the land, as he did in Whitby. But if day comes before he is on the shore, then, unless he is taken to land, he cannot disembark. And if he is unloaded, then the customs officers may discover what the box contains. Thus, in summary, if he does not escape to land tonight or before sunrise, he will lose the entire day. Then, we will be able to arrive in time, since if he does not escape during the night, we will reach him during the day and find him inside the box and at our mercy, since he cannot be his own self, awake and visible, for fear of being discovered.",26.347,25.883

Fortunately it came at a time when there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation. Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count’s sensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count’s power over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so.

If the sunset had coincided with the train stopping at a station, we certainly wouldn't have had the peace to hypnotize Mina: this time it was much harder for her to enter a trance compared to the last time. I fear the ability to decode the Count's sensations within her will vanish just when we need it the most. So far, her abilities have been limited to the simplest matters, and if this continues, she might lead us to a mistake. If I think the power the Count imposed on her is diminishing in tandem with her ability to see through issues, then I have no reason not to be happy. But honestly, I still doubt the situation she is experiencing. In the end, she only decoded it this simply: — Something just disappeared.",9.697,8.708,"Later. - Sunset came and went.

I fear that at the very time we need her the most, the Count's power to read her senses is gradually diminishing. It seems as if Ms. Harker's imagination is starting to work. Until now, she has kept herself limited to the simplest facts during her trance. If this continues, there is a possibility that she might eventually mislead us.

1880,"“Man!” he said, “but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should have to pay for it wi’ some rare piece o’ ill luck, so as to keep up the average. It’s no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi’ a wind ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin’ on yer sail for his ain purpose. An’ a’ the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi’ us, till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi’oot bein’ able to signal; an’ till we came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we never were within hail o’ aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it whether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi’ the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an’ the Old Mon who had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin’ him.” This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:—","— The trip terrified us because we thought we would have to pay the price for our efforts to steer the ship back on its correct course. Drifting in the Black Sea is no joke. It seemed as if some demon had blown the wind to direct the sails and take the ship where it wanted. There was no way to know what was real and what was not. Every time we tried to approach another ship, or a port, or a headland, a thick fog would suddenly descend from nowhere and follow the ship along its journey, which was truly terrifying. Only when we neared this region did that bizarre hellish scene finally let us go. We passed Gibraltar without being able to signal the mainland. Then, when we reached the Dardanelles, we were supposed to dock to present our papers before continuing, but the ship kept moving forward without any authority questioning us. At first, I intended to reduce the air pressure and let the ship sail against the wind until the fog completely cleared, but then I gave up, thinking that if the demon had decided the ship must go full speed into the Black Sea, it would do so regardless of our wishes. And the demon must have been satisfied without being annoyed by our resistance. The mixed temperament of honesty, humor, but also a certain cunning and superstitious nature typical of a merchant in the captain seemed to further intrigue Van Helsing. He said:",10.709,10.23,"“Wow!” he said with an accented voice, “but it scared us, because we thought we would have to pay for it with a rare misfortune to even the situation. From London to the Black Sea, it is not natural at all to have the wind at your back as if the devil himself is blowing into your sails for his own purposes. And at that time, we couldn't see anything. When we approached a ship or a port or a cape, fog descended upon us and traveled with us; but after the fog lifted and we looked around, we could see some damn things. We passed Gibraltar without being able to send a signal; until we came to the Dardanelles and had to wait for our passage permit, we didn't see anyone close enough to hail. At first, I was inclined to slacken the sails until the fog lifted; but then I thought if the devil is determined to get us to the Black Sea quickly, he will do it whether we want it or not. If he makes a fast journey, it won't cause any trouble between us and the owners of this ship, our traffic won't be disrupted; and the Old Man, who serves his main purpose because we didn't hinder his work, would be grateful enough to us.” This simplicity, a mixture of superstitious cunning and commercial logic, spurred Van Helsing into action, and he said: ""My friend, that Devil is smarter than some think, and when he meets his match, he knows it!""",15.625,15.178,"But we were fearful, because we were afraid that we would have to pay with some accident or something similar for the extraordinary luck that favored us throughout the entire journey. It is not common to sail from London to the Black Sea with a tailwind that seemed like the devil himself was blowing on the sails for his own purposes. At the same time, we couldn't see anything. As soon as we approached a ship or land, a fog descended upon us, covered us, and traveled with us, until when it lifted, we looked around and couldn't see anything. We passed through Gibraltar without being able to signal our passage, and we couldn't communicate until we were in the Dardanelles, waiting for the corresponding permission. At first, I felt inclined to lower the sails and wait for the fog to lift, but, in the meantime, I thought that if the devil was interested in getting us quickly to the Black Sea, he would probably do so, whether we stopped or not. If we made a quick journey, it wouldn't discredit us with the shipowners and wouldn't harm our traffic, and the devil, having achieved his goals, would be grateful for not having put obstacles in his way. This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition and commercial reasoning, excited van Helsing, who said:",15.507,15.087
1881,"“Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and he know when he meet his match!” The skipper was not displeased with the compliment, and went on:—","— My friend, sometimes demons are even bolder than what some people think of them, and they are fully aware of who they are facing. The professor's suggestive joke did not excite the captain.",6.121,3.357,"This simplicity, a mixture of superstitious cunning and commercial logic, spurred Van Helsing into action, and he said: ""My friend, that Devil is smarter than some think, and when he meets his match, he knows it!"" The Captain, not at all pleased with this compliment, continued his speech:",11.898,9.869,"–My friend, that devil is much smarter than many think and knows when he meets his match! The captain did not appear displeased by the compliment, and continued speaking:",23.192,20.767
1882,"“When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o’ them, the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin’ old man just before we had started frae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa fingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot their business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn’t say it was agin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn’t let up for five days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get somewheres—well, he would fetch it up a’reet. An’ if he didn’t, well, we’d keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin’ sun came through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz. The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi’ them aboot it wi’ a handspike; an’ when the last o’ them rose off the deck wi’ his head in his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to fling in, and as it was marked Galatz via Varna, I thocht I’d let it lie till we discharged in the port an’ get rid o’t althegither. We didn’t do much clearin’ that day, an’ had to remain the nicht at anchor; but in the mornin’, braw an’ airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came aboard wi’ an order, written to him from England, to receive a box marked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his hand. He had his papers a’ reet, an’ glad I was to be rid o’ the dam’ thing, for I was beginnin’ masel’ to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil did have any luggage aboord the ship, I’m thinkin’ it was nane ither than that same!”","— After leaving the Bosphorus, - the captain continued - the passengers began to grumble. Some Romanians came to me and demanded that we throw overboard a rather large wooden chest sent by a strange old man since we left London. At that time, I saw them glance at the old man and quickly raise two fingers as if to ward off something very unlucky when they saw him approaching. Indeed, the beliefs of foreigners can sometimes be quite strange! I had to shoo them away several times. But right after that, a fog suddenly descended upon the ship from who knows where, making me wonder if those Romanians were right, even though I saw no reason to be prejudiced against that wooden chest. Regardless, we continued our journey. The fog enveloped the ship for five days straight. I left the navigation to the winds, because if the devil wanted the ship to reach a certain place, we had no choice but to let it be, we couldn't do otherwise anyway! Then the ship kept moving forward, very safely and without any collisions at all. The day before yesterday, when the sun rose and pierced through the detestable fog, I suddenly realized the ship had reached a river, opposite Galatz. The Romanians once again went mad, demanding to immediately throw the wooden chest into the river. I had to talk to them with sticks, and when the last one jumped off the deck holding his head, I persuaded them that no matter how unlucky it was, I still placed the passengers' property and trust above all. It should be noted that before that, these Romanian fellows had already dragged that damned chest onto the deck to prepare to throw it into the water. I intended to throw it overboard when we unloaded at the port. But in the morning, about an hour before sunrise, a man suddenly appeared and climbed aboard with an authorization letter from England to receive a chest addressed to Count Dracula. All his papers were in order, so there was no reason not to hand him the chest, moreover, I was beginning to feel uneasy about that cursed thing. If the devil sent luggage onto my ship, it must be that wooden chest and nothing else!",8.336,7.86,"""When we crossed the Bosphorus in Istanbul, the men started grumbling; some of them, Romanians, came to me and asked me to throw a large crate that a strange-looking old man had loaded onto the ship just before we set off from London into the sea. I had seen them glaring at the man and raising two fingers to ward off the evil eye when they saw him. Wow! But the superstitions of foreigners are complete nonsense! I quickly sent them back to their duties; but immediately after, when the fog descended upon us, although I couldn't say for sure it was related to the crate, I felt they were up to something. Anyway, we continued our journey and when the fog didn't lift for five days, I let the wind take us, because if the Devil wanted to go somewhere - well, he would get his job done somehow. And if he didn't, we would be on the lookout. Indeed, we made good progress and always sailed in deep waters; two days ago, when the daytime sun broke through the fog, we found ourselves in the river opposite Galaţi. The Romanians went crazy, asking me to take the crate out and throw it into the river, whether it was right or wrong. I had to argue with them with a lever in my hand, and when the last of them got up from the ground holding his head, I convinced them that it was better for the shipowners' goods and consignments to be in my hands rather than in the Danube River, whether there was an evil eye or not. They had brought the crate onto the deck to throw it into the river, and since it was labeled 'Via Varna to Galaţi,' I thought of letting it stay on the deck until we unloaded the goods at the port and got rid of the crate entirely. We didn't clear customs that day and had to stay anchored overnight; but early in the morning, an hour before sunrise, a man came with instructions written from England, stating that he was to take a crate for someone named Count Dracula. Everything was in the man's hands. His documents were in order, and since I was getting uneasy about the matter, I was glad to be rid of the damn thing. If there was the Devil's baggage on the ship, I thought it must be this crate!""",14.948,14.616,"–When we crossed the Bosphorus, the men began to grumble; some of them, the Romanians, came to see me and asked me to throw overboard a large box that had been loaded by a sinister-looking old man, shortly before we left London. I had seen them spying on that fellow and raising their two index fingers when they saw him, to ward off the evil eye. Well! The superstitions of these foreigners are absolutely ridiculous! I quickly sent them to mind their own business, but as the fog closed in on us again shortly after, I somewhat felt that they might have a bit of a point, though I couldn't be sure it was about the large box again. Well, we continued sailing and, although the fog didn't leave us for five days, I let the wind guide us, since if the devil wanted to go somewhere... Well, I wouldn't stop him. And if he didn't guide us, well, we would take a look anyway. In any case, we had deep waters and a good voyage all the time, and two days ago, when the morning sun broke through the fog, we discovered that we were on the river, right in front of Galatz. The Romanians were furious and wanted, with or without my consent, to throw the large box overboard, into the river. I had to argue a bit with them, with a bar in hand, and when the last of them left the bridge with his head in his hands, I had managed to convince them that, evil eye or not, my employers' property was much better off on my ship than at the bottom of the Danube. They had brought the box up to the deck, ready to throw it into the water, and since it was marked Galatz via Varna, I thought it best to leave it there until we unloaded it at the port and got rid of it anyway. We didn't do much work that day, but in the morning, an hour before sunrise, a man came on board with an order written in English and sent from London, to receive a box marked for a certain Count Dracula. Naturally, everything was prepared for her to take it away. The paperwork was in order, and I was glad to get rid of that damned box, as I myself was starting to feel uneasy because of it. If the devil had any luggage on board, I was convinced it could only be that box.",23.061,22.843

He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box which would arrive at Galatz in the Czarina Catherine. This he was to give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port.

1911,"As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape. The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the box before sunrise. There is also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to Hildesheim.","To begin with, it is obvious that he intended to go to Galatz. For us, the order concerning Varna was derailed if we understood that he had left England and we had to strive to determine his actual destination. His sole immediate purpose was to find a way to escape our pursuit: The main evidence is the instructions recorded in the letter to Emmanuel Hildesheim, to receive and unload the box before sunrise, as well as the instructions for Petrof Skinsky.

There must surely be a letter or some form of communication, as he personally went to find Hildesheim.",7.79,6.03,"Regarding the first one, it is clear that he aimed to reach Galaţi and sent an invoice to Varna to deceive us so that we wouldn't learn the real reason for his departure from England; at that time, his sole purpose was to escape.

1912,"That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The Czarina Catherine made a phenomenally quick journey—so much so that Captain Donelson’s suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness played the Count’s game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the Count’s arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it—and here we lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water, moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been avoided.","According to what we know, up to this point, all of his plans have been completed. The ship Tsarine Catherine had such a terrifyingly fast journey that Captain Donelson became suspicious. How could the ship sail smoothly to Galatz through the eerie fog without encountering any trouble or collision? All of the count's preparations were effective. Hildesheim arrived to receive the wooden crate and handed it over to Skinsky. In turn, Skinsky also managed the crate - but that's as far as we know before losing track. Surely, those carrying the crate tried to avoid any encounters with customs or tax officials along the way.",4.22,2.916,"We know that their plans so far have been successful. Czarina Catherine made an astonishingly fast journey - so much so that it aroused Captain Donelson's suspicion; but his superstition, combined with his shrewdness, played into the Count's hands on his behalf, and he sped rapidly through the mists with a protective wind until he reached Galaţi blindly. It has been proven that the Count's arrangements were well made. Hildesheim took the chest and delivered it to Skinski. Skinski took it - and we lost track of it there. All we know is that the chest is moving somewhere over the water.

The Count wanted isolation.","The wooden box was handed over to Skinsky before dawn. At sunrise, the old count could appear in his true form. We need to understand why Skinsky was chosen as an accomplice. According to my husband's diary, Skinsky has connections with the Slovaki people who are trading upstream at the port.

Did the old count intend to divert everyone's attention?",15.083,13.56,"The chest was delivered to Skinski before sunrise. At sunrise, the Count could appear in his own form. Here, we must ask why Skinski was chosen to assist in these matters.

The Count wanted to be alone.",38.877,38.131,"The box was delivered to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise, the count could appear in his true form. Here we ask: why was Skinsky chosen to carry out this task? In my husband's diary, the said Skinsky is indicated as an individual who trafficked with the Slovaks who traded by the river, up to the port; and the cry of the women, that the crime had been committed by Slovaks, showed the general sentiment against those of his kind. The count desired isolation.",30.984,30.076
1915,"My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London. Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought, by murdering his agent.","That is my conjecture. From London, the old count decided to return to Dracula's castle by sea, the surest and most secretive route. Previously, the Gypsies had taken him and might have had the Slovakians transport the boxes of earth to Varna, then continue by ship to London. Thus, the old count knew exactly who was capable of organizing this service for him. Now, when the coffin is brought to the surface, he will emerge before sunrise or after sunset and then instruct Skinsky to continue transporting the coffin by river. He certainly killed this man to cover his tracks and erase any evidence of his presence.",8.819,7.606,"My guess is this: The Count decided to return to his castle via the most reliable and secret route, the waterway, while he was in London. He had been removed from the castle by the Gypsies, and most likely they had handed over their cargo, the crates, to the Slovaks who took them to Varna; from Varna, they were loaded onto a ship to be taken to London. Thus, the Count had gathered information about the people who could arrange this service. While the crate was on land, either before sunrise or after sunset, he met with Skinski and instructed him to arrange for the crate to be transported along the river. When these tasks were completed and he realized everything was progressing smoothly, he thought he had covered his tracks by killing his intermediary.",21.316,20.567,"I suppose that, in London, the count decided to return to his castle by water, since this was the safest and most secret way. He was taken from the castle by the gypsies, and they probably handed over their cargo to Slovaks, who took it to Varna, where it was shipped to London. Thus, the count knew the people who could perform this service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out of his box, met with Skinsky, and gave him instructions on what he had to do regarding finding someone who could transport the box by river. When Skinsky did so, and the count knew that everything was in order, he set about erasing the tracks by killing his agent.",34.315,33.783
1916,"I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then, was on a river in an open boat—propelled probably either by oars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There would be no such sound if floating down stream.","Reviewing the map, I realized that the nearest river convenient for the Slovakians to travel upstream could only be the Pruth River or the Sereth River. I saw that Van Helsing's notes mentioned the sounds of water swirling at ear level, the clattering of wood that I sensed while being hypnotized. Thus, it is possible that the Count is still lying in the coffin, but placed in the hold of an open boat and moved by oars or poles. Of course, the boat might not necessarily be on the Pruth or Sereth River, but we can determine this.",9.036,7.134,"I examined the map and saw that the most suitable river for the Slovaks to exit was either the Prut or the Seret. In the typed texts, I read that when I entered a trance, I heard distant cow sounds, water sounds at ear level, and the creaking of wood. So, the Count was on an open boat on the river - most likely being propelled by oars or poles because the two banks of the river are close and the boat is moving against the current. If he were letting himself drift with the current, such sounds wouldn't be heard.",17.025,15.949,"I have examined the maps and discovered that the most suitable river for the Slovaks to have ascended is the Pruth or the Sereth. I have read in the manuscript that in my moments of trance I heard cows in the distance and the sound of water at the level of my ears, as well as the sound of wood rubbing against wood. So, that means that the count, in his box, traveled on the river, in an open boat... probably propelled by means of oars or floats, since the banks are close and it sails against the current. Those noises would not occur if it were moving with the current.",23.682,22.887

Now of these two, the Pruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as close to Dracula’s castle as can be got by water.","Of course, the boat might not necessarily be on the Pruth or Sereth River, but we can determine this. Among these two small rivers, navigating the Pruth River seems much easier, but the Sereth River, at the Fundu section, receives the Bistriza River, which is a small river flowing around the Borgo Pass. The bend at the foot of the pass is the point most accessible to Dracula's castle if traveling by water.",15.461,13.856,"Of course, it may not be the Seret and the Prut, but we can certainly do more research.

We must be vigilant against any unforeseen events that may occur. — I think I can go with Quincey. - Dr. Seward interjected.",17.722,16.338,"“I brought a few Winchesters; they are quite useful in a crowd, and there might be wolves around. If you recall, the Count had taken some other precautions; he had made some requests that Ms. Harker could not hear or understand well. We must be prepared in every way.” Dr. Seward said:",39.23,38.115,"They can be used very well in the middle of a crowd and, besides, there are wolves. The Count, if you remember, took other precautions; he gave certain instructions that Mrs. Harker could neither hear nor understand. We must be prepared for anything. –I think it would be best if I go with Quincey -said Dr. Seward-.",30.969,29.903
1925,"“I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt together, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come along. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the Slovaks, and a chance thrust—for I don’t suppose these fellows carry guns—would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; we shall not rest until the Count’s head and body have been separated, and we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate.” He looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was torn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ... the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:—","- You too, Arthur, you shouldn't go alone like that. You might have to confront the Slovakians, and just one mistake could ruin all our plans. This time, don't let any mistakes happen. Of course, we will only stop when the Count is beheaded and we ensure that he cannot reincarnate. He spoke while looking at Jonathan, whereas Jonathan looked at me as if pondering something. I understood that he was deeply troubled inside. Of course, he always wanted to be by my side, but only those on the boat had the chance to destroy the ""vampire"" (Why do I always hesitate when mentioning this word?). He stood silently without saying a word. Van Helsing had to speak up to break the silence:",8.01,7.023,"""I think it would be best if I go with Quincey.

This time we must not leave anything to chance; we will not stop until the Count's head is separated from his body and we are sure he will not rise again."" He looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see the poor thing was torn. Of course, he wanted to stay by my side, but then, that boat trip would most likely be the thing that destroys the vam... vam... vampire. (Why am I hesitant to write that word?)

We mustn't take risks this time; we won't rest until the count's head and body have been separated and we are sure that he won't be able to reincarnate. He looked at Jonathan while he spoke, and my husband looked at me. I understood that the poor man was desperate. Naturally, he wanted to be with me; but, in any case, the group that would leave in the boat would be the one most likely to destroy the..., the... vampire (why do I hesitate to write the word?). He remained silent for a moment and Dr. Van Helsing intervened, saying:",31.887,31.496
1926,"“Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the last; and again that it is your right to destroy him—that—which has wrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to fight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight in other way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy’s country. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running stream whence he cannot escape to land—where he dares not raise the lid of his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to perish—we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,—from Bistritz over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam Mina’s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way—all dark and unknown otherwise—after the first sunrise when we are near that fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.” Here Jonathan interrupted him hotly:—","— Dear friend Jonathan, there are two reasons why you must listen to us. First, you are young and no less brave, and you have the ability to fight, while the strength of all of us must be focused on the final battle. Moreover, you are the one who deserves to directly destroy what has caused you and your loved ones so much suffering. As for Mina at this time, you don't need to worry at all, I will take care of her to the best of my ability. After all, I am old, my legs are no longer as agile as before, I am not used to long horseback rides, nor am I good at wielding weapons. But if necessary, I can die like a true young man. How can I tell you what I am wishing for now! Here’s the plan, you will go upstream by boat with Lord Godalming, while John and Quincey will follow along the shore to guard against the possibility of the Tsarine Catherine docking unexpectedly. Meanwhile, I will lead Mina to the enemy's lair. While the old fox is still lying in the coffin on the ship heading upstream and cannot climb onto the land, or does not dare to open the lid for fear of the Slovaki throwing it into the water in panic - we will follow the path that Jonathan once took, from Bistritz to Borgo, and find our way to Dracula's castle. Mina's ability to enter a trance will certainly help us find our way in a strange land - right after the first sunrise on the necessary journey. There is still so much to do before the snake's den is eradicated. Jonathan eagerly interrupted:",11.733,11.276,"“My friend Jonathan, this task is yours for two reasons. First, because you are young, courageous, and capable of fighting, and for this last reason, all your strength may be needed, and it is your right to destroy this person who has caused such suffering to you and your loved ones. Do not worry about Madam Mina; if I can, she will be under my protection. I am old. My legs can no longer run as fast as they used to, and I am not accustomed to long rides, chases, or fighting with deadly weapons as required. But I can serve in other ways; I can fight in other ways. And if necessary, I can die like men younger than myself. Now, with your permission, let me tell you what I will do: Lord Godalming and my friend Jonathan, while you advance on the river with your fast, small steamship, and John and Quincey guard the riverbank where the Count might have found an opportunity, I will take Madam Mina to the very heart of our enemy's country. While the old fox progresses over the water, unable to escape ashore - the Slovak carriers, out of fear, do not dare to lift the lid of his coffin and leave him to decay - we will follow Jonathan's tracks, go from Bistriţa to Borgo, and from there find the way to Dracula's Castle. Here, Madam Mina's hypnotic power will certainly be of help, and following the first sunrise near that hateful place, with the help of her hypnotic power, we will find the otherwise completely dark and foreign path to us. There is much work to be done to destroy the nests of vipers, and other places to be sanctified.” Here Jonathan interrupted excitedly:",24.072,23.77,"–Friend Jonathan, that is your responsibility for two reasons: firstly, because you are young, brave, and can fight. All forces may be necessary at the final moment; moreover, you have the right to destroy him, since he has caused so much suffering to you and yours. Do not worry about Mrs. Mina; I will take care of her, if I can. I am old and my legs no longer allow me to run as before; besides, I am not accustomed to riding such a long distance to chase the count, as may be necessary, nor to fighting with deadly weapons. And I can die, if necessary, as well as younger men. Let me tell you what I desire: while you, Lord Godalming, and our friend Jonathan, advance so quickly in your beautiful steam launch, and while John and Quincey guard the shore, where Dracula may have disembarked by chance, I will take Mrs. Mina directly to the enemy's territory. While the old fox is locked in his box, floating in the middle of the river current, where he cannot escape to land, and where he cannot afford to lift the cover of his box, because those transporting him would throw him into the water and let him perish in it, we must follow the trail taken by Jonathan. From Bistritz, over the Borgo, and we must find the way to Count Dracula's castle. There, Mrs. Mina's hypnotic power can surely help us, and we will set out on the path, which is dark and unknown, after the first dawn immediately following our arrival in the vicinity of that grim place. There is much to do, and other places to sanctify, so that this nest of vipers is destroyed. At that moment, Jonathan interrupted him, saying passionately:",22.447,22.148

The Professor’s voice, as he spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed us all:—","— Do you know what kind of place that is? Have you ever seen such a terrifying hell? A place where even the moonlight takes on grotesque shapes? Where every speck of dust whirls madly in the wind, always potentially manifesting into female demons?

I understand that! Sorry to upset you again, but what I am saying is necessary, my friend. Do you think we should let such a harsh reality occur?

1931,"Later.—Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked. How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money! What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do when basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing to spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within another hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each of us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment’s notice. Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We have all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. Professor Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti, where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and horses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust in the matter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages, so we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me a large-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like the rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my forehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me that I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting colder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as warnings.","• A moment later Indeed, I was greatly comforted to work with such brave men as my husband's friends! A gentle woman cannot help but admire such serious, honest, and courageous men! But to be honest, I also secretly appreciate their financial capabilities. Without money, what could we possibly accomplish at this moment? I am very grateful for the wealth of Lord Godalming and also that of Mr. Quincey Morris. If they were poor, we could not have set out here, and so quickly at that. Each of our tasks was well arranged, and everyone tried to complete all their duties. In just three hours, Lord Godalming and Jonathan had a lovely steam launch ready to depart at the first signal. Dr. Seward and Morris managed to buy half a dozen thoroughbred horses, already saddled. We also purchased all necessary maps and equipment. At 11:40 PM tonight, I will go with Dr. Van Helsing to Veresti, where we can buy a carriage to reach the Borgo Pass. Of course, we must carry a lot of cash to buy the carriage and some horses. We have to manage on our own, as we know no one else trustworthy enough to help with the purchases. The professor is fluent in many languages, so there is no need to worry about this matter. We are all armed. Even I have a large revolver. Jonathan is only calm when he sees that I am armed like the others. Dr. Van Helsing said the gun could help me if I encounter wolves. The weather is getting colder with snowstorms swirling around as if to challenge us.",12.0,11.609,"Later on. - Ah, it did me good to see how these brave men work. When men are so sincere, so honest, and so brave, how can women help but love them! And this made me think of the perfect power of money. What can't it do when used correctly! And what can it do when used cowardly! I am grateful that Lord Godalming is rich, and that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are ready to spend their money so freely. Because if they weren't, our little expedition could neither start so quickly nor be so well-equipped as it will be in an hour. It hasn't even been three hours since we organized the tasks each of us has to do, and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a nice steam launch ready to go at any moment. Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a dozen well-equipped fine horses. We have taken all the maps and every kind of equipment we could find. Professor Van Helsing and I will go to Veresti tonight on the 11:40 train, where we will arrange for a carriage to take us to the Borgo Pass. We have plenty of cash with us as we will buy a carriage and horses. We will drive the carriage ourselves, as there is no one we can trust with this task. The professor knows many languages, so we will not have any problems. We are all armed, and even I have been given a large-caliber pistol; Jonathan would not be happy if I were not armed like the others. Alas! I cannot carry one of the weapons the others have; the scar on my forehead does not allow it. Dear Dr. Van Helsing reassures me by saying that I am fully armed because there might be wolves; with each passing hour, the weather gets colder, and there are flurries of snow coming and going as if to warn us.",37.4,37.217,"Later. It did me a lot of good to see the way those brave men work. How is it possible that women do not love men who are so sincere, frank, and brave? Likewise, I thought about the extraordinary power of money. What can't it do when applied correctly? What can't it achieve when used in a low manner? I am very happy that Lord Godalming is so rich and that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has a lot of money, are willing to spend it so liberally. Because, if it were not so, our expedition would not have been able to set off, neither so quickly nor with such good equipment, as it will do within another hour. Not even three hours have passed since it was decided what role each of us would play, and now, Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a beautiful steam launch, and are ready to depart at any moment. Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a dozen excellent horses, all prepared. We possess all the maps and enlargements of all kinds that it is possible to obtain.

1934,"October 30. Night.—I am writing this in the light from the furnace door of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our plans, we finally decided that Mina’s guess was correct, and that if any waterway was chosen for the Count’s escape back to his Castle, the Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We took it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the Carpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me to sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on watch. But I cannot sleep—how can I with the terrible danger hanging over my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My only comfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it would be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started; they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead their spare horses—four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look after the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they can mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and can be easily adapted for Mina, if required.","• October 30 I am writing these lines under the light streaming through the boiler room door on the boat, while Lord Godalming takes on the responsibility of operating the boiler, as he is quite experienced after many years with his small boat on the Thames and on the lakes in Norfolk. After studying various maps, we decided to follow Mina's hypothesis: if there is a waterway that takes Dracula back to his castle, it can only be the Sereth River, then from the confluence continue along the Bistritza River. We consider the ideal place to cross the land, between the river and the Carpathian range, to be at 47 degrees north latitude. Our boat can speed at full throttle without any worries: the river's water is deep everywhere and the distance between the banks is always wide enough for us to glide comfortably on the water, even at night. Lord Godalming advised me to take a nap, saying that at this moment, one person is enough to manage everything. But how could I sleep when my mind is always heavy with fear about a vague danger looming over my wife on her way to that dreadful place? My only solace is to remind myself that our friends are in the protective arms of God. Without this belief, the simplest way for me to escape all the bitterness would be to seek death. Morris and Dr. Seward set off on horseback ahead of us because the route they have to take is very long and not without hardships. They followed the Sereth River upstream to maintain a certain view of the river and to avoid the rough, winding roads. Two riders with spare horses accompanied them in the initial stages to avoid drawing attention. These two riders will soon return, and then my two friends will have to manage everything on their own. There may come a time when we will have to meet them to continue the rest of the journey on horseback together.",9.39,8.931,"October 30, evening. - I am writing these lines by the light coming from the furnace door of the steamship; Lord Godalming is tending the fire. He is experienced in this matter, having had one boat on the Thames and another on the Norfolk Broads for many years. As for our plans, we have finally decided that Mina's predictions are correct and that if the Count has chosen any waterway for his escape to his castle, it would be the Seret and then immediately the Bistriţa beside it. We thought the crossing of the lands between the river and the Carpathian Mountains would be somewhere near the 47th parallel. We are not afraid of crossing the river swiftly at night; there is plenty of water making it easy enough to proceed with the steamship even in the dark, and the shores are far enough apart. Lord Godalming tells me to sleep for a while, as one person keeping watch is sufficient for now. But I cannot sleep - how can I sleep while my beloved is in that dreadful danger and heading to that terrible place... My only solace is that we are in God's hands. With this belief alone, dying and thus escaping all troubles would be easier than living. Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward had set out on their long journey on horseback before we departed; they will advance until they reach the lands high enough on the right bank of the river to see it and avoid its bends. In the initial stages, they have two men to ride and manage the spare horses - they are four in total to avoid arousing curiosity. After sending the men away - which will happen shortly - they will take care of the horses themselves. The grip of one of the saddles is movable and can be easily adjusted for Mina if necessary.",24.26,24.029,"October 30, at night. I am writing this by the light given off by the boiler of the steam launch; Lord Godalming is acting as stoker. He has experience in the work, as he had his own boat on the Thames and another on the Norfolk Broads for many years. Regarding our plans, we have finally decided that Mina's assumptions were relevant and that if the Count had chosen a waterway to return to his castle, it must necessarily be the Sereth and Bistritza rivers. We assumed that somewhere near the forty-seventh degree of north latitude would be the chosen place to cross the country between the river and the Carpathians. We were not afraid to move at a good speed on the river, in the middle of the night; the water is deep and the banks are far enough apart from us so that we can navigate calmly and without difficulties, even in the dark. Lord Godalming tells me to sleep for a while; that it is enough for the moment that one of us stays on guard. But I cannot sleep… How could I, with the terrible danger hanging over my dear wife and thinking that she is heading towards that accursed place…? My only consolation is that we are in God's hands. The bad thing is that, with that faith, it would be easier to die than to continue living, to put an end to all these worries once and for all. Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward set out to make their enormous journey on horseback before we set off; they must stay on the riverbank, at a considerable distance, on the highlands, so that they can see a good stretch of the river without needing to follow its meanders. For the first stages, they have two men with them, to lead their spare horses… Four in total, in order not to arouse curiosity. When they dismiss the men, which will happen quite soon, they will have to take care of the horses themselves. It is possible that we will need to join forces, and in that case, we can all ride the horses… One of the saddles has a movable pommel, which can be adapted for Mina, if necessary.",31.153,30.956

Here, as we are rushing along through the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes home. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into a whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the furnace door....","Our journey was truly an adventurous and perilous trip!

The men were scared every time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and prayed.","• October 31 Still on the pursuit journey. A new day is coming. Lord Godalming just woke up after a good night's sleep. The morning weather is very cold. We passed several cargo barges but did not see any carrying a wooden coffin like we were looking for.

1937,"1 November, evening.—No news all day; we have found nothing of the kind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat, and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them, going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the night. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he shall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poor dear Mina and me.","• November 1, afternoon Today, there is nothing new. We haven't found what we were looking for, despite keeping an eye on all the large and small boats we encountered on the river. Now we are in Bistritza. If the hypothesis our group proposed is wrong, then we have lost all our chances. This morning, we were warmly welcomed by the sailors on a government ship and managed to obtain a Romanian flag to put on our boat. The flag facilitated our approach and inquiries with the boats traveling on the river without any obstacles. Some Slovakians informed us about a large ship, with several sailors who looked like ghosts on the deck, passing them at an unusually high speed. They saw this ship near the Fundu junction, where the Bistritza river flows into the Sereth river, so they didn't know which way it intended to turn. We arrived at Fundu but didn't learn anything new, likely because the ship crossed the river during the night. My eyes are heavy with sleep, perhaps the biting cold has stimulated an instinct that is growing stronger within me. Godalming insisted on taking the first watch. God will bless him, a friend who is wholeheartedly dedicated to my wife and me.",7.373,6.663,"November 1, evening. - No news all day; we found nothing of the sort we were looking for. We have now moved on to Bistriţa, and if we are wrong in our guess, it means we have lost our chance. We checked all the boats, big and small. Early this morning, one of the crew mistook us for a government boat and acted accordingly. We saw something in this that would make things easier; thus, we obtained a Romanian flag now conspicuously waving at Fundu, where the Bistriţa merges with the Seret. Since then, this trick has worked on all the boats we have inspected; we are shown every respect and not once have we been opposed in what we ask or want to do. Some of the Slovaks said that a large boat, which was going faster than usual due to double crew on deck, passed by them. This was before they reached Fundu, so they couldn't tell if the boat returned to Bistriţa or proceeded up along the Seret. We heard nothing about such a boat at Fundu; it must have passed there during the night. I am very sleepy; perhaps the cold is starting to affect me badly, and even nature needs to rest at times.

This morning, early, the crew of one of them thought we were a government vessel, and treated us very well. We saw in this, in a way, an improvement in our situation; thus, in Fundu, where the Bistritza converges into the Sereth. We obtained a Romanian flag which we now carry on the bow. This trick has been successful with all the boats we have encountered since; everyone has shown us great deference and no one has objected to anything we wanted to inspect or ask about. In Fundu we did not get any news about any similar boat, so it must have passed through there at night.

It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept so long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a new man this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and keeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to me. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to Veresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they would be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am afraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them are very large—at present, at all events, though they are terrible doubtless in winter and when the snow melts—the horsemen may not have met much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be necessary to take counsel together what to do next.","• November 2, morning The sun was already high, but my friend still didn't want to wake me up. He said that doing so would be wrong, as a peaceful sleep would temporarily make me forget the worries in my heart. I felt a bit selfish for having slept so long. But anyway, Godalming was right because clearly this morning I felt like a completely different person, fully capable of controlling the boat and observing everything happening around. It seemed I had regained my strength and determination. I wonder where Mina and Dr. Van Helsing are now. Surely they must have reached Varesti by Wednesday noon as planned. They would need some time to buy a carriage and a few horses. If everything went smoothly, they should definitely be at Borgo Pass by now. May God protect them! I shivered at the thought of what might happen to them. I wish we could go faster. But the boat's engines were already running at maximum speed. How can we catch up with Dr. Seward and Morris?... There were many small streams flowing down from the cliffs into the river we were traveling on, but they wouldn't pose any significant obstacles to the riders—at least not today, when there was no snow.

1950,"1 November.—All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go willingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic; he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and off we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice qualities. They are very, very superstitious. In the first house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can’t abide garlic. Ever since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have escaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he made me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he says that I answered as usual “darkness, lapping water and creaking wood”; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr. Van Helsing is sleeping. Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror’s; even in his sleep he is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make him rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us, and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be needed.... All is ready; we are off shortly.","• November 1 We galloped tirelessly all day long. The horses seemed to understand the kind treatment from their owners and did not let us down. They were frequently changed, and each one showed obedience to their owners, making us feel encouraged and supported. Along the way, Van Helsing seemed very reserved; he only told the locals that we were in a hurry to get to Bistritza and paid them generously to change horses for us. We only stopped briefly to quench our thirst or grab a quick bite before continuing on our journey. This land is truly wonderful, with breathtaking scenery as far as the eye can see. The people here are also admirable: they are brave, strong, simple, and equally enthusiastic towards guests. But they are also very, very superstitious. At the first house we stopped at, the landlady made the sign of the cross and held up two fingers towards me as if to ward off bad luck upon seeing the mark on my forehead. I think she even intentionally put garlic in my food for the same reason, but I can't stand the smell of garlic! Therefore, I thought to myself that I must learn from this experience for the future, not to remove my hat or veil to avoid being discriminated against. We still sped forward quickly. The professor seemed to know no fatigue; he said he didn't need to rest all day, and I could just take a long nap in the car. At sunset, he hypnotized me again to gather information. I answered as usual: ""Pitch dark, the sound of water waves, the creaking of the wooden floor."" So, our enemy was still underwater. Thinking about Jonathan suddenly made me shiver, even though at this moment I had no doubts about the harmful things to him and myself. I wrote these lines while waiting for people to prepare horses and carriages at a farm. Finally, Dr. Van Helsing had to lie down for a bit; he looked much older and seemed exhausted. When we continue on our way, I will persuade him to let me hold the reins, while he rests to regain his strength. I said we had more than a day's journey ahead, so he couldn't be exhausted at the moment when strength was most needed. Everything is ready again. We continue our journey.",8.768,8.321,"November 1st. - We were on the road all day and made good progress. The horses seem to know they are being treated kindly, as they run at their best speed of their own accord. We have changed so many horses so far and have seen the same thing consistently that we dare to think the journey will be easy. Dr. Van Helsing speaks briefly and to the point; he tells the farmers that he is in a hurry to get to Bistriţa and pays them well to change the horses. We drink soup, coffee, or tea and immediately set off again. It is a very beautiful country; filled with all imaginable beauties, and the people seem brave, strong, simple, and pleasant. They are very, very superstitious. At the first house we stopped at, the woman who served us crossed herself when she saw the scar on my forehead and extended two fingers towards me to ward off the evil eye. I think they have taken the trouble to put extra garlic in our food, and I cannot stand garlic. Since then, I have been careful not to take off my hat or veil, thus avoiding their suspicions. We are traveling fast, and since we do not have a driver who carries gossip with him, we are ahead of the gossip; but I can say that the fear of the evil eye follows us all along the way. The professor seems tireless; despite forcing me to sleep for long periods, he has not rested at all throughout the day. At sunset, he hypnotized me, and as usual, he says I responded, ""Darkness, rushing water, and creaking wood."" I am afraid to think of Jonathan, but somehow I am no longer afraid for him or myself. I am writing these lines while we wait for the horses to be prepared at a farmhouse. Dr. Van Helsing is sleeping. Poor thing, he looks very tired, old, and troubled, but his mouth is set as firmly as that of a conqueror; even in his sleep, he is full of determination. When we set off, I must ensure he rests while I drive the carriage. I will tell him that there are still days ahead of us and that he must not be exhausted when his full strength is needed. Everything is ready, we are setting off shortly.",32.691,32.516,"November 1st. We have traveled all day at a good speed. The horses seem to know that we are treating them kindly, as they show a willingness to move at the best pace. We have had some changes and found the same thing so consistently that we feel encouraged to think the journey will be easy. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic; he tells the farmers that he is in a hurry to get to Bistritz and pays them well for changing horses. They give us hot soup, coffee, or tea, and we leave immediately. It is a charming landscape, full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, strong, and simple; they seem to have many beautiful qualities. They are very, very superstitious. At the first house we stopped at, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and held two fingers in front of me to ward off the evil eye.

Since then, I have been careful not to remove my veil, and in this way, I have managed to escape their suspicions.

There is a strange heaviness in the air—I say heaviness for want of a better word; I mean that it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep us comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered “darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,” so the river is changing as they ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of danger—more than need be; but we are in God’s hands.","• November 2, morning I succeeded in persuading him: we took turns holding the reins throughout the night. A new day had begun, it was bright but cold. The weather was strangely oppressive, I say oppressive because I couldn't find a more accurate word, as both of us felt an indescribable suffocation. It must be said that it was very cold; without the fur coats, I don't know how we would have managed. At dawn, Van Helsing hypnotized me once again. According to him, I responded: ""Pitch dark, the sound of waves roaring, the creaking of wooden planks."" So the river is undergoing some transformation as the wooden coffin is being carried upstream. I hope my husband will not be in danger.

It's very cold and only our warm furs are keeping us comfortable. At dawn, Van Helsing hypnotized me; he said I responded with “Darkness, creaking wood, and roaring water,” so it means there are changes in the river as they move upstream.

1952,"2 November, night.—All day long driving. The country gets wilder as we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us and tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr. Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude four-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no trouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can drive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive before. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what will to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor darling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, and that He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both, and who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in His sight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred His wrath.","• November 2, afternoon Continuously walking on the road, not even thinking about taking a break. The landscape spread out before us, the peaks of the Carpathians in Veresti suddenly loomed around us and seemed to block the path we had to take. We tried to encourage each other and also to encourage ourselves, not to fall into a state of pessimism. Professor Van Helsing told us we would reach the Borgo Pass at sunrise. This area doesn't have many replacement horses, so he planned to keep the newly bought ones to go all the way. We had two spare horses, and they were all thoroughbreds with enough patience to travel long distances. Nothing went wrong with us on the way, so much so that I could easily hold the reins and control the team of horses. We will reach the Borgo Pass early tomorrow morning, and then we can rest a bit. What will happen to us tomorrow? The eerie castle where my beloved husband endured so many horrors is approaching. May God guide us in the right direction? May God watch over my husband and all the friends I love, who are facing a looming danger? As for me, it doesn't matter if He doesn't protect me. Oh Lord!

There are very few houses here now, and the Professor says that the last horses we took will have to stay with us because we might not have the opportunity to change them. In addition to the two horses we changed, we have two more, so we have roughly four horses. Dear horses are patient and good-natured, they do not cause us any trouble. The other travelers do not worry us, and thus even I can drive the carriage. We will reach the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive earlier. So we are taking it slow and both of us are taking long rests in turns. Oh, I wonder what tomorrow will bring us? We will search for the place where my poor beloved suffered greatly. God, help us to be rightly guided, and may my husband and our loved ones, who are in mortal danger, be watched over by God. As for me, I am not worthy in His eyes. Ah! I am a sinner in His eyes, and I will remain so until He allows me to stand before Him as one who has not aroused His wrath.",30.944,30.677,"November 2, at night. We have been traveling all day.

The houses are now very scarce, and the professor says that the last horse we obtained will have to continue with us, as it is very likely that we will not be able to change it again.

It is morning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept alive—Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all winter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have affected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was not like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost her appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so faithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well. However, to-night she is more vif. Her long sleep all day have refresh and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset I try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown less and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether.

The day has dawned, and I write by the flickering firelight throughout the night thanks to Mina's hand. It is cold, very cold, so cold that the sky turns gray with the first snowflakes of winter. When they fall, these snowflakes will reign over the Borgo Pass throughout the bleak winter season. Mina also seems numb from the cold. The frost has turned her into a completely different person. She sleeps, sleeps, and sleeps. Normally she is so active, yet she did nothing at all yesterday. Even eating does not appeal to her. And she hasn't touched the small notebook she always carries with her to jot down notes whenever she rests along the way. I feel something unusual constantly ringing in my ears. However, yesterday afternoon, she somewhat regained her usual agility. The long sleep during the day seemed to have relieved her fatigue and made her cheerful and pleasant as always. As dusk fell at the foot of the pass, I intended to hypnotize her to see if there was anything new, but my goodness, I tried and tried with no result. My ability is diminishing day by day, and this evening, I have completely failed.

Normally very brisk, Madam Mina did literally nothing all day; she even lost her appetite. Madam Mina, who usually writes with great dedication at every break, did not record anything in her little journal. Something whispers to me that not everything is alright. But tonight she is more lively. Her long sleep has revived and refreshed her, for she is now as sweet and radiant as ever. At sunset, I try to hypnotize her, but alas!

1956,"We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As before, came the answer: “darkness and the swirling of water.” Then she woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass. At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:—","We arrived at Borgo Pass at dawn yesterday. As soon as I saw the first light of dawn, I immediately stopped the car and told Mina to prepare for hypnosis. I made a temporary bed out of fur coats: Mina would lie on it to enter a trance, but indeed this time it was very difficult for me as well. The answer was still the same: ""Pitch dark, swirling water."" As soon as she said this, she woke up, her face looking visibly happier and more radiant. We continued on our way and soon crossed the pass. Her enthusiasm had turned her into a very eager person. Clearly, a new strength was guiding her, as I saw her suddenly point towards the road ahead and say:",10.948,9.84,"Yesterday morning, just after sunrise, we arrived at the Borgo Pass.

The response was the same as before: ""Darkness and violently flowing waters."" Then she woke up lively and cheerful, and we continued on our way, soon reaching the Pass.

It is used but little, and very different from the coach road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and more of use.","At first, I found it strange, but then I quickly regained my composure because, in reality, there was only one interprovincial road like this here. It seemed like this was a road with very few passersby, quite different from the road from Bukovina to Bistritza, which was wider, gravel-paved, and always bustling with people.",8.746,6.581,"At first, it struck me as a bit odd, but soon I thought that there could be only this one side road.

It is very little used, and extremely different from the main road that leads from Bucovina to Bistritz, which is wider, harder, and more frequently used.",25.021,23.049
1961,"So we came down this road; when we meet other ways—not always were we sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow have fallen—the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and they go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long hours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and she succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may not wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm her; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be all-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel guilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I look down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood, so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep. For we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though it were the end of the world.","We followed the road Mina had just pointed out. When we encountered other paths, we suddenly became doubtful. Are these really the right roads? I wasn't sure, because they were all rugged and somewhat scattered with fallen snow. Our horses had stepped in and were the only ones diligently moving along the road. I loosened the reins and let them trot. We gradually recognized everything Jonathan had described in his admirable journal. The horses continued to rhythmically clop their hooves on the seemingly endless paths. At first, I had to make Mina lie down to sleep. She tried and eventually fell into a deep sleep. She slept continuously, so soundly that I became alarmed and had to wake her up. But she still slept as if nothing had happened. I didn't dare to wake her abruptly because I knew she had endured too much, and after all, a good sleep would surely make her feel better. Suddenly, I felt like I was at fault with her. Therefore, I quietly returned to my seat, holding the reins and urging the horses to go faster. Mina was still asleep. The twilight gradually descended, casting a golden hue like chicken fat on the snowflakes and our long, lanky shadows on the steep mountain slopes. Our car climbed higher and higher, amidst a desolate, remote, rugged landscape, as if we were reaching the end of the world!",5.981,5.197,"Thus, we embarked on this path; when other paths appeared before us - we were not always sure they were paths because they were neglected and lightly covered with snow - the horses knew where to go, in fact, only they knew. I left the reins to them, and they proceeded with great patience. Soon, we found everything Jonathan had noted in his astonishing journal. Then we progressed for long, long, long hours. At first, I told Madam Mina to sleep; she tried and succeeded. She kept sleeping until I became suspicious and tried to wake her. But she continued to sleep, and despite my efforts, I couldn't wake her. I didn't want to push too hard to avoid hurting her because I knew she was suffering greatly and that sleep was everything to her at times. I think I must have fallen asleep too, because suddenly I felt guilty as if I had done something wrong; I found myself sitting upright with the reins in my hands, and the good-natured horses were trotting along slowly as usual. I looked down and saw that Madam Mina was still asleep. There wasn't much time left until sunset, and the sunlight was streaming over the snow like a great yellow flood, casting huge, long shadows where the mountain rose steeply. Because we kept going up, up without stopping, and everything was so wild and rocky as if we had reached the end of the world!",17.198,16.798,"So we took that path. We found other paths (we were not always sure they were real paths, as they were neglected and covered with a light layer of snow). The horses knew, and only they did. I left the reins loose, and the animals continued patiently. One after another, we found all the things that Jonathan noted in the wonderful diary he wrote. Then, we continued for long and extended hours. At first, I told Mrs. Mina to sleep; she tried and managed to do so. She slept the whole time until, finally, I felt my suspicions growing and tried to wake her, but she kept sleeping and I couldn't wake her despite my attempts. I didn't want to do it too forcefully for fear of harming her, as I know she has suffered a lot and that sleep, at times, can be very beneficial for her. I think I dozed off, because suddenly, I felt guilty, as if I had done something wrong. I found myself upright, with the reins in hand and the beautiful horses trotting as usual. I looked down and saw that Mrs. Mina was still asleep. It's not long until sunset and, over the snow, the sunlight glistens like a huge yellow stream, so that we cast a long shadow where the mountain rises vertically. We are climbing and climbing continuously and everything is, oh, very rugged and rocky. As if it were the end of the world.",14.651,14.192
1962,"Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as though I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down. Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake, and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we first enter the Count’s house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter, to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already—that she was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes obedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have harnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it not. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!—I am afraid of all things—even to think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.","That was also the moment when I woke Mina up without much difficulty, but the only thing was that I could no longer easily hypnotize her. Not only did she not go into a trance, but she also acted as if I didn't exist in this world. I kept trying and trying, and eventually, both she and I sank into darkness. I suddenly realized that the sun had sunk behind the mountain ranges. Mina suddenly burst out laughing, making me turn to look at her. She was still completely awake. I was surprised, feeling that something was not right. I stood up, took the reserved firewood from the cart, and found a spot to light a fire. She prepared dinner while I untied the horses to feed them. When I returned to the fire, the meal was already prepared. I intended to serve Mina, but she smiled and said that she had already eaten because she was too hungry to wait for me. I felt unhappy, suspecting that she was lying but said nothing for fear of upsetting her. I sat and ate alone to get it over with, then went back to the cart to get a fur coat, put it on, and sat by the fire. I told Mina to sleep first, so I could stay awake and watch over everything. But in reality, I had been awake for a long time, and when I suddenly remembered this, I quickly turned to look at her: she was lying in the fur coat I had just brought, her eyes still wide open, staring at me. How sparkling those eyes were! I just sat there and only dozed off for a moment when the sky began to lighten. I intended to turn and hypnotize her once more, but wait! It seemed she was still awake. The sun rose high, and only then did she fall asleep. Even though it was too late, she still slept deeply and heavily to the point that I had no way to wake her up. In the end, I had to carry her and place her in the cart after harnessing the horses. Mina was still asleep. She looked much more rosy. That phenomenon did not signal anything good to me. I was scared, scared, and scared. I was afraid of everything, even my own thoughts. But no matter what, I still had to see it through to the end. The game was a gamble between life and death, or perhaps even more than that. We could no longer turn back.",7.1,6.594,"Then I wake Madam Mina. This time she wakes up without much trouble, and then I try to put her into a hypnotic sleep. It's as if she's not trying to sleep. Still, I keep trying, trying; until suddenly I find both of us in the dark; so I look around and see that the sun has set. Madam Mina laughs; I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake and looks better than I have seen her since the night we first entered the Count's house in Carfax. I am surprised and feel uneasy at that moment; but she is so lively, so gentle and thoughtful towards me that I forget all fears. Since we brought wood with us, I make a fire; she prepares food while I untie, rest, secure, and feed the horses. Then, when I return to the fire, my meal is ready. I go to help her; but she laughs and says she has already eaten - she was so hungry that she couldn't wait. I don't like this, I have great doubts, but I am afraid of alarming her and so I say nothing. She helps me, and I eat my meal alone; then we wrap ourselves in furs and lie down by the fire, and I tell her to sleep while I keep watch. But I immediately forget that I am keeping watch, and when I suddenly remember, I find Madam Mina lying quietly but awake, looking at me with shining eyes. The same thing happened a couple more times, and I got quite a bit of sleep until morning. When I woke up, I tried to hypnotize her, but alas! Even though she obediently closed her eyes, she couldn't sleep. The sun rose higher and higher, her sleep came very late, but it was such a heavy sleep that she wouldn't wake up. When I had harnessed the horses and prepared everything, I had to lift her and place her in the carriage. Madam is still sleeping, sleeping, and in her sleep, she looks healthier and redder than before. And I don't like this. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid! (I am afraid of everything.) I am even afraid to think, but I must continue on my way. This task we have undertaken is a matter of life and death, even more, and we must not retreat.",31.284,31.103,"Then, I woke up Mrs. Mina. This time she woke up without much difficulty and, then, I tried to make her sleep hypnotically, but I couldn't; it was as if I wasn't there. However, I keep trying repeatedly, until suddenly, we find ourselves in the dark, so I look around and discover that the sun has gone. Mrs. Mina laughs and I turn towards her. Now she is wide awake and looks as good as I have ever seen her since that night in Carfax, when we first entered the Count's house. I feel astonished and uneasy, but she is so lively, tender, and solicitous with me, that I forget all fear. I light a fire, as we brought a supply of wood with us, and she prepares food while I untie the horses and settle them in the shade to feed them. Then, when I returned to the campfire, she had my dinner ready. I went to help her, but she smiled at me and said she had already eaten, that she was so hungry she couldn't wait. I didn't like that, and I have terrible doubts, but I fear scaring her and don't mention anything about it. Mrs. Mina helped me, I ate, and then, we wrapped ourselves in the furs and lay down beside the fire. I told her to sleep and that I would keep watch, but suddenly I forget to keep watch and, when I suddenly remember that I must do so, I find her lying still; but awake, looking at me with very bright eyes. This happened once or twice and I was able to sleep until morning. When I woke up, I tried to hypnotize her, but, although she obediently closed her eyes, she couldn't fall asleep. The sun rose higher and higher and, then, sleep came to her, too late; it was so strong, that she did not wake up. I had to lift her and place her, asleep, in the carriage, once I had harnessed the horses and prepared everything. The lady continues to sleep, and her face looks healthier and rosier than before, and I don't like that. I'm scared, very scared! I am afraid of all things. Even of thinking; but I must continue my path. What we are risking is something of life or death, or even more than that, and we must not hesitate for a moment.",20.398,20.134

1964,"All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and moving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great, frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held sometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her—even for food. I began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as she is with that Vampire baptism. “Well,” said I to myself, “if it be that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at night.” As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell of in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill, the end was near.","We still trudged on throughout the entire winter day and were approaching the mountain peaks that blocked a land which became increasingly desolate and savage in the eyes of the traveler. I cannot recount the countless silent caves and deep crevices interspersed with roaring waterfalls, as if nature occasionally played a masquerade before its own Lent. Mina remained deeply asleep. Feeling a gnawing hunger, I had to sit and eat alone because I couldn't wake her up to share the meal. I suddenly became worried. ""If she keeps sleeping all day - I thought to myself - then perhaps I'll have to sleep all night."" We were traveling on a rough road, crudely made in the old style. Despite my best efforts, I still nodded off. When I awoke with a guilty feeling, Mina was still asleep. The sun had already shifted to the afternoon. But everything had changed. The suspicious mountain peaks seemed farther away, and we were near a steep hill, upon which stood an ancient, solitary castle, resembling the one Jonathan described in his diary. Joy and worry almost intertwined within me at the same time, because now, whether good or bad, the end was near.",9.98,9.399,"Yesterday, we were on the road all day and we are getting closer and closer to the mountains, advancing towards wilder and more desolate lands. There are alarming steep cliffs with waterfalls, and it seems as if Nature occasionally holds a carnival here. Madam Mina is still sleeping, sleeping; despite getting hungry and feeding myself, I couldn't wake her up - not even for food. Since she is tainted by the vampire's baptism, I began to fear that the deadly enchantment of this place might take hold of her. ""Well!"" I said to myself, ""If she is going to sleep all day, then I will not sleep all night."" As we progressed on the rugged road - because the road was very old and broken - I bowed my head and slept. I woke up again with a feeling of guilt and a sense that a lot of time had passed; I saw that Madam Mina was still sleeping and the sun had considerably lowered. But actually, everything had changed; the angry mountains seemed farther away, and we were in the high regions of a steep hill with a castle on its summit similar to the one described in Jonathan's journal. At the same time, I was both happy and scared; because now, for better or worse, the end was near.",16.986,16.476,"We traveled all day yesterday, getting closer and closer to the mountains and traversing increasingly rugged and deserted terrain. There are gigantic and threatening cliffs, many waterfalls, and nature seems to have once held its carnival here. Mrs. Mina continues to sleep constantly, and although I felt hungry and satisfied it, I could not wake her, not even to eat. I began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was taking hold of her, as she is stained with that baptism of the vampire's blood. –Well -I said to myself-, if he sleeps all day, it is also certain that I will not sleep during the night. While we were traveling along the rough road, since it was an old and deteriorated road, I fell asleep. I woke up again with a feeling of guilt and the passage of time, and discovered that Mrs. Mina was still asleep and that the sun was very low, but indeed, everything had changed. The threatening mountains seemed farther away and we were near the top of a very steep hill, and at its summit was the castle, just as Jonathan indicated in his diary. Immediately I felt uneasy and fearful, because now, for better or worse, the end was near.",23.141,22.727
1965,"I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas! unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us—for even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and all was for a time in a great twilight—I took out the horses and fed them in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid her rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and I broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the time—so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when she had grown more quiet:—","I called Mina to wake her up to try hypnotizing her once more, but it was still a failure. Darkness began to fall, covering all the desolate paths, I unhitched the horses and led them to a sheltered spot to feed them, and lit a fire so Mina could warm herself in the fur cloak. She looked as lively as a bird and more radiant and beautiful than ever. I fumbled around preparing dinner, but she refused to eat with the simple reason that she didn't feel hungry. I didn't insist because I knew it would be useless. As for me, I had to eat, because I needed the strength to prepare for any dangerous challenges. To guard against any unforeseen events, I sat up and drew a circle with Mina at its center, then I crushed the holy wafers into fine powder and sprinkled it evenly around the circle to ensure every part was well protected. During that time, Mina sat silently like a corpse, her complexion gradually turning a pale, ghostly white like the snow at night. But when I approached her, she suddenly clung tightly to me. I felt her body trembling violently. Finally, waiting until she returned to normal, I dared to ask:",4.776,3.717,"I woke Madam Mina and tried to hypnotize her again, but alas! I couldn't succeed until it was too late. Then, before the great darkness fell upon us - because even after sunset, the sky continued to reflect the setting sun on the snow, and everywhere was enveloped in a great twilight for a while - I untied the horses and fed them in a shelter I could find. Then I lit a fire, and made Madam Mina, who was now awake and looking more attractive than ever, sit comfortably among her blankets. I prepared the meal, but she didn't eat, merely saying she wasn't hungry. Knowing it would be of no use, I didn't force her. But I ate, because now I must be strong for everyone. Then, fearing what might happen, I drew a wide circle around the place where Madam Mina was sitting for her comfort; I sprinkled some blessed bread over the circle and crumbled it well so that everywhere would be well protected. Madam Mina sat all this time - motionless like the dead; her color turned white, white until she looked paler than the snow, and not a single word came out of her mouth. But when I approached her, she clung to me, and I knew the poor thing was trembling from head to toe with great, painful terror. When she became even quieter, I immediately said:",20.729,20.294,"I woke Mrs. Mina and tried to hypnotize her again, but to no avail. Then, deep darkness descended upon us, because even after sunset, the skies reflected the hidden sun over the snow and everything was plunged, for some time, into a gigantic twilight. I unhitched the horses and fed them at the inn I managed to find. Then, I lit a fire and, near it, I made Mrs. Mina, who was now more awake and charming than ever, sit comfortably among her furs. I prepared dinner, but she did not want to eat. She simply said she was not hungry. I did not press her, knowing she did not wish to, but I had dinner, because I needed to stay strong for everyone. Then, still gripped by fear of what might happen, I drew a large circle around Mrs. Mina and placed part of the sacred Host on it, finely crumbling it, so that everything would be protected. She remained sitting quietly the whole time; as calm as if she were dead, and she began to grow paler and paler, until she was almost the same color as the snow; she did not utter a word, but when I approached her, she clung to me, and I noticed that the poor thing was trembling from head to toe, with a shiver that was painful to see. Then, when she calmed down a bit, I said to her:",17.588,17.162
1966,"“Will you not come over to the fire?” for I wished to make a test of what she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she stopped, and stood as one stricken.","— Don't you want to move a little closer to the fire? Actually, I intended to see if you could do it. She obediently stood up, but after taking just one step, she suddenly halted as if her feet were chained.",11.202,8.268,"“Aren't you going to come near the fire?” Because I wanted to see what he could do.

1967,"“Why not go on?” I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat down in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked from sleep, she said simply:—","— Why don't you keep walking? - I pressed. She shook her head and went back to sit in the exact spot she had been sitting, her eyes wide open looking at me just like the eyes of someone who has been abruptly woken from a deep sleep.",13.68,11.417,"“Why don't you continue?” I asked. He shook his head from side to side and quietly returned to his seat. Then, like someone who had just woken up, he opened his eyes and looked at me, saying:",15.276,12.845,"–Why don't you continue? – I asked him. She shook her head and, stepping back, sat down in her place again. Then, looking at me with wide-open eyes, like those of a person who has just woken up from a dream, he said to me simply:",33.065,31.752
1968,"“I cannot!” and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!","— I can't! - She replied curtly and then fell silent. But I felt happy, because I understood her impossibility, whatever I doubted was no longer its true nature. But the sudden, prolonged neighing of the horses made me think otherwise.",4.869,2.474,"“I can't!” And he fell silent. I was relieved because I knew the things he couldn't do, and he couldn't do the things we were afraid he would. Even if his body was in danger, his soul was still safe!",9.993,7.466,"–I can't! – and he fell silent. I was glad knowing that if she couldn't pass, none of the vampires, whom we feared, could do it either. Although there might be dangers to her body, at least her soul was safe!",22.178,19.985
1969,"Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a time. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to fear—horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan’s horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it was:—","I jumped before I could think to approach and soothe them. Feeling someone approaching, they immediately licked my hand gently but did not forget to let out another series of neighs before falling silent again. But only for a moment, then they started neighing incessantly once more. I had to soothe them many times during the night, before that cold moment when the heartbeat of the earth and sky fell to its weakest point. At that coldest moment, the fire began to die down, forcing me to stoke it once more, as the snow started to fall heavily amidst the freezing fog. Even though it was dark, I could still faintly see my surroundings. But the snowstorm and fog seemed to be forming the shapes of women, faintly visible in their flowing white dresses sweeping the ground. Everything exuded an aura of death, sorrow, and an eerie silence. The horses let out long, mournful neighs as if anticipating the worst to come. I shivered with a vague sense of fear until I suddenly remembered the safety circle I had just drawn. I began to think that all the apparitions were due to the darkness, my own cowardice, and my lingering fatigue. Could it be that the memories of all the terrible things Jonathan had experienced had turned me into a madman? Yes, the swirling, chaotic snow and fog made me realize the shadows of those women in white, flickering and hovering as if about to pounce on me. The horses huddled together and occasionally let out faint whimpers of fear, much like human gestures. I suddenly felt worried for Mina, as the strange faces began to flicker closer to us, but she still sat calmly and smiled at me as if nothing was happening. When I stood up to stoke the fire again, she suddenly pulled me back:",7.326,6.784,"At that moment, the horses began to neigh and tug at their reins; until I went to them and calmed them down. When they felt my hands on them, they whinnied softly as if they were happy, licked my hands, and stood still for a while. Throughout the night, until that cold hour when all of nature slowed down, I went to them many times, and each time my presence calmed them. At that cold hour, the fire began to die, and I was about to step out of the circle to revive it; because the snow was sweeping everything with an icy mist. Even in the darkness, there was light on the snow; it was as if the snowstorm and mist rings were turning into women wearing dresses with fluttering skirts. Everything was in deathly silence; only the horses were whimpering and cowering as if fearing the worst. I began to be afraid - terrifying fears; but then I felt the safety within the circle I stood in. I started to think that the night, the gloom, the unease I felt, and all those dreadful anxieties were causing me to dream. It was as if my memories of Jonathan's terrible experience were deceiving me, because the snowflakes and mist began to form circles, until the shadowy figures of those women who might have kissed Jonathan appeared. And then the horses cowered even more in fear, whimpering with terror like people in agony. They were not even in a state to escape from there in the madness of fear. When these strange shapes came closer and began to circle around, I feared for dear Madam Mina. I looked at her, but she was sitting calmly and smiling at me; I was about to take a step to stoke the fire when she caught me and pulled me back, whispering softly like one hears in dreams:",20.861,20.589,"At that moment, the horses began to get restless and pull at their reins, until I approached them and calmed them down. When they felt my hands on them, they neighed softly, as if in joy, rubbed their muzzles against my hands, and remained calm for a moment. Many times, throughout the night, I got up and approached them until the cold moment came when all of nature is at its lowest point of vitality, and, every time, my presence calmed them. As the coldest hour approached, the fire began to die out, and I got up to add more wood, because the snow was falling more heavily, and with it, a light and very cold mist was approaching. Even in the darkness, there is a certain kind of glow, as always happens over the snow, and it seemed that the snowflakes and the wisps of mist took the form of women, dressed in clothes that trailed on the ground. Everything seemed dead, and a deep silence reigned, interrupted only by the agitation of the horses, who seemed to fear the worst would happen. I began to feel a tremendous fear, but then a feeling of security came over me, due to the circle within which I found myself. I also began to think that it was all due to my imagination in the middle of the night, because of the glow, the restlessness, the fatigue, and the terrible anxiety. It was as if my memories of Jonathan's terrible experiences were deceiving me, because the snowflakes and the mist began to swirl around me until I could make out a blurry image of those women who had kissed him. Then, the horses crouched down more and more and lamented in terror, as men do in the midst of pain. Even the madness of fear was denied to them, so that they could move away. I felt fear for my dear lady Mina, when those strange figures approached and surrounded me. I looked at her, but she remained seated calmly, smiling at me; when I approached the fire to add more wood, she took one of my hands and held me back; then, she whispered, in a voice one hears in dreams, extremely low:",22.031,21.777
1970,"“No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!” I turned to her, and looking in her eyes, said:—","— Don't, don't, don't step out of the circle. You can only be safe if you stay in here! - She said, her voice sounding weak and vague as if echoing from a distant realm. I turned back and looked straight into her eyes:",5.319,2.901,"“No! No! Don't go out! You are safe here!” I turned to him and said, looking into his eyes:",30.543,27.467,"–No! No! Don't go out. You're safe here!

1971,"“But you? It is for you that I fear!” whereat she laughed—a laugh, low and unreal, and said:—","— And you? You are the one who scares me! Hearing that, she burst into laughter, a gentle smile but as surreal as her voice.",7.233,3.713,"""Well, what about you? I'm afraid for you!"" When he heard this, he laughed, it was a low and surreal laugh, and he said:",9.759,5.718,"–But, what about you? It is for you that I fear! Upon hearing that, he burst out laughing... with a hoarse, unreal laugh, and said:",36.184,34.44
1972,"“Fear for me! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them than I am,” and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead. Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till—if God have not take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes—there were before me in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when they would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:—","— Afraid because of me? Why? No one in this world can protect those being hunted more safely than I can, sir. I was about to ask what she meant when a sudden strong gust of wind blew, rekindling the nearly extinguished flame. It was only at this moment that I noticed the fresh red scar on her forehead. Oh my God! It was now clear to me. I suddenly understood everything, as the swirling faces of the snowstorm approached very close but seemed to halt before my Sacred Circle. Then they took shape right before my eyes, unless God had taken my sanity - in flesh and blood; they were the three women that Jonathan had encountered in the castle when they approached to caress and kiss his neck that day. I recognized the round, alluring bodies, the wickedly flirtatious eyes, the white teeth and the rosy, plump skin, then the bright red lips full of lustful desire. They giggled foolishly at Mina, their laughter piercing the silence of the dark night. They clung tightly to each other, pointing directly at her and speaking a long string of words, their voices clear and gentle like crystal, just as Jonathan had described in his diary.",11.054,10.481,"“Are you afraid for me? Why are you afraid for me? There is no one in the whole world who is safer than I am against them.” While I was wondering about the meaning of his words, a sudden gust of wind flared the fire and I saw the red scar on his forehead. That was when, ah! I understood! If I hadn’t understood then, I would soon learn, because the shapes of swirling mist and snow approached but always kept away from the sacred circle. Then they began to materialize, until -if God hasn’t taken my mind- I saw with my own eyes the same three women Jonathan had seen in the room, trying to kiss his throat, standing before me in flesh and blood. I recognized their swaying round forms, their gleaming hard eyes, their white teeth, their red cheeks, and their lustful lips. They laughed at poor dear Madam Mina, and as their laughter pierced the silence of the night, they entwined their arms and pointed at her, speaking in those sweet ringing voices that Jonathan compared to the unbearable sweetness of clinking water glasses:",22.558,22.034,"–Do you fear for me? Why do you fear for me? No one in the whole world is better protected against them than I am. And while I wondered about the meaning of his words, a gust of wind made the flame rise, and I saw the red scar on his forehead. Then I understood. And if I hadn't understood then, I would have soon, thanks to the figures of mist and snow that swirled and approached, but kept away from the sacred circle. Then, they began to materialize, until, if God hadn't taken my sanity, because I saw it with my own eyes, the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when they kissed his throat, were before me, in flesh and blood. I knew the spinning images, the bright and hard eyes, the white teeth, the rosy color, and the voluptuous lips. They continuously smiled at poor Mrs. Mina, and as their laughter echoed in the silence of the night, they waved their arms and pointed at her, speaking with the resonant and sweet voices that Jonathan had said were unbearably sweet, like crystalline.",31.293,30.913
1973,"“Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!” In fear I turned to my poor Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and laughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for I knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not approach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on them softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor beasts no more of terror.","— Come here with us, little brother, come here, come here! I turned back to look at Mina, feeling weak, but inside I felt as if I was seeing a glimmer of hope. Because her fearful and disgusted eyes, and her terror, told me that I could still be full of hope. Simply put, she had not yet become an accomplice of those women. I grabbed some firewood near me and held out a holy wafer, then slowly approached them. They immediately backed away, but did not forget to let out those chilling, shrill laughs. I continued to build the fire, no longer afraid, because I understood that we would be unharmed as long as we stayed within our invisible fortress. And with a weapon like the one I had, those women could not come near me or Mina. Moreover, as long as she remained within the Sacred Circle, she could not step out, just as they could not step in. The horses stopped neighing and stomping wildly; they lay down on the ground, letting the falling snow cover them, making them look like small snow-covered hills. I understood that they were no longer afraid of those ghostly figures.",6.828,5.544,"""Come, my brother. Come to us. Come! Come!"" I turned to my dear Madam Mina in fear, and my heart leapt as if it had burst into flames of joy; for oh! The fear, disgust, and horror in her sweet eyes told a story to my heart filled entirely with hope. Thank God she had not yet become one of them. I took a few of the logs beside me and, extending some of the blessed bread forward, I advanced towards them from across the fire. They retreated before me and laughed with their low, terrifying laughter. I fed the fire and was not afraid of them, for I knew we were safe among our precautions. As long as I was armed in this way, they could not approach me or Madam Mina, who was within the circle they could not enter or leave. The horses stopped groaning and lay still on the ground; snow was gently falling on them, and the horses turned completely white. I knew there was nothing more for the poor animals to fear.",27.888,27.436,"–Come, sister! Come with us! Come! Come! – they said to her. Filled with fear, I turned to my poor lady Mina and my heart rose like a flame, full of joy, because, oh!, the terror reflected in her sweet eyes and the repulsion and horror made my heart understand that there was still hope, thanks be to God that she was not yet one of them! I grabbed one of the logs from the campfire, which was near me, and, holding part of the Host, I advanced towards them. They moved away from me and laughed out loud, in a hoarse and horrible manner. I fed the fire and was not afraid of them, because I knew we were safe within our protective circle. They could not approach me, as long as I was armed in that way, nor could they approach lady Mina, as long as she remained within the circle, which she could not leave, and into which the others could not enter. The horses had stopped moaning and lay motionless on the ground. The snow fell gently on them, until they turned white. I knew that, for the poor animals, there was no greater terror.",22.189,21.711

I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again. At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away towards the castle, and were lost.","We just sat still in one place until we noticed the bright pink halos of the sun piercing through the melancholy color of the white snow. All last night, I lived in a state of heavy worry, sorrow, and fear. But life truly returned to me when the sun's rays burst forth on the horizon. As soon as the sun rose, the lurking spirits immediately vanished with the swirling snowstorms and fog.

When I left Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle. The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that being entered I might not get out. Jonathan’s bitter experience served me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves. Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight. The dilemma had me between his horns.","• November 5, afternoon At least I am still intact and must thank God, even though the reality unfolding before my eyes is truly terrifying.

I have just set foot in the castle. All doors are open, but I must carefully lift each one off its rusted hinges for fear that some mishap or plot might suddenly slam them shut, blocking my way out. I learned that through the harsh reality of Jonathan. His bitter diary pages helped me find the path leading to the old church, where I know my mission awaits. The suffocating air made me dizzy, as if I had just entered a cloud of sulfur smoke. I'm not sure if my ears are ringing or if the howling of the wolves is echoing from a distant place?

It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound of a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.","Yes, I was mesmerized by the women lying in a tomb stained by the dust of time over many centuries, despite the foul odor emanating from everywhere in the count's lair.

She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as there had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the night, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent. There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and nobly proportioned. On it was but one word","I steeled myself to complete my first search mission. While moving some stones aside, I discovered a second woman, also with dark hair like the first one. I did not dare to hesitate and gaze, fearing the same disheartening feeling of hesitation as before. The search continued until I found, under a large, tall tomb seemingly reserved for someone dearly beloved by the count - the blonde woman whom I, after Jonathan, had once seen in the mist. She looked beautiful, alluring, and seductive to the point that the deep instincts of a man stirred within me a desire to protect someone of the opposite sex and an indescribable emotion. But thank God, Mina's cry of pain still echoed in my ears, and before being completely bewitched by the woman's beauty, I managed to regain my senses to carry out my dreadful task. I felt as if I had searched all the tombs in the ancient church and there might not be any more such places.

She had such a pure appearance, such dazzling beauty, such graceful sensuality that the masculine instinct within me, which calls my kind to love and protect one of her kind, caused my head to spin with a new feeling. But thank God, the cry of my dear Madam Mina's soul had not yet faded from my ears, and before the spell could further take hold of me, I gathered my courage for my savage duty. By this time, I had searched all the tombs I could find in the chapel; since there were only two Undead specters around us at night, I concluded that there were no other active Undead at the moment. There was a single tomb more magnificent than all the other tombs; it was giant and had noble proportions. On it was inscribed a single word:",19.175,18.722,"Then, I dedicated myself to my horrible task and discovered, by lifting the slabs of the graves, another of the sisters, the other brunette.

She was so pleasant to behold, of such radiant beauty and so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which demanded part of my sex to love and protect one of them, made my head spin with a new emotion. But, thank God, that prolonged lament of my dear lady Mina had not yet ceased in my ears and, before the spell could affect me again, I had already decided to carry out my terrible work. I had searched all the tombs in the chapel, I believe, and since there had only been near us, during the night, three of those ghosts of the undead, I assumed there were no more active undead than them.

If there were only one corpse to deal with, it wouldn't be too difficult. But there are three corpses! This means I will have to repeat the process two more times!

1990,"Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of fear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been won, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and left my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud “I am here!”","— So there you have it, my friend John! Is that the work of a butcher? If it weren't for the resolute thought of a true death, and a life placed in such a terrible vice, I might never have dared to go all the way. I am still trembling, but until the entire job is finished, may God help me return to myself! I returned to the first woman and suddenly had the feeling of witnessing a fleeting satisfaction on her face just before she was freed, as if to acknowledge that her soul had been completely conquered: without such a feeling, I certainly wouldn't dare to do the work of a butcher. I couldn't bear the hair-raising sound of driving the stake into the girl's body. I was so terrified that I abandoned the job. But in the end, everything was finished! Now I can mourn for those wretched souls, those who could rest peacefully in the contentment of a true death, even if that moment of peace only briefly passed before my eyes before turning to dust and returning to the past, as if the deaths that had been restrained for centuries finally asserted their rightful claim and proclaimed: ""Here I am.""",4.926,3.825,"Ah, my friend John! This is butchery! If I hadn't gathered my courage by thinking of other dead and those living with such a shroud of fear over them, I wouldn't have been able to continue my work. Even after it all ended, I keep trembling, thank God my nerves endured it. If I hadn't seen the peace indicating the soul was reclaimed, the satisfaction spreading across the face before the final dissolution, I couldn't have continued my butchery. I couldn't bear that horrifying scream heard as the stake was driven in, the lunges of the writhing form, and the blood-filled frothy lips. I would flee in terror and leave my work unfinished. But it's all over! And thinking that in that brief moment before their annihilation, each of them appeared docile in their true death sleep, I can pity them and shed tears for them. Because, my friend John, it was as if the death that should have come centuries ago finally appeared and suddenly declared loudly, ""I am He!"" before each of their heads was freshly severed, and their entire body crumbled and merged back into the soil from which it came.",14.473,13.943,"Oh, friend John, it was a butcher's job! If the thought of other dead and the living upon whom a similar mistake weighed had not given me courage, I would not have been able to do it. I still tremble, even though the work has long been finished. Thank God, my nerves did not betray me. If I had not seen the peace first and the joy that spread over the face of the corpse a moment before the dissolution began, as a demonstration that a soul had been freed, I would not have been able to conclude my butchery. I would not have been able to endure the terrible noise of the stake penetrating, the lips covered with bloody foam, nor the writhing of the body. I should have left my work unfinished, fleeing from there in terror, but, it is now concluded! And as for the poor souls, I can now feel pity for them and shed tears, since I saw the peace that spread over their faces before disappearing. Since, friend John, I had barely cut off their heads with my knife when the bodies began to disintegrate into natural dust, as if the death that should have occurred several centuries before had finally firmly established itself, proclaiming: ""Here I am!""",14.269,13.66

1996,"6 November.—It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the clear line of Dracula’s castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur, perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we could trace it through the drifted snow.","• November 6 The evening gradually faded as Van Helsing and I walked eastward, where I knew Jonathan was heading towards us. We couldn't walk fast, even though we were going downhill, because we had to carry rather bulky fur coats to guard against the cold and snow in case we had to rest along the way. We also had to carry some of the reserve supplies. Indeed, we were in a state of isolation and, as far as our strength could penetrate the snow curtain, we would likely struggle to find a shelter. Not even a mile in, I was forced to sit down on the ground to rest because my legs were utterly exhausted. Behind us, Dracula's castle was etching stark white lines against the horizon. We had descended a long way, yet the hill bearing the castle still loomed, almost entirely obscuring the desolate, cold Carpathian range. Only at this point did we notice again the mournful howls of the wolves echoing from afar. They were still very far away, but those savage howls, though somewhat muffled by the falling snow, still echoed as if to threaten the lone travelers on the long road. Watching Professor Van Helsing as he walked and glanced around, I understood he was trying to find some shelter that could help us be less exposed to an attack. We could still make out the rugged road stretching out of sight, even though snow had already fallen heavily below.",8.623,7.88,"November 6. - It was almost evening when the Professor and I started heading east, knowing that Jonathan had arrived. Despite the steep downhill slope of the road, we weren't going fast because we had to take heavy blankets and shawls with us; we couldn't dare face the possibility of not having something to keep us warm in the cold and snow. We also had to take some of our supplies with us, because we were in a completely desolate place and, as far as we could see through the falling snow, there was no sign of any settlement in sight. After advancing about two kilometers, I got tired from the heavy walk and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw the place where the distinct outlines of Dracula's castle cut the sky, because we were so far down the hill it stood on that the perspective of the Carpathian Mountains was well below the castle. We saw it in all its glory, perched atop a three-hundred-meter-deep precipice; it seemed as if there was a great void between it and the summit of any adjacent mountain. There was something wild and sinister about this place. We could hear the howling of wolves in the distance. They were very far away, but even muffled by the deafening snow, their voices were filled with terror. I knew from Dr. Van Helsing's exploration of the surroundings that he was trying to find a strategic point where we would be less exposed in case of an attack. The rough road still stretched downward; we could trace it partly from the accumulated snow.",33.998,33.749,"November 6. It was already quite late in the afternoon when the professor and I set off towards the east, where I knew Jonathan was approaching from. We did not advance quickly, due to the steep terrain and the heavy furs and coats we had to carry with us, as we did not want to risk being without warm clothing in the midst of the cold and snow. Moreover, we had to bring some of our provisions, as we were in an utterly desolate area and, as far as our eyes could see over the snow, there was no inhabited place in sight. After we had covered approximately a kilometer and a half, I felt tired from the heavy walk and sat down for a moment to rest. Then, we looked back and saw the place where Dracula's proud castle stood out against the sky, as we were in such a low place compared to the hill on which it stood, that the Carpathians were far behind it. We saw it in all its grandeur, almost hanging over a huge precipice, and it seemed that there was a great separation between the summit and the other mountains that surrounded it on all sides. We could hear the distant howl of the wolves. They were very far away, but the sound, although muffled by the snow, was horrifying. I understood from the way Professor Van Helsing was looking around us that he was searching for a strategic point where we would be less exposed in case of an attack. The main road continued downward and we could see it despite the snow that covered it.",26.408,26.096
1997,"In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock, with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the hand and drew me in: “See!” he said, “here you will be in shelter; and if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.” He brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:—","After a while, the professor signaled for me to stand up and walk over to him. He had just found a rather ideal spot, a cave with an entrance resembling a vestibule situated between the two ends of the cave. He reached out and pulled me in. — Try to look, maybe you will be safe here. - He said. - If the wolves come, I can take them down one by one for you to see. Then he turned around, took some fur coats, and made a fairly neat bed for me, just enough for me to lie down, and forced me to eat some compressed rations. But I couldn't eat. I really didn't care about anything other than sitting and breathing for a while to catch my breath, even though I really wanted to please him. He seemed sad but didn't have the heart to blame me with a single word. I saw him quietly step out onto a rock, take out his binoculars, and look towards the horizon. Suddenly, he shouted out to me:",11.781,10.767,"Soon after, the Professor signaled to me, and I stood up and went to him.

But I couldn't eat; even attempting it was repulsive to me, and although I wanted to please him, I couldn't bring myself to try. He looked very sad, but he did not scold me.

He brought all our furs inside and prepared a comfortable bed for me; then, he took out some provisions and forced me to consume them. But I couldn't eat, and even trying to do so was repulsive to me; although I would have liked very much to please him, I couldn't do it. He seemed very saddened. However, he did not reproach me.

1998,"“Look! Madam Mina, look! look!” I sprang up and stood beside him on the rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far off—in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before—came a group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog’s tail wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the snow as they were, I could see from the men’s clothes that they were peasants or gypsies of some kind.","— Look, Mrs. Mina? Come here and see this? I stood up abruptly, hurriedly walked closer to him, and took the binoculars he had just handed over. Snowflakes began to fall thickly and swirl chaotically due to the gusts of cold wind blowing in. However, occasionally the gales would stop blowing, giving me a fairly clear view. From the rock ledge where I was standing, I saw the horizon wide open before my eyes. I could make out in the distance, beyond the thick snowy plain, a river winding like a soft ribbon. Not far ahead of us - in fact, so close that we were surprised we hadn't noticed sooner - was a group of people riding horses uphill. Among the group was a long wagon, occasionally lurching forward like a dog being prodded each time it strayed off the path. This group stood out clearly against the white snow, so much so that I immediately recognized them as farmers, or Bohemians, thanks to the style of clothing they wore.",5.54,4.427,"""Look! Madam Mina! Look! Look!"" I jumped up from my place and stood beside him on the rock; he handed me his binoculars and pointed. The snow was now falling even more heavily, and the fierce snowflakes were swirling as if caught in a vortex, because a strong wind had started to blow. But there were occasional gaps in the heavy snowfall, and I could see a long distance. From our height, it was possible to see a great range; in the distance, beyond the empty snowy fields, I could see the river winding like a black ribbon. Right in front of us and not very far away - in fact, so close that I wondered why we hadn't noticed them before - a group of horsemen was advancing rapidly. In the middle of them was a carriage, a long wagon that swayed from side to side with every bump in the road, like a dog's wagging tail. Since they stood out clearly against the snow, I could tell from the men's clothing that they were either peasants or Gypsies.",33.949,33.576,"–Look, Mrs. Mina! Look! Look! I jumped to my feet and climbed onto the rock, stopping beside him; he handed me the binoculars and pointed with his finger. The snow was falling more heavily and swirling around us furiously, as a strong wind had picked up. However, there were times when the blizzard would calm down a bit, and I could see a vast expanse of land. From the height where we were, it was possible to see a great distance, and in the distance, beyond the white layer of snow, the river winding like a black ribbon, right in front of us and not very far away... in fact, so close that I was surprised we hadn't seen them before, a group of men on horseback was advancing as quickly as they could. In the middle of them, they were carrying a cart, a long vehicle that swayed from side to side like a dog's tail when it passed over some uneven ground.

1999,"On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation, however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:—","On the vehicle, there was a large rectangular coffin. My heart felt like it was about to leap out of my chest, as the scene before me made me think of the ending of a ghost story that was closely tied to my own life. In no time, another day would pass, and I fully understood that right after sunset, the thing lying in that coffin would be free to move around in some suitable guise to evade all pursuits. Fearful inside, I turned to look at the professor, but I didn't know where he had disappeared to, which scared me out of my wits. A moment later, I saw him return at my feet, scattering pieces of holy bread in a protective circle around the rock, similar to the circle that had protected us the night before. After finishing the work, he climbed up to sit near me and said:",7.553,6.471,"There was a large square chest in the car. My heart skipped a beat when I saw it, because I felt that the end had come. Evening was falling, and by that time, that Thing which had been imprisoned here would regain its freedom and escape all pursuits. I turned to the Professor in fear; I was very surprised not to see the Professor there. A second later, I saw him down below. He drew a circle around the rock, similar to the one we had taken refuge in last night. When he completed the drawing, he came back to me and said:",21.025,20.202,"On the cart, there was a large square box, and I felt my heart begin to beat strongly because I sensed that the end was near. The night was already approaching, and I knew perfectly well that, at sunset, the thing that was locked in that box could come out and, taking one of the forms that were in its power, evade the pursuit. Terrified, I turned to the professor and saw, dismayed, that he was no longer by my side. A moment later, I saw him below me. Around the rock, he had drawn a circle, similar to the one that had served the previous night to protect us. When he finished, he stood by my side again, saying:",21.602,20.884

He picked up the binoculars again and looked towards the horizon in front of him: — Look at that, they're in such a hurry, they're urging the horses to run at full speed. He remained silent for a moment, then continued in a contemplative tone:",4.467,2.503,"""At least here you will be safe from him!” He took the binoculars from me and, once the snow had stopped again, he scanned the area beneath us thoroughly.

He took the glasses from my hands, and in the next moment of calm, he scanned the entire terrain that stretched out at our feet with his gaze. –Look -he said-: they are approaching quickly, spurring the horses and advancing as fast as the road allows -he paused and, a moment later, continued, with a hollow voice-:",12.033,10.033
2001,"“They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God’s will be done!” Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:—","— They are racing against the sun... Perhaps we have arrived too late! May God's will come true? Another violent storm suddenly swept in, erasing everything, but this event lasted only for a very short time. When the sky calmed down again, the binoculars in the professor's hands were pointed down at the plain. He suddenly exclaimed:",5.972,4.039,"""They are running for the sunset."" ""We might be too late."" ""God’s will shall be done!” A blinding snowstorm came from below again and the entire landscape disappeared under the snow.

2002,"“Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow blots it all out!” I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan. At the same time I knew that Jonathan was not far off; looking around I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at break-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took, of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy, and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter. “They are all converging,” he said. “When the time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.” I got out my revolver ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again. It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us, and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbers—the wolves were gathering for their prey.","— Look! Look down there! There are two horsemen rushing from the south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the binoculars and look, quickly, or the storm will rise again. I held the binoculars. Indeed, those two men must be Dr. Seward and Mr. Quincey Morris. I believe so, as neither of them bore the familiar appearance of Jonathan. But I also knew Jonathan was not far from us. I noticed that a little to the north of where the two riders were, there were two other men also hastily spurring their horses to a gallop. I immediately recognized Jonathan, and of course, the other was Lord Godalming. They were also chasing after the carriage and the escorting party. Hearing my account, Van Helsing cheerfully shouted ""hooray"" like a schoolboy, and after carefully observing ahead until a snowstorm obscured his view, he held the Winchester rifle ready for battle. — They are all converging towards the same point. - He said. - The time will come when we surround those Bohemians. I also groped for the gun, because while we were talking, the howling of the wolves had become closer and much more terrifying. Another moment of calm wind helped us see more clearly. Before our eyes was a magical and mysterious scene, with heavy snowflakes falling very close to us while the sun was casting its last rays of the day and gradually setting behind the distant mountain peaks. Holding the binoculars and scanning back and forth towards the horizon, I noticed here and there groups of two or three black dots, or more, moving on the white snow carpet: those were the hungry wolves rushing to compete for the unfamiliar prey.",17.327,16.969,"""Look! Look! Look! Look, two horsemen are rapidly coming from the south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the binoculars. Look before the snow hides everything!” I took the binoculars and looked. The two men coming could be Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris. In any case, I knew that neither of them was Jonathan. At the same time, I knew Jonathan wasn't far away; when I looked around, I saw two other men coming at lightning speed to the north of the approaching group. I knew one of them was Jonathan and concluded that the other was, of course, Lord Godalming. They were also chasing the group with the carriage. When I told this to the Professor, he shouted with joy like a schoolboy and, after watching carefully until the snow reduced visibility to zero, he propped his Winchester rifle against the rock at the entrance of our shelter and got it ready. “They are getting closer to each other,” he said. “When the time comes, we will see Gypsies everywhere.” I took my pistol in hand to use, because as we talked, the howling of the wolves grew stronger and closer. When the snowstorm subsided for a moment, we looked again. It was strange to see the snow falling around us in such large flakes and the sun shining even brighter as it set over the peaks of the distant mountains. When I scanned the surroundings with the binoculars, I saw dots moving here and there, in pairs, in threes, and in large groups - the wolves were gathering for their prey.",35.797,35.555,"–Look! Look! Look! See: two riders are following them quickly, coming from the south. They must be Quincey and John. Take the binoculars. Look before the snow prevents us from seeing again!

At the same time, I knew that Jonathan was not far away; looking around me, I saw to the north of the group that two other men were approaching, galloping at full speed on their mounts. I realized that one of them was Jonathan and, of course, I assumed that the other must be Lord Godalming. They were also chasing the cart group. When I told the professor, he jumped for joy like a schoolboy and, after looking intently until another snowstorm made all vision impossible, he prepared his Winchester, placing it on one of the rocks, ready to shoot. –They are all converging -he said-. When the time comes, we will have gypsies everywhere. I drew my revolver and kept it ready to fire, as, while we were talking, the howling of the wolves sounded much closer. When the snowstorm calmed down a bit, we looked again. It was strange to see the snow falling so heavily in the place where we were, and a little further on, to see the sun shining, with increasing intensity, approaching ever closer to the line of mountains. Looking around us, I could see spots moving over the snow, alone, in pairs or trios, and in large numbers... The wolves were gathering to attack their prey.",29.516,29.255
2003,"Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm’s length before us; but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts, the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the mountain tops.","Each minute of waiting for us felt like a century. The cold wind howled, blowing into fierce, raging gusts, angrily driving the snowflakes into a flurry and piling them into successive crescent-shaped ice ridges. Occasionally, we couldn't even recognize our own outstretched arms; but whenever the wind calmed, we had the chance to gaze far into the distance. For a long time, we had developed the habit of attentively observing the moments of sunrise and sunset. And this time was no different, the sun would disappear behind the mountain range in just a moment. Without a clock, we couldn't believe we had been waiting for the other three groups for nearly an hour. The north wind continued to blow more fiercely and intensely. But it seemed that after the short gusts, the snow stopped falling, and if it did, it was blown far away from us. Now, we could clearly identify each member of every group, the hunters and the hunted. It seems that the Bohemian group did not realize someone was urgently following them, or at least they did not care about it. However, they still hurried forward as the sun was gradually sinking behind the mountains.",6.201,4.995,"Every second we waited felt like a year. The wind was increasing in intensity, and the snowflakes swirling around us, creating small vortices, were being driven with great fury. At times, we couldn't even see the tip of our noses, but at other times, as the wind passed by with its echoing sound, it seemed to clear the airspace around us so we could see into the distance. We had become so accustomed to waiting for sunrise and sunset lately that we could predict exactly when it would happen, and we knew that the sun would set very soon. It was hard to believe that our watches showed we had been waiting in that rocky shelter for less than half an hour until the newcomers began to approach us closely. The wind was now blowing more violently and harshly, mostly coming from the north. Apparently, the wind had driven the snow clouds away from us, because now there were only occasional bursts of snow. We could easily distinguish the members of both groups, those being chased and those doing the chasing. The strange thing was that the ones being chased seemed unaware of their pursuers or at least didn't care, but as the sun descended over the mountain peaks, they seemed to double their speed.",21.311,20.808,"Each passing moment felt like an eternity as we waited. The wind suddenly grew stronger, and the snow fell furiously, swirling around us without rest. Sometimes we couldn't see even as far as our outstretched arms; but at other times, the air cleared, and our gaze encompassed the entire landscape. In recent times, we had become so accustomed to waiting for the sunrise and sunset that we knew exactly when it would happen. It wasn't long until dusk. It was hard to believe that, according to our watches, we had been on that rock for less than an hour, waiting, while the three groups of riders converged on us. The wind kept getting stronger and blew more steadily from the north. It seemed that the snow-laden clouds had moved away from us, as it had stopped, except for occasional flakes. It was quite strange that the pursued did not realize they were being pursued, or that they did not care at all. However, they seemed to hurry more and more as the sun descended over the mountain peaks.",17.405,16.93
2004,"Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined that they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our presence.","As the group approached, Professor Van Helsing and I retreated to hide behind a rock, weapons ready in hand. Clearly, he did not want to let them pass by unnoticed. It seemed that none of them suspected our presence.",8.783,6.037,They were getting closer and closer. The Professor and I crouched behind our rock and took our weapons in hand; I could see that the Professor was determined not to let them pass through here. They were all unaware of our presence.,36.045,34.309,They were getting closer… The professor and I crouched behind a rock and kept our weapons ready to fire. I realized that he was firmly determined not to let them pass. None of them had noticed our presence.,20.279,17.583
2005,"All at once two voices shouted out to: “Halt!” One was my Jonathan’s, raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris’ strong resolute tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the other. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his companions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them. Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.","Suddenly, two voices shouted together: ""Stop!"" I recognized Jonathan's voice, hoarse from an indescribable emotion. The other voice, more resolute and calm, belonged to Quincey Morris. Although they did not understand what the two were saying, the Bohemian crowd could not mistake the emotions contained in their voices, even if it was in a foreign language. They instinctively reined in their horses. At that moment, Lord Godalming and Jonathan rode up close on one side, while Dr. Seward and Morris flanked the other side. The leader of the gypsy group, a stunningly handsome young man riding a centaur-like horse, glared and signaled my friends to retreat, angrily ordering his followers to move forward. They pulled the reins, urging their horses to lunge forward. The four men immediately placed their hands on their gun triggers - an action that could not be misinterpreted - ordering the gypsies to stop. At the same time, Van Helsing and I stepped out from behind the rock, weapons in hand. Seeing themselves surrounded, the group of Gypsies pulled the reins to stop their horses. The leader said something I didn't understand, I only knew that the followers simultaneously grabbed their weapons, which were all knives and pistols, to prepare for battle. It seemed like the outcome would be decided within a few minutes.",11.949,11.404,"At the same time, two voices shouted, ""Stop!"" One of the voices was Jonathan's, high-pitched with anger; the other was Mr. Morris's, strong, determined, and calm in command. The Gypsies might not have known the language, but it was impossible to misunderstand the tone, no matter what language the words were spoken in; instinctively, they pulled the reins, and at that moment, Lord Godalming and Jonathan attacked from one side, while Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris attacked from the other. The chief, a magnificent-looking man sitting on his horse like a Centaur, signaled them to go with his hand and angrily commanded his companions to advance. They whipped their horses, and the horses surged forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles and unmistakably ordered them to stop. At the same time, Dr. Van Helsing and I stood up from behind the rock and aimed our weapons at the Gypsies. Seeing they were surrounded, they pulled the reins and stopped. Their leader turned to them and said something, upon which each of the Gypsies drew their weapon - knife or pistol - and stood ready to attack. An argument ensued instantly.",30.407,30.046,"Suddenly, two voices shouted loudly: –Stop! One of them was that of my Jonathan, which rose in a tone of passion; the other was the resolute and commanding voice of Mr. Morris. It was possible that the gypsies did not understand the language, but the tone in which that word was spoken left no room for doubt, regardless of the language in which it was said. Instinctively, they pulled on the reins and, suddenly, Lord Godalming and Jonathan rushed to one side while Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward went to the other. The leader of the gypsies, an impressive-looking man who rode a horse like a centaur, gestured to them, ordering them to retreat and, with an angry voice, commanded his companions to take action. They spurred their horses forward, but the four riders raised their Winchester rifles and, in an unequivocal manner, ordered them to stop. At that very moment, Dr. Van Helsing and I stood up behind the rocks and aimed our weapons at the gypsies. Seeing that they were surrounded, the men pulled on the reins and stopped. The leader turned to them, gave an order, and upon hearing it, all the gypsies reached for the weapons they had, knives or pistols, and prepared to attack. The result was not long in coming.",23.992,23.609
2006,"The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in front, and pointing first to the sun—now close down on the hill tops—and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand. For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild, surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order.","The leader pulled the reins, urging his horse to break away from the group and move to the front, pointing towards the sun that was setting very close to the mountain peaks and the castle, then said something. In response, each member of our group of four allies immediately dismounted and rushed towards the carriage. Seeing Jonathan rush into the danger zone should have made me tremble with fear, but the thrill of the battle made me and my friends forget everything. I did not show any fear, but only had a wild desire to fight. At our unexpected action, the leader shouted out orders once more. The Bohemian crowd immediately gathered around the carriage, forming a chaotic circle.",7.921,6.342,"The leader of the community spurred his horse forward with a swift movement of the reins and, pointing first to the sun, which was now approaching the hills, and then to the castle, uttered some words I did not understand. In response, four men from our team dismounted from their horses and quickly ran towards the carriage. When I saw Jonathan putting himself in such danger, I should have been horrified, but the fire of battle must have affected me like the others; I felt no fear, only a wild and great desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our team, the chieftain gave an order; his men instantly formed an undisciplined circle around the carriage, each one pushing and shoving the other to carry out the command.",31.228,30.727,"The leader, with a quick movement of his reins, launched his horse forward, heading first towards the sun, which was already very close to the mountain peaks, and then towards the castle, saying something I could not understand. In response, the four men in our group dismounted from their horses and quickly rushed towards the carriage. I should have felt terribly terrified to see Jonathan in such great danger, but the fervor of the battle had taken hold of me, just like everyone else; I was not afraid, but had a wild and pressing desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our friends, the leader of the gypsies gave an order and his men instantly formed around the carriage, in a somewhat disorganized formation, pushing and hindering each other in their eagerness to execute the order quickly.",28.888,28.357
2007,"In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their attention. Jonathan’s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr. Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had, with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest, attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and the top of the box was thrown back.","In that chaos, I saw Jonathan on one side and Quincey Morris on the other, both desperately rushing to make their way to the vehicle. They needed to reach the vehicle to complete their mission before sunset. It seemed nothing could stop the two of them at this moment. The clashing of swords and the flashing of blades, along with the savage howls of the approaching wolves, seemed to not concern them. Jonathan's unyielding bravery and determination clearly demoralized those blocking his path, causing them to start moving aside, leaving an open way for him. Just a split second was enough for him to leap onto the vehicle and throw the coffin to the ground with all his strength and fury. At the same time, Morris also bravely made his way through. In my interrupted breaths, I watched Jonathan, but Morris's desperate scream startled me: the flashing blades of the Gypsies continuously swung around him and his short sword like a flying steel net. At first, I thought there would be no problem, but when he rushed towards Jonathan - who had just jumped down from the vehicle - I suddenly realized his left hand was clutching his side, futilely trying to cover a stream of blood seeping through his fingers. Despite this, with the strength of a man in despair, he still threw himself into prying open one side of the wooden coffin lid with his knife, simultaneously with Jonathan on the other side. The efforts of the two men forced the coffin lid to gradually give way, the nails creaking as they were pulled out, and finally, the wooden lid was forcefully thrown to the ground.",8.946,8.414,"In the midst of all this, I could see Jonathan on one side of the circle of men and Quincey on the other, trying to clear a path to the carriage; it was clear they were determined to finish their work before sunset. Nothing could stop or even hinder them. Neither the guns and gleaming knives aimed by the Gypsies in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind seemed to catch their attention. Jonathan's boldness and evident determination seemed to have frightened and subdued those in front of him. In an instant, he jumped onto the carriage and, with what seemed like extraordinary strength, lifted the large chest and hurled it to the ground over the wheel. Meanwhile, Mr. Morris had to use force to get through the Gypsy circle on his side. During the time I watched Jonathan breathlessly, I saw out of the corner of my eye that Mr. Morris, in desperation, lunged forward and made a path through them, the Gypsies' knives flashing and stabbing him. He fended off the attacks with his large hunting knife, and at first, I thought he had safely overcome it, but then I saw him leap to Jonathan's side, who had jumped down from the carriage, clutching his side tightly with his left hand and blood gushing between his fingers. Still, he did not stop, for as Jonathan, in desperation, used the large kukri to pry open the lid from one end of the chest, Mr. Morris, in a frenzy, attacked the other end with his hunting knife. With the efforts of both men, the lid began to give way; the nails were pulled out with a sharp, scream-like creak, and the lid of the chest was thrown back.",26.696,26.44,"In the midst of them, I managed to see Jonathan making his way towards the cart from one side, while Mr. Morris did so from the other. It was evident that they were in a hurry to carry out their task before the sun set. Nothing seemed able to stop them or block their way: neither the weapons aimed at them, nor the knives of the gypsies standing in front of them, nor even the howls of the wolves behind them seemed to attract their attention. Jonathan's impetuosity and the apparent firmness of his intentions seemed to overwhelm the men in front of him, as they instinctively stepped back and let him pass. A moment later, he climbed onto the cart and, with an incredible strength, lifted the box and threw it to the ground, onto the wheels. Meanwhile, Mr. Morris had to use force to break through the circle of gypsies. All the while I had been anxiously watching Jonathan, I saw out of the corner of my eye Quincey advancing, desperately fighting among the gypsies' knives that gleamed in the sun and pierced his flesh. He had defended himself with his dagger and, finally, I thought he had managed to pass without being wounded, but when he leapt to Jonathan's side, who had already gotten down from the cart, I could see that he was holding his side with his left hand and blood was oozing between his fingers. However, he did not let this discourage him, as Jonathan, with a desperate energy, was attacking the wood of the box with his large kukri knife to remove the lid, and Quincey frantically attacked the other side with his dagger. Under the effort of the two men, the lid began to give way and the nails came out with a dry screech. Finally, the lid of the box fell to one side.",23.143,22.829
2008,"By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters, and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I knew too well.","Seeing the gun barrels pointing directly at them, entrusting their lives to Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, the Bohemian group all hesitated, none of them daring to resist. The sun began to set, giving way to the darkness that gradually enveloped the snow-covered world.

He looked as pale as a leaf, more accurately like a wax figure. His eyes were wide open, clearly showing a terrifying hatred.",10.51,9.46,"At this moment, seeing that they were surrounded by Winchesters and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, the Gypsies gave up and ceased to resist.

I saw the Count lying in the box, on the ground, part of which had been spilled over him due to the violence with which the box had fallen from the cart.

2021,"Seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy’s birthday is the same day as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the secret belief that some of our brave friend’s spirit has passed into him. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but we call him Quincey.","So, it has been seven years since the day we escaped those nightmares. We are the ones who enjoy happiness at the cost of the pains in our own lives. The fact that our son was born on the anniversary of Quincey Morris's death brought even more joy to Mina and me. I know, you have kept in your heart a secret belief that some aspect of your heroic friend has been instilled in our child. We gave the boy the names of all the members of our group of friends, but Quincey is still the name we use the most.",9.418,8.011,"Seven years ago, we all went through fire, and since then, some of us believe that the happiness we have now is worth the pain we endured. The fact that our son's birthday is on the same day Quincey Morris died gives Mina and me extra joy. I know that his mother has a secret belief that a part of our brave friend's spirit has passed into him. The bundle of names he carries ties our small community together, but we call him Quincey.",29.953,28.971,"Seven years ago, all of us went through the flames; and for the happiness that some of us have enjoyed since then, I believe it was well worth the suffering.

His mother secretly believes, though I know it, that part of the spirit of our dear friend has passed into the child.

2022,"In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and terrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were living truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.","Last summer, on the way back to visit Transylvania, we returned to the land filled with terrible memories that are indelible in everyone's mind. We couldn't believe the things we saw and heard were still so vivid, even though all traces had been erased. All that remained was the majestic, silent, solitary castle standing alone on a windswept hill.",4.462,2.582,"This summer, we took a journey to Transylvania and went to that old place which holds -and still holds- very vivid and terrifying memories for all of us. It was almost impossible to believe that the things we saw with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were vivid realities. The traces of everything that happened had been erased. The castle was standing as before, rising over the desolation.",33.247,32.433,"During the summer of this year, we took a trip to Transylvania, traversing the terrain that for us was and is so full of terrible memories.

The castle remains as before, rising before a landscape full of desolation.",35.251,34.455
2023,"When we got home we were talking of the old time—which we could all look back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily married. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since our return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one authentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later note-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing’s memorandum. We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as proofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with our boy on his knee:—","We reminisce about the old times with a heavy heart, as Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward have both married and are living very happy lives. I reopened the papers stored in the iron chest after our first return, a long time ago. Strangely enough, among all the documents that make up the record of this story, it would be very difficult to find an authentic part: everything is just typewritten copies, except for the last diary pages of mine, Mina, Seward, and a few notes from Professor Van Helsing. That being said, how could we possibly make others acknowledge these papers as evidence of a tragic and mystical story now? Once, Van Helsing held our son in his arms and said a few very brief words:",3.757,2.198,"When we returned home, we began to talk about the old times, which we no longer remember with sorrow because Godalming and Seward had happy marriages. I took the documents out of the safe where they had been since we returned long ago. We were horrified by the fact that there were almost no original documents among all this pile of material where the records were arranged; apart from Mina's, Seward's, and my later journals and Van Helsing's notes, there was nothing but a heap of typewritten papers. Even if we had such a desire, we could not ask anyone to accept these documents as evidence of such a wild story. Van Helsing, with our son sitting on his knee, summarized the matter as follows:",17.876,16.998,"When we returned home, we talked about the old times... which we could remember without feeling despair, since both Godalming and Seward are happy in their marriages. I took the papers out of the safe where they have been kept since our return, so long ago. We were surprised to see that the entire set of papers that make up the entirety of the records cannot be said to constitute an authentic document; they are merely a pile of typewritten papers, with the exception of the last notes taken by Mina, by Dr. Seward, and by myself, as well as the memorandum from Dr. Van Helsing. We cannot ask anyone, even if we wish to, to accept that pile of papers as proof of such a terrible story. Van Helsing summed it all up when he said, having our little son on his knees:",22.02,21.429
2024,"“We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some day know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is.
