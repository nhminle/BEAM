2,"We slept in what had once been the gymnasium. The floor was of varnished wood, with stripes and circles painted on it, for the games that were formerly played there; the hoops for the basketball nets were still in place, though the nets were gone. A balcony ran around the room, for the spectators, and I thought I could smell, faintly like an afterimage, the pungent scent of sweat, shot through with the sweet taint of chewing gum and perfume from the watching girls, felt-skirted as I knew from pictures, later in miniskirts, then pants, then in one earring, spiky green-streaked hair. Dances would have been held there; themusic lingered, a palimpsest of unheard sound, style upon style, an undercurrent of drums, a forlorn wail, garlands made of tissue-paper flowers, cardboard devils, a revolving ball of mirrors, powdering the dancers with a snow of light.","We slept in what used to be the gymnasium. The floor was made of varnished wood, painted with circles and lines for games of the past; the basketball hoops were still there, though the nets were gone. A long balcony ran along the four walls, meant for spectators, and I could almost smell, faintly like a lingering echo, the pungent scent of sweat, mixed with hints of chewing gum and perfume from the girls watching, dressed in wool skirts – I saw it in movies – then over time to mini skirts, pants, and finally with one ear pierced, hair streaked with blue and spiked with gel. Perhaps dances were also held here: the music still lingers, layers of sound overlapping without listeners, one tune covering another, the drumbeats blending, the mournful wails, garlands made of crepe paper, cardboard devil masks, the glass ball on the ceiling slowly turning, scattering clusters of light over the dancing couples.",23.979,23.483,"We used to sleep in a place that was once a gymnasium.

A balcony surrounded the hall, for spectators, and from what I know from pictures, I imagined I could smell the sharp scent of sweat mingling with the pleasant aroma of gum and perfume from the girls in felt skirts at first, then mini-skirts, later pants, and finally with earrings in one ear and stiff hair with green streaks, like a fleeting afterimage. Balls were also held there; the music would be dying: like a parchment of unheard sound, layer upon layer, with drum sounds coming from underneath, a desperate cry; garlands made of thin paper flowers; cardboard devil masks; a rotating glass ball sprinkling a snow of light over the dancers.",23.043,22.47,"We slept in what had once been the gymnasium. The floor, made of varnished wood, had lines and circles painted on it for various sports. The basketball hoops were still there, but the nets had disappeared.

Dances had been held here; the music persisted, a palimpsest of sounds that no one listened to, one style after another, a background of drums, a melancholic wail, garlands of flowers made of tissue paper, cardboard demons, a rotating mirror ball that sprinkled the dancers with flakes of light.",23.406,22.887

Those eyes, shadowed with makeup, are fine but they resemble the eyes of cats turned to stone, ready to pounce on their prey.

1955,"""I don't have much time,"" I say. This is awkward and clumsy, it isn't what I mean.","“I don't have much time,” I said. An awkward and clumsy sentence, I didn't mean it that way at all. ""I can squeeze it into a bottle, and you can just pour it in,"" he said. Not laughing. “There's no need to be so cruel,” I said. Maybe he felt used. Maybe he also wanted something from me, like emotions, like acknowledging that he is also human, not just a seed pod. “I know you have your own difficulties,” I ventured. He shrugged. ""I get paid,"" he said, looking irritable. But he still didn't move. I get paid, she gets beaten, I recite in my head. So we will do it like that. He doesn't like makeup, flashy stuff. We will play it cool. “Do you come here often?” “What can a good girl like me do in a place like this,” I replied. Both of them smiled: that's better. That was an acknowledgment that we were acting, for what else could we do with such a setup? ""The longer the abstinence, the deeper the love."" We are quoting late-night movies from a very long time ago. And those movies used even older language: this manner of speaking originates from an era millions of years before us. Even my mother didn't speak like that when I lived with her. Perhaps no one has ever spoken like that in real life; it was made up from the start. Anyway, it's still surprising how quickly it has come back, this old-fashioned, falsely cheerful way of asking for favors. Now I know what the real meaning is, returning after millions of years: to keep one's core truly distant, truly hidden, untouchable by anyone. I'm sad again, talking like this leads to endless sorrow: the music fades, the paper flowers lose their color, the satin frays, echoes within echoes. Everything is lost, never to return. Suddenly, I burst into tears. Finally, he came forward, wrapped his arms around me, gently rubbed my back, just holding me like that, comforting me. “Come on,” he said. “We don't have much time.” Still holding my shoulder, he led me to the folding bed and laid me down. He remembered to pull the blanket back first. He started unbuttoning, then caressing, kissing my ear. “No playing romantic games,” he said. “Agreed?” That sentence used to have a different implication, in the past. In the past, it used to mean: unbound. Now it means: no hero. It means: don't risk your life for me, if it comes to that. And then it was like that. And just like that.",1.428,1.193,"“I don't have much time,” I say. I acted rudely and clumsily, that wasn't what I meant. ""I can empty into a bottle and you can pour into it,"" he says. He doesn't smile. “There’s no need to be rude,” I say. Maybe she feels used. Maybe she wants something from me, a bit of emotion, an acknowledgment that she’s human too, that she’s more than just a seed envelope. “I know it’s hard for you,” I try. He shrugs his shoulders. “I get what I deserve,” he says, with an empty retort. But he still doesn't move. I'm getting my due, I'm laying you down, I rhyme in my mind. So, this is how we will do it. She didn't like the makeup and sequins. We will be strict. ""Do you come here often?"" “What is a good girl like me doing in a place like this?” I reply, and we both smile: this is better. This is to confirm that we are pretending, because what else can we do in such a situation? “Abstinence spurs desire.” We are quoting from old movies belonging to a previous era. Those movies belonged to an even earlier time: Such conversations correspond to a date long before our own era. Even my mother wouldn't speak like that, at least not as long as I've known her. Maybe no one ever spoke like that in real life, it was all a lie from the beginning. Still, how surprising it is that it comes to mind so easily, I understand now what purpose this stereotypical and artificial joke, peculiar to homos, served, what it has always served: to keep one's essence distant; closed, protected. Now I am sad, the way we speak is extremely melancholic: lost music, faded paper flowers, worn satin, an echo of an echo. Everything is gone, now impossible. I start crying out of the blue. Finally, he moves towards me, wraps his arms around me, strokes my back, holds me in this way, to comfort me. “Come on,” he says. “We don't have much time.” With his arm around my shoulder, he takes me to the pull-out couch and lays me down. He even opens the blanket first. He starts undressing me, then caressing me, kissing my ear. “No romance,” he says. “Okay?” It had a different meaning once, a long time ago. The meaning back then: no restrictions. The current meaning: no exaggerations. The meaning: don't risk yourself for me, if it comes to that. And so it goes. And so. I knew it could only happen once. Goodbye, I thought, even then, goodbye. There was no thunder either, I had added this. To cover up the sounds I was ashamed to make. It didn't happen like that. I'm not sure exactly how it happened. My only hope is in a revival: feeling love is always just an approximation. Halfway, I thought of Serena Joy, sitting downstairs in the kitchen. Thinking: cheap. They spread their legs for everyone.

All you have to do is give them a cigarette. And then I thought: this is a betrayal. Not the fact itself, but my reaction. If I were sure that he is dead, would there be any difference? I wish I didn't feel shame. I would like to be shameless. I would like to be ignorant. Then I wouldn't know how ignorant I am. 14 THE RESCUE CHAPTER 41 I would like this story to be different. I would like it to be more civilized. I would like it to give a better impression of me, if not as a happy person, at least more active, less hesitant, less distracted by trivialities.
