On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.

Not because Bingley was inadequate, but because Darcy was intelligent. At the same time, he was proud, distant, and meticulous, and his manners, though polite, were not inviting.

Bingley knew the respect that Darcy had for him, which is why he trusted him completely, as well as his good judgment. He understood Darcy like no one else.

The distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.

He named the house Lucas Lodge, where he could complacently consider himself an important person, unburdened by business matters, focusing solely on living up to the appearance of being a good citizen. He took pride in his knighthood but was not arrogant; on the contrary, he cared about everyone.

Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, while vanity is what we would have others think of us.""",33.625,33.04,"––Pride ––observed Mary, who prided herself greatly on the solidity of her reflections––, is a very common defect. From all that I have read, I am convinced that it is indeed very frequent for human nature to be especially prone to it; there are very few who do not harbor a feeling of self-sufficiency for one reason or another, whether real or imagined. Vanity and pride are different things, although they are often used as synonyms. Pride relates to the opinion we have of ourselves; vanity, to what we would like others to think of us.",30.502,29.865

By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising, in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It was generally evident, whenever they met, that he did admire her; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss Lucas.","Thus, it wasn't long before the women at Longbourn visited Netherfield. They were properly reciprocated with visits. Jane Bennet's amiable nature won over Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.

It was clear that whenever the two met, he genuinely showed his affection for her, and as for Jane, she liked him more as well, but she was glad that no one noticed this.

Almost every relationship requires a bit of appreciation or frivolity, to the extent that if everything is left to develop freely, there's no guarantee of anything. We can start comfortably – perhaps a gentle affection is natural, but very few of us can truly love without encouragement from the other side.

As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,","The long-standing discord between you and my esteemed father has always made me feel uneasy, so since my father's unfortunate passing, I have often wanted to mend this rift. However, for a time I thought it would be disrespectful to my father's memory if I were to have a conciliatory relationship with anyone who had been in conflict with him. Nevertheless, I have now made a decision on this matter because, after being ordained last Easter, I was particularly fortunate to be appointed by the council of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, with generosity and kindness, to the precious position of vicar of this parish. Here, I will strive with all my might to act with grateful reverence towards the Lady and be ready to perform the rites of the Church. Furthermore, in my capacity as a clergyman, I feel it is my duty to promote and establish the grace of peace to all families within my sphere of influence. On this basis, I believe that opening my heart is very appropriate, and given my position as the heir apparent to the estate at Longbourn, which will be overlooked by the family, I hope you will not refuse my olive branch. I cannot be at ease because I have hurt the dear ladies of the house, and I also wish to apologize for this, as well as to ask you to understand that I am willing to reconcile with them – but I will mention this matter later. If you do not mind welcoming me into your home, I would like to visit the family on Monday, November 10th, at 4 PM.

Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank—such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people, he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,—some shelves in the closets upstairs.","Mr. Bennet spoke very little during the meal, but when all the servants had left the dining room, he thought it was time to talk to the guest.

Mr. Bennet could not have chosen a better topic for the young man. For Mr. Collins eloquently praised the Lady. And the topic elevated his solemn demeanor above the usual level, and with the most important appearance, he stated that he had never met anyone like her in the upper class – the kindness and condescension, as he had observed in Lady Catherine. She had been pleased to graciously review two of his sermons during her attendance. She had also twice invited him to dine at Rosings, and just the previous Saturday had invited him to fill in for a four-person card game in the evening. Many people he knew said that Lady Catherine was proud, but he saw nothing in her but affability. She always spoke to him as she would to any other upper-class person, she never hindered him from socializing with neighboring families, or when he left the parish to visit relatives. She even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as possible, provided he chose carefully, and had several times visited his humble abode, where she was absolutely pleased with all his arrangements, and she even gave him a few suggestions – a few shelves in the room upstairs.",23.736,23.433,"Mr. Bennet did not talk much during the meal; but when the servants withdrew, he thought it was time to converse with his guest and opened a topic in which he hoped he would show himself, saying that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.

She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she had not objected in the slightest to his forming close relationships with the neighbors or to his leaving his parish for a week or two to visit his relatives occasionally. She had even shown her generosity by advising him to marry as soon as possible, provided he made a good choice, and had once visited him in his humble abode, fully approving of all the renovations he was making and even making some suggestions herself – such as adding a few shelves to the small rooms upstairs.""",32.045,31.804,"Mr. Bennet barely spoke during dinner; but when the servants had already withdrawn, he thought the opportune moment had arrived to converse with his guest.

As he had told Elizabeth, although he had to face folly and conceit elsewhere, in the reading room he was usually free from such annoyances. Therefore, he politely invited Mr. Collins to accompany his daughters. Mr. Collins also preferred going with the ladies to reading, and was very happy to close the thick book and join them.",16.595,16.013,"Lydia's intention to walk to Meryton was not forgotten; all the girls except Mary agreed to go with her; Mr. Collins would accompany them at the request of Mr. Bennet, who wanted to get rid of him and have the library to himself; the man had followed him to the library after breakfast and, pretending to browse one of the largest volumes in the collection, would once again relentlessly talk about his house and garden in Hunsford, giving Mr. Bennet no respite. Such actions greatly annoyed Mr. Bennet. He always desired absolute comfort and tranquility in his library; as he told Elizabeth, he was prepared to encounter foolishness and pretentiousness in every other room of the house, but he was accustomed to being free from them there; therefore, without losing a moment, he kindly invited Mr. Collins to join his daughters' walk; Mr. Collins, being more inclined to walk than to read, gladly closed the large book and went.",29.104,28.724,"Lydia's plan to go to Meryton was still on. All the sisters, except Mary, agreed to go with her. Mr. Collins was going to accompany them at Mr. Bennet's request, who was eager to get rid of his relative and have the library all to himself; for Mr. Collins had followed him there after breakfast and would continue to do so, apparently occupied with one of the largest folios in the collection, though in reality, incessantly talking to Mr. Bennet about his house and garden at Hunsford. Such things greatly unsettled him. The library was the place where he knew he could enjoy his free time in peace. He was willing, as he told Elizabeth, to endure stupidity and conceit in any other room of the house, but in the library, he wanted to be free of all that. So he employed all his courtesy in inviting Collins to accompany his daughters on their walk; and Collins, who was much better at walking than reading, saw the heavens open. He closed the book and left.",28.366,27.954
505,"In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them.","With trivial displays and polite compliments, he accompanied the ladies to Meryton. At this point, the ladies no longer paid attention to him. Their eyes roamed the streets in search of officers, and only the sight of truly elegant hats or muslin goods could distract them.",7.78,6.0,"He swaggered idly, while his cousins nodded politely, and finally, they arrived in Meryton. By then, he could no longer attract the attention of the young people. The girls' eyes immediately started searching for the officers as they wandered the streets, and nothing could distract them except for a very flashy hat in a shop window or a brand new muslin.",13.609,11.712,"And between pompous and insipid phrases on his part, and courteous nods on the part of his cousins, time passed until they reached Meryton. From then on, the younger sisters no longer paid him any attention. They had eyes only for seeking officers in the streets. And unless it was a truly elegant hat or a genuinely new muslin, nothing could distract them.",9.565,7.201
506,"But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.","But a young man appeared and caught the ladies' attention. He had a truly elegant appearance, walking in the opposite direction of an officer. The officer was Danny, the one who had returned from London that Lydia had mentioned. He bowed his head to greet them as everyone passed by. All the ladies were impressed by his demeanor and wondered who he was. Kitty and Lydia decided to find out who he was. The two led the way, crossing the street under the pretext of buying something from the shop opposite, and luckily arrived at the curb just as the two young men were returning to the same place. Danny greeted them and asked permission to introduce his friend to the ladies, Mr. Wickham, who had returned from the city with him and was also joining the same unit. Just the uniform alone made the young man completely captivating. Every aspect of his appearance was splendid; he had a delicate face, a perfect physique, and, in addition, a very charming way of speaking. Right after the introduction, there was a cheerful and naturally fluent conversation that was very proper. They were all chatting when they heard the sound of approaching horses, and they saw Darcy and Bingley riding up. Upon seeing the ladies, the two men approached and began the usual polite exchanges. Bingley was the main speaker, and Jane the main listener. He said he was on his way to Longbourn to inquire about her condition. Darcy confirmed his friend's words with a slight nod, and as he began to resolutely avoid staring at Elizabeth, he noticed the unfamiliar young man. Elizabeth managed to see the expressions on both their faces as they looked at each other, very surprised by the impact of the encounter. Both changed their complexion, one turning white, the other red. After a few moments, Wickham touched his hat to greet, and Darcy only awkwardly responded. What was that? Impossible to think of, impossible not to want to know?",16.125,15.846,"However, it wasn't long before a young man caught the attention of all the ladies, someone they had never seen before, very gentlemanly in appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the road. The officer was Mr. Denny, whom Lydia had come to inquire about whether he had returned from London, and he nodded as they passed by. They were all struck by the stranger's demeanor, all curious about who he might be; Kitty and Lydia pretended to look at something in the shop across the street to find out if possible, and just as they stepped onto the sidewalk, by coincidence, they came face to face with the two gentlemen returning. Mr. Denny immediately began to speak, asking permission to introduce his friend: Mr. Wickham had come to town with him the previous day and, he was happy to say, had agreed to be an officer in their regiment. This was just as it should be; the young man's only missing element for perfect charm was his uniform. Every detail of his demeanor added something to him; everything about him was beautiful: a pleasant face, a well-formed body, and an engaging manner of speaking. After the introductions, the young man showed he was eager to talk – but it was a perfectly measured and easy eagerness; the whole group was standing and chatting sweetly when the sound of horses drew their attention, and they saw Darcy and Bingley coming down the street. As soon as the two gentlemen recognized the ladies in the group, they came directly to them and displayed their usual politeness. Bingley was the main speaker, and Miss Bennet was the main topic. At that moment, Bingley said, he was also on his way to Longbourn to inquire about her health. Mr. Darcy nodded to confirm this and was just beginning to struggle not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth when he noticed the stranger's presence and suddenly froze; Elizabeth saw that both their faces froze in astonishment at the encounter as they looked at each other. Both of their colors changed, one turning white, the other red. Mr. Wickham touched his hat a few seconds later – Darcy barely acknowledged this salute. What could this mean? –It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to be eager to find out.",27.413,27.215,"But the attention of all the young ladies was instantly captured by a young man they had not seen before, who had the appearance of being quite the gentleman, and who was walking with an officer on the opposite side of the street. The officer was Mr. Denny himself, whose return from London Lydia had come to inquire about, and who bowed to greet them as he passed. They were all impressed by the stranger's bearing and wondered who he could be. Kitty and Lydia, determined to find out, crossed the street under the pretext that they wanted to buy something at the shop opposite, reaching the sidewalk so fortunately that, at that very moment, the two gentlemen, on their way back, arrived at exactly the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly and asked if he might introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had come from London with him the day before and had kindly accepted a position in the Corps. This was the last straw, for belonging to the regiment was the only thing he lacked to complete his charm. His appearance spoke highly in his favor; he was handsome and slender, with very affable manners. After the introduction, Mr. Wickham initiated a conversation with great ease, with the utmost correctness and without pretensions. They were all still standing there pleasantly chatting when the sound of horses drew their attention, and they saw Darcy and Bingley, on their mounts, coming down the street. Upon recognizing the young ladies in the group, the two gentlemen approached them and began the customary greetings. Bingley spoke more than anyone, and Jane was the main subject of his conversation. At that moment, he said, they were on their way to Longbourn to see how she was; Darcy confirmed this with a nod and was trying not to fix his gaze on Elizabeth when suddenly they were both paralyzed upon seeing the stranger. Elizabeth, who saw both their faces as they looked at each other, was very surprised by the effect the encounter had on them. Both changed color, one turned pale and the other red. After a slight hesitation, Wickham raised his hand to his hat, to which Darcy deigned to respond. What could that mean? It was impossible to imagine, but it was also impossible not to feel a great curiosity to know.",25.825,25.611
507,"In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.","Meanwhile, Bingley seemed unaware of what had happened, bid farewell, and rode off with his friend.",16.853,12.613,"Soon after, Mr. Bingley asked for leave without seeming to pay attention to what was happening and set off with his friend.",23.87,18.956,"A moment later, Bingley, who seemed not to have noticed what had happened, said goodbye and continued on with his friend.",30.036,26.774
508,"Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation.","Mr. Danny and Wickham accompanied the ladies to Mr. Phillips' house, then bowed and took their leave, despite Lydia's pleas for them to come inside.",3.82,2.206,"Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips's house, then, despite Miss Lydia's insistent invitations to come inside and even Mrs. Philips raising the parlor window to support the invitation, they bowed and took their leave.",36.295,35.291,"Denny and Wickham continued walking with the girls until they reached Mr. Philips' house door, where they made the appropriate bows and left despite Lydia's insistent pleas for them to come in and despite Mrs. Philips opening the vestibule window and leaning out to vocally support the invitation.",7.628,5.295
509,"Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield, because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s commission in the ——shire. She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street,—and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation; but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid, disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured, with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.","Mrs. Phillips was delighted to see her nieces again. The two older girls, having been away for some time, received a special welcome. She was surprised by their sudden return home. Since they did not use the carriage, she would not have known they had returned if she had not accidentally met the shopkeeper who sold goods to Mr. Jones and informed her. Jane introduced Mr. Collins to her, and she received him with utmost politeness. He responded formally, apologizing for the intrusion as they had not been acquainted before, only through the ladies' introduction. Mrs. Phillips seemed concerned about receiving someone with such excessive politeness. But the welcome was interrupted by inquiries about the stranger, and about him, she only knew what the ladies had already been told. She promised to have her husband visit him and invite him for a meal, provided the Bennet family would also come in the evening. Everyone agreed, and they all left in high spirits, anticipating the upcoming pleasures. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies, but she reassured him that it was unnecessary.",6.327,6.104,"Mrs. Philips was always pleased to see her nieces; the two eldest girls were especially well received after their recent absence; Mrs. Philips was fervently expressing her surprise at their sudden return, saying that if she hadn't seen Mr. Jones's apprentice in the street, who told her they would no longer be sending syrup to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets had left, she wouldn't have known. At that moment, Jane stepped forward and introduced Mr. Collins, drawing her attention to him. Mrs. Philips greeted Mr. Collins in the most polite manner, and received the same courtesy in return; Mr. Collins apologized for being a guest without their prior acquaintance, but he believed that his proud connection with the young ladies who brought him there would excuse this situation. Mrs. Philips was delighted by such extreme politeness; but her observation of the stranger was soon interrupted by excited questions about another stranger, about whom she could tell her nieces what they already knew, namely that Mr. Denny had brought him from London and that he would be taking the rank of lieutenant in the -------shire regiment. She said she had been watching him for the past hour, walking up and down the street; if Mr. Wickham had appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued to watch, but unfortunately, apart from a few officers who were ""stupid, disagreeable fellows"" compared to the stranger, no one else was passing by the windows. Some of them would be dining with the Philipses the next day; their aunt promised that if the Longbourn family came in the evening, she would send her husband to visit Mr. Wickham and invite him as well. They agreed; Mrs. Philips said they would play a delightful, easy, and boisterous game of lottery tickets, followed by something hot to eat. It was joyful to have such entertainments to look forward to; both parties were in high spirits as they parted. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies as he left the room and was assured with tireless politeness that there was no need for any apology.",24.685,24.465,"Mrs. Philips was always delighted to see her nieces. The two eldest were especially well received due to their recent absence. She expressed her surprise at their quick return home, of which she would have known nothing, since they did not come back in their own carriage, had it not been for the chance encounter with Dr. Jones's young man, who told her that she no longer needed to send more medicines to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets had left. Then Jane introduced Mr. Collins to whom she dedicated all her attention. She welcomed him with the most exquisite courtesy, to which Collins responded with even more refinement, apologizing for having presented himself at her house without prior notice, although he felt proud that it was the relationship with her nieces that justified such an intrusion. Mrs. Philips was completely overwhelmed by such an excess of good manners. But she soon had to set aside this stranger, due to the exclamations and questions regarding the other. Mrs. Philips could not tell her nieces more than they already knew: that Mr. Denny had brought him from London and that he was going to stay at the county garrison with the rank of lieutenant. She added that she had been observing him while he walked down the street; and if Mr. Wickham had appeared then, both Kitty and Lydia would have also approached the window to watch him, but unfortunately, at that moment only a few officers passed by who, compared to the stranger, seemed ""stupid and unpleasant fellows."" Some of these officers were going to dine the next day with the Philips, and the aunt promised them that she would tell her husband to visit Wickham to invite him too, if the Longbourn family wanted to come in the evening. Thus it was agreed, and Mrs. Philips offered them to play the lottery and then have a hot dinner. The prospect of such delights was magnificent, and the girls left very happy. Collins apologized again upon leaving, and he was assured that it was unnecessary.",18.847,18.572
510,"As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.","On the way back, Elizabeth told Jane about Darcy's strange attitude. Although Jane could defend both of them if they had done something wrong, she couldn't explain to her sister the attitude of the two.",8.166,5.628,"While walking home, Elizabeth explained to Jane what had transpired between the two gentlemen; if they seemed to have made a mistake, Jane would have defended one or both of them, but she too could not make more sense of this behavior than her sister.",25.276,23.268,"On the way home, Elizabeth told Jane what had happened between the two gentlemen, and although Jane would have defended them if she had noticed anything strange, in this case, like her sister, she could not explain such behavior.",20.367,17.708

He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.","Mr. Collins made Mrs. Bennet extremely grateful when he praised Mrs. Phillips' attitude and polite manners. He insisted that, except for Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never met a more elegant woman, for she not only received him with the highest courtesy but also kindly invited him to visit the next evening, despite not having known him before.

He said that, except for Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant lady in his life; she had not only received him with tremendous politeness but had also emphatically included him in the invitation for the following evening, even though she had never seen him before. Of course, their familial connection might have had some influence, but still, he had never received such attention in his life.",31.889,31.105,"Collins praised Mrs. Bennet by commending the manners and education of Mrs. Philips. He assured that apart from Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman, for not only did she receive him with the utmost courtesy, but she also included him in the invitation for the next evening, despite being a complete stranger to her. Of course, he knew he should attribute it to his relationship with them, but nevertheless, he had never been treated with such kindness in his life.",32.885,32.161

514,"When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper’s room.","When everyone had taken their seats, Mr. Collins gazed around absentmindedly and admired the surroundings, as he was quite impressed with the size and interior of the room, to the extent that he remarked he felt as if he were sitting in the summer dining room at Rosings.",5.024,4.635,"After this information was given and everyone was seated, Mr. Collins began to idly examine the surroundings; he was so impressed by the spaciousness and furnishing of the apartment that he almost declared he could mistake it for the small summer breakfast room at Rosings. Although this comparison did not initially garner much appreciation, once Mrs. Philips learned what Rosings was and who its owner was – upon hearing a description of just one of Lady Catherine's sitting rooms and that just the fireplace had cost eight hundred pounds – she felt the full force of the compliment, to the extent that she would no longer be offended even if it were compared to the servant's quarters.",18.319,17.449,"After receiving this information, and when everyone had taken their seats, Collins was able to observe everything at his leisure; the dimensions and the furniture of the room caused him such admiration that he confessed to having believed he was in the summer dining room of Rosings.",2.807,2.182
515,"In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the ——shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.","At first, the comparison did not bring joy, but when Mrs. Philips understood where Rosings was and who owned it, when she heard him describe one of Lady Catherine's drawing rooms and learned that just the fireplace had cost eight hundred pounds, she immediately felt the full force of the compliment, and it would not have been bothersome if he had intended to compare it to the housekeeper's room. Until the young men arrived to sit with them, while describing all the splendor of Lady Catherine and her estate, occasionally digressing to praise his own humble Parsonage and its improvements, Mr. Collins found Mrs. Philips to be an attentive listener in conversation. The more she listened, the higher her impression of his status grew, and she intended to recount everything to her neighbors as soon as possible. For the young ladies, unable to hear him speak and with nothing to do but wait, the waiting time seemed excessively long. Finally, the young men arrived. When Mr. Wickham entered, Elizabeth felt as if she had either never met him before or had not thought of him since then, with a fleeting, inexplicable fondness. The officers were all reputable, elegant, and the best of them were present here; but Mr. Wickham stood out above all in person, face, manner, and bearing, just as they surpassed Mr. Philips, with his broad face, who at that moment was exhaling the scent of port wine as he followed them into the room.",14.639,14.164,"She was very happy to describe the splendor of Lady Catherine and her mansion, occasionally praising her own humble abode and the renovations she was undergoing, until the gentlemen joined them; Mrs. Philips was a very attentive listener for her; after hearing these, she found the young man even more important and decided to share this with her neighbors at the first opportunity. The girls, who couldn't listen to their cousins, lamented the lack of a piano, and had nothing to do but examine the fake porcelain they had decorated above the fireplace, found the waiting time very long. But it finally ended, of course. The gentlemen approached; when Mr. Wickham entered the room, Elizabeth felt that she was not at all wrong in her admiration for him when she had seen him before and since then. The officers of the -------shire regiment were generally very reasonable, gentlemanly men, and the best of them were at this party; but Mr. Wickham, with his appearance, face, demeanor, and walk, was far superior to all of them, just as the officers were superior to the broad-faced, dull, wine-breathed Mr. Philips who entered the room after them.",24.044,23.663,"This comparison did not arouse any enthusiasm at first; but when Mrs. Philips heard from Collins' lips what Rosings was and who its owner was, when she heard the description of one of Lady Catherine's drawing rooms and learned that just the fireplace had cost eight hundred pounds, she appreciated the full value of that compliment and would hardly have been bothered if he had compared her drawing room to the housekeeper's room at the Bourghs'. Collins amused himself by telling Mrs. Philips all about Lady Catherine's grandeur and her mansion, occasionally mentioning his humble home and the improvements he was making to it, until the gentlemen arrived. Collins found in Mrs. Philips an attentive listener whose good opinion of the rector increased with everything he explained to her, and she was already thinking about telling her neighbors all about it as soon as possible. To the young ladies, who could not stand their cousin and had nothing else to do but wish for a musical instrument at hand and examine the china imitations on the mantelpiece, the wait was becoming too long. But finally, the gentlemen appeared. When Wickham entered the room, Elizabeth noticed that she had neither paid attention to him before nor remembered him afterward with sufficient admiration. The county garrison officers generally enjoyed extraordinary prestige; they were very handsome, and the best of them were now at the present gathering. But Wickham, with his gallantry, his ease, and his graceful walk, was as superior to them as they were to the stout Uncle Philips, who entered the room last, reeking of port wine.",13.983,13.467

591,"TILL Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s pleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,—","Elizabeth never doubted that Mr. Wickham would be absent from the ball, until she entered the drawing room at Netherfield and searched for him in vain among the men in red coats. She had been so sure he would be there, that she did not review her memories for any event that might have alerted her. She had dressed more carefully than usual, and prepared with the greatest eagerness to conquer all that remained unconquered in his heart, thinking that it could be achieved in just one evening. But suddenly, she had the dreadful thought that he had been deliberately excluded from Mr. Bingley's guest list to please Mr. Darcy. Although this was not entirely true, Mr. Denny conveyed the news of his absence when Lydia spoke with him. Denny reported that Wickham had to attend to business in town the day before and had not yet returned. He added, with a suggestive smile:",10.823,9.606,"It had never occurred to Elizabeth that there was any chance of Mr. Wickham not being present until she entered the sitting room at Netherfield and looked in vain among the cluster of redcoats gathered there.

She had dressed with more than usual care, prepared with all her cheerfulness to conquer everything that remained unconquered in the man's heart, confident that there was not much left unconquered throughout the evening. But for a moment, she was seized by the suspicion that the Bingleys had deliberately omitted the officers from their invitations to please Mr. Darcy; although this was not the case, the fact of his absence was confirmed by his friend Mr. Denny, who, when approached by the curious Lydia, explained that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the previous day and had not yet returned, adding with a meaningful smile:",29.181,28.764,"Until Elizabeth entered the Netherfield drawing-room and searched in vain among the group of red coats gathered there for Wickham, it did not occur to her that he might not be among the guests. The certainty of finding him had made her forget what would have rightly alarmed her. She had groomed herself with more care than usual and was prepared with a very high spirit to conquer whatever remained untamed in her heart, trusting that it was the best reward she could achieve during the evening. But in an instant, the horrible suspicion came over her that Wickham might have been omitted from Bingley's list of invited officers to please Darcy. That was not exactly the case. His absence was definitively confirmed by Mr. Denny, whom Lydia anxiously approached, and who told them that Mr. Wickham had been obliged to go to the capital to resolve some matters the day before and had not yet returned.

593,"This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.","Although Lydia did not notice, Elizabeth heard it. Though this news reassured her that Darcy was not much involved in Wickham's absence as she had initially suspected, all her resentment towards Darcy grew even more intense due to her disappointment, to the extent that she could not respond with the minimal courtesy to his polite questions. She thought that showing interest, tolerance, and patience towards Darcy would hurt Wickham. She resolved not to speak to Darcy anymore, turning away with a bit of irritation that she could not entirely suppress even when conversing with Mr. Bingley, and was further provoked by his blind partiality.",11.927,10.743,"Although this part of the explanation escaped Lydia's attention, it did not escape Elizabeth's, and even if her initial guess was not correct, it convinced her that the reason for Wickham's absence was Darcy; the coldness she felt towards Darcy hardened so much with her current disappointment that she had difficulty responding with reasonable politeness to Darcy's courteous questions when he approached her shortly after. Showing interest, patience, and understanding to Darcy meant insulting Wickham. She was determined not to speak to him in any way and turned her back with a certain petulance; her petulance did not fully subside even while talking to Mr. Bingley; she was also angry with him for not being impartial.",9.445,8.092,"Lydia did not hear these words, but Elizabeth did; although her initial suspicion had not been true, Darcy was equally responsible for Wickham's absence, her antipathy towards the former was so exacerbated that she could barely respond politely to the kind questions Darcy asked her when he approached her shortly after. Any attention or tolerance towards Darcy meant an injury to Wickham. She decided not to have any conversation with Darcy and put herself in such a mood that she could not even conceal it when talking to Bingley, as his blind partiality irritated her.",10.764,9.635
594,"But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.","However, Elizabeth's personality did not hold onto resentment for long. Although all her hopes for the evening had faded away, her spirits gradually became comfortable again. After sharing all her feelings with Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen in a week, she soon willingly moved on to the peculiarities of her cousin, telling her friend about him. However, the first two dances brought about sorrow; they were two torturous pieces.

She was delighted to be rid of him.",19.727,19.064,"Aunt Elizabeth was not made for sulking; although all the dreams she had for the evening were shattered, the sulking did not last long; after pouring out all her sorrows to Charlotte Lucas, whom she hadn't seen for a week, she became willing to transition to her cousin's oddities and pointed her finger at Charlotte. However, the first two dances brought back her boredom; they were no different from a death dance.

The moment of getting rid of the man was wonderful.",16.109,15.333,"But bad humor was not made for Elizabeth, and despite all her plans for the night being ruined, it soon passed. After telling her sorrows to Charlotte Lucas, whom she hadn't seen for a week, she soon found herself in the mood to tolerate all her cousin's oddities and approached him. However, the first two dances brought back her distress; they were like a penance.

Getting rid of him was like reaching ecstasy.",22.288,21.671
595,"She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind: Charlotte tried to console her.","She danced the next set with an officer, feeling happy to hear about Wickham and knowing that everyone adored him. After the music ended, she returned to Charlotte Lucas. While they were conversing, Mr. Darcy suddenly approached her. He surprised her by asking her to dance. Without thinking, she accepted.

598,"When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time, with—","However, when the dance music started and Darcy returned to take her hand, Charlotte couldn't help but whisper in her ear not to foolishly dream of Wickham and become unpleasant in the eyes of someone ten times higher in status. Elizabeth did not reply, accepted the dance with him, feeling surprised at how her own dignity had changed to allow her to face Mr. Darcy, and read in the eyes of the other dancing couples an equal surprise at seeing the two of them together. For a long while, neither of them spoke a word; she began to imagine that their silence would last throughout the two dances.

They stood without speaking for a while; Elizabeth thought their silence would last until the end of the two dances and initially decided not to break it, but then suddenly considered that forcing him to talk would be a greater punishment and made a few observations about the dance.

Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,—","Elizabeth tried to persuade him to abandon the idea, making him understand that Mr. Darcy would consider his approaching to start a conversation without an introduction as an improper and presumptuous attitude rather than a friendly inquiry about his aunt; that there was no need for them to recognize each other; that if necessary, Mr. Darcy should be the one to take the initiative to get acquainted due to his higher status.

Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.","- Dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the utmost respect for your excellent judgment on all matters within your understanding, but allow me to say that there is a significant difference between the manners of the secular world and the rituals of the clergy.

Her heart fluttered seeing him expose himself to such a person. Mr. Darcy looked at him with undisguised astonishment, and when Mr. Collins finally stopped speaking, he responded with little politeness.

655,"As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.","Since Elizabeth no longer cared about anything else, she paid close attention to her sister and Mr. Bingley. The sight of the two being close to each other made her feel a joy almost as great as what Jane was experiencing. She imagined her sister living in this very house with all the happiness that a marriage based on love could bring, and in this context, she thought she could even grow fond of Bingley's two sisters. She clearly saw that her mother's intentions were aligned with the same feelings, so she decided not to go near her for fear of hearing too much. Thus, when they sat down to eat, she found the unfortunate circumstance that had placed her and her mother close to each other, and she was very uneasy to see her mother talking comfortably and openly with Lady Lucas, discussing nothing but her expectations of seeing Jane soon married to Mr. Bingley. It was a lively topic, and Mrs. Bennet seemed tireless in listing the advantages of the marriage. The first points she boasted about were a charming, wealthy young man living only three miles away; and then it was truly comforting to see that his two sisters also liked Jane, being sure that they too desired the match as much as she did. Moreover, this was a promising situation for the younger siblings, as Jane's wedding and such a brother-in-law would bring them closer to other wealthy men, and finally, it was a relief in this stage of her life to be able to entrust the care of her unmarried daughters to their elder sister, so when they went out to socialize, she wouldn't have to follow them more closely than she wished. In this situation, it was necessary to accept and find joy, due to the social etiquette of such occasions, although she did not feel as comfortable as everyone else being confined indoors at any stage of life. She concluded with many good wishes for Lady Lucas to soon be as fortunate as she was, although she confidently believed with a sense of triumph that her friend would have no such luck.",18.116,17.834,"When Elizabeth had no business of her own to attend to, she immediately turned all her attention to her sister and Mr. Bingley; the train of thoughts that emerged from her observations made her almost as happy as Jane.

She could clearly see that her mother's thoughts were in the same direction and decided not to approach her for fear of hearing too much. When they sat down to dinner, she saw that by a stroke of bad luck she was seated next to her; and her spirits sank even further when she saw her mother freely and openly conversing with Lady Lucas on her other side, constantly talking about how she hoped Jane would soon marry Mr. Bingley. – It was an exciting topic, and Mrs. Bennet seemed tireless in enumerating the advantages of that union. The most significant sources of joy were that the man was so charming, so rich, and lived only three miles away from them; then, seeing how fond Bingley's two sisters were of Jane, and how much they desired the union as much as she did, was a great comfort. Moreover, it was a promising thing for her younger sisters as well, because Jane making such a great marriage would pave the way for them to find wealthy men; and finally, knowing that at her age, she could place her unmarried daughters under their sister's protection and not have to go out into society unless she wanted to was a source of happiness. This situation had to be turned into a source of pleasure because etiquette required it; but no one could enjoy staying at home less than Mrs. Bennet at any period of her life.

It was not difficult for her to guess that her mother's thoughts followed the same path, and she decided not to risk approaching her to avoid hearing her comments. Unfortunately, at dinner time, they had to sit next to each other. Elizabeth was very upset to see how her mother kept talking to Lady Lucas, freely and openly, about her hope that Jane would soon marry Bingley. The topic was captivating, and Mrs. Bennet seemed never to tire of enumerating the advantages of that alliance. Just considering the youth of the groom, his attractiveness, his wealth, and the fact that he lived only three miles from Longbourn, made Mrs. Bennet happy. But in addition, one had to take into account how delighted Bingley's two sisters were with Jane, who would undoubtedly be as pleased with the union as she herself was. Moreover, Jane's marriage to someone of such high status was very promising for her younger daughters, who would thus have more opportunities to meet wealthy men. Finally, it was a relief, at her age, to be able to entrust her single daughters to the care of their sister, and not have to accompany them herself except when she felt like it. There was no choice but to take this circumstance as a reason for satisfaction, for in such cases, etiquette demands it; but there was no one who liked staying comfortably at home more at any time in her life.

Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,—but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, impenetrably grave.

Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her sister with the most wretched feelings; and she restlessly watched her through several not very well-received musical passages as they concluded. Upon receiving thanks, Mary also perceived the implied wish for her to sing another song, so she began again. Mary's talents were not suited for such a style of performance; she had a weak voice and overly affected mannerisms. Elizabeth fell into despair. She looked over at Jane to see how her sister was enduring it, but Jane was calmly conversing with Bingley. She looked at her two younger sisters, seeing them making mocking gestures at each other.

In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared—many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.","Mr. Collins said: - If I were fortunate enough to have a good singing voice, I would be very honored to contribute to the enjoyment, as I consider music a healthy pastime and entirely compatible with a clergyman. However, I do not mean to say that we have a legitimate reason to spend much time on music, as there are certainly other tasks that need to be done. A pastor managing a parish has many tasks to handle. First and foremost, he must arrange with the higher powers to be effective in his duties without offending his patron. He must write his own sermons, and the remaining time cannot be so extensive that it neglects parish duties. He also has to take care of and improve his living quarters without being condemned for extravagance. I consider it equally important that he must have an attitude of care and reconciliation with everyone, especially those who have elevated him. I cannot exempt him from these duties, just as I cannot think well of someone who has missed the opportunity to show respect to anyone related to the family. He leaned towards Mr. Darcy as he concluded his speech, which was delivered loudly enough for half the room to hear clearly. Many people stared at him intently. Many people smiled, but no one appeared as interested as Mr. Bennet, while his wife enthusiastically praised Mr. Collins for his heartfelt words, whispering to Mrs. Lucas that he was a particularly virtuous and wise young man.",16.325,15.923,"""If I were fortunate enough to be able to sing,"" said Mr. Collins, ""I would take great pleasure in entertaining this assembly with a song; I see music as a very innocent occupation, perfectly in harmony with the profession of clergy. –However, I do not say we should devote too much time to music, because there are other things that need attention. A village parson has many duties to attend to. –For one, he must make a contribution agreement that will be beneficial to himself and not disturb his patron. He must write his own sermons; the remaining time is barely enough for church duties and the maintenance and repair of his home, and it would be inexcusable not to make his home as comfortable as possible. Moreover, I find it very important that he should have a careful and conciliatory attitude towards everyone, especially towards those to whom he owes his appointment. I cannot absolve him from this duty; in fact, let me say, I would not look kindly on him missing an opportunity to show his respect to anyone connected with the family. "" And he concluded his speech by bowing to Mr. Darcy; he had spoken so loudly that half the room had heard him. –Many people stared –many people smiled; but no one seemed more amused than Mr. Bennet; at that moment his wife was seriously engaged in praising Mr. Collins for making such a meaningful speech: in a half-whisper she was telling Lady Lucas that he was quite an intelligent, well-bred young man.",26.75,26.479,"––If I ––said Collins then–– had the good fortune to be apt for singing, I would very much like to entertain the audience with a romance. I consider music to be an innocent distraction and completely compatible with the clerical profession. By this, I do not mean to say that it is right to devote too much time to music, for there are, of course, other things to attend to. The rector of a parish has a lot of work. First of all, he has to make an adjustment of the tithes that is beneficial to him and not burdensome to his patron. He has to write the sermons, and the time left is never enough for the parish duties and for the care and improvement of his parishioners whose lives he is obliged to make as bearable as possible. And I consider it of great importance that he be attentive and conciliatory with everyone, especially with those to whom he owes his position. I consider this indispensable and cannot hold in good esteem the man who would waste the opportunity to pay his respects to anyone related to the family of his benefactors. And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, spoken so loudly that half the room heard it.

664,"To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.","For Elizabeth, it seemed as though her family had conspired together to showcase themselves as prominently as possible on this occasion; they could not have played their roles with higher spirits or better results. She thought Mr. Bingley and her sister were truly fortunate that he did not notice some of the performances, and his feelings were not too distressed by the ridiculous actions he had witnessed. However, she found it unfortunate that Mr. Bingley’s sisters and Mr. Darcy had the opportunity to mock her relatives, and she was unsure whether Mr. Darcy's silent arrogance or the sisters' disdainful smiles were more bearable.",12.683,11.646,"It seemed to Elizabeth as if her entire family had conspired to disgrace themselves throughout the evening; they could not have played their roles more sincerely or with greater success; she was glad for Bingley and her sister that he had missed some of the disgrace; fortunately, Bingley's feelings were not the kind to be troubled by the foolishness he must have witnessed. However, it was bad enough that her two sisters had found an opportunity to mock Mr. Darcy's relatives, and Elizabeth could not decide whether Mr. Darcy's silent disdain or the two ladies' insolent smiles were more unbearable.",14.5,13.514,"To Elizabeth, it seemed that if her family had agreed to make themselves as ridiculous as possible that night, they could not have done it better nor achieved such success; and she was very glad that Bingley and his sister had not witnessed most of the spectacle and that Bingley was not the kind of person who cared about or was bothered by the madness he might have witnessed. It was bad enough that the sisters and Darcy had the opportunity to mock her family; and she did not know what she found more intolerable: Darcy's silent contempt or the ladies' insolent smirks.",6.858,5.431
665,"The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation to herself.","She did not feel any joy in the remaining time. Mr. Collins teased her, persistently clinging to her; and although he could not dance with her again, he found ways to prevent her from dancing with others. She earnestly asked him to dance with someone else and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room, but he refused. He reassured her that he did not like dancing at all, that his main purpose was the delicate attentions he wanted to bestow upon her, and thus he wanted to make his intentions clear by staying close to her for the rest of the time. There was no arguing about this. She felt greatly relieved whenever Miss Lucas came over to them and cheerfully started a conversation with Mr. Collins.",21.441,20.811,"The rest of the evening brought very little amusement. She was weary of Mr. Collins, who stubbornly stood by her side; although he could not persuade her to dance again, he also did not allow her to dance with others. Elizabeth tried in vain to get rid of him; she even offered to introduce him to one of the young ladies in the room. The man said that he did not care in the least about dancing, that his main aim was to win her favor by showing delicate attention, and therefore he insisted on staying by her side all evening. There was no arguing with such a project. Her friend Miss Lucas often came over to them and meekly took over the task of listening to Mr. Collins' conversation, which allowed Elizabeth to feel somewhat at ease.",26.154,25.61,"The rest of the night passed for her without the slightest interest. Collins drove her crazy with his insistence on not leaving her side. Although he did not manage to convince her to dance with him again, he prevented her from dancing with others. It was useless for her to beg him to go chat with other people and to offer to introduce him to some young ladies at the party. Collins assured her that dancing did not matter to him and that his main desire was to make himself agreeable to her with delicate attentions, so he had decided to stay by her side all night. There was nothing to argue about such a plan. Her friend Miss Lucas was the only one who consoled her by frequently sitting by her side and diverting Collins' conversation towards her.",15.367,14.601
666,"She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice: though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.","At least she no longer had to endure the annoyance of Mr. Darcy paying her any more attention. Although he often stayed a short distance away, somewhat unburdened, he never came close enough to converse. She thought it might be because she had hinted at Mr. Wickham, and she was glad about this.",17.731,15.803,"At least she did not have to endure the boredom that Mr. Darcy could cause; although he was often very close and standing by himself, he never came close enough to talk. Elizabeth felt that this might be the result of his implications regarding Mr. Wickham, and she was pleased.",17.039,15.052,"At least in this way she was free of Darcy, who, although sometimes found himself at a short distance from them completely unoccupied, did not approach to speak to them. Elizabeth attributed it to the result of her allusions to Wickham and was glad of it.",11.206,8.42
667,"The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord, how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.","The Longbourn family left the ball last. With Mrs. Bennet's arrangements, they had to wait for their carriage for 15 minutes after everyone else had gone. This gave them enough time to see how warmly some members of the host family bid them farewell. Mrs. Hurst and her sister barely spoke except to complain of tiredness, clearly wanting to see the guests off as quickly as possible. The two did not want to continue conversing with Mrs. Bennet, despite her attempts to start a conversation, and this created an awkward atmosphere for everyone. Mr. Collins did not help matters by going on at length praising Mr. Bingley and his two sisters for their elegance in manners, as well as their outstanding hospitality and courtesy towards the guests. Darcy said nothing. Mr. Bennet, also in silence, amused himself by observing the scene around him. Mr. Bingley and Jane stood together, slightly apart from everyone else, speaking only to each other. Even Lydia was too tired to say anything more than “Oh my, I am so tired!” accompanied by a long yawn.",21.784,21.4,"The Longbourn group was the last to leave; due to Mrs. Bennet's maneuver, they had to wait fifteen minutes after everyone else had left for their carriage, which gave them the opportunity to see how heartily some members of the family wished for their departure. Mrs. Hurst and her sister hardly opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue; it was clear that they wanted the house to themselves. They repelled every attempt Mrs. Bennet made to start a conversation, thereby creating a severe silence over the whole group; Mr. Collins' long speeches, full of compliments about the elegance of the entertainment arranged by Mr. Bingley and his sisters, and their hospitality and kindness as a mark of their treatment of their guests, did nothing to ease them. Darcy said nothing. Mr. Bennet, in the same silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane stood a little apart from the others, talking only to each other. Elizabeth also maintained her steady silence with Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; even Lydia, except for occasionally exclaiming ""My God, how tired I am!"" with a violent yawn, was too exhausted to say anything else.",33.031,32.712,"The Longbourn family was the last to leave.

They rejected all of Mrs. Bennet's attempts at conversation and the liveliness dwindled, despite Collins' long speeches congratulating Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of the party and the hospitality and finesse with which they had treated their guests. Darcy said absolutely nothing. Mr. Bennet, as silent as he, enjoyed the scene. Bingley and Jane were together and a little apart from the others, talking to each other.

Bingley was all grateful pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.","Finally, when they bid each other farewell, Mrs. Bennet, with the most constrained politeness, expressed her desire to welcome the entire family to Longbourn, specifically telling Mr. Bingley that everyone would be very happy if he could come for an informal meal with the family at any time, instead of a formal invitation.

669,"Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.","Mrs. Bennet was completely satisfied, leaving with the joy that, after preparing for the settlement of living arrangements, new carriages, and wedding dresses, she would surely see her daughter settled at Netherfield within three to four months.

Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford,—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,—that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake, and for your own; let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place—which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”","- My reasons for marriage are, first, I think every clergyman, when in favorable circumstances, should set a good example of married life in his parish. Second, I believe that married life will bring me boundless happiness; and third, which I should have mentioned first, due to the advice of the noble lady whom I have the honor to call my patroness. Twice she has condescended to give me her opinion on this matter, and only last Saturday before I left Hunsford, she said: “Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose carefully, select a good woman for me, and for yourself; she must be active and useful, not necessarily high-born but should be capable of managing household finances. That is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as possible, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her. ” By the way, my dear, allow me to remark that I consider Lady Catherine de Bourgh's concern and advice among my favorable circumstances. You will find her character far surpasses what I have described; your wit and vivacity will please her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect that her position inevitably commands. While I have intentions of marriage, I must also explain why I am inclined towards Longbourn rather than the area where I currently reside, which also has many charming young ladies. I will inherit this estate after your esteemed father passes away, and I would not be at ease if I did not choose one of his daughters as my spouse, so that they would suffer less when that unfortunate event occurs, although, as I have said, it will not happen for many years. My dear, that is my motivation, which I hope will not make you think less of me. Now, I have nothing more to say except to confirm to you, in the most vivid terms, my ardent affection. I am completely indifferent to money, and will not ask your father for anything in this regard because I know well that he cannot provide, and that you will only inherit a sum of one thousand pounds at four percent, which you will only receive after your mother's death. Therefore, on this matter, I will remain entirely silent. You can trust that I will not be so narrow-minded as to utter any complaints once we are married.",19.951,19.79,"""My reasons for getting married are as follows; first, I think it is right for a clergyman with comfortable conditions (like myself) to set an example of marriage in his village; second, I believe my happiness will greatly increase; third – and perhaps I should have mentioned this first, it is the special advice and recommendation of that noble lady whom I have the honor to call my patroness. She gave me her opinion on this matter twice (unsolicited); it was the Saturday night before I left Hunsford – between the quadrilles, Mrs. Jenkinson was adjusting Miss de Bourgh's footstool, and she said, 'Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. –Make a suitable choice, select a young lady for my sake; for your own sake, she should be lively, useful, not overly pampered, but able to manage a small income. That is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as possible, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit.' Meanwhile, my dear cousin, allow me to mention that I do not consider the privilege of being able to present you with Lady Catherine de Bourgh's interest and kindness as the least of my advantages. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; your intelligence and liveliness, I believe, will be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the awe her rank will inspire. That is enough explanation for my intention to consider marriage; now it remains to explain why my thoughts have directed me to Longbourn instead of my own neighborhood; believe me, there are many beautiful young women in my own neighborhood. But the truth is, after the death of your esteemed father (may he live long), this estate will pass to me, and I would not feel at ease unless I chose one of his daughters as my wife to lessen the loss they would suffer, which I repeat, may it be long delayed. That was my reason, dear cousin; I believe this will not lower me in your eyes. Now it only remains to convince you of the intensity of my feelings in the most colorful language. I have no concern about a dowry; I will not make such a demand from your father, as I am aware it is impossible to meet; the only thing you may have a right to is that thousand-pound bond at 4 percent interest, which will not come to you until after your mother's death. I will not say a word about this; and rest assured, when we are married, not a single ungenerous complaint will ever escape my lips.""",24.738,24.581,"––The reasons I have for marrying are: first, that the obligation of a clergyman in favorable circumstances like mine is to set an example of marriage in his parish; second, that I am convinced that it will contribute greatly to my happiness; and third, something that perhaps I should have mentioned first, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the most noble lady whom I have the honor to call my patroness. Twice she has deigned to suggest it to me, even without my hinting at it, and on the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford and during our game of quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was adjusting Miss de Bourgh's chair, she said to me: ""Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must be married. Choose well, choose thinking of me and yourself; make sure she is an active and useful person, not highly educated, but capable of making the most of small incomes. This is my advice. Find that woman as soon as possible, bring her to Hunsford, and let me see her."" Allow me, by the way, to say, fair cousin, that I do not consider as the least of the advantages I can offer you, the acquaintance and enjoyment of the kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Her manners will seem to you far above anything I can describe, and your liveliness and wit will seem very acceptable to her, especially when moderated by the discretion and respect that her high rank inevitably imposes. This is all regarding my general intentions in favor of marriage; I have nothing more to say except the reason why I have directed myself directly to Longbourn instead of seeking in my own locality, where, I assure you, there are many charming young ladies. But it is the case that being as I am the heir of Longbourn upon the death of your honorable father, whom I hope will live many years, I would not be satisfied if I did not choose a wife from among his daughters, to mitigate as much as possible the loss they will suffer upon the occurrence of such a sad event which, as I have already told you, I wish will not happen for many years. This has been the reason, fair cousin, and I hope it will not lower me in your esteem. And now I have only to express to you, in the most emphatic words, the strength of my affection. As for your dowry, it is absolutely indifferent to me, and I will not ask your father for anything that I know he cannot fulfill; so you will only have to bring the thousand pounds at four percent that will come to you upon your mother's death. But I will not be demanding and you can be assured that no interested reproach will come from my lips once we are married.",29.541,29.396

I am concerned that my manner might be unpleasant when I accept your daughter's refusal instead of yours. But we all can make mistakes. Surely, I have had good intentions throughout this matter.

It is not because I doubted the happiness I would feel if my beautiful cousin had granted me the honor of taking my hand; I have often observed that resignation takes on a marvelous quality when the beauty we are deprived of begins to lose its value in our eyes. I hope you do not think I have disrespected your family by withdrawing my claims regarding your daughter without showing the courtesy of asking you and Mr. Bennet to use your influence in my favor. I fear it may not be pleasant that I accepted the rejection from your daughter rather than from you. But we can all make mistakes. Throughout the whole matter, I was certainly very well-intentioned. My aim was to find a compassionate life partner for myself while also ensuring the benefit of your entire family; if I have behaved inappropriately, I apologize to you.""",11.677,11.104,"––My dear madam ––he replied––, not another word on this matter. I am very far ––he continued with an accent that denoted his indignation–– from harboring any resentment towards your daughter's attitude. It is everyone's duty to resign themselves to inevitable misfortunes; and it is especially a duty for me, who has had the fortune of seeing myself so young in such an elevated position; I trust I will know how to resign myself. It may be that my beautiful cousin, by not wanting to honor me with her hand, has not diminished my positive happiness. I have often observed that resignation is never as perfect as when the denied happiness begins to lose some value in our estimation. I hope you do not suppose that I am disrespecting your family, my dear madam, by withdrawing my plans regarding your daughter without asking you and Mr. Bennet to interpose your authority on my behalf. I fear that my conduct, by accepting my rejection from your daughter's lips and not from yours, may be censurable. But we are all capable of making mistakes. I am sure I have acted with the best intention in this matter. My objective was to procure myself a kind companion with due consideration to the advantages this would bring to your entire family. If my conduct has been reproachable, I beg you to forgive me.",16.811,16.362

But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”","- Actually, Jane, you should trust me. No one who has ever seen the two of you together would doubt his feelings for you. I'm sure Miss Bingley doesn't either. She's not foolish. If she could recognize that Mr. Darcy loved her even half as much, she would have already ordered her wedding dress. But here's the issue. We are neither wealthy nor have any status for them to look forward to; while her sister keeps trying to pair Miss Darcy with him, with the idea that once there is a marriage between the two families, she could easily secure a second marriage. This calculation is quite clever; I'm sure it could succeed if not for Lady De Bourgh's interference. But, dear Jane, you shouldn't seriously imagine that just because Miss Bingley tells you he admires Miss Darcy, he will think less of you than he did when he left on Tuesday, or that she has the ability to persuade him to love her friend instead of you.",16.93,16.377,"""Truly, Jane, you must believe me. –No one who has seen you together can doubt his affection. I am sure Miss Bingley cannot doubt it either. She cannot be that foolish. If she could see that Mr. Darcy was half as in love with her, she would have ordered her wedding dress by now. But the situation is this: –We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; she wants to marry Miss Darcy to her brother because she thinks that once there is one marriage, achieving a second one will be easier, which she may be partly right about, and she might even succeed if it weren't for the obstacle of Miss de Bourgh. But, dear Jane, just because Miss Bingley told you that her brother admires Miss Darcy very much, you cannot believe that Mr. Bingley values your superiority any less than he did at your parting on Tuesday, or that her influence could make him fall in love with her friend instead of you.""",23.445,22.983,"––That's right, Jane; you must believe me.

If Miss Bingley is so eager to marry Miss Darcy to her brother, it's because it would make it easier for her to marry Darcy himself; which seems a bit naive on her part. But I would dare to believe that she would achieve her desires if Miss de Bourgh were not in the way. However, you can't seriously think that just because Miss Bingley tells you that her brother likes Miss Darcy, he is less in love with you than he was on Thursday when he said goodbye; nor that it is possible for his sister to convince him to love Miss Darcy instead of you.",18.606,18.106

812,"Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s assertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference; whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.","Elizabeth listened to this in silent disdain. Her mind was torn between worry for her sister and resentment towards everyone else. She did not believe Caroline's words about her brother falling for Miss Darcy. She did not doubt that he genuinely admired Jane. Although she always liked him, she could not help but feel a mix of anger and slight contempt for such an easy-going nature, for the lack of decisiveness that made him a slave to his scheming relatives, causing him to sacrifice his own happiness to please them. However, if his happiness was the only sacrifice, he could be allowed to be generous in the way he thought best; but since this involved her sister, she thought he ought to have been more sensitive. This was what troubled her; she could think of nothing else. Yet whether his feelings had faded or were suppressed by the interference of others, whether he could understand that Jane loved him or he did not recognize this affection, in any case—though her opinion of him varied accordingly, her sister's situation remained the same, her own peace was equally disturbed.",16.75,16.398,"Jane summarized the letter to Elizabeth shortly after; Elizabeth listened to it in silent fury. Her heart was divided between the concern she felt for her sister and the anger she felt towards the others. She did not believe Caroline's claim that her brother was interested in Miss Darcy. She still did not doubt that Jane genuinely felt close to her; although she had always been inclined to like Mr. Bingley, she could not think of the weakness, that indecisiveness that made him a slave to his meddlesome friends and caused him to sacrifice his own happiness to their spoiled preferences, without feeling anger, even hatred. Moreover, if only his own happiness were being sacrificed, no one could object to him doing as he pleased, but her sister's happiness was also at stake, and he needed to consider that. In short, the matter was not something that could be resolved by thinking. Elizabeth could think of nothing else; had Bingley's interest truly waned, or was it suppressed by his friends' interference, was he aware of Jane's attachment or had it escaped his notice; whatever the answer, although her opinion of Bingley would change significantly depending on the answer, her sister's situation remained the same, and her own peace of mind was equally damaged.",16.529,16.115,"Elizabeth, to whom Jane immediately communicated the most important parts of the news, listened in silence and with great indignation.

If he were only sacrificing his own happiness, he could play with it as he pleased; but it also involved Jane's happiness, and she thought he should take that into account. In the end, it was one of those things that it is useless to break one's head over. Elizabeth could think of nothing else; and whether Bingley's interest had truly died, or had been hindered by the interference of his friends; whether Bingley was aware of Jane's affection, or it had gone unnoticed by him; in any case, and although Elizabeth's opinion of Bingley might vary depending on the differences, Jane's situation remained the same and her peace had been disturbed.",20.452,20.068

From what she observed, she did not seriously conclude that they were in love, but the obvious interest they showed in each other disturbed her a bit, and before leaving Hertfordshire, she decided to talk to Elizabeth about it and advise her that continuing such a closeness would be unwise.",19.302,18.562,"The Gardiners stayed in Longbourn for a week; and among the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without an engagement. Mrs. Bennet had taken such care to prepare everything so that her brother and sister-in-law would have a good time, that not once could they enjoy a family meal. When the gathering was at home, there were always some officers present among whom Wickham could not be absent. On these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, who was curious about the many praises Elizabeth bestowed upon him, observed the two of them closely. Realizing, from what she saw, that they were not seriously in love; their mutual preference was too evident. She did not feel very at ease, so before leaving Hertfordshire she decided to speak with Elizabeth about the matter, warning her of her imprudence in encouraging that relationship.",26.044,25.507

About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring.","For Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had a way of enjoying pleasures that had nothing to do with his abilities. About ten years ago, before she got married, she had lived for a long time in Derbyshire, Wickham's hometown. Therefore, she and Wickham had mutual friends.

In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might agree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.","Mrs. Gardiner had come to Pemberley and knew very well about old Mr. Darcy's character. Therefore, this was a topic for endless conversation.

I saw that they were waiting for Miss Darcy to have dinner. I hope to meet her. I couldn't stay long because Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were about to go out. I believe it won't be long before I see them here again.”",15.579,14.425,"After the visit, he wrote again; he had seen Miss Bingley. ""I found Caroline unwell,"" he wrote, ""but she was very happy to see me; she was upset that I hadn't informed her of my arrival in London. So I was right; my last letter did not reach her. Of course, I asked about her siblings. They are well, but she is so occupied with Mr. Darcy that they rarely see her. I learned that Miss Darcy is expected for dinner. I wish I could see her. I couldn't stay long; Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were about to go out. I think I will see them here soon.""",26.233,25.525,"After the mentioned visit, in which she saw Miss Bingley, Jane wrote again: ""Caroline was not in a good mood, but she was very happy to see me and reproached me for not notifying her of my arrival in London. Therefore, I was right: she had not received my letter. Naturally, I asked her about her brother. She told me he was well, but that he is so busy with Mr. Darcy that she barely sees him. They were expecting Miss Darcy for lunch by chance; I would like to see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst had to go out. I suppose they will come to see me soon.""",26.558,25.91

888,"Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt:—","Four weeks passed, Jane did not see him at all. She told herself she had nothing to be upset about regarding this, but she couldn't help but notice Miss Bingley's indifference. After expecting every morning for two weeks, and every evening thinking of all sorts of reasons to excuse her friend, she finally came. But the brief visit and, moreover, her friend's changed attitude, made it impossible for Jane to deceive herself any longer. She wrote to Elizabeth about this:",9.228,7.295,"Four weeks passed and Jane did not see Mr. Bingley. She tried to convince herself that she was not upset about this; but she could no longer ignore Miss Bingley's indifference.

889,"“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but, if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming, her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.","“My dear Lizzy, you must be proud of having outshone me in judgment, as I admit I was completely deceived by Miss Bingley. But, my dear, although the event proves you right, do not think me stubborn if I say that my trust in him was as natural as your suspicion. I do not understand her reasons for being so friendly with me, but if similar situations arise, I am sure I will be deceived again. It was only yesterday that Caroline visited me in return, and she had not written a single word to me before that. When she came, it was clear she took no pleasure in the visit. She offered a superficial, solemn apology for not visiting sooner, without expressing any desire to see me again. Her demeanor had changed so completely that when she left, I resolved not to continue the acquaintance. I pity her, though I cannot help but blame her. She was entirely mistaken in targeting me. I can rightly say that all the beginnings of our acquaintance were initiated by her. But I pity her, for she must realize she was wrong, and I am convinced that the reason for this is her concern for her brother. I need not explain further; although we all know there is no need for such anxiety, if she is worried, it easily explains her attitude towards me. Any concern for her brother is natural and endearing, as he deserves such care from his sister. However, she still worried about her fear, because if he still cared about her, he could have met her many days ago. From her sister's words, she was certain that he knew she was currently residing in the city. Yet, from the way she talked, it seemed he truly leaned towards Miss Darcy. She couldn't understand this. If she didn't fear being judged harshly, she could clearly say there was an ambivalent attitude in everything. But she would try to dispel all sorrowful thoughts, only thinking about things that made her happy, about her sister's love, about the kindness of their uncle and aunt. Write to me soon. Miss Bingley mentioned something about him never returning to Netherfield, about giving up the house, but it is not certain. It is better not to mention this matter. I am very glad to know that you are on good terms with our friends at Hunsford. Go visit them, with Sir William and Maria. I believe you will feel comfortable there.",19.637,19.454,"""I am sure, my dear Lizzy, that Miss Bingley will not derive any pleasure from being proven right in her judgments against me when I admit to myself that I was entirely mistaken about her regard for me. But, my dear sister, although events have proven you right, I hope you do not think me stubborn if I continue to say that, considering Miss Bingley's behavior, my confidence was as natural as your doubt. I cannot understand why she wanted to be close to me; but if the same things were to happen again, I am sure I would be deceived once more. Caroline only returned my visit yesterday; during the intervening time, I received neither a note nor a single line from her. When she did come, it was clear she did not enjoy it; she made a light, formal apology for not having called earlier, said nothing about wanting to see me again, and in every way was so changed that I resolved not to continue our acquaintance after she left.

But I pity her, because she must feel she has acted wrongly, and I am sure it is her concern for her brother that is the cause. I need not explain myself further; we know that this concern is entirely unnecessary, but if she is worried, it easily explains her behavior towards me; since she is justly so fond of her brother, any concern on his behalf is natural and reasonable. However, I cannot help being surprised that she should feel such fears now, because if Mr. Bingley cared about me, we would have met a very, very long time ago.

Caroline did not return my visit until yesterday, and in the meantime, I did not receive a single note or line from her.

I feel sorry, although I cannot help but blame her. She was wrong to choose me as a friend. But I can safely say that it was she who took the first step to become close to me. Anyway, I pity her because she must understand that she has behaved very badly, and because I am sure that her concern for her brother was the cause of everything. And although we know that this concern is unnecessary, the fact of feeling it justifies her attitude towards me, and since he fully deserves his sister's adoration, all the anxiety he inspires in her is natural and appreciable. But I cannot help but wonder why she continues to have these fears, for if he had been interested in me, we would have seen each other a long time ago. He knows that I am in the city; I deduce this from something she herself said; and still, it seemed, by her way of speaking, that she needed to convince herself that Bingley is really interested in Miss Darcy.

But I will try to dispel all these painful thoughts and think only of what makes me happy: your affection and the unalterable kindness of our dear uncles. Write to me soon.

892,"Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.","Around this time, Mrs. Gardiner reminded Elizabeth of her promise to interact with that young man, and inquired about the news. Elizabeth had to comply to put her aunt at ease. He no longer paid exclusive attention to her; his attentions were gone, he was fond of someone else. Elizabeth observed carefully so she knew everything, but she could look and write about it without feeling sorrow. Her heart had only slightly fluttered; her vanity was satisfied with the thought that she could have been his only choice, if circumstances had allowed. The fact that he unexpectedly received ten thousand pounds was the most attractive thing about the girl he was pursuing. But Elizabeth, perhaps in this case not as farsighted as Charlotte, did not argue with him about his desire for independence. On the contrary, nothing could be more natural. While guessing that he had to go through some mental struggle to part from her, she was ready to wish him happiness.",22.798,22.333,"Around the same days, Mrs. Gardiner reminded Elizabeth of her promise regarding that gentleman and asked for information; Elizabeth had such information that would please her aunt more than herself.

Elizabeth was perceptive enough to see it all, but she could see and write about it without feeling significant pain. She wasn't very hurt; her pride was satisfied when she believed that she would be his only choice if his financial situation allowed it. The most striking charm of the young lady he was now trying to impress was that she had suddenly come into possession of ten thousand pounds; but perhaps because Elizabeth, who showed more understanding to Wickham than she did to Charlotte, wanted to be free, she did not quarrel with him.

But my feelings are not only cordial towards him, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.”","She explained everything to Mrs. Gardiner, and continued: “Dear aunt, now I am sure that I have never been in love, because if I had truly experienced that pure and noble feeling, I would now detest even his name and wish all sorts of ill upon him. But my feelings towards him are not only kind but also indifferent towards Miss King. I do not hate her at all, and I am willing to acknowledge that she is a good example of a fine young lady. There could not have been any love in this matter. My vigilance has paid off. Although I would certainly become the subject of everyone's attention if I foolishly fell in love with him, I do not regret becoming unimportant. Sometimes one can pay a high price to become important. Kitty and Lydia are more concerned than I am about his distancing himself from me.

Being alert has helped me; if I were madly in love with him, I would certainly be a more interesting person to all my acquaintances, but I can't say that I regret my relative insignificance. Importance can sometimes be bought at a very high price. Kitty and Lydia are much more troubled by this betrayal than I am.

But not only do I still appreciate him, I do not feel any aversion towards Miss King. I do not hate her, I do not want to believe she is a bad girl. This cannot be love. My precautions have been effective; and although my friends would worry much more about me if I were madly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my relative insignificance. Importance is sometimes paid for too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take Wickham's betrayal more to heart than I do.

895,"WITH no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would, moreover, give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as perfect as plan could be.","February and March passed without any events of greater importance at Longbourn, with little variation through visits to Meryton, sometimes muddy, sometimes cold. In March, Elizabeth visited Huntsford. At first, she had no serious intention of going there, but she learned that Charlotte was eagerly awaiting her, and she gradually thought of the trip with joy and more determination. Their absence had made her eager to see Charlotte again and less resentful of Mr. Collins. There was a bit of novelty in the plan, for with such a mother and sisters who could not be close, the family setting inevitably became unpleasant, so a little change of scenery was good for her. The trip could also give her a brief insight into Jane's situation. As the day of departure approached, she would have regretted any delay. However, everything went smoothly, finally arranged according to Charlotte's outline. She would accompany Sir William and his second daughter. They decided to spend the night in London, and thus the plan became perfect.",18.718,18.229,"The months of January and February passed for the Longbourn family without any events of greater significance, or without much color aside from occasional walks to Meryton, sometimes in the mud, sometimes in the cold.

In their absence, her desire to see Charlotte again had increased, and her displeasure towards Mr. Collins had diminished. Life demanded novelty; a home with such a mother and such unbearable sisters could not be considered perfect; a small change, even for her own sake, would not be bad at all. Moreover, the journey would give her the opportunity to see Jane; in short, as the time approached, she began to worry that there might be a delay or something.

But she saw that Charlotte took it for granted, and little by little she became pleasantly accustomed to the idea until she decided to go. With the absence, her desire to see Charlotte had increased and her aversion to Collins had diminished. The project involved a certain novelty, and since with such a mother and such unbearable sisters, her home was not a very pleasant place, she could not disregard this change of scenery. The trip also provided her with the pleasure of going to give Jane a hug; so much so that when the date approached, she would have regretted having to postpone it.

When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.

Instead, she looked at her friend and wondered about such cheerfulness, with such a husband. When Mr. Collins said something that might embarrass his wife, she involuntarily turned to look at Charlotte. A couple of times she could detect a faint blush, but usually, Charlotte wisely ignored it as if she hadn't heard. After everyone had had time to admire the furnishings in the room, recount their journey and the events in London, Mr. Collins invited everyone to take a walk in the garden, which was quite large and meticulously arranged, tended by his own hands. Gardening was one of his respectable pleasures, and Elizabeth admired Charlotte's composed expression when her friend spoke about the health benefits of gardening; Elizabeth thought her friend intended to encourage this as much as possible. He led the three companions around, rarely giving them time to express any praise, pointing out every trivial detail, leaving the beauty completely behind. He could count the garden plots on every side and tell how many trees were in the farthest grove. But for all the beauty that his garden, or the entire region, or even the entire kingdom, could boast, nothing compared to the view of the Rosings estate, seen through a gap in the foliage surrounding the garden near the front of the Parsonage.

Whenever Mr. Collins said something that his wife might be embarrassed by, which was evidently not infrequent, Elizabeth couldn't help but fix her eyes on Charlotte. Once or twice she thought she detected a slight blush; but Charlotte was wise, mostly pretending not to hear. After sitting long enough to admire every piece of furniture in the room, from the display cabinet to the fireplace grate, and to recount their travels and what had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them for a walk in the garden; the garden was large, well-arranged, and he personally took care of its maintenance. Working in his garden was one of his most esteemed pleasures; Elizabeth admired Charlotte's ability to control her facial expressions while she spoke about the benefits of exercise and her great encouragement in this matter. Falling ahead of them on every path, without giving them a second to utter the praises he expected, he pointed out the details of the scenery with a speed that made them forget every beauty. He could count the fields in every direction and tell how many trees were in the most distant grove. But among all the landscapes that his garden, or the country, or the kingdom could boast of, Rosings was incomparable, as seen through the clearing among the trees surrounding the grove facing the front of his house.

When Collins said something that must have embarrassed his wife, which happened quite often, Elizabeth involuntarily turned her eyes towards Charlotte. Once or twice she could see that Charlotte blushed slightly; but, for the most part, Charlotte pretended not to hear him. After sitting for a while, long enough to admire each and every piece of furniture, from the sideboard to the fireplace grate, and to recount the journey and everything that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a walk in the garden, which was large and well laid out and which he personally took care of. Working in the garden was one of his most respected pleasures; Elizabeth admired the seriousness with which Charlotte spoke of how healthy it was for Collins and confessed that she herself encouraged him to do it whenever possible. Guiding them through all the paths and corners and barely giving them time to express the praises he demanded, he pointed out all the views with a meticulousness that far exceeded their beauty. He enumerated the fields that could be seen in all directions and said how many trees were in each one. But of all the views that his garden, or the countryside, or the entire kingdom could boast of, there was none that could compare to that of Rosings, which was revealed through a clearing in the trees that bordered the estate on the side opposite to the front of his house. The mansion was pretty, modern, and very well situated, on an elevation of the land.",29.899,29.674

It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.","From his garden, Mr. Collins wanted to take them to his two meadows, but the women were not wearing suitable shoes, so they turned back. While Sir William followed him, Charlotte led her sister and friend back, perhaps very happy to have the opportunity to introduce the residence without needing her husband's accompaniment. The residence was quite small, but it was built in a complete and convenient manner. Everything was arranged and equipped in an orderly and consistent way that Elizabeth attributed to Charlotte's efforts.

It was a small house, but well-built and functional; everything was matched with a care and harmony that Elizabeth attributed to Charlotte.

It was small but well laid out, everything was arranged with order and cleanliness, a merit that Elizabeth attributed to Charlotte. When one could forget Collins, the house had a more pleasant atmosphere; and from her friend's evident satisfaction, Elizabeth thought she should forget him more often.",9.186,7.402

952,"In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.","Although present at St. James's Palace, Sir William still felt completely awed by the magnificent surroundings, to the point where he only had the courage to bow very low and then sit down without being able to say a word. His daughter, terrified to the extent of almost losing all her senses, sat on the edge of her seat, not knowing which way to turn. Elizabeth felt herself quite at ease with the setting, able to calmly observe the three women in front of her. Lady Catherine was tall and large, with strong features that might have once been beautiful. Her manner and gestures of greeting did not aim to win affection, such as helping the guests forget their lower status. When silent, she did not seem terrifying, but every word she spoke carried an authoritative tone as if to assert her position. She immediately reminded Elizabeth of Mr. Wickham, and from what she had observed, Elizabeth believed she was exactly the type of person he had described.",18.052,17.425,"Although he had previously been to St. James, Sir William was so astonished by the surrounding splendor that he could only muster the courage to bow deeply and sit down without uttering a word; his daughter, almost fainting from fear, sat on the edge of her seat, not knowing where to look.

Lady Catherine was a very tall and stout woman, with extremely pronounced features that must have been beautiful in her youth. She had an air of sufficiency, and her manner of receiving them was not the most appropriate to make her guests forget their inferior rank. When she was silent, she was not at all terrible; but when she spoke, she did so in such an authoritative tone that her importance became overwhelming.

He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed.

Every dish was praised, first through his words, then through Sir William's, who had recovered enough to echo every word his son-in-law said, in a manner that made Elizabeth wonder if Lady Catherine could endure it. But Lady Catherine seemed pleased with the excessive praise, smiling very graciously, especially when there was a dish that was new to them. They did not converse much with each other. Elizabeth was ready to respond whenever spoken to, but she sat between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh – the former only focused on listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter did not say a word throughout the meal.

But Lady Catherine seemed to take pleasure in their excessive admiration and distributed generous smiles, especially when a dish appeared that they seemed not to have tasted before. The company was not very talkative. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever she found a gap, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh – the former was busy listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter did not say a single word to her throughout the meal. Mrs. Jenkinson was mostly occupied with observing how little Miss de Bourgh ate, insisting she try another dish, and fearing she had no appetite.

956,"When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,—","When the women returned to the living room, they did nothing more than listen to Lady Catherine speak. She spoke incessantly until the servants brought out the coffee. She gave her opinion on every subject with a decisive manner as if to demonstrate that she was not accustomed to being contradicted.

Elizabeth noticed that nothing escaped her attention, giving her the opportunity to impose her opinions on others. Between conversations with Mrs. Collins, Lady Catherine asked many questions of Maria and Elizabeth, especially Elizabeth. She knew the least about Elizabeth and remarked to Mrs. Collins that Elizabeth was a gentle and pretty young woman. She asked her many questions, how many sisters she had, if any were about to get married, whether they were beautiful, how educated they were, what kind of carriage her father had, and what her mother's maiden name was.

In the midst of her conversation with Mrs. Collins, she directed various questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to Elizabeth; she did not know her relatives and told Mrs. Collins that she was a very elegant and beautiful girl.

While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.","Sir William stayed in Huntsford for only a week, but it was enough for him to believe that his daughter was settled in the most satisfactory manner, that she had a husband and neighbors that were not easy to find. While Sir William was staying there, Mr. Collins spent every morning driving him out into the countryside. When he left, the whole family returned to their usual routine. Elizabeth was pleased to see that they seldom saw him, for in the time between breakfast and dinner, he was either working in the garden or reading and writing, sitting in his own study at the front of the house looking out the window, while the women's gathering room was at the back of the house. At first, Catherine was puzzled that Charlotte did not want to use the dining room for everyone to gather in, as it was quite spacious and had a better view, but soon she saw that her friend had a very good reason, for if they used the large room, Mr. Collins would seldom be in his own study.",19.101,18.636,"Sir William stayed in Hunsford for only a week, but his visit was long enough to convince him that his daughter had made an extraordinary marriage, and that she had a rare husband and neighbor.

The room where the ladies sat was at the back. Elizabeth was initially surprised that Charlotte had not chosen the dining room for everyday use; it was a larger room and had a more pleasant view; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for doing so, because if they sat in an equally beautiful room, Mr. Collins would undoubtedly spend less time in his own room; Elizabeth appreciated Charlotte for this arrangement.",32.996,32.693,"Sir William spent no more than a week in Hunsford, but it was enough to convince him that his daughter was very well situated and that a husband like that and a neighborhood like that were not often found.

This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.","After Mr. William had left and there was only one card table, each dining opportunity was no longer as enjoyable as the first evening. They had little chance to interact with anyone else, as the lifestyle of the neighbors did not suit the Collins family. This did not bother Elizabeth. During this time, she felt quite comfortable.

They had very few other occupations, as the lifestyle of the neighborhood generally exceeded Mr. Collins' means. Nevertheless, Elizabeth was not bothered by this and mostly spent her time quite pleasantly; there were sweet half-hour conversations with Charlotte, and the weather was so beautiful for that time of year that she often spent cheerful hours outdoors. When the others went to visit Lady Catherine, she often went for a walk; she had a favorite route; there was a sheltered, beautiful path along the open plain adjacent to that side of the grove that seemed to matter to no one else, and here she felt herself in a place where Lady Catherine's curiosity could not reach.",17.815,17.132,"The invitation to dine at Rosings was repeated a couple of times a week, and since Sir William's departure, as there was only one game table during the evening, the entertainment was always the same.

Elizabeth did not mind; she was comfortable with it, spending long periods chatting pleasantly with Charlotte; and since the weather was wonderful, despite the time of year, she amused herself by going out for walks. Her favorite walk, which she often took while the others visited Lady Catherine, was the avenue that bordered one side of the estate where there was a very beautiful and sheltered path that no one but her seemed to appreciate, and on which she was out of Lady Catherine's curious reach.",13.712,12.846

All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former favourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.","But when Elizabeth spoke of his silence, everyone felt it didn't seem to be the case, even Charlotte had a wish.

Inside was Lady Catherine, books, billiards table, but the young men couldn't be confined within four walls forever. Next door was the Parsonage, either the pleasure of walking there or because of the people living there, the two cousins found pleasure in walking there almost every day. The two came at different morning hours, sometimes separately, sometimes together, occasionally with their aunt. Everyone clearly saw that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he enjoyed their company; this thought made them like him even more. Elizabeth felt comfortable near him as well as seeing him like her, seeing him like Mr. George Wickham whom she once admired; and though in comparing the two, she found Colonel Fitzwilliam's gentle manners less captivating, she believed he might have higher knowledge.",20.797,20.41,"When Elizabeth mentioned Miss Darcy's silence, it became clear, despite Charlotte's wishes, that the situation was not quite as she had hoped; after various speculations, they finally assumed that her visit stemmed from the difficulty of finding something to do, which was very possible for that time of year. All outdoor sports had ended. Inside, there were only Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but men cannot stay indoors all the time; soon, the parsonage, or the walk there, or the pleasantness of the people there, enticed the two cousins to walk there almost every day thereafter.

Everyone understood that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he enjoyed their conversation, which made them like him even more; Elizabeth, thinking about the pleasure she took in his company, especially the admiration he showed her, was reminded of her former favorite, George Wickham; comparing the two, she found that Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners had less of a heart-winning softness, but she decided he was better educated.",24.01,23.641,"But when Elizabeth recounted how quiet he had been, it didn't seem very likely, despite Charlotte's good wishes; and after several conjectures, they limited themselves to supposing that his visit had been due to the difficulty of finding something to do, which was very natural at that time of year. All the sports had ended. At Lady Catherine's house, there were books and a billiard table, but the gentlemen were frustrated by always being cooped up indoors, and whether it was because the Collins' residence was so close, or because the walk was pleasant, or because of the people who lived there, the two cousins felt tempted to visit them every day. They would show up at different times in the morning, sometimes separately and other times together, and occasionally accompanied by their aunt. It was evident that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he felt comfortable with them, which naturally made him even more pleasant. The pleasure Elizabeth derived from his company and Fitzwilliam's evident admiration for her made her remember her first favorite, George Wickham. Comparing them, Elizabeth found that the Colonel's manners were less attractive and sweet than Wickham's, but Fitzwilliam seemed to her to be a more cultured man.",22.442,22.04
1061,"But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.","But why Mr. Darcy often went to the Parsonage was more difficult to understand. It was not due to a fondness for socializing, as he would often sit for a full ten minutes without saying a word, and when he did speak, it seemed more out of necessity than spontaneity – a sacrifice to propriety rather than personal inclination. He was rarely lively. Mrs. Collins could not discern his character. Colonel Fitzwilliam sometimes joked about his peculiar manners, suggesting he was different, but Mrs. Collins could not make anything of it. When she wanted to believe that this change was due to love, the object of this love, her friend Eliza, would sit solemnly alone for him to observe. She watched him whenever they visited Rosings and whenever he came to Huntsford, but she could not understand his feelings. It was evident that he often looked at her friend, but the expression in his gaze was unfathomable. It was a serious, intent look; but she often wondered if there was any affection in it, and sometimes she saw nothing but indifference.",25.213,24.765,"It was hard to understand why Mr. Darcy came to the lodge so often. It couldn't be for friendship, because he would come, sit for ten minutes, and leave without opening his mouth; and when he did speak, it seemed out of necessity rather than desire – not for pleasure, but to avoid rudeness. He rarely appeared cheerful. Mrs. Collins didn't know what to make of it. Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasional amusement at his absent-mindedness indicated that he was normally a different person, otherwise, she didn't know Mr. Darcy well enough to decide for herself; she seriously dedicated herself to finding out, because she liked to believe that this change was due to the effect of love, and that the object of his affection was her friend Elizabeth. She observed him every time they went to Rosings or whenever he came to Hunsford, but she didn't achieve much success. He looked at her friend a lot, but the expression of that gaze was debatable. It was a determined, steady gaze, but she wasn't sure if it contained much admiration and sometimes it just seemed like absent-mindedness.",26.388,25.952,"But understanding why Darcy came to the house so often was more difficult. It couldn't be to seek company, as he would sit for ten minutes without opening his mouth, and when he spoke, it seemed more out of obligation than pleasure, as if it were a sacrifice rather than a delight. He was rarely truly animated. Mrs. Collins didn't know what to think of him. Since Colonel Fitzwilliam sometimes laughed at Darcy's foolishness, Charlotte understood that he must not always be like that, something her limited acquaintance with the gentleman would not have allowed her to guess; and as she wished to believe that this change was the work of love and that the object of that love was Elizabeth, she set out to discover it. When they were at Rosings and whenever Darcy came to her house, Charlotte observed him attentively, but she couldn't make anything of it. It was true that he looked at her friend a lot, but the expression of those looks was ambiguous.

1066,"MORE than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions—about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.","A couple of times while wandering in the garden, Elizabeth happened to meet Mr. Darcy. She felt that unfortunate irony had led him to a place where no one else bothered to go. To prevent this from happening again, she informed him in advance that this path was her favorite. How this happened a second time was truly strange! Nevertheless, it happened, and it happened a third time. It seemed like a deliberate bad habit, or a voluntary act of remorse, because on these occasions, it wasn't just a few customary greetings and a moment of awkwardness before moving on, but rather he turned back to walk with her. He never said much, and she didn't bother to talk or listen much either, but she noticed during the third walk that he asked strange questions, unrelated to the conversation – about her impressions of staying at Huntsford, her thoughts on walking alone, her opinion on the happiness of Mr. and Mrs. Collins. When talking about Rosings, her lack of understanding about this residence, it seemed he intended that whenever she came to Kent, she would also stay there. His words carried this implication. Could he be thinking of Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She guessed, if he had any intention, he must be hinting at the possibility of it happening that way.

It was actually no different from a deliberate mischief or a voluntary ordeal, because in these situations, it wasn't just about asking a few formal questions, awkwardly hesitating, and then leaving; on the contrary, Mr. Darcy found it really necessary to turn back and walk with her. He didn't talk much; Elizabeth also didn't bother to talk or listen to him much; but during their third encounter, she was intrigued by some odd, unrelated questions he asked –whether she liked being in Hunsford, her solitary walks, her views on Mr. and Mrs. Collins' happiness; then, when Elizabeth mentioned Rosings and that she didn't know the house well, Mr. Darcy spoke as if he hoped she would stay there during her next visit to Kent.

The first time, she was not at all pleased that bad luck had brought him precisely to a place where no one else usually went, and to prevent it from happening again, she was careful to indicate that it was her favorite spot. Consequently, it was rare for the encounter to happen again, and yet, it occurred even a third time. It seemed as if he did it with intentional malice or as a penance, because it wasn't just limited to the usual questions or a simple and annoying stop; Darcy would turn back and walk with her. He never talked much nor bothered her by making her talk or listen too much. But at the third encounter, Elizabeth was astonished by the oddity of the questions he asked: if she liked being in Hunsford, if she enjoyed solitary walks, and what her opinion was of the happiness of the Collins' marriage; but the strangest thing was that when talking about Rosings and her limited knowledge of the house, it seemed that he assumed that, upon returning to Kent, Elizabeth would also reside there.

She is everything that is lovely and gentle! She has excellent understanding, an open mind, and graceful manners that captivate people. There is also nothing to criticize about her father, because although he is a bit eccentric, he has qualities that Mr. Darcy cannot disdain, and a respectable position that he cannot attain. When she thought of the mother, she felt a bit less confident, but she did not think any opposition here would carry weight with Mr. Darcy.

Thinking of her mother, of course, shook her confidence a little, but she did not believe that even the objections at that point would have a significant effect on Mr. Darcy; it seemed to Elizabeth that Mr. Darcy's pride had been most deeply wounded by the insignificance of his friend's relatives, not their impropriety; in the end, she concluded that he acted out of this worst kind of pride on one hand, and on the other hand, the desire to keep Mr. Bingley for his own sister.",12.903,12.051,"“Against Jane,” thought Elizabeth, “there was no possible objection.

1108,"WHEN they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.","When they had gone, as if wanting to vent her anger on Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth took out and reviewed all the letters Jane had sent her since she went to visit in Kent. The letters contained no complaints, no recounting of past events or current suffering. But she noticed that every letter, and almost every line, was less cheerful, whereas her sister's writing was usually cheerful and truly calm, making it hard to disguise this change in tone. Elizabeth noticed that every phrase carried a sense of discomfort, which would not be noticed upon a first, cursory reading. Mr. Darcy's shameful boast about how he could inflict harm helped her clearly feel her sister's suffering. She found some comfort in thinking that his visit to Rosings would end in two days. A greater comfort was that within two weeks she would see Jane again, when she could help her sister recover her spirits with all the love she could muster.",9.197,8.376,"When they left, Elizabeth, as if wanting to make herself even angrier with Mr. Darcy, began to examine all the letters Jane had written to her since she came to Kent. There was no specific complaint in the letters; past events were not remembered, nor was there any mention of present suffering. But in all of them, and in almost every line of them, there was a lack of that cheerfulness which had so far hardly ever been dimmed, coming from the tranquility of a spirit at peace with itself and kind to everyone, which was a typical feature of her style. When Elizabeth read them more carefully than she had the first time, she noticed that every sentence carried a sense of discomfort. Mr. Darcy's arrogant boasting about the sorrow he had caused made her feel her sister's pains more acutely. The thought that Mr. Darcy's visit to Rosings would end the next day gave her some relief; the thought that in less than fifteen days she would be with Jane again, and with all her love would help restore her cheerfulness, gave her even more comfort.",23.418,23.004,"When everyone had left, Elizabeth, as if she intended to further exasperate herself against Darcy, set about reviewing all the letters she had received from Jane since she had been in Kent. They contained no lamentations nor anything that indicated she remembered the past or that she suffered because of it; but overall, and almost in every line, there was a lack of the joy that used to characterize Jane's style, a joy that, as was natural in such a calm and affectionate character, had almost never been eclipsed. Elizabeth focused on all the phrases revealing unease, with an attention she had not given them in the first reading. Darcy's shameful boast about the harm he had caused made her feel her sister's suffering more keenly. It consoled her a little to think that in two days she would be back by Jane's side and could help her regain her spirits with the care that only affection can provide.",11.304,10.719

But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.

1137,"And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.","He hurriedly stepped out of the room, and in a moment, Elizabeth heard him open the door and go outside. Her mind was now in turmoil and intense pain. She did not know how to pull herself together; in her weakness, she sat down and cried for half an hour. The more she thought back on each past event, the more astonished she became. She had heard a proposal from Mr. Darcy! He had loved her for many months! He had loved her so passionately that he wanted to marry her despite all the opposition that had led him to prevent his friend from marrying her sister! And the opposition was just as strong in his own case. It was almost unbelievable! It was exhilarating to have unconsciously sparked such a passionate love. But his pride – his despicable pride, his shameless admission of how he treated Jane – his unforgivable confidence even if he could not justify it, and his indifference when he mentioned Mr. Wickham – his cruel actions towards him which he did not bother to deny, all exceeded her compassion when she thought of his feelings.",20.986,20.548,"And with these words, he hurriedly left the room; shortly after, Elizabeth heard him open the front door and leave the house.

To receive a marriage proposal from Mr. Darcy! for him to be in love with her for so many months! for him to want to marry her despite all the obstacles that led him to prevent his friend from marrying her sister, obstacles that were equally valid for his own situation, it was unbelievable! To have unknowingly inspired such a strong love was an honor. But Darcy's pride, that disgusting pride, his shameless confession of what he did regarding Jane, his unforgivable arrogance in accepting it even though he couldn't justify himself, and his callous demeanor when speaking of Mr. Wickham, the cruelty he did not deny towards him, soon destroyed the feeling of pity that thinking about his love had momentarily created.",22.767,22.359,"Having said this, he hurriedly left the room, and Elizabeth immediately heard him open the front door and leave the house.

Having received a marriage proposal from Darcy, who had been in love with her for so many months, and so in love that he wanted to marry her despite all the objections that had led him to prevent his friend from marrying Jane, and which should have applied equally in his own case, was incredible. She was pleased to have inspired such a vehement affection. But the pride, his abominable pride, his shameless confession of what he had done to Jane, his unforgivable brazenness in admitting it without even trying to excuse himself, and the insensitivity with which he had spoken of Wickham despite not denying his cruelty towards him, soon prevailed over the compassion she had felt when thinking about his love.",26.134,25.775

1142,"After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.","After having walked two or three times along this section of the trail, the pleasant morning weather made her stop in front of the gates and linger in the garden. The five weeks she had spent in Kent had changed the scenery significantly, with the trees becoming greener each day. She was about to continue walking when she caught a glimpse of a young man in the bushes along the edge of the garden; he was walking towards her. Fearing it was Mr. Darcy, she turned back. But the man had come close enough to recognize her, quickly approached, and called her name. She had turned away, but upon hearing her name, even in Mr. Darcy's voice, she turned back towards the gate. At that moment, he also reached the gate, handed her a letter which she reflexively accepted, and spoke with an arrogant demeanor: - I took a walk through some bushes hoping to meet you. Could you do me the honor of reading this letter?

As he was about to continue his walk, he caught sight of a man in the wooded area along the edge of the grove; the man was coming towards him; fearing it might be Mr. Darcy, he immediately turned back. But the approaching man was now close enough to see him and excitedly rushed forward, calling out his name. Elizabeth had turned the other way, but upon hearing herself being called, she continued walking towards the door, even though she recognized Mr. Darcy's voice. Mr. Darcy caught up with her at the door and handed her a letter, and as Elizabeth instinctively took the letter, he said with a haughty solemnity, ""I was walking in the grove hoping to meet you. Would you be so kind as to read this letter?"" –Then he bowed slightly, turned, disappeared among the trees, and was out of sight.",14.987,14.423,"After walking up and down that part of the road two or three times, he felt the temptation, given how delightful the morning was, to stop at the gates and gaze at the estate.

He was about to continue his walk when he glimpsed a gentleman in the avenue bordering the estate; the gentleman was walking towards her, and Elizabeth, fearing it was Darcy, instantly retreated. But the person advancing was already close enough to see her; he continued walking quickly and called her name. She had turned, but upon hearing that voice in which she recognized Darcy, she continued towards the gate.

It was dated from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:—","Not expecting any joy but with the greatest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and with increasing bewilderment, she found that the envelope contained two sheets of densely written paper.

1145,"“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,—and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. If you have not been mistaken here, I must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father:—pardon me,—it pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly went—and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them earnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal, regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.—With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question—of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances—and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.","""Last night you accused me of two charges of entirely different nature and unequal magnitude. The first charge is that, regardless of the feelings of each party, I separated Mr. Bingley from your sister; the other charge is that I ruined Mr. Wickham's immediate prosperity and shattered all his prospects, in defiance of all appeals, in defiance of honor and humanity. Deliberately and obstinately denying the friend of my youth, whom my father loved, a young man who had no other refuge than our patronage, who was raised to fend for himself. This is an unparalleled vile act, separating two young men whose affection could blossom in just a few weeks. “But from the severe condemnation declared so liberally last evening, for each case, I hope in the future you will believe me, if you read through the explanations below about my behavior and motivations. If while explaining, I mention feelings that might upset you, I can only ask for your forgiveness. But I need to mention them, and if further apologies are unreasonable. “When I first came to reside at Netherfield, like everyone else, I noticed that Mr. Bingley had more affection for your eldest sister than for any other young woman in the area. But it was only at the Netherfield ball that I realized the seriousness of his feelings. I have often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honor of dancing with you, for the first time through Sir William Lucas, I learned that Mr. Bingley's attentions to your sister had raised hopes of a marriage between the two. He spoke of it as if it were a certainty, with only the date and time yet to be determined. “From that moment, I paid close attention to my friend's behavior, and noticed that Bingley's feelings towards your sister exceeded anything I had ever witnessed in him. I also observed your sister. Her demeanor and gestures remained open, cheerful, and graceful as always, but there was no particular sign of affection, and after a thorough examination that evening, I believed that although she was happy to be noticed by him, she did not invite his attention by revealing any sentiments. If you are not mistaken here, I could be mistaken. You understand her better than I do, so I could be mistaken. If that is the case, if I am mistaken, and it causes her distress, you have every right to be angry. But I do not hesitate to assert that, regardless of how amiable her disposition may be, her feelings are not easily swayed, judging by the calmness in her expression and demeanor that a sensitive observer can detect. I sincerely want to believe that she is indifferent, but I must boldly add that my hopes or fears do not usually influence my understanding and decisions. It is not that I believe she is indifferent because I wish it so. I believe this based on impartial observation; as truly as if I had reason to wish otherwise. I oppose the marriage not merely for the sake of opposition, and last night I realized that it would take the strongest emotions to set aside these objections, in my case; if lacking, the relationship would not be bad for him but very bad for me. “But the aversion has other causes that I myself want to forget because they are not apparent to me, although they still exist, and exist to the same degree in both Mr. Bingley's and my cases. I need to briefly mention these causes, though succinctly. Your family's circumstances, although uncomfortable, are insignificant compared to the material desires often manifested through your mother, your three younger sisters, and sometimes even your father. I apologize to you, I feel pained if I offend you. But when you and your sister show hesitation about the shortcomings of your relatives and displeasure at the manifestation of these shortcomings, please take comfort in knowing that your attitudes have avoided the criticism that others have faced, and have even earned you much praise, as well as making both your awareness and temperament worthy of respect. “I can only add that, from what happened that evening, my opinion of everyone was determined, and I was further compelled to act to protect my friend from an unhappy marriage. As you may recall, I am sure, the next day he left Netherfield for London with the intention of returning soon. Now I will explain my actions. Both his sister and I were concerned, and soon we both realized this coincidence, both of us were aware that no time should be wasted in separating him, so we decided to go to London with him. There, I tried my best to point out to my friend the disadvantages of such a choice. I tried to persuade him earnestly. But even if this reproach might have caused him to hesitate or delay his decision, I do not believe it would have prevented the marriage, if not for your sister's indifferent attitude. Previously, he believed that she would reciprocate his feelings with sincere interest, if not equally. But Bingley is inherently shy, and he relied on my judgment more than his own. Therefore, convincing him that he had deceived himself was easy. Once I had made him believe it, urging him not to return to Hertfordshire was not difficult. “I cannot blame myself for having acted to such an extent. In the entire matter, there is only one action of mine that I am dissatisfied with when I recall it, and that is that I lowered myself to use the art of concealing from you the fact that your sister was in town at that time. I knew this information, Miss Bingley knew it too, but Mr. Bingley did not know at all. It is possible that the two might meet without any harmful consequences, but I deemed that his feelings had not yet been entirely extinguished, so there was still a disadvantage in their meeting. Perhaps this concealment and disguise went against my nature. However, I did it, and did it in the hope of achieving the best outcome. On this matter, I have nothing more to say, no further apologies to offer. If I have caused your sister any pain, it was beyond my intention; and although the motives that guided me may not seem sufficient justification to you, I do not know how to condemn these motives. “Regarding the heavier accusation, that I have harmed Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by explaining to you all the relations he has had with my family. He particularly accuses me of ignorance, but according to the truth I will present, I can call upon witnesses whose honesty is beyond dispute. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who for many years managed all the estates at Pemberley, and due to his virtue in his work, he was highly trusted, so naturally my father helped him. As for George Wickham, my father was very kind to him, as he was practically his adopted son. My father supported his education up to Cambridge University. This support was even more important because his father was poor due to his wife's extravagant lifestyle and could not afford to educate him properly. My father not only cherished his always engaging company but also held him in high regard, hoping he would have a career in the church, so he intended to support him in this direction. As for me, it was only after many, many years that I began to think of him differently. The lowly talents and lack of principles that he carefully concealed from his closest friend could not escape the observation of someone nearly his age, who had opportunities to see him in unguarded moments. Here, once again, I am causing you pain, to what extent only you can know. But whatever feelings Mr. Wickham has stirred in you, the doubt about the nature of these feelings cannot prevent me from exposing his true character. “I have another motivation as well. My father passed away about five years ago, and his affection for him remained so steadfast that in his will, which he specifically conveyed to me, it was stated that he would support the advancement that his profession allowed, and if he took holy orders, he would be given a substantial allowance from the family. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His father passed away shortly after mine, within a year, and Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that he had finally decided not to take holy orders, and he hoped I could consider providing him with financial assistance immediately rather than waiting until he was appointed. He added that he intended to study law, and I had to admit that one thousand pounds would not be sufficient for him. I wished, rather than believed, that he was sincere. But in any case, I was willing to comply with his request. I knew that Mr. Wickham should not become a clergyman. Therefore, the matter was settled shortly thereafter. He declared that he would renounce any future claims to church support that he might be entitled to, and instead, he received three thousand pounds. All relations between us now seem to be dissolved. I thought so little of him that I did not want to invite him to Pemberley, nor associate with him in the city. I believe he lives mainly in the city, but studying law was just an excuse, and now free from all restraints, he lives idly and extravagantly. ""For about three years, I heard little news about him, but when the allowance he received ran out, he wrote to me asking for more. He persuaded me, and I had no difficulty believing him that he was in need. He found studying law to be unprofitable; now he was determined to be ordained, if I would transfer the remaining part of the allowance to him. He believed he was entitled to this because he knew I did not need to support anyone else, and I surely could not forget my grandfather's intentions. You cannot blame me for refusing his plea, or for rejecting all subsequent repeated requests. His resentment was as intense as his material deprivation, and surely he spoke ill of me to others as fiercely as he reproached me. “After this period, all outward appearances of the relationship between the two of us were discarded. I do not know how he managed to live. But last summer, he again forced me to pay painful attention to him. Now I must mention an event that I myself wish to forget, only because I am now compelled to reveal it. In such a lengthy manner, I think I can trust you to keep this matter confidential. My sister Georgiana, who is more than ten years younger than I, was entrusted to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she left school, a residence was established for her in London, and she, along with the manager of this residence, went to Ramsgate, from where she sought out Mr. Wickham. Surely this was premeditated, as he and Mrs. Younge had known each other previously. She deceived us sadly; through her collusion and assistance, he courted Georgiana. My sister's tender heart was strongly impressed by his kindness to a child, to the point that she was persuaded she loved him and agreed to elope with him. At that time, she was only fifteen, so this was an excuse to run away, and after mentioning her imprudence, I am pleased to add that I learned of this through her. I met the two of them one or two days before they planned to elope. Georgiana, not wanting to cause her brother, whom she also viewed as a father, distress and offense, confessed everything to me. You can imagine what I thought and how I acted. For the sake of my sister's dignity and feelings, I kept the matter confidential, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, and of course, Mrs. Younge was dismissed. Surely Mr. Wickham's aim was my sister's fortune, about thirty thousand pounds, but I cannot help but guess that a desire for revenge against me was also a strong motivating factor. Indeed, his revenge could have been complete. ""Miss, I have recounted every event truthfully that pertains to both of us. If you do not dismiss the story as falsehood, I hope you will retract your accusation of my cruel treatment towards Mr. Wickham. I am not sure how he has influenced you, with what deceitful words, but it is likely that he has succeeded. Previously, you knew nothing of these matters, you had no means to investigate, and certainly, you had no inclination to doubt. You may wonder why I did not recount all these events last night. But at that time, I could not maintain the composure to know what could or should be said. Regarding the truth behind what I have recounted here, I can call upon Colonel Fitzwilliam as a witness. As he is closely related and lives in proximity to us, still being an executor of my father's will, he could not help but be well aware of all the details. If you despise me so bitterly that all my explanations are worthless, you can still confide in my cousin, and since you may have the opportunity to seek his opinion, I have endeavored to find a chance to deliver this letter to you this morning. “I only have one more thing to say: may God bless you.”",20.373,20.331,"""Last night, you accused me of two evils of very different natures and varying degrees of importance. The first was that I separated Mr. Bingley from your sister without regard for either of their feelings, and the second was that I hindered Mr. Wickham's prosperity and darkened his future by rejecting various claims, disregarding honor and humanity. –To deliberately and irresponsibly cast aside a childhood friend, known to be my father's favorite, who had no means of subsistence outside our protection and was raised to expect to benefit from our patronage, would have been a deprivation incomparable to the separation of children with only a few weeks of shared feelings. –But when the following explanation of my actions and reasons is read, I hope to be spared from the severity of the accusations so unreservedly directed at me last night in both matters. –If I feel compelled to explain emotions that may seem repulsive to you while doing so, I can only apologize for it. –I must comply with this obligation –to apologize further would be absurd. –It wasn't long after I arrived in Hertfordshire that I, like others, saw that Bingley preferred your sister over all the other girls in the countryside. But it wasn't until the dance evening at Netherfield that I realized he had serious attachment. –I had seen him in love many times before. –At that ball, while I was dancing with you, a casual remark by Sir William Lucas made me realize for the first time that Bingley's interest in your sister had created expectations of marriage in everyone. Sir William spoke of it as if it were a certain event, with only the date left to be determined. From that moment, I observed my friend's actions carefully; and it was only then that I understood his attachment to Miss Bennet was beyond what I had seen before. I also watched your sister. –Her demeanor was as open, cheerful, and charming as ever, but there were no signs of special interest; from my observations that evening, I concluded that while Miss Bennet accepted Bingley's interest with pleasure, she did not invite it with any shared feelings. –If you are not mistaken on this point, then I was wrong. Your better knowledge of your sister strengthens the second possibility. –If so, if I made a mistake that caused her pain, your resentment would not be unjust. But I will say without hesitation that the seriousness in your sister's face and demeanor was such that even the most careful observer would think she was someone who, while friendly, was not easily accessible to the heart. –It is true that I wanted to believe in her indifference, –but I can say that my investigations and decisions are generally not influenced by my hopes or fears. –I did not believe in your sister's indifference because I wanted it to be so; –I believed it with impartial conviction, and with the same sincerity. –My objections to the marriage were not the matters I confessed last night could be overcome by a great passion on my part; the issue of relatives was not as great an obstacle for my friend as it was for me. –But there were other annoying circumstances; –although they still exist, and even if they exist to the same extent for both of us, they are not constantly in front of me, so I personally try to forget them. –These reasons also need to be briefly mentioned. –The situation of your mother's family, though repulsive, is insignificant compared to the absolute vulgarity almost always displayed by her, your three younger sisters, and even occasionally your father. –Forgive me. –It pains me to offend you. However, despite the discomfort you feel because of the faults of your closest relatives and the displeasure you will feel at their being described in this way, you may find consolation in knowing that the praise of your and your sister's intelligence and sensitivity, which prevents you from sharing in a similar judgment, is frequently expressed as you deserve. –Lastly, I must say that what happened that evening confirmed my views on everyone and strengthened my desire to protect my friend from a connection I found very unpleasant without further delay. –The next day, as you surely know, he went to London from Netherfield, intending to return soon. –Now it's time to explain the role I played. –His sisters' discomfort was no less than mine; we soon realized we shared the same thought; and believing that we should not waste time in separating their brother, we immediately decided to go to London to join him. –We went –there I began to explain to my friend the certain disadvantages of such a choice. –I did not just describe them, I proved them. –This intervention could have accelerated or delayed his decision, but in my opinion, it would not have prevented the marriage in the end if I had not mentioned your sister's indifference, which I did without hesitation. Until then, he believed he had received sincere reciprocation of feelings, if not to the same extent as his own. –But Bingley has a tremendous natural humility; he trusts my judgments more than his own. –It was not difficult to convince him that he was deceiving himself. After giving him this belief, persuading him not to return to Hertfordshire was a moment's work. –I cannot blame myself for what I did. There is one aspect of my behavior in the whole matter that I do not like to remember; that is, I stooped so low as to scheme to keep from him the fact that your sister was in town. I knew, Miss Bingley knew, but her brother still does not know. –It is possible that they could have met without bad consequences; –but it seemed to me that his feelings had not yet faded enough for him to see her safely. –Perhaps these secretive, devious actions did not suit me. –But I did it once, and I did it with good intentions. –I have nothing more to say on this matter, no other excuse to offer. If I hurt your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly; the reasons that guided me may naturally seem insufficient to you, but I have not yet learned to reject them. –As for the more serious accusation, the accusation that I harmed Mr. Wickham, I can refute it by revealing his entire connection with my family. I do not know exactly what he accuses me of; but I can present more than one witness whose reliability is beyond doubt regarding the truth of what I will tell. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man who managed all the Pemberley estates; his father's good conduct in his duties naturally inspired my father with a desire to be beneficial to him, and he showed his affection for his godson George Wickham with all his generosity. My father supported him at school, and later at Cambridge –significantly, because his own father, condemned to poverty by his wife's extravagance, was not in a position to provide him with a gentleman's education. My father not only valued the friendship of this young man, who always had pleasant manners, but also held high hopes for him and decided to provide him with a means of livelihood by hoping he would choose the church as his profession. For my part, I began to think differently about him years, long years ago. He was careful to hide his immoral tendencies and indecency from his closest friend, but these did not escape the notice of a young man almost the same age as him, who had the opportunity to catch him in unguarded moments, unlike Mr. Darcy. Here I will upset you again –only you can know how much. But whatever feelings Mr. Wickham has aroused, my doubts about their nature will not prevent me from revealing his true face. There is another reason. My kind-hearted father died five years ago; his attachment to Mr. Wickham continued until the end; so much so that in his will, he specifically instructed me to assist him in advancing in his profession as much as possible, and if he qualified for the clergy, to give him a valuable family living as soon as it became vacant. There was also a sum of one thousand pounds. His father did not outlive mine by much; six months after these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to me saying he had decided to give up his religious education, and hoped I would not find it inappropriate to expect some financial assistance instead of a church appointment that would be of no use to him. He also added that he intended to study law; he assumed I would understand that the interest on a thousand pounds would not be enough to support him there. Although I did not believe he was sincere, I wished he were; but in any case, I was ready to accept his proposal. I knew Mr. Wickham should not be a clergyman. The matter was quickly settled. He renounced all financial rights he could have received from the church and accepted three thousand pounds in return. Thus, all relations between us seemed to be over. My thoughts about him were so negative that I neither invited him to Pemberley nor allowed him to appear to me in town. I believe he mostly lived in town, but the study of law was merely a lie; once free of all obstacles, his life became one of complete idleness and vagabondage. For three years, I heard little from him; but upon the death of the clergyman intended for him, he again approached me for the letter of appointment. He wanted me to believe he was in very bad condition, which I found easy to believe. He had seen that law was a non-lucrative profession and had now definitely decided to take the clergy, provided I gave him the said living –he had no doubt about it, and besides, who else did I have to look after, and I could not have forgotten my dear father's intention. You cannot blame me for refusing this attempt or resisting its repetition. His resentment was proportional to the harshness of his circumstances –his complaints to others were as intense as the insults he directed at me. After this period, all signs of acquaintance were abandoned. I do not know how he lived. But last summer, he entered my life again in a very painful way. I must now speak of an event I wish I could forget and which no force other than the current matter would compel me to reveal to anyone. I am telling you this because I have no doubt you know how to keep a secret. My sister, who is at least ten years younger than me, was left under the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school and a house was opened for her in London; last summer, she went to Ramsgate with the lady managing the house; Mr. Wickham also went there, undoubtedly with intent; for it turned out he had a prior acquaintance with Mrs. Younge, which we had been quite mistaken about her character; with her arrangement and assistance, he managed to ingratiate himself with Georgiana; my sister, whose sensitive heart had been filled with affectionate memories of him since childhood, was convinced she was in love with him and agreed to elope with him. She was only fifteen at the time; this must be her excuse; after expressing her imprudence, I am also pleased to add that I learned of the matter from her. A few days before the planned elopement, I unexpectedly joined them; at that time, Georgiana could no longer bear the idea of subjecting a brother she saw as a father to such distress and insult, and she told me everything as it was. You can imagine what I felt and how I acted. My concern for my sister's reputation and feelings prevented the matter from becoming public; but my writing to Mr. Wickham and his immediate departure were simultaneous; Mrs. Younge was, of course, dismissed from her position. Mr. Wickham's main goal was undoubtedly my sister's thirty thousand-pound fortune; on the other hand, I cannot help but think that the hope of taking revenge on me was also a strong motivating factor. This, madam, is an honest explanation of every event between us; if you do not reject it as a lie, I hope you will retract the accusation that I have been cruel to Mr. Wickham. I do not know what style or lies he used to influence you; but perhaps his success should not be surprising, as you had no prior knowledge of these matters. You could not have learned these things yourself; doubting them was naturally not in your nature. You may wonder why all this was not told to you last night. But at that time, I was not in a state to decide how much could be explained. Regarding the truth of everything told here, I can particularly recommend the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam; due to our close relationship and constant confidences, and as one of the executors of my father's will, he has inevitably been involved in every detail of these transactions. If your contempt for me makes my explanations worthless, there is no reason to prevent you from consulting my cousin; I will try to find an opportunity to give you this letter this morning so that you can consult him. All I can wish is, may God protect you.",21.401,21.36,"Yesterday you accused me of two offenses of very different nature and magnitude. The first was having separated Mr. Bingley from his sister, without consideration for the feelings of either; and the other, that despite certain rights and ignoring honor and humanity, I ruined Mr. Wickham's immediate prosperity and destroyed his future. To have abandoned ruthlessly and intentionally the companion of my youth and my father's favorite, a young man who had almost no other future than that of our rectory and who had been educated for its practice, would be a depravity that could not be compared to the separation of two young people whose affection had been the result of only a few weeks. But I hope you will withdraw the severe censure you so openly directed at me last night, when you have read the following account of my actions regarding these two circumstances and their motives. If in the explanation that I cannot help but give, I am forced to express feelings that offend you, I can only say that I regret it. One must submit to necessity and any apology would be absurd. It wasn't long after I arrived in Hertfordshire that I noticed, like everyone else, that Mr. Bingley favored your eldest sister much more than any of the other young ladies in the locality; but until the night of the Netherfield ball, I did not see that his affection was formal. I had seen him in love several times before. At that ball, while I had the honor of dancing with you, I learned for the first time, through a casual remark from Sir William Lucas, that Bingley's attentions towards your sister had given rise to hopes of marriage; he spoke of it as a settled matter with only the date to be fixed. From that moment, I carefully observed my friend's behavior and noticed that his inclination towards Miss Bennet was greater than any he had felt before. I also studied your sister. Her appearance and manners were as frank, cheerful, and attractive as ever, but they did not reveal any particular regard. My observations that evening left me convinced that, despite the pleasure with which she received my friend's attentions, she did not reciprocate his feelings. If you were not mistaken about this, then I must have been in error. Since you know your sister better, it is more likely the latter; and if so, if driven by that error I have caused her suffering, your resentment is not unfounded. But I do not hesitate to assert that your sister's appearance and demeanor could have given even the most astute observer the assurance that, despite her affectionate nature, her heart did not seem to have been affected. It is true that I wished to believe in her indifference, but I assure you that my studies and conclusions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe her indifferent because it suited me to believe so; I believed it with absolute impartiality. My objections to that marriage were not exactly those I acknowledged last night could only be overcome by the force of passion, as in my own case; the disparity in rank would not be as serious for my friend as it would be for me; but there were other obstacles that, despite existing in both my friend's case and mine, I would have tried to forget since they did not affect me directly. I must say what they were, though I will do so briefly. The position of your mother's family, though questionable, was nothing compared to the absolute impropriety so often, almost constantly, displayed by that lady, by her three younger sisters, and occasionally even by her father. Forgive me, it pains me to offend you; but amid the concerns about the faults of your closest relatives and your displeasure at my mentioning them, take comfort in knowing that the fact that both you and your sister conduct yourselves in such a way that no similar reproaches can be made against you, elevates you even more in the esteem you deserve. I will only say that what happened that night confirmed all my suspicions and increased the reasons that might have already prompted me to preserve my friend from what I considered an unfortunate union. Bingley left for London the next day, as you will recall, with the intention of returning very soon. Now it remains to explain my involvement in the matter. The displeasure of his sisters had also intensified, and we soon discovered that we agreed in our assessments. We saw that there was no time to lose if we wanted to separate Bingley from his sister, and we decided to go with him to London. We moved there, and immediately I set about making my friend understand the dangers of his choice. I listed and described them to him with diligence. But, although this might have caused his determination to waver or be postponed, I do not believe it would have ultimately prevented the marriage, except for the conviction I managed to instill in him of his sister's indifference. Until then, Bingley had believed that she reciprocated his affection with sincere, though not equal, interest. But Bingley possesses great natural modesty and, moreover, genuinely believes that my sagacity is greater than his. Even so, it was not easy to convince him that he had been mistaken. Once convinced, making him decide not to return to Hertfordshire was a matter of an instant. I see nothing in all this that is reprehensible against me. One thing alone in all I did seems reproachable to me: having agreed to take the necessary measures to keep Bingley unaware of his sister's presence in the city. I knew she was in London, and Miss Bingley knew it too; but my friend has not found out yet. Perhaps if they had met, nothing would have happened; but it did not seem to me that his affection had extinguished enough for him to see her again without any danger. Maybe this concealment is unworthy of me, but I believed it my duty to do so. I have nothing more to say on this matter nor any further apology to offer. If I have hurt his sister's feelings, it has been unintentionally, and although my motives may seem insufficient to her, I do not find them so condemnable. Regarding the other more important accusation of having wronged Mr. Wickham, I can only counter it by explaining in detail the relationship of that gentleman with my family. I am unaware of what he may have specifically accused me of, but there is more than one reliable witness who can corroborate the truth of what I am about to tell you. Mr. Wickham is the son of a most respectable man who was in charge of managing all the Pemberley estates for many years, and whose excellent conduct inclined my father to favor him, as was natural; my father's affection was therefore generously manifested in George Wickham, who was his godson. He funded his education at a school and then at Cambridge, for his father, constantly impoverished by his wife's extravagances, would not have been able to give him a gentleman's education. My father not only enjoyed the boy's company, who was always very charming, but also formed the highest opinion of him and believed that the Church could be his profession, so he sought to provide him with the means for it. I, on the other hand, began to have a very different opinion of Wickham many years ago. The propensity for vices and the lack of principles that he took care to hide from his best friend could not escape the observation of a boy almost his age who had the chance to catch him in moments of carelessness that Mr. Darcy did not see. Now I will have to sadden you again to a degree that only you can calculate, but whatever feelings Mr. Wickham may have awakened in you, this suspicion will not prevent me from unmasking him; on the contrary, it will be an additional incentive for me. My excellent father died five years ago, and his affection for Mr. Wickham remained so constant until the end that in his will he recommended that I support him in the best way that his profession would allow; if he were ordained a priest, my father wished for him to be granted a benefice capable of supporting a family, at the first vacancy. He also bequeathed him a thousand pounds. Wickham's father did not survive mine by much. And half a year after his death, the young Wickham wrote to me informing me that he had finally resolved not to be ordained, and that, in exchange for the benefice he was not to enjoy, he hoped I would give him some more immediate pecuniary advantage. He added that he intended to pursue a career in law, and that I should understand that the interest on a thousand pounds could not suffice for that. More than believing him sincere, I wished he were; but in any case, I agreed to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham was not suited to be a clergyman; so I arranged the matter. He renounced all claims to assistance regarding the clerical profession, even if he might find himself in a position to adopt it, and accepted three thousand pounds. Everything seemed settled between us. I had too poor an opinion of him to invite him to Pemberley or admit his company in the capital. I believe he lived mostly in London, but his law studies were nothing but a pretext, and as there was nothing to hold him, he freely indulged in idleness and dissipation. I knew almost nothing of him for three years, but upon the death of the holder of the rectory that had been intended for him, he sent me a letter asking me to grant it to him. He told me, and it was not difficult for me to believe, that he was in very poor circumstances, opined that the law career was not profitable, and was completely decided to be ordained if I granted him the rectory in question, something he did not doubt I would do, as he knew I had no one else to occupy it and on the other hand, I could not forget the wishes of my venerable father. I believe you cannot blame me for having refused to comply with this demand and preventing it from being repeated. Wickham's resentment was proportional to the calamitousness of his circumstances, and he undoubtedly spoke of me to people with the same violence with which he directly insulted me. After this, all relations between him and me were broken off. I do not know how he lived. But last summer I received very unpleasant news about him. I have to tell you something now that I myself would like to forget and that no other circumstance than the present one could induce me to reveal to any human being. I have no doubt that you will keep my secret. My sister, who is ten years younger than I am, was left under the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she left school and settled in London. Last summer, she went with her governess to Ramsgate, where Mr. Wickham also went expressly, with complete certainty, for we later learned that Mrs. Younge and he had been in contact. We had, unfortunately, been deceived about the character of the governess. With her complicity and help, Wickham set about seducing Georgiana, whose affectionate heart was strongly impressed by his attentions; she was only a child and, believing herself to be in love, consented to elope. She was then only fifteen years old, which serves as an excuse. After confessing her imprudence, I have the satisfaction of adding that I learned of that plan from her herself. I went to Ramsgate and surprised them a day or two before the planned elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to distress and offend her brother whom she almost loved as a father, told me everything. You can imagine how I felt and how I acted. Out of consideration for my sister's honor and feelings, I did not make a public scandal, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left immediately. Mrs. Younge, naturally, was dismissed on the spot. Mr. Wickham's main objective was undoubtedly my sister's fortune, which amounts to thirty thousand pounds, but I cannot help but suspect that his desire for revenge against me was also part of his purpose. It really would have been a complete revenge. This is, miss, the faithful narration of what happened between him and me; and if you do not reject it as absolutely false, I hope that henceforth you will withdraw the accusation of having behaved cruelly towards Mr. Wickham. I do not know in what way or with what falsehood he has deceived you; but it is not surprising that he has succeeded, for you were unaware of all these matters. It was impossible for you to find them out and you were not inclined to suspect them. You may wonder why I did not tell you everything last night, but at that time I was not in control of myself and did not know what I could or should reveal to you. Regarding the truth of everything I have narrated to you, I can appeal to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, due to our close relationship and constant interaction, and even more so for being one of the executors of my father's will, has had to become fully aware of everything that has happened. If the hatred you feel towards me invalidates my assertions, you may consult with my cousin, against whom you will have no reason for distrust; and to make this possible, I will try to find the opportunity to get this letter into your hands this very morning.

1148,"ELIZABETH, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.","When Mr. Darcy handed her the letter, Elizabeth had not expected him to propose to her again, nor could she anticipate its contents. But she eagerly read it, and the letter caused conflicting emotions within her. She could not clearly define her thoughts as she read through the letter. At first, she was surprised to understand that he believed he had the ability to apologize to her, and she remained firmly convinced that he had no explanation that could justify his shameful behavior. With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began with the explanation of what had happened at Netherfield. She eagerly read, but in her impatience to know what the next sentence said, she could not clearly grasp what she was reading. She immediately assumed that his belief in her sister's indifference was wrong, and his explanation of the strong objections made her too angry to consider him impartially. He did not show any regret for what he had done; his manner was not repentant but arrogant. It was all pride and insolence.",23.412,23.081,"When Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, although Elizabeth did not expect it to reiterate his marriage proposal, she had no idea what it might be about. But given what it explained, it is easy to imagine how eagerly she read the letter and the complex emotions she experienced. What she felt while reading is indescribable. First, she saw with astonishment that Mr. Darcy believed he could somehow manage to apologize; whereas Elizabeth firmly believed that there was no explanation Mr. Darcy could give without blushing from shame. With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began reading his words about what happened at Netherfield. She read with an excitement that did not leave her mind at ease, and due to her impatience to learn what the next sentence might bring, she could not manage to pay attention to the meaning of the sentence before her. She immediately dismissed Mr. Darcy's belief in her sister's indifference as wrong; the most real, the worst objections against the marriage angered her so much that she could not remain impartial. She found it understandable that he said he did not regret what he had done; there was no remorse in his tone, there was arrogance. From beginning to end, it was proud and disrespectful.",23.419,23.059,"Elizabeth did not expect, when Darcy gave her the letter, that he would repeat his proposal in it, but she had no idea what it might contain. Upon discovering it, one can well imagine how quickly she read it and what conflicting emotions it aroused in her. It would have been difficult to define her feelings. At first, she believed with astonishment that Darcy would want to apologize as best he could, but she immediately became firmly convinced that he could not offer any explanation that the most basic sense of dignity would not advise concealing. With great prejudice against everything he might say, she began to read his account of what had happened at Netherfield. Her eyes skimmed the paper with such anxiety that she barely had time to comprehend, and her impatience to know what the next sentence said prevented her from understanding the meaning of the one she was reading. She instantly assumed that Darcy's belief in her sister's indifference was false, and the worst objections he raised to that marriage angered her too much to be able to do him justice. She was pleased that he expressed no regret for what he had done; his style revealed no contrition, but arrogance. In his lines, she saw nothing but pride and insolence.",22.759,22.354
1149,"But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham—when she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself—her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”—and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.","But when he mentioned Mr. Wickham, as she read more attentively, the events, if true, would surely dispel all her good feelings about his worth. Her feelings became more painful and harder to define. She was extremely surprised, worried, even horrified. She wanted to reject everything, constantly shouting: ""This is not right! It can't be like this! This is nonsense!"" And when she had finished reading the letter, though she remembered nothing of the last one or two pages, she hurriedly folded the letter, convinced that she should not believe it, that she would never read it again.",12.124,11.158,"But when the explanation regarding Mr. Wickham followed this subject, if it were true, it should have shattered every good thought she had about Mr. Wickham, and as she read the explanation of events that bore a very disturbing similarity to the story he had told with a bit more clear attention, she felt an even more intense and indescribable pain. She was left in astonishment, anxiety, even horror. She wanted to oppose it all, repeatedly cried out, ""Lies! It cannot be true! The utmost of lies!"" – when she finished reading the letter, although she understood very little from the last one or two pages, she hastily folded and put it away, saying she would not believe what was written and would not look at it again.",5.957,4.505,"But when she came to the part concerning Wickham, she read with greater attention. Faced with that account of events which, if true, would destroy all her good opinion of the young man, and which bore an alarming similarity to what Wickham himself had told her, her feelings became even more distressing and harder to define; confusion, suspicion, and even horror overwhelmed her. She wanted to deny it all and repeatedly exclaimed: ""That must be false, it can't be true! It must be the greatest of lies!"" She finished reading the letter, and without having taken in the last one or two pages, she quickly put it away, complaining to herself that she would not look at it again, that she did not want to know anything about it.",16.51,15.681
1150,"In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each statement—but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on. But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.","In such a state of mental turmoil, with intentions not knowing where to cling, she continued to walk. But she could not control herself, opened the letter again, trying to calm herself in her distressed state, and read everything about Wickham again, examining the meaning in each sentence. The letter's account of Mr. Wickham's relationship with the Pemberly family was just as he had told. The kindness of the late Mr. Darcy was also as he had said, though she had not known it well before. Up to this point, everything matched, but when she read the part about the will, there was a significant difference. She still remembered the allowance that Wickham mentioned, and when pondering each word he said, she couldn't help but think that either one or the other had behaved deceitfully, and for a moment she was proud that she had not been mistaken. But as she continued to read, then carefully reread, the subsequent details about Wickham renouncing all claims to the support, instead accepting a sum of three thousand pounds, made her uneasy. She put the letter down, considering every situation she thought was fair – cautious about the assumptions in each sentence – but she could not reach a conclusion. Each side was adamant about what they said. She read on. But each line showed more clearly that the matter, which she had believed no scheme could present in such a way as to make Mr. Darcy appear not too bad, had taken a step or made him completely innocent.",13.708,13.323,"In this shaken state of mind, he continued to walk with scattered thoughts; but it didn't work; half a minute later, the letter was opened again; he tried to collect himself as best as he could and began to read all those things about Wickham again in shame, forcing himself to examine the meaning of each sentence. The connection with the Pemberley family was exactly as he had described; although he did not know the extent of it until then, the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy matched his own words exactly. Up to that point, both statements corroborated each other: but when it came to the will, the difference was significant. What Wickham had said about the church was still fresh in his memory; remembering his words, it was impossible not to feel that there was a heavy lie on one side or the other; for a few minutes, he complimented himself by saying that his instincts would not mislead him. But upon closer reading, upon re-reading, the details behind Wickham's relinquishment of all claims to the church and instead receiving a substantial sum of three thousand pounds made him hesitate again. He put the letter aside, trying to weigh every possibility in his mind impartially – he pondered and considered the likelihood of every word, but he was unsuccessful. Both statements were merely claims. He read it again. But each line more clearly revealed that although he did not believe the matter had been falsified to make Mr. Darcy's behavior appear vile, it was also open to an interpretation that would show him completely innocent from the beginning to the end of the story.",21.117,20.82,"In such a state of perturbation, assaulted by a thousand confused thoughts, she continued walking; but it was of no use; after half a minute she took out the letter again and, overcoming herself as best she could, began once more the mortifying reading of what referred to Wickham, mastering herself enough to examine the meaning of each phrase. His relationship with the Pemberley family was exactly as he had said, and the kindness of the old Mr. Darcy, although Elizabeth had not known until now how far it had gone, also coincided with what Wickham himself had indicated. Therefore, one account confirmed the other, but when it came to the matter of the will, it was very different. Everything he had said about his ecclesiastical benefice was fresh in the young woman's memory, and recalling his words, she had to acknowledge that there was double intention on one side or the other, and for a few moments she believed that her wishes were not deceiving her. But when she read and reread everything that had happened after Wickham had refused the rectory, in exchange for which he had received a sum as considerable as three thousand pounds, she could not help but doubt again. She folded the letter and weighed all the circumstances with her supposed impartiality, meditating on the probabilities of sincerity of each account, but she made no progress; from both sides she found nothing but assertions. She began to read again, but each line proved more clearly that the matter, which she had not believed could be explained in any way other than as an infamy to the detriment of Darcy's conduct, could be exposed in such a way that left Darcy completely free of blame.",21.003,20.663
1151,"The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ——shire militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told","The extravagance and liberality that he had unhesitatingly accused Mr. Wickham of shocked her, even more so because she saw no evidence of any injustice. She had never heard of Mr. Wickham before he joined the military at the persuasion of her young brother, who had rekindled a superficial acquaintance upon meeting him again in the city. No one in Hertfordshire knew anything about his previous life except for what he himself had said.",16.016,14.808,The accusation of excess and general immorality that he did not hesitate to direct at Mr. Wickham shook him deeply; it shook him even more as he could not find any evidence to disprove the accusation. He had heard nothing about him before he joined the -------shire Regiment; he had joined this regiment on the recommendation of a young man he had met by chance in the city and quickly renewed his friendship with. Nothing was known about his previous lifestyle except for what he had told in Hertfordshire.,4.647,2.694,"The vices and prodigality that Darcy did not hesitate to attribute to Wickham outraged her excessively, all the more so because she had no evidence to refute Darcy's testimony. Elizabeth had never heard of Wickham before his joining the county garrison, which had been prompted by his casual encounter in London with a young man she only knew superficially.

1153,"himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’ continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself—from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.","No one in Hertfordshire knew anything about his previous life except for what he himself had said. She never wanted to inquire about his true character. His face, voice, and gestures all immediately confirmed every virtue of his. She tried to recall a few virtues, a few unique traits of integrity or benevolence that could help defend him against Mr. Darcy's accusations, or at least could excuse the common faults, as she thought, that Mr. Darcy had described as laziness and long-standing vices. But she could not remember anything like that. She could see him right before her, every manner and word captivating, but she could not recall any substantial point of his virtues, except for the approval of neighbors and the affection due to his social skills among the guests. After a moment of pondering this point, she continued reading. But, alas! The subsequent story about his intentions towards Miss Darcy, partially confirmed by the conversation she had with Colonel Fitzwilliam the previous morning, and finally substantiated in every detail by Colonel Fitzwilliam himself – who had informed her of his concerns about his cousin's actions, a man whose integrity she had no reason to doubt. For a moment she decided she would ask him about it, but the intention wavered because she felt awkward bringing it up. Ultimately, she dismissed the idea altogether, convinced that Mr. Darcy would never risk making such a proposal unless he was certain his cousin would corroborate his account.",16.002,15.637,"If he had learned something about his true character, he would not have felt the desire to investigate. Thanks to his face, voice, and demeanor, he had immediately established himself as a very virtuous person. Elizabeth tried to remember an example of goodness, a sign of evident honesty or humanity that could save him from Mr. Darcy's attacks or at least help classify the faults Mr. Darcy described as long-standing idleness and wickedness as mere ordinary mistakes through his inherent morality, but she could not recall anything more tangible than the general positive opinion in the village and the reputation his sociability had earned him among his fellow soldiers. After dwelling on this point for a while, she continued reading once again. But alas! The next story described his plans regarding Miss Darcy and was somewhat confirmed by the conversations she had had with Colonel Fitzwilliam earlier that morning; in the end, every detail was referred to Colonel Fitzwilliam for verification, from whom she had already learned about his close interest in all his cousin's affairs and had no reason to question his character. At one point, she almost decided to consult him but realized it would seem odd and gave up; in the end, she dismissed the idea entirely, thinking that Mr. Darcy would not risk making such an offer unless he was quite sure of his cousin's cooperation.",10.975,10.431,"Of his former life, nothing was known in Hertfordshire except what he himself had told. As for his true character, despite Elizabeth having the opportunity to analyze it, she never felt the desire to do so; his appearance, voice, and manners instantly endowed him with all virtues. She tried to recall some noble trait, some special gesture of integrity or kindness that could shield him from Darcy's attacks, or at least that the predominance of good qualities would compensate for those casual errors, which was how she insisted on labeling what Darcy branded as laziness and immorality ingrained in him from the beginning. She imagined Wickham in front of her and remembered him with all the charm of his demeanor, but apart from the general approval he enjoyed in the locality and the consideration he had gained among his comrades for his sympathy, Elizabeth could find nothing more in his favor. After having reflected for a long time on this point, she resumed reading. But what followed about the adventure with Miss Darcy was partly confirmed by the conversation Elizabeth had had the previous morning with Colonel Fitzwilliam; and, at the end of the letter, Darcy appealed, to prove the truth of everything, to the colonel himself, whose involvement in all his cousin's affairs Elizabeth knew in advance, and whose veracity she had no reason to doubt. She was about to turn to him, but restrained herself at the thought of how awkward it would be to take that step; dismissing it in the end, convinced that Darcy would never have risked proposing it without being absolutely certain that his cousin would corroborate his statements.",12.208,11.698
1154,"She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.","She clearly remembered everything that was exchanged between Wickham and her on the evening they first met at Mr. Phillips' house. Many of his words were still vividly imprinted in her memory. Now she was startled to think that speaking in such a manner to a stranger was improper, and she wondered why she hadn't realized this before. She thought he lacked tact when presenting himself in that way, and his statements and actions were inconsistent. She remembered that he had boasted that he was not afraid to meet Mr. Darcy, that Mr. Darcy could leave but he would stay; yet, he had avoided the ball at Netherfield the following week. She also remembered that, until the Netherfield family left, he had only told his story to her and no one else, but after they left, the story was discussed everywhere. She thought he had not hesitated at all, not even for a moment, to seek to undermine Mr. Darcy's character, even though he had reassured her that out of respect for the late gentleman, he would never expose the son.",17.417,16.736,"Mr. Philips remembered everything that was said during his conversations with Wickham very well. Most of his words remained fresh in his memory. Now, he was disturbed by the impropriety of making such revelations to a stranger and was amazed that he had overlooked this until now. He saw the indiscretion in revealing oneself in such a manner and that his words did not align with his actions. He recalled Wickham boasting that he was not afraid of seeing Mr. Darcy – that Mr. Darcy could leave the village if he wanted, but he would not budge from his place, yet he avoided the ball at Netherfield the following week. He remembered that Wickham did not tell his story to anyone else until the family at Netherfield left the village, but after they were gone, the story was talked about everywhere, and despite saying that his respect for his father would not allow him to disgrace his son in public, he ceaselessly criticized Mr. Darcy.",8.169,6.648,"She perfectly remembered everything Wickham told her when they first spoke at Mr. Philips' house; many of his expressions were still entirely in her memory. Now she realized the impropriety of such confidences to a stranger and was amazed that she had not noticed it before.

She remembered that he boasted of not fearing to see Darcy and that Darcy would have to leave, but that he would not move, which did not prevent him from evading the Netherfield ball the following week. She also remembered that until the Netherfield family had left the county, he told his story only to her, but after their departure, the said story spread from mouth to mouth, and Wickham had no scruples about ruining Darcy's reputation, despite previously assuring Elizabeth that respect for the father would always prevent him from offending the son.",25.292,24.835
1155,"How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;—that, proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways—seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust—anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits;—that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued;—that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;—that had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.","Everything related to him has now changed! His attention to Miss King is now merely a consequence of pure greed and a desire for revenge, and her meager fortune indicates that his aspirations are no longer moderate but driven by a keen eagerness to seize anything. His attitude towards her now cannot be motivated by anything acceptable; either he is disappointed by her poor fortune, or his vanity has been satisfied after he aroused the affection that she believed she had shown imprudently. All ideas of justifying him are gradually fading away. Through Mr. Darcy's explanation, she had to accept that Mr. Bingley, when asked by Jane, had long believed he was not at fault in the matter. She realized that, throughout the time Mr. Darcy and she had a relationship that eventually brought them closer and allowed her to know his lifestyle well, although he was proud and unpleasant, she had never seen anything that indicated he lacked principles or fairness. Anything that indicated irreligious or immoral habits. In his social interactions, he was respected and highly regarded – even Wickham had considered him a brother; she had often heard him speak affectionately about his sister; all of which indicated he had some amiable sentiments. If his actions were as Wickham described, a blatant violation of all that is right could hardly be concealed from anyone, and the friendship between a person capable of forming bonds and someone as charming as Mr. Bingley; all of it was incomprehensible.",17.055,16.631,"How different everything related to Wickham seemed now! His interest in Miss King was now only the result of his low and selfish inclinations; the modesty of the girl's fortune no longer proved the ordinariness of Wickham's desires, but his desire to cling to whatever he could find. There was now no understandable reason for his behavior towards Elizabeth; either he was mistaken about her wealth, or he was feeding his own vanity by encouraging the intimacy he believed Elizabeth had shown so imprudently. As her last efforts to defend him weakened and further justified Mr. Darcy, she couldn't help but agree with Mr. Bingley's assertion of his innocence in response to Jane's question long ago; although his behavior was so proud and repulsive, throughout their acquaintance, which had recently brought them together frequently and made her familiar with his manner, she had never seen anything that revealed him to be unprincipled or unjust – nothing that suggested he had impious or immoral habits. He was respected and complimented among their acquaintances – even Wickham had admitted he was valuable as a brother, and Elizabeth had often witnessed him speaking of his sister with great affection, so much so that she thought he was capable of feeling closeness in his own way. If his actions were as Wickham described, such a grave disregard for everything right would be hard to hide from the world; a friendship between a person capable of this and a man as extremely kind-hearted as Mr. Bingley would be inconceivable.",15.511,15.064,"How different everything related to Wickham seemed to her now! His attentions towards Miss King were now solely and exclusively the consequence of his odious fortune-hunting prospects, and the mediocrity of the young lady's fortune was no longer proof of the moderation of his ambitions, but rather his eagerness to cling to anything. His attitude towards Elizabeth could no longer have an acceptable motive: either he had been mistaken at first about her wealth, or he had tried to flatter his own vanity by nurturing the preference she had unwittingly shown him. All the efforts she made to defend him were progressively weakening. And to further justify Darcy, she could not help but recognize that Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago proclaimed Darcy's innocence in that matter; that no matter how proud and repellent he was, never, in the entire course of their relationship ––a relationship that had recently brought them much closer, allowing her to know his character more deeply––, had she seen him do anything ignoble or unjust, nothing for which he could be accused of being irreligious or immoral; that among his friends he was appreciated and loved, and even Wickham himself had acknowledged that he was a good brother. She had also heard him speak of his sister with such affection that it demonstrated he had good feelings. If he had been as Wickham painted him, capable of such a violation of all rights, it would have been difficult for no one to know, and the friendship between such a being and a man as amiable as Bingley would have been incomprehensible.",16.664,16.205

Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were concerned.

If I had known love, I could not have been so miserably blind! But vanity, not love, has always been my folly.

But my foolish mistake was not love, it was pride. As soon as we met, I liked being someone's choice, and I was offended by being neglected by the other; I acted prejudiced and ignorantly about both, setting reason aside. It turns out I didn't know myself until this moment.""",8.862,7.607,"“How despicably I have acted,” she thought, “I, who prided myself on my discernment!” “I, who have boasted of my talent, who have scorned my sister’s generous candor, and have flattered my vanity with useless or blameworthy suspicions!” “How humiliating all this is, but how I deserve this humiliation!” If I had been in love with Wickham, I would not have acted with such lamentable blindness.

His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.

She was glad that he loved her; she respected his character, but could not accept him; and at no time did she regret rejecting him, nor did she have any fleeting desire to see him again. In her past behavior, there were always sources of annoyance and regret; and the shortcomings of her family were a matter that caused her even more distress. She felt hopeless to remedy it. Her father only wanted to joke and never restrained the frivolity of the young daughters. Her mother, with attitudes that were still improper, was completely insensitive to the harm. Elizabeth often tried with Jane to control the impulsiveness of Catherine and Lydia, but while their mother indulged them, what chance was there for the two to improve? Catherine, with her weak and irritable nature, always being led by Lydia, was always displeased with her sisters' advice. Lydia, with her self-willed and careless disposition, rarely listened to them. Both were foolish, lazy, and empty-headed.

Within her past behaviors, there was a constant source of distress and regret, and in the sad mistakes of her family, an even heavier subject of unhappiness. Their situation was hopeless. Their father, who consoled himself by laughing at them, did not make any effort to restrain the wild recklessness of his younger daughters; their mother, with actions far from propriety, was unaware of the vulgarity at hand. Elizabeth often joined hands with Jane, trying to control the instability of Catherine and Lydia; but how could they possibly improve as long as they were supported by their mother's obsession? Weak-willed, uneasy, and having taken Lydia as her complete role model, Catherine was offended by their advice; ambitious and indifferent Lydia did not even hear them. They were ignorant, idle, and headstrong. As long as there were officers in Meryton, they would flirt with them; as long as Meryton was within walking distance of Longbourn, they would go there forever.",23.558,23.244,"She almost knew Darcy's letter by heart. She studied its phrases one by one, and her feelings towards its author were sometimes extremely conflicted. When she focused on the tone in which he addressed her, she was filled with indignation, but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and vilified him, her anger turned against herself and she pitied Darcy's disillusionment. His love for her stirred her gratitude, and his general demeanor, her respect; but she could not accept him and never for a moment regretted having rejected him nor felt the slightest desire to see him again. The way she had behaved filled her with constant shame and regret, and the unfortunate flaws of her family caused her horrible discomfort. There was no remedy. Her father merely mocked her younger sisters, but never attempted to curb their impetuous recklessness; and her mother, whose manners were so far from any decorum, was completely insensitive to the danger. Elizabeth had often conspired with Jane to curb Catherine and Lydia's imprudence, but as long as they had their mother's indulgence, what hope was there that they would be corrected? Catherine, weak and irritable in character and absolutely submissive to Lydia's direction, had always rebelled against their warnings; and Lydia, capricious and carefree, paid them no heed. Both were ignorant, lazy, and vain. As long as there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him, and as long as Meryton was so close to Longbourn, nothing could prevent them from going there all their lives.",23.005,22.696

Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to her good graces, made her understand what Jane had lost.

She felt even more compassion when she thought that, with a situation favorable in every way, full of advantages, full of promises of happiness, Jane was deprived of it all, just because her own family had been too foolish and impolite!",17.102,16.031,"Another source of her unhappiness was the worry she felt for Jane; Mr. Darcy's explanation had revived all her former positive opinions about Bingley, making her feel the magnitude of Jane's loss even more. Bingley's love had proven to be genuine, his behavior free from blame, unless one finds fault in his unquestioning trust in his friend. How painful it was that Jane, in every way so perfect, so satisfying, so promising of happiness, had lost such a match due to her own family's foolishness and lack of manners!",11.441,9.888,"The anxiety for Jane's fate was another of her predominant concerns. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to the good opinion she previously had of him, made her better realize what Jane had lost.

But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.","If Elizabeth's thoughts were all derived from her family, she could not have formed a very favorable impression of married life or a harmonious family. Her father, attracted by youth, beauty, and the outward cheerfulness that youth and beauty bring, had married a woman of weak understanding and narrow mind, and from the very beginning of the marriage, he had lost all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished forever; all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for his disappointment in his own imprudence, so he did not resort to those pleasures which might have soothed the unfortunate who had acted foolishly or wickedly. He loved the countryside and books, and found enjoyment in them. As for his wife, he owed her little gratitude except for the amusement her folly and nonsense provided him. This was not the sort of happiness that makes a man grateful to his wife, but when he had no ability to indulge in other diversions, the true philosopher must derive benefit from whatever is available.",33.611,33.284,"If Elizabeth's views had come from her family, she might not have been able to paint a very pleasant picture of a happy marriage or a comfortable home life. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and the cheerful appearance that youth and beauty generally bring, had married a woman who was lacking in both sense and manners, and had lost all real affection for her soon after their marriage began. Respect, reverence, and trust had vanished forever; all hopes for family happiness were shattered. But Mr. Bennet was not the kind of man to seek solace in the pleasures that other unfortunate people, who had acted foolishly or wickedly, might resort to in their disappointment caused by their own imprudence. He was fond of the countryside and books; his main enjoyment came from these pleasures. He owed very little to his wife, except for the amusement her ignorance and foolishness provided him.

Respect, esteem, and trust had vanished forever; and all of Mr. Bennet's prospects of happiness within the home had collapsed. But he was not one of those men who seek comfort for the effects of their own imprudence in the pleasures that often console those who have become unhappy through their follies and vices. He loved the countryside and books, and they constituted the source of his main joys. From his wife, he owed nothing more than the laughter that her ignorance and folly provided him from time to time.

1312,"Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents—talents which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.","However, Elizabeth had never ignored his improper behaviors as a husband. She was always distressed to see him like that, but out of respect for his abilities and happiness at being cherished by him, she tried to forget what she could not overlook and pushed out of her mind the sad actions when he showed irresponsibility or lacked the spirit of marital decorum by exposing his wife to the contempt of their children. But she had never deeply felt the disadvantages for the daughters in such a discordant marriage, nor had she ever recognized the harms of misusing talents – talents that, if properly harnessed, could at least earn the daughters respect from others, if not broaden the mind of their mother.",18.651,18.001,"However, Elizabeth had never been blind to her father's inappropriate behavior as a husband. She had always watched these with pain; but because she respected her father's abilities and was grateful for the love he showed her, she tried not to think about the extremely unpleasant act of constantly violating the duties and decorum of marriage, such as belittling his wife at every opportunity in front of their children. But never had she felt so strongly the troubles that children of such an incompatible marriage had to endure; never had she understood so well the harm caused by talents directed at the wrong targets – talents that, if used correctly, could at least have preserved her daughters' dignity, even if they failed to improve her wife's mind.",15.651,14.888,"Elizabeth, nevertheless, had never ceased to recognize the impropriety of her father's conduct as a husband.

But she had never felt as she did then the harm that a discordant marriage can cause to the children, nor had she ever so clearly realized the dangers inherent in the misdirection of talent, talent that, if well employed, although it might not have been enough to enhance his wife's intelligence, could at least have preserved the respectability of the daughters.",28.881,28.337
1313,"When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.","While Elizabeth was glad that Wickham would be leaving, she saw no other reason to be satisfied with the loss of the militia regiment. Social gatherings at other people's houses became more monotonous than before; and at home, she had a mother and a sister who were always irritable because everything around them had become boring, creating a gloomy atmosphere in the family. Although Kitty gradually regained her natural sense because those who disturbed her mind were absent, the other sister, whom everyone feared would encounter worse, might plunge deeper into her foolish self-confidence. Thus, as before, she thought that an event she eagerly awaited, when it happened, did not satisfy her as she had hoped. As a result, it was necessary to identify another time period to truly begin to be happy. There needed to be a milestone to which all wishes and hopes could be connected. Through this, feeling pleasure in anticipation, comforting her for the present, and preparing for another disappointment. Her trip to the Lake District had now become a happy thought. This was the best consolation for the frustrating moments caused by her mother and Kitty. If Jane could join in this plan, everything would become wonderful.",13.441,12.993,"While Elizabeth Wickham was happy to be gone, she couldn't find any other consoling aspect in losing the regiment. The parties outside were duller than before; at home, her mother and sister, who constantly complained about the monotony of everything around them, cast a gloom over their family life; with the things that troubled her mind now distant, Kitty might eventually regain her former common sense, but her other sister, from whom greater mischief could be expected, seemed likely to harden all her foolishness and stubbornness in a situation that involved the double danger of the seaside and the military camp. In the end, as she had seen a few times before, she realized that an event she had been waiting for with impatient anticipation did not bring the joy Elizabeth had promised her when it finally happened. Another date would have to be set for true happiness to begin, another turning point where her wishes and hopes could be realized; and once again, she would console herself for the time being with the pleasure of anticipation, and prepare for another disappointment. The trip to the Lake District now formed her happiest thoughts; it was her strongest consolation against all those distressing hours made inevitable by her mother and Kitty; if she could include Jane in the plan, everything would be perfect.",16.932,16.468,"While it is true that Elizabeth was glad of Wickham's absence, it cannot be said that she rejoiced at the regiment's departure. Her outings were less frequent than before, and the constant complaints of her mother and sister about the boredom they had fallen into saddened the house. And although Catherine might have regained the common sense lost with the departure of those who caused her disturbance, her other sister, from whose behavior all calamities could be expected, was in danger of affirming her madness and brazenness, for being near a beach and a camp, her situation was doubly threatening. In short, she now saw what she had already realized at other times, that an eagerly awaited event could not, upon happening, bring her all the satisfaction that was to be expected. It was necessary, therefore, to open another period for the beginning of her happiness, to set another goal for the achievement of her desires and hopes, which by cheering her with another anticipated pleasure, would console her for the present and prepare her for another disappointment. Her trip to the Lakes became the object of her happiest thoughts and constituted her best refuge in the unpleasant hours that her mother's and Catherine's discontent made inevitable.

She was also surprised by his changed demeanor compared to the last time they met, which only added to her confusion with every word he uttered. All thoughts about her sudden visit returned to her mind; and the few minutes they continued to converse were the most uncomfortable moments of her life. He did not seem natural either.

While Mr. Darcy spoke with his nephews, the two of them stood a little aside; the nephews were astonished, dazed, and did not even dare to lift their eyes to look at his face, unsure of how to respond to his polite inquiries about their family's health. As she marveled at how differently he behaved compared to the last time they parted, every sentence he uttered increased her discomfort a bit more; the inappropriateness of her presence repeatedly came to mind, making the few minutes they stood face to face some of the most tense moments of her life.

They waited at a certain distance while their niece spoke with him. Elizabeth, astonished and confused, hardly dared to raise her eyes to Darcy and did not know how to answer the questions he asked about her family. Surprised by the change in manners since they had last parted, each phrase he uttered increased her embarrassment, and as she thought about how improper it was to have met him there, the few moments they were together were the most uneasy of her life.

In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.

That he should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.

And why did he return a day early? If the three of them had left ten minutes earlier, they could have avoided him, for it was evident that at that moment he was arriving, either dismounting from his horse or stepping out of his carriage. She blushed and blushed again over the wretched encounter. And his demeanor, completely changed, what did it mean? That he still wanted to converse with her was surprising enough, but to speak with such politeness, and even inquire about her family! Never had she seen his manner so unpretentious, never had he spoken so gently as in this unexpected meeting. It was indeed a stark contrast to his behavior at Rosings, when he handed her his letter.

Such a thing would seem so unbecoming to such a proud man! It would look as if she had deliberately thrown herself in his way! Why had she come, why? And why had Mr. Darcy arrived a day earlier than expected? If they had left ten minutes earlier, he wouldn't have even noticed them, because it was clear he had just arrived, just dismounted from his horse or carriage. She blushed repeatedly at the thought of the awkward encounter. And his so changed behavior – what to make of that? It was a miracle that he even spoke to her! – especially speaking so kindly and inquiring about her family's health! She had never seen him behave so humbly, never heard him speak so delicately as he did in that unexpected encounter. How different it was from their last conversation at Rosings Park, especially when he handed her that letter! She did not know what to think, how to explain it.",15.611,15.109,"The Gardiners met with Elizabeth and praised Darcy's good appearance; but she heard nothing; absorbed in her thoughts, she followed them in silence. She was overwhelmed by shame and frustration. How had it occurred to her to go there? It had been the most unfortunate and foolish decision in the world! How strange it must seem to Darcy! How was a man ––so vain!–– to interpret that? Her visit to Pemberley would seem deliberately made to seek him out. Why had she gone? And he, why had he come a day earlier? If they themselves had arrived at Pemberley just ten minutes earlier, they would not have met, for it was evident that Darcy had just arrived, that at that moment he was getting off the horse or the carriage. Elizabeth could not stop feeling ashamed of their unfortunate encounter. And Darcy's behavior, so remarkably changed, what could it mean? It was surprising that he had spoken to her, but even more so that he did it with such finesse and asked about her family. She had never seen such simplicity in his manners nor had she ever heard him express himself with such gentleness. What a contrast to the last time he approached her at the Rosings estate to hand her the letter! Elizabeth did not know what to think or how to judge all this.",14.167,13.621
1384,"They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice, which was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.","They had walked onto the path along the riverbank, each step bringing a more elegant scene or a more beautiful stretch of forest; but only after a while did Elizabeth realize this. Although she mechanically responded to every comment from her uncle and aunt and tried to direct her gaze to where they pointed, she could not distinguish the scenes around her. All her thoughts were directed to a place within the Pemberley estate, any place where Mr. Darcy might be present. She wanted to know what he was thinking at that moment, and whether she still held any affection in his mind, even though she still felt defiant. Perhaps he had been polite to her just because he felt comfortable, yet there was something in his voice that showed her he was not calm. She could not guess whether he was distressed or pleased to see her again, but surely he had not maintained his composure when he saw her.",12.53,11.781,"They had now entered a beautiful road by the water; each step revealed a larger slope or a small extension of the forest they were approaching; but it took Elizabeth some time to see these; she was so busy answering her uncle and aunt's incessant questions, turning her eyes to the places they pointed out, that she could not distinguish any part of the scene. Her thoughts were fixed on that single point of Pemberley Manor, the point where Mr. Darcy was at that moment. She wanted to know what was going through his mind at that moment, what he thought of her, and whether she still mattered to him despite everything. Perhaps he had been kind just because he felt comfortable; but still, there was that thing in his voice, that thing that was not like comfort. She did not know whether he felt pain or joy at seeing Elizabeth, but she knew he could not remain calm when he saw her.",22.275,21.802,"Meanwhile, they had entered a beautiful path parallel to the stream, and with each step, a more beautiful slope of the terrain or a more impressive view of the forests they were approaching appeared before them. But some time passed before Elizabeth realized all of this, and although she mechanically responded to her uncles' repeated questions and seemed to direct her gaze to the objects they pointed out, she did not distinguish any part of the landscape. Her thoughts could not be diverted from the site of Pemberley mansion, wherever it might be, where Darcy must be. She longed to know what was going through his mind at that moment, what he thought of her, and if he still loved her. It might be that his courtesy was merely because he had already forgotten her; but there was something in his voice that denoted unease. She could not guess whether Darcy felt pleasure or regret at seeing her; but the truth is that he seemed bewildered.",17.853,17.308
1385,"At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.","However, in the end, her uncle and aunt's remarks about her absent-mindedness awakened her mind, and she thought she needed to return to herself.",12.186,8.383,"Nevertheless, in the end, the words of his friends woke him from his reverie; he felt he needed to appear more present.",7.061,3.641,The observations of her companions about her lack of attention woke her up and made her realize that she needed to appear calm.,9.726,6.425
1386,"They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more.","They entered the forest and bid farewell to the river, climbing up a slope to a place where the sparse canopy opened up to reveal a mesmerizing view of the valley, with hills facing a long stretch of tree-covered land, and glimpses of the water appearing intermittently. The uncle expressed a desire to walk around the entire garden, but was concerned about the long distance. The gardener proudly informed them that the path was ten miles long. So he dismissed the idea, and they followed the familiar path, and after descending under the drooping foliage, they reencountered the riverbank where the water was at its narrowest. They crossed a rustic bridge that blended harmoniously with the surrounding scenery. This was the least maintained area compared to the places they had passed through. The valley here narrowed, leaving just enough space for the river to flow through, and the path also narrowed between the low bushes on either side. Elizabeth wanted to explore along the trail, but they realized they had gone quite far, and Mrs. Gardiner, due to her frail health, could not go any further and wished to return to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece had to comply with her. They followed the riverbank back to the mansion by the shortest route. But they could not move quickly because Mr. Gardiner, who was very fond of fishing despite having few opportunities, was captivated by the occasional appearance of trout on the water's surface, and as he walked slowly, he conversed with the gardener. While they were leisurely like this, once again the three were surprised, and Elizabeth was as astonished as the last time, when they saw Mr. Darcy approaching. This area had fewer trees than the opposite bank, so they saw him before they met. Though surprised, Elizabeth was somewhat more prepared than before to respond to him, intending to remain calm if indeed he wanted to meet them. For a moment, she thought he seemed to want to take a different path. He disappeared around a bend, then suddenly appeared before them. With just a glance, she saw that he maintained the same courteous demeanor as before, and to mimic his manner, when they faced each other, she began to praise the scenery there. But before she could say more than ""beautiful"" or ""charming,"" she remembered something, and she imagined that he might misunderstand her praise of Pemberley. She blushed deeply and said nothing more.",13.59,13.369,"They entered the forest, bidding farewell to the river for a while; they descended several slopes; at points where the clearings among the trees allowed the eye to wander, they caught magnificent views of the valley, the opposite hills, the distant forests covering many hills, and occasionally a part of the river. Mr. Gardiner said he wanted to explore the entire grove, but he feared it might not be possible to do so on foot. With a triumphant smile, they were told that the grove was ten miles in diameter. This settled the matter; they followed the usual path, which after a while led them down a slope through drooping trees to the water's edge, at one of its narrowest points. They crossed a simple bridge made in a style suitable to the atmosphere of the surroundings; it was a less adorned place than the areas they had previously explored; here the valley narrowed, allowing space only for the river and a narrow path winding through the bushes along the river. Elizabeth wanted to follow the path; but when they crossed the bridge and realized how far they were from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a vigorous walker, could go no further and was eager to return to the carriage as soon as possible. Her niece had to agree, and they walked towards the house by a shortcut on the opposite side of the river; they moved slowly because, although Mr. Gardiner could not spare the time, he was very keen on fishing and would get absorbed in watching a trout in the water, talking about trout, and hardly walking at all. As they walked at this slow pace, something else surprised them; seeing Mr. Darcy approaching them and not far away at all, Elizabeth was once again as astonished as before. Because the path on that side of the river was less sheltered than the one on the opposite side, they could see him before coming face to face with him. Although Elizabeth was surprised, she was at least more prepared to speak than before and decided to appear and speak calmly if Mr. Darcy indeed intended to talk to them. For a few minutes, she really thought he would take another path. As a bend in the path hid him from view, they continued, then the bend was passed, and they found him right in front of them. At a glance, Elizabeth saw that he had not lost his previous courtesy; and to reciprocate his politeness, as they came face to face, she began to express how much she admired the beauty of the surroundings, but she could not get beyond the words ""magnificent"" and ""extraordinary"" when some unfortunate memories intervened, and she thought that praising Pemberley might be misunderstood. She blushed and fell silent.",22.428,22.247,"They penetrated the forest and, moving away from the stream for a while, climbed to one of the highest points, from which, through the clearings of the trees, one could extend the view and appreciate magnificent panoramas of the valley and the opposite hills covered with woodland, and parts of the stream could also be seen. Mr. Gardiner would have liked to tour the entire estate, but he feared the walk would be too long. With a triumphant smile, the gardener told them that the estate was ten miles long, so they decided not to take the planned tour and headed back down to a slope with trees leaning over the water at one of the narrowest points of the stream. They crossed it by a simple bridge in harmony with the general aspect of the landscape. That spot was the least adorned with artifices of all they had seen. The valley, turned into a glen here, left only space for the stream and a narrow path in the middle of the rustic grove that bordered it. Elizabeth wanted to explore its twists and turns, but as soon as they crossed the bridge and could appreciate how far they were from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not fond of walking, did not want to go any further and only thought of returning to the carriage as soon as possible. Her niece was forced to yield, and they began the return to the house on the opposite side of the stream and by the shortest path. But they walked very slowly because Mr. Gardiner was fond of fishing, although he seldom had the chance to indulge in it, and he was distracted every so often by watching for the appearance of a trout and commenting on it with the gardener. As they continued their slow march, they were surprised again; and this time Elizabeth's astonishment was as great as before when she saw Darcy heading towards them and at a short distance. Since the path was not as hidden as the one on the other side, they saw each other from afar. Therefore, Elizabeth was more prepared and resolved to show calmness in her appearance and words if Darcy indeed intended to approach them. There was a moment when she firmly believed that Darcy was going to take another path, and her conviction lasted while a bend in the path hid him, but after passing the bend, Darcy appeared before them. At the first glance, she noticed that he was as courteous as a moment ago, and to imitate his good manners, she began to admire the beauty of the place; but she had barely said ""delightful"" and ""charming"" when she thought that praising Pemberley might be misinterpreted. She changed color and said no more.",20.35,20.164
1387,"Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought she, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of fashion.”","Mrs. Gardiner stood behind her. When she stopped speaking, he asked if she could grant him the honor of being introduced to her companions. This was a courtesy that completely surprised her, and she could hardly conceal a smile when she saw that he wanted to be acquainted with the very people who had stirred his pride. She thought, ""How surprised he will be when he knows who they are!"" He must think they are people of high society.",16.068,14.958,"Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; when Elizabeth paused, Mr. Darcy asked her to introduce him to her friends. This was a gesture of courtesy for which Elizabeth was quite unprepared, and she could barely suppress a smile when she saw that he now wanted to be introduced to the same people whom his pride had previously rejected. ""How surprised he will be,"" she thought, ""when he finds out who they are! He thinks they are from high society.""",26.601,25.846,"Mrs. Gardiner was coming a little behind, and Darcy took advantage of Elizabeth's silence to ask her to do him the honor of introducing him to her friends. Elizabeth was not prepared for this gesture of courtesy, and she could not help but smile at seeing that he intended to meet one of those people against whom his pride had rebelled when he declared himself to her. ""What will his surprise be,"" she thought, ""when he finds out who they are? He imagines they are people of high rank.""",19.865,18.84
1388,"The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was surprised by the connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and, so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.","However, she still introduced the two sides to each other. When she informed him about the relationship between the two people and herself, she cunningly watched his reaction, thinking he would flee as quickly as possible to avoid associating with such lowly individuals. Clearly, his face showed surprise, but he stubbornly suppressed it; instead of walking away, he turned to look at them and started a conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction, a sense of victory. She found comfort in the fact that he should know she had relationships she was not ashamed of. She attentively listened to their exchange, delighted with every word her uncle spoke that demonstrated his intelligence, his taste, or his gentle demeanor.",16.479,15.849,"However, the introduction was made immediately; while Elizabeth was explaining their kinship, she cast a furtive glance at Mr. Darcy's face to see how he would react; she did not entirely expect him to quickly distance himself from such lowly friends. Mr. Darcy was clearly surprised by the kinship; nevertheless, he endured this information with composure, and instead of walking away, he turned to the other side with them and began conversing with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth felt joy, she felt the intoxication of victory. It was reassuring to have relatives who were not disgraceful, and for Mr. Darcy to know this. She listened to the conversation between them with great attention and took pride in every expression, every sentence of her uncle; he was showing himself to be an intelligent, tasteful, and cultured man.",16.84,16.149,"He made the introduction promptly and, upon mentioning the relationship, quickly glanced at Darcy to see his reaction, hoping he would hastily flee from such company. It was evident that Darcy was surprised, but he composed himself and instead of continuing on his way, he turned back with all of them and began conversing with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth couldn't help but feel satisfied and triumphant. It was comforting that Darcy knew she had relatives of whom there was no need to be ashamed. She listened attentively to what they were saying and took pride in her uncle's phrases and remarks that demonstrated his intelligence, good taste, and excellent manners.",12.828,12.071
1389,"The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for me, it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.”","The conversation shifted to the topic of fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy, with utmost politeness, invite him to fish there whenever he wished, offering to lend him his fishing gear and pointing out the best spots. Mrs. Gardiner, walking hand in hand with Elizabeth, looked at her with astonishment. Elizabeth said nothing, but felt extremely pleased; all good thoughts were for her. However, she was utterly astonished, and kept wondering: ""Why has he changed so much? Where did this come from? It can't be because of me, it can't be for me that his attitude has become so gentle. My scolding him at Huntsford couldn't have made him change this much. There's no way he still loves me.""",14.891,14.213,"The conversation quickly turned to fishing; he heard that Mr. Darcy had very kindly invited him to fish as often as he wished while he was in the area, had also offered to give him fishing tackle, and had shown him the spots in the river where the catch was most abundant. Mrs. Gardiner, walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look of astonishment. Elizabeth said nothing, but she was extremely proud of the situation; the compliment must have been entirely directed at her. Nevertheless, her astonishment was very great, and she kept repeating to herself, ""Why has he changed so much? What can be inferred from this? The softening of his actions cannot be for me, it cannot be for my sake. My words at Hunsford cannot have caused such a change. It is impossible that he still loves me.""",30.199,29.738,"The conversation soon turned to fishing, and Elizabeth heard Darcy inviting her uncle to go fishing there whenever he wanted while they were in the neighboring town, even offering to provide him with gear and pointing out the best spots on the river for fishing. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, looked at her with an expression of disbelief. Elizabeth said nothing, but she was extremely pleased; Darcy's attentions must surely be directed at her. Her astonishment, however, was extraordinary and she couldn't stop repeating to herself: ""Why is he so changed? It can't be because of me, it can't be for my sake that his manners have softened so much. My reproaches in Hunsford cannot have effected such a transformation. It's impossible that he still loves me.""",25.752,25.283
1390,"After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”","After having walked such a distance, with two women in front and two men behind, and as they went down near the riverbank to observe some strange aquatic plant, they wanted to make a slight change. This was because Mrs. Gardiner, tired from the long distance, saw that Elizabeth could not support her, so she wanted to lean on her husband. Mr. Darcy took Mrs. Gardiner's place, and they walked together. After a moment of silence, Elizabeth began to speak. She wanted him to understand clearly that she had heard he was absent before she came here, so she remarked that his return was completely unexpected. She continued: - Because your housekeeper assured us that you would definitely return tomorrow; and in fact, before we left Bakewell, we were informed that you would not return soon. He accepted that she was sincere, because he had little work with the butler so he had to return earlier than his friends. He continued: - They will come here tomorrow morning, among them are a few people you know – Mr. Bingley and his sisters.",15.004,14.554,"Two ladies in front, two gentlemen behind, after walking this way for a while, there was a small change in the situation after descending to the riverbank to better examine a strange water plant. Mrs. Gardiner, tired from the morning walk, did not get enough support from Elizabeth's arm and eventually preferred her husband's arm. Mr. Darcy took his place beside his niece and they walked together. After a short silence, Elizabeth spoke first. She wanted him to know that she was sure he wasn't there before they arrived and said his arrival was very sudden – ""your steward,"" she added, ""said you wouldn't come before tomorrow; we even learned before leaving Bakewell that you wouldn't come to the village nearby."" Mr. Darcy confirmed these were true; he said his business with the steward caused him to arrive a few hours earlier than the rest of the group they traveled with. ""They will join me early tomorrow,"" he continued, ""and among them are those who know you, –Mr. Bingley and his sisters.""",18.605,18.194,"After walking for a while in this manner, the two ladies in front and the two gentlemen behind, upon resuming their path after descending to the riverbank to get a better look at a curious aquatic plant, there was a change of pairs. This was initiated by Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the day's exertions, found Elizabeth's arm too weak to support her and therefore preferred her husband's arm. Darcy then positioned himself beside the niece, and they continued their walk in this way. After a short silence, Elizabeth spoke. She wanted to let him know that before going to Pemberley, she had made sure that he was not there and that their arrival was completely unexpected. ––Your housekeeper ––he added–– informed us that you wouldn't arrive until tomorrow; and even before leaving Bakewell, we were told that you would be delayed in returning to Derbyshire. Darcy acknowledged that it was so, but some matters he had to resolve with his steward had forced him to go ahead of his companions. ––Tomorrow morning ––he continued–– they will all meet with me. Among them are your acquaintances who will wish to see you; Mr. Bingley and his sisters.",19.752,19.342
1391,"Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged.","Elizabeth only responded with a slight nod. Her thoughts flashed back to the time, that day, when the two of them mentioned Mr. Bingley's name, and if she guessed correctly from his expression, he was having the same thought.",16.006,12.641,"Elizabeth merely nodded slightly in response. Her thoughts suddenly returned to the last time Mr. Bingley's name was mentioned among them; from what she could tell from his face, Mr. Darcy's mind was not occupied with anything very different.",11.035,8.283,"Elizabeth did nothing more than a slight nod of her head. She instantly remembered the last time Bingley's name had been mentioned between them, and judging by Darcy's expression, he must have been thinking the same thing.",9.582,7.089

Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?”","He continued after a moment of silence: - There is someone else in the group who wants to get to know you.

1393,"The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.","She was surprised again, to the point that she did not know how to respond affirmatively. She immediately thought that any desire of Miss Darcy to get acquainted with her must have been orchestrated by her brother. It was quite encouraging to know that although he was upset with her, he did not actually think ill of her.",11.79,9.48,"The astonishment caused by this request was great; he felt a tremendous desire to know how he had attained this privilege. He immediately sensed that Miss Darcy's desire to meet him must have been the result of her brother's words, and without looking further, he found this explanation sufficient; it was pleasing to see that his resentment had not led him to think ill of Elizabeth.",14.37,12.766,"Elizabeth was left speechless. She could not imagine how Miss Darcy could intend such a thing; but she immediately understood that this desire was her brother's doing, and without drawing any further conclusions, it seemed very flattering to her. It was pleasant to know that Darcy did not hold a grudge against her.",6.977,5.245
1394,"They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.","Two people walked in silence, each immersed in their own thoughts. Elizabeth was uncomfortable, as it could not be otherwise, but she felt smug and pleased. His intention to introduce his sister to her was the best thing he could offer her.

1395,"He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.","Then he invited her into the house, but she said she did not feel tired, and they stood together on the lawn.

1410,"ELIZABETH had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently, resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.","Elizabeth guessed that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her on the very day she arrived at Pemberley, so she planned not to stray far from the inn that entire morning. But she was mistaken, for the very morning after they arrived in Lambton, their two guests came. The three had strolled around the area with a few new friends; just as they returned to the inn to change clothes for a meal with these friends' family, they heard the sound of a carriage, and through the window, they saw a man and a woman driving a two-wheeled carriage along the road. Immediately, Elizabeth recognized the noble attire, expressing her surprise to her uncle and aunt about the honor their guests were bestowing upon her. The uncle and aunt were equally astonished. The awkwardness when she spoke to them, combined with the current situation and many past situations, led them to a new thought. Nothing had been said about this before, but now they thought there was no other way to explain such attentions from the upper class, except for the affection they had for their niece. While these ideas passed through their minds, Elizabeth's state of anxiety grew higher and higher. She found it strange that she was losing her composure, but among the reasons for her agitation, she feared that his feelings for her might have spoken too highly of her to his sister. More than the anxiety of wanting to please, she feared that she no longer had the ability to please anyone at all.",19.034,18.679,"Elizabeth had arranged for Mr. Darcy to bring his sister to visit the day after they arrived at Pemberley; therefore, she decided not to leave the inn's vicinity throughout the morning.

Elizabeth immediately recognized the coachman's uniform, guessed its meaning, and surprised her relatives just as much by announcing the expected visit. Her uncle and aunt were astonished; their discomfort in their movements while speaking, combined with the situation itself and the events of the previous day, sparked a new idea about the matter in their minds. Nothing had suggested this possibility before, but now they felt that the only explanation for such attention from such a place could be an interest in their niece. As these new thoughts passed through their minds, the confusion of Elizabeth's feelings increased every moment. She was surprised at her own agitation; but among other reasons for discomfort, she most feared that the brother had praised her too much; she wanted to appear pleasing, but she was afraid that nothing she did would be enough to achieve that.",17.291,16.901,"Elizabeth had calculated that Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the day after their arrival at Pemberley, and consequently, she resolved not to lose sight of the inn all that morning.

Elizabeth instantly recognized the livery of the footmen, guessed what it meant, and left her uncles astonished by informing them of the honor that awaited them. They were frightened; that visit, Elizabeth's bewilderment, and the circumstances of the previous day made them form a new idea of the matter. There had been nothing to suggest it before, but now they realized that there was no other way to explain Darcy's attentions than by supposing him interested in their niece. While they were thinking about all this, Elizabeth's agitation increased by the moment. She was alarmed by her own bewilderment, and among the other causes of her unease was the idea that Darcy, in his enthusiasm, might have spoken of her to his sister with too much praise.

But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply, he added, “It is above eight months.

But, although this might have been mere imagination, she could not be deceived by his attitude towards Miss Darcy, who had been presented as Jane's rival. Neither of them showed any signs of affection. Nothing occurred between the two that could justify Miss Darcy's hopes. She felt immediately satisfied on this point, and there were a few small incidents before they parted, which, in her eager interpretation, indicated that he had fleeting recollections of Jane, marked by a gentle demeanor and a desire to inquire further about something that might lead to mentioning Jane, if he dared. While the others were conversing, he spoke to her in a voice tinged with regret, saying that it had been a long time since he last saw Jane, and before she could respond, he added that it had been over eight months since the 26th of October when they danced together at Netherfield.",21.432,21.04,"Upon seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally turned to her sister; oh, how she wished she knew if his thoughts were directed to the same place! Sometimes it seemed to her that Bingley spoke less than he used to; indeed, once or twice she was delighted by the thought that he was trying to find traces of resemblance while looking at her. These could be mere figments of her imagination, but she could not be mistaken about his behavior towards Miss Darcy, who was set up as a rival to Jane. Neither party's looks indicated any special interest. There was nothing between them that could justify her sisters' hopes. She was quickly satisfied on this point; indeed, before their departure, there were a few small incidents which, according to Elizabeth's eager interpretation, showed that he remembered Jane and wanted to say something more that could lead to her being mentioned, but did not dare to. At a moment when the others were talking among themselves, he said to Elizabeth in a voice filled with genuine regret, ""It has been a very long time since I had the pleasure of seeing her;"" and before Elizabeth could respond, he added, ""It has been over eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, the day we danced at Netherfield.""",27.241,26.924,"Upon seeing Bingley, Elizabeth's thoughts naturally flew to her sister, and she diligently observed whether any of his thoughts were going in the same direction. She deluded herself into thinking that he spoke less than on other occasions, and once or twice she took pleasure in the idea that, when he looked at her, Bingley was trying to find a resemblance. But, even if all that were just her fantasies, she could not be mistaken about his behavior towards Miss Darcy, who had been spoken of as Jane's presumed rival. She did not notice a single glance from either of them that could justify the hopes of Bingley's sister. Regarding this matter, she was completely satisfied. Before they left, she still noticed from two or three small details that Bingley remembered Jane tenderly and seemed to want to say something more but did not dare. At a moment when the others were conversing, he said it in a sorrowful tone: ––How long it has been since I had the pleasure of seeing you! And, before Elizabeth had time to respond, he added: ––About eight months ago. We hadn't seen each other since the twenty-sixth of November when we all danced together at Netherfield.",23.182,22.842
1419,"Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.","Elizabeth was pleased to see that his memory was so accurate, and then taking advantage of the opportunity when no one was standing next to them, he asked her if all her sisters were at Longbourn. The question was not much, just like the previous one, but with an attitude and gesture that conveyed some meaning.",21.337,19.721,"Elizabeth was pleased to see that her memory was so strong; later, finding an opportunity when the others were not around, she asked if all her sisters were at Longbourn. There was nothing much in the question, nor in the answer that came, but there was a look and a manner that gave them meaning.",43.861,42.97,"Elizabeth was glad to see that her memory did not fail her. Then, taking advantage of the others being distracted, she asked him if all his sisters were at Longbourn. Neither the question nor the previous memory were important, but Bingley's look and gesture were very significant.",11.647,9.649
1420,"It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.","She did not often look at Mr. Darcy, but whenever she glanced at him, she always noticed a kind demeanor, and in every word he spoke, she detected a tone that no longer seemed arrogant or disdainful. This convinced her that the improvement in his character, which she had noticed before, had lasted for more than just two days. When she saw him wanting to get acquainted and win the approval of people he had not wanted to associate with a few months ago, when she saw him being polite not only to her but also to those he had previously openly scorned, and recalled the vivid scene at the Huntsford Parsonage; the differences, the changes were so great, striking her consciousness so strongly, that she could hardly contain her expression of astonishment. Never, even when he was among his close friends at Netherfield, or his noble relatives at Rosings, had she seen him so eager to please others, so devoid of arrogance, or as comfortable as he was now, while gaining no significant benefit from this attitude, even though this interaction would cause the ladies at Netherfield and Rosings to mock and criticize him.",18.616,18.201,"She could not often turn her eyes towards Mr. Darcy; but whenever she did catch a glimpse of him, she saw a general expression of politeness, and in everything he said, she heard a tone of voice that was far removed from arrogance or disdain towards his companions, which convinced her that the improvement in his behavior she had witnessed yesterday, even if temporary, had lasted for more than just a day. Seeing him seek opportunities to meet people he would have been ashamed to encounter a few months ago, and trying to win their approval, and observing him being courteous not only to her but also to the relatives he had previously openly scorned, and recalling the last lively scenes at the parsonage in Hunsford, the difference and change seemed so great and made such a strong impression on her mind that she could not help but show her astonishment. She had never seen him so eager to be liked, whether among his dear friends at Netherfield or his noble relatives at Rosings, and so far removed from self-importance or pretentiousness, even though his efforts would bring him no benefit and his acquaintance with the people he was showing kindness to would lead to the mockery and disapproval of the ladies at Netherfield and Rosings.",19.292,18.817,"Elizabeth did not look at Darcy very often; but when she did, she saw in him an expression of contentment and in what he said she perceived a tone that erased all disdain or haughtiness towards his companions, and convinced her that the improvement in his character that she had witnessed the previous day, even if fleeting, had lasted, at least, until now. Seeing him trying to be sociable, seeking the good opinion of those present, with whom having any dealings a few months ago would have meant disgrace for him; seeing him so courteous, not only with her, but with the very relatives he had despised, and remembering the violent scene at the parsonage in Hunsford, the difference, the change was so great, that she could barely prevent her astonishment from becoming visible. Never, neither in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, nor in that of his haughty relatives at Rosings, had she found him so eager to please, so devoid of self-importance or reserve, as now when no vanity could be gained from the success of his endeavor, and when dealing with those he showered with attentions would have been censured and ridiculed by the ladies of Netherfield and Rosings.",26.98,26.636
1421,"Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.","The three people stayed for just over half an hour. When they stood up to say goodbye, Mr. Darcy asked his sister to join him in inviting Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner and Miss Bennet to dine at Pemberley before their departure. Miss Darcy readily obeyed, though with a lack of confidence in extending the invitation, due to her nature. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, as she was the main subject of the invitation, to see how she would respond, but Elizabeth had turned away. However, she guessed that this was due to shyness rather than a desire to refuse; and seeing that her husband enjoyed socializing, she suggested that her niece accept, and they arranged to meet two days later.",22.979,22.448,"The guests stayed with them for more than half an hour; when they got up to leave, Mr. Darcy turned to his sister and asked her to join him in expressing the desire to see Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner and Miss Bennet again for dinner at Pemberley before they left the area. Miss Darcy, though shyly indicating her lack of habit in making invitations, complied with the request. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece to see if she, the person most concerned with the invitation, was inclined to accept, but Elizabeth had turned her head away. However, assuming that this eager avoidance indicated momentary discomfort rather than displeasure with the offer, and seeing in her husband a complete willingness to accept, she accepted the invitation; the next day was agreed upon.",27.328,26.815,"The visit lasted about half an hour, and when they stood up to say goodbye, Darcy asked his sister to support the invitation to the Gardiners and Miss Bennet, so that they would come to dine at Pemberley before leaving the area.

Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece to see how she, to whom the invitation was directed, would receive it; but Elizabeth had turned her head away.

1422,"Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.","Bingley expressed genuine joy at the prospect of seeing Elizabeth again, as he still had many things he wanted to discuss with her and many questions to ask about his friends at Netherfield. Elizabeth was pleased, thinking he wanted to hear her talk about her sister. When the guests had left, Elizabeth reflected on the recent events and felt satisfied. Desiring privacy and wary of her uncle and aunt's questions or insinuations, she lingered only a moment to hear them praise Bingley, then excused herself to go change her clothes.",7.665,6.501,"Bingley said that he was very happy to see Elizabeth again, that he still had much to tell her and many questions to ask about their friends in Hertfordshire. Elizabeth, attributing all this to his desire to hear news about her sister, was pleased; therefore, and for some other reasons as well, she found that she could think back on the last half hour with a certain satisfaction after the guests had left, even though it had not seemed very enjoyable at the time. She wanted to be alone, fearing questions or insinuations from her uncle and aunt, and stayed with them just long enough to learn their positive opinions about Bingley, then hurriedly went to change her clothes.",19.72,18.906,"Bingley expressed his delight at knowing he would see Elizabeth again, as he still had many things to tell her and many questions to ask about all the friends in Hertfordshire. Elizabeth believed she understood that he wished to hear her speak of her sister, and she was very pleased.

1423,"But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.","But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; they did not want to press her to disclose anything. They clearly saw that she was more acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had thought; and it was also evident that he loved her deeply. They had noticed many things worthy of their attention, but there was nothing that needed to be asked.",33.658,32.668,"However, there was no reason for Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner to fear their curiosity; they did not intend to force her to talk. It was clear that Elizabeth knew Mr. Darcy much better than they had previously realized; it was also clear that Mr. Darcy was deeply in love with her. They were seeing interesting things, but there was no need to ask questions.",23.309,21.829,"But she was very wrong to fear the curiosity of the Gardiners, who had no intention of making her talk. It was evident that her relationship with Darcy was much more serious than they had believed, and it was clearer than water that he was deeply in love with her.

1424,"Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.","Regarding Mr. Darcy, this is a matter of concern that requires her to think clearly. According to the acquaintance they have just established, the couple did not find anything lacking. They could not be indifferent to his courteous demeanor, and if they judged him based on their feelings combined with the housekeeper's affection but disregarded other opinions, those who knew him in Hertfordshire would not recognize this as Mr. Darcy. However, now is the time to consider whether to trust the housekeeper or not. They realized that it would not be wise to hastily dismiss the opinion of a respectable servant who had known him since he was four. They also did not hear their friends in Lambton speak ill of him. These people had nothing to accuse him of except pride. Perhaps he is proud, or it could be that those living in a small town who are less acquainted with him said so. However, they acknowledged that he was a generous person who had done many good deeds for the poor.",16.338,15.799,"Thinking well of Mr. Darcy was now a matter of concern; throughout their acquaintance, they had seen no fault in him. It was impossible not to be impressed by his politeness; if they had drawn his character from their own feelings and the words of his servant without resorting to anyone else's expression, the Hertfordshire community who knew him could not recognize this Mr. Darcy. However, there was also meaning in believing the steward; they realized that the testimony of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own behavior exuded respectability could not be easily disregarded. There was nothing known by their friends in Lambton that could significantly lessen the weight of this. They could not accuse him of anything other than pride; he was probably proud, but even if he were not, the residents of a small market town that the family did not visit would somehow attach that label to him. On the other hand, it was accepted that he was a generous man, and that he did much good for the poor and needy.",28.337,27.894,"The important thing now was that Darcy was a good boy. As far as they could have appreciated, he had no faults. His kindnesses had moved them, and if they had had to describe his character according to their own opinion and according to the reports of their maid, disregarding any other reference, they would have done so in such a way that the Hertfordshire circle who knew him would not have recognized him. They now wished to give credit to the housekeeper and soon agreed that the testimony of a maid who had known him since he was four years old and who seemed so respectable, could not be questioned. On the other hand, there was nothing in what his friends from Lambton said that could diminish the weight of that testimony. They accused him of nothing more than pride; proud he may have been, but even if he had not been, the inhabitants of that small commercial town, where the Pemberley family never went, would have attributed the label to him just the same. But they said he was very generous and did a lot of good among the poor.",15.855,15.245
1425,"With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.","As for Wickham, the couple did not think highly of him. Although they did not fully understand what he complained about regarding the son of the patron who took care of him, they knew one thing for sure: when he left Derbyshire, he left behind many debts that Mr. Darcy had to settle afterward.",9.899,7.785,"As for Wickham, the travelers learned that he was not held in high regard there; although most of his troubles, particularly those involving his master's son, were not well known, it was a well-known fact that he had left behind a considerable amount of debt when he departed from Derbyshire, and that these debts were later paid off by Mr. Darcy.",18.846,17.028,"As for Wickham, the travelers soon saw that he was not held in high regard there; the main details of his relationship with his master's son were unknown, but it was well known that upon leaving Derbyshire he had left behind a multitude of debts that Darcy had paid.",14.089,12.051
1426,"As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;—gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.","As for Elizabeth, her thoughts about Pemberley tonight were even more complicated than the day before. Although the evening seemed to pass slowly, it was not slow enough for her to determine her feelings for a certain resident of that estate, and she lay awake for two hours trying to find an answer. Surely, she did not hate him. No, the thought of hatred had long vanished, and for a long time, she had felt ashamed of having harbored such thoughts, one might say. The respect born from her belief in his noble qualities, although initially she did not want to admit it, no longer conflicted with her feelings. Now, that respect had grown to a more intimate level, through her good opinions of him, making him more likable, as past events had shown. But above all, above respect and affection, there was in her a driving force of goodwill that could not be ignored. It was emotion. Emotion not just because someone loved her, but because he loved her so deeply that he forgave all her impulsiveness and sharpness when rejecting his proposal, and forgave all the unjust accusations that followed the rejection. She had thought he would avoid her like the worst enemy; but when he unexpectedly met her again, he seemed to want to maintain a relationship with her. Without any lack of tact or odd gestures, he had won the good opinion of her relatives and even wanted his sister to become acquainted with her. Such a change in a very proud man not only astonished her but also moved her – for this was due to love, deep love. Therefore, the impression within her was something that should be encouraged, certainly not unpleasant, though it could not be clearly defined. She respected him, liked him, was moved by him. She genuinely cared about his happiness. She only wanted to know how much she desired that his happiness depended on her and how much she would use her abilities for the happiness of both. She thought she still had the ability to lead him to propose to her again.",18.559,18.304,"Elizabeth's thoughts this evening were even more focused on Pemberley than the previous evening; the evening hours seemed long as they passed, but not long enough for her to understand her feelings for someone at that estate; she lay awake for two hours trying to make sense of her emotions. Of course, she did not hate him. No; the hatred had passed long ago, and Elizabeth had almost been ashamed of the coldness she had felt towards him since then. The respect that his superior qualities had aroused, though initially accepted reluctantly, had for some time ceased to be repulsive to her; moreover, thanks to the praise spoken about him, he now appeared in a more friendly light, and his character was shown in a very charming light that had emerged yesterday. But more than anything, more than respect and trust, there was a feeling of goodwill within Elizabeth that she could not ignore. It was gratitude. –Not just gratitude for once loving him, but gratitude for loving him enough to forgive all the rudeness and irritability in her manner of rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations that accompanied them. When she should have seen him as her greatest enemy and avoided him, he had shown willingness to maintain their friendship when they met by chance, had tried to win the hearts of her friends without the discourtesy of limiting his attention to her, and had decided to introduce her to his sister. Such a change in a man so proud not only aroused astonishment but also gratitude –for it must have been because of love, passionate love; thus, the effect on Elizabeth was not irritating but rather of a kind that sought encouragement, though it was not clear exactly what it was. She felt respect, appreciation, and gratitude towards him, and sincerely wished for his well-being; she just wanted to know to what extent she wished that well-being to be tied to herself, Elizabeth, and to what extent her imagination, which still told her she had the power, would take their happiness if he used the power to renew his proposal.",17.672,17.4,"Elizabeth thought about Pemberley that night even more than the previous one. It seemed very long to her, but not long enough to determine her feelings towards one of the inhabitants of the mansion. After going to bed, she stayed awake for two hours trying to decipher them. She did not hate him, no; the hatred had vanished long ago, and for almost all that time she had been ashamed of having felt a dislike towards that person that could bear such a name. The respect due to his valuable qualities, although admitted at first against her will, had contributed to the cessation of the hostility of her feelings, and these had evolved into affectionate ones in light of the significant testimony in his favor that she had heard and the good disposition he himself had shown the previous day. But above all that, above respect and esteem, Elizabeth felt another impulse of benevolence towards Darcy that could not be overlooked. It was gratitude; gratitude not only for having loved her, but for still loving her enough to forget all the petulance and sharpness of her rejection and all the unjust accusations that accompanied it. He, who should consider her ––so Elizabeth supposed–– as his greatest enemy, upon meeting her by chance seemed eager to maintain her friendship, and without any display of indelicacy or affectation in his manner, in a matter that only concerned the two of them, sought the good opinion of her friends and decided to introduce her to his sister. Such a change in a man so proud not only had to inspire astonishment, but also gratitude, for it had to be attributed to love, to a passionate love. But, although this impression was encouraging and very contrary to dislike, she could not define it precisely. She respected him, esteemed him, was grateful to him, and earnestly wished for his happiness. She only needed to know to what extent she wished that happiness to depend on her, and to what extent it would result in the happiness of both if she used the power she imagined she still possessed to induce him to renew his proposal.",23.785,23.559
1427,"It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley—for she had reached it only to a late breakfast—ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.","In the evening, the aunt and the niece agreed that according to the standards of etiquette on their part, they needed to return the visit to Miss Darcy, who had been extremely courteous when she visited them immediately upon returning to Pemberley, even though their return visit could not be equivalent.

They would go, that is. –Elizabeth was happy, but when she asked herself why she was happy, she couldn't find much of an answer.",12.784,11.507,"In the afternoon, the aunt and niece agreed that such an extraordinary attention as the visit from Miss Darcy on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley—where she had arrived shortly after breakfast—should be reciprocated, if not with something equivalent, at least with some special courtesy.

The wide-open windows offered a refreshing view of the tall, forested hills behind the building, and of the beautiful oaks and chestnut trees of Spain scattered across the meadow that stretched out in front of the house.",23.246,21.803
1432,"In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.","They were received by Miss Darcy; she was sitting with Mrs. Hunts and Miss Bingley, along with a lady who lived with her in London. Georgiana was very polite in receiving the two, but with a confused manner due to shyness and the fear of making mistakes, which could make someone of lower class mistakenly think that she was proud and fastidious. However, Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth thought rightly of her, feeling sorry for her.",21.586,20.482,"They were greeted in this room by Miss Darcy; Miss Darcy was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst, Miss Bingley, and a lady from London. Georgiana greeted them very politely; but there was no lack of that discomfort stemming from shyness and the fear of making mistakes, which could make those who felt inferior to her think she was proud and distant. Nevertheless, Mrs. Gardiner and her niece gave her credit and felt sorry for her.",26.825,25.906,"In that room, they were received by Miss Darcy, who was waiting for them along with Mrs. Hurst, Miss Bingley, and her companion. Georgiana's welcome was very courteous, but dominated by that shyness due to her timidity and the fear of doing things wrong, which had given her a reputation of being proud and reserved among her inferiors. But Mrs. Gardiner and her niece understood and sympathized with her.",28.806,28.008
1433,"By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.","Mrs. Hunts and Miss Bingley only inclined their heads to greet them. After everyone sat down, there was an awkward moment, broken by Mrs. Annesley. She was a gentle, pleasant woman; when she wanted to start a conversation, she demonstrated that she was truly better educated than the others. The conversation took place between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with Elizabeth occasionally joining in. It seemed that Miss Darcy needed to muster enough courage to contribute, and she occasionally added a short sentence when there was the least risk of being overheard by others.",15.408,14.547,"Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley greeted them only with a slight bend of the knee; once seated, there was a silence, the kind of awkward silence that can occur in such a situation, and it lasted for a few minutes. The first to break the silence was Mrs. Annesley; she appeared to be a kind and amiable woman, and her attempt to start a conversation showed that she was better bred than the other two; the conversation continued between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth. Miss Darcy seemed to be gathering the courage to join the conversation and sometimes dared to say a brief word when the risk of being heard was at its lowest.",21.316,20.562,"Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley made a simple bow and sat down. An extremely awkward silence ensued, lasting for a few moments. It was interrupted by Mrs. Annesley, a kind and pleasant person who, in attempting to break the ice, showed better manners than any of the other ladies. The conversation continued between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with some contributions from Elizabeth. Miss Darcy seemed to wish she had the confidence to take part in the conversation, and occasionally ventured a short sentence when there was the least danger of being overheard.",23.735,23.107
1434,"Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.","Elizabeth immediately realized that Miss Bingley was observing her closely. This would not have prevented her from joining the conversation if she were not in an inconvenient position, but she did not regret having to speak less. She was preoccupied with the thought that at any moment some gentlemen would enter the room. She both wished for and feared the presence of the master of the estate among them, and she could not discern whether she wished or feared it more. After sitting for a while without hearing Miss Bingley, Elizabeth heard her coldly inquiring about her family's health. She responded with the same coldness and brevity, and Miss Bingley said nothing more.",16.144,15.558,"Elizabeth soon realized that she was under the close watch of Miss Bingley and that she couldn't speak a single word to Miss Darcy without drawing her attention. This observation did not prevent her from trying to talk to her, but there was an inconvenient distance between their seats; however, she was not upset as she was relieved from the obligation of much conversation. Her thoughts were already occupying her. She was expecting some of the gentlemen to enter the room at any moment. She wanted the master of the house to be among them, feared he would be, and couldn't decide whether she wanted it or feared it. After sitting for a quarter of an hour in this manner without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was startled when a cold question about her family's health came from her. She replied with the same indifference and brevity, and the other said nothing more.",26.982,26.401,"Elizabeth immediately realized that Miss Bingley was closely watching her and that she couldn't say a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without the other sharpening her ears. However, her tenacious observation would not have prevented her from speaking with Georgiana if they hadn't been so distant from each other; but she was not distressed by not being able to speak much, as it allowed her to think more freely. She both wished for and feared the arrival of the master of the house, and she could hardly clarify whether she feared it more than she desired it. After being like this for a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth blushed when the latter asked her how her family was. She replied with the same indifference and brevity, and the other said nothing more.",25.23,24.741
1435,"The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table.","The servants brought in cold meats, pastries, and some of the finest seasonal fruits; this was only after Mrs. Annesley had repeatedly glanced and smiled at Miss Darcy to remind her of her position. Now they had something to do, for if they could not talk, they could eat, and they gathered around the table adorned with fresh grapes, tangerines, and peaches.",12.371,11.145,"The second movement during the visit occurred with the entrance of the servants; they brought cold cuts, cake, and various seasonal fruits; but for this movement to happen, Mrs. Annesley had to make numerous gestures to Miss Darcy to remind her of her duty. Now there was something for everyone to occupy themselves with; they couldn't all talk, but they could all eat; seeing the grapes, nectarines, and peaches arranged in marvelous pyramids, they soon gathered around the table.",22.474,21.506,"The first variety of the visit consisted of the appearance of some servants who brought cold cuts, pastries, and some of the best fruits of the season, but this happened after many significant looks from Mrs. Annesley to Georgiana to remind her of her duties. This distracted the gathering, for, although not all the ladies could talk, at least all could eat. The beautiful pyramids of grapes, apricots, and peaches immediately gathered them around the table.",18.583,17.59
1436,"While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.","At that moment, Elizabeth had the opportunity to determine whether she wished for or feared Mr. Darcy's appearance more, through the emotions that arose within her as he entered. Just a moment ago, she believed she wished for it more, but now she began to regret that he had come.",16.992,15.01,"In the midst of this occupation, was Elizabeth afraid of Mr. Darcy's arrival, or did she want him to come?

1437,"He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;—a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,—","He was standing by the river with Mr. Gardiner and a few of his friends when he was informed that there were guests. As soon as he appeared, Elizabeth wisely resolved that she needed to appear completely at ease and not flustered. Thinking it was easy but doing it could be difficult, because when he entered, she felt all the curiosity was focused on the two of them, with every eye keenly observing his demeanor. Miss Bingley's face showed the most attentive curiosity although she always smiled when talking, because jealousy had not yet made her desperate, she had not ceased to pay attention to Mr. Darcy. When she saw her brother enter, Miss Darcy spoke more, and Elizabeth noticed that he wanted her and his sister to become more acquainted, so he tried to draw the two into the conversation. Miss Bingley also knew this, and in a rash moment of anger, she seized the first opportunity to speak, with a polite mocking tone:",10.979,10.428,"Mr. Darcy had been with Mr. Gardiner for a while; Mr. Gardiner was busy at the river with a few gentlemen who were guests at the house, and Mr. Darcy had only left him alone upon learning that the ladies of the family were planning to visit Georgiana that morning. As soon as she entered the room, Elizabeth decided to appear quite at ease and natural – a necessary decision but perhaps not so easy to adhere to, because she saw that the suspicions of everyone in the room were aroused against the two of them and that there was not a single eye that did not follow Mr. Darcy's behavior when he first entered. No one else's face bore such a strongly fixed look of attentive curiosity as Miss Bingley's, even though her face lit up with smiles while speaking to one of the two people who aroused her curiosity; jealousy had not yet exhausted all her hopes, and she had not given up showing interest in Mr. Darcy. Miss Darcy forced herself to talk more upon her brother's arrival; Elizabeth saw that Mr. Darcy wanted his sister and herself to become closer and that he supported every attempt at conversation from both sides as much as he could. Miss Bingley also saw all this and, in the carelessness of her anger, said with a contemptuous interest at the first opportunity,",20.722,20.282,"Darcy had been with Mr. Gardiner, who was fishing in the river with two or three other gentlemen, but upon learning that the ladies of his family planned to visit Georgiana that very morning, he went home. Upon seeing him enter, Elizabeth resolved to appear as natural as possible, a necessary but difficult task, as she was aware that the entire gathering was focused on them, and as soon as Darcy arrived, all eyes turned to examine him. But no face showed curiosity as strongly as Miss Bingley's, despite the smiles she lavished while speaking with anyone; however, her jealousy had not reached the point of making her desist from her attentions to Darcy––. Georgiana, as soon as her brother entered, made more effort to speak, and Elizabeth understood that Darcy wanted the two to become close, for which he encouraged all attempts at conversation from both sides.

1439,"In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.","In front of Darcy, she did not dare to mention Wickham by name, but Elizabeth immediately understood that he was present in her thoughts, and Elizabeth felt a moment of pain when memories of him were mentioned. However, she tried to counter the attack with ill intent, answering the question by distancing herself from the issue. While she spoke, she inadvertently glanced at her brother Darcy and saw his tense, worried face looking at her; meanwhile, her sister showed a confused expression, unable to lift her eyes. If Miss Bingley understood the pain she had caused her dear friend Darcy, she certainly would not have implied such things. She only wanted to embarrass Elizabeth to force her opponent to reveal emotions that could harm Darcy's feelings, perhaps to remind him of the recklessness and impropriety associated with some members of Elizabeth's family involved with the regiment. She knew nothing about Miss Darcy's intention to elope with her lover. The news was not disclosed to anyone except Elizabeth, and Darcy particularly kept it secret from all of Bingley's connections. This stemmed from the very wish that Elizabeth previously thought was his, that the relationships between the two young men would also become her relationships. He certainly had such a plan, and while he had no intention of separating Bingley and Miss Bennet, the plan might have caused him to worry about his friend's happiness.",7.235,6.36,"She did not dare to mention Wickham's name in Darcy's presence; but Elizabeth immediately understood that he was on her mind; various memories related to Wickham briefly troubled her, but she gathered her attention to fend off that malicious attack and answered the question in a very indifferent tone. While speaking, she glanced at Darcy for a moment and saw a serious expression on his face, persistently looking at her, and his sister, unable to lift her eyes, sinking into distress. If Miss Bingley had known how much she was hurting her dear friend at that moment, she undoubtedly would not have made such an insinuation, but she only wanted to upset Elizabeth by mentioning a man she believed she was close to, revealing a sensitivity that could lower him in Darcy's eyes, and perhaps reminding Darcy of all the foolishness and ridiculousness of some of her family members associating with soldiers. Miss Darcy had not heard a single word about the planned elopement. This had been kept as secret as possible from everyone, except Elizabeth; her brother especially wanted to keep it from all of Bingley's relatives due to the same wish Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, namely the wish for Bingley's relatives to be his relatives. Of course, he had made such a plan; although it might not have had an effect on his effort to separate Bingley from Miss Bennet, it could have contributed to his concern for his friend's well-being.",15.725,15.305,"In Darcy's presence, she did not dare to utter Wickham's name, but Elizabeth guessed that he had that name in his thoughts; the various memories it evoked distressed her for a moment, but she composed herself with fortitude to repel that brazen attack and answered the question in a nonchalant tone. In doing so, an involuntary glance made her see Darcy, with his face flushed, watching her intently, and his sister completely confused and unable to lift her eyes. If Miss Bingley could have suspected how much it pained her beloved, she would undoubtedly have refrained; but she had only tried to unsettle Elizabeth by bringing up something related to a man for whom she had been partial, and to provoke her into some misstep that would harm her in Darcy's eyes and, incidentally, remind him of the absurdities and follies of the Bennet family. She did not know a word about Miss Darcy's elopement, as it had been kept strictly secret, and Elizabeth was the only person to whom it had been revealed. Darcy wanted to conceal it from all of Bingley's relatives for that same desire, which Elizabeth had attributed to him for so long, of becoming part of their family. Darcy, in fact, had this purpose, and although it was not for this reason that he sought to separate his friend from Jane, it is likely that it added to his keen interest in Bingley's happiness.",11.366,10.754
1440,"Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.

Her brother no longer remembered much about his sister's affair, and the very circumstances created to distract him from Elizabeth made him pay even more attention to Elizabeth, and he became even more cheerful.",14.696,13.275,"Elizabeth quickly calmed her excitement with her careful demeanor; Georgiana, who was disappointed and bored, gradually recovered as Miss Bingley did not dare to approach Wickham any further, but of course, she could not speak to anyone for a while.

An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!

But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.”","“Dear Lizzy, since writing the above, an unexpected and serious matter has occurred, but I fear you will worry – rest assured that our whole family is healthy.

At least he has no intention of taking advantage of her, for he must know that father has nothing to leave her. Our poor mother is very distressed. Father is bearing it better. I am very glad that we never let them know what people have been saying about him; we should forget these matters.

However, Kitty did not seem so surprised. I am very, very sorry. Such an imprudent union for both sides! – But I prefer to hope for the best and think that we have misunderstood Wickham's character. I can easily believe that he is thoughtless and irresponsible, but this step (I think we should be glad) shows that there is no malice in him.

But I want to hope for the best and that Wickham is not as bad as believed, that he is merely frivolous and indiscreet; for what he has done ––let us be glad of it–– does not indicate a bad heart.

1455,"“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B., intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success,—no such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F.; but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”","“My dear, at this moment you have received the previous letter I wrote in haste. I hope this letter is clearer, but my mind is still confused so perhaps it is still not coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I don't know what to write, but I have bad news for you, which cannot be delayed. Although the marriage between Wickham and the poor girl is imprudent, the family is anxious to hear that they have married, as there are many reasons to fear they did not go to Scotland. Colonel Forster came to the house yesterday, after leaving Brington the day before, a few hours after the urgent news. Although Lydia's letter to Mrs. F. stated that the two intended to go to Gretna Green. Denny has reason to believe that W. never intended to go there, nor to marry Lydia at all. Colonel F. immediately sent out a notice upon hearing this news, then left B. to trace their route. He tracked them to Clapham but lost the trail, as the two traveled there by a small carriage and then switched to a hired carriage. From there, they only know that the two were seen continuing on the road to London. I don't know what to think. After inquiring everywhere on that side of London, Colonel F. went to Hertfordshire, continuing to inquire at the turnings, at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but could not find them, no one had seen such a pair pass through. He was kind enough to visit the house, providing the news in the most reliable way from his heart. I also feel sorry for Mr. and Mrs. F. but no one can blame them. Dear Lizzy, the family is in great distress. Both parents are thinking the worst, but she cannot think ill of her father. Many situations suggest that the two might marry discreetly in the city rather than pursue their original intention, and even if he had such intentions towards a young girl of a lower class like Lydia, unlikely as it may be, would the girl lose much? It cannot be. However, she is saddened to see that Colonel F. does not believe in the marriage; he shook his head when she expressed such a hope, and said he feared W. is not a trustworthy person. The poor mother was really sick and stayed in her room. It would be better if she had more willpower, but one shouldn't count on that. As for the father, she had never seen him so emotional. The parents were angry with poor little Kitty for hiding the matter between the two, but this is a private issue that we cannot question. Dear Lizzy, I am truly happy to see you avoid these painful scenes, but now that the initial shock has passed, can I hope for your return? However, I am not so selfish as to compel you, if it is not convenient. Goodbye. You are picking up the pen to do what you just wrote above that you wouldn't do, because circumstances compel you to earnestly call for you to return as soon as possible. I understand uncle and aunt's nature well, so I am not afraid to make such a request, although I have other matters to ask of him. Father will go to London immediately with Colonel Forster to try to find the girl. I don't know exactly what father intends to do, but he is too distressed to act carefully, while Colonel Forster is obliged to return to Brighton tomorrow night. In this urgent matter, your opinion and support will be very helpful; he will immediately understand what I mean, and I am relying on his goodwill.",21.451,21.319,"""By now, my dear brother, you must have received my hastily written letter; I hope this one is more legible, but although I am not pressed for time, my mind is so unsettled that I may not be able to be coherent. Dear Lizzy, I don't know what to write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. While the idea of a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia was considered imprudent, now we are anxious to be assured that they are married, because there are many reasons to fear that they did not go to Scotland. Colonel Forster arrived yesterday; he had set out from Brighton the day before, just a few hours after the courier. According to the note Lydia wrote to Mrs. F., they were going to Gretna Green, but in the meantime, Denny said that he did not believe W. intended to go there or to marry Lydia; when this was conveyed to Colonel Forster, he immediately became alarmed and set out from B. to follow them. He tracked them easily as far as Clapham but could go no further; for there they had hired a carriage and dismissed the one that had brought them from Epsom. After that, all that is known is that they continued on the road to London. I don't know what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side of London, Colonel F. came to Hertfordshire, searched for them at the toll gates and in Barnet and Hatfield, but to no avail, as no one had seen such persons pass through. He came to Longbourn in distress and told us what he had learned in sorrow. I am truly sorry for him and Mrs. F., but no one can blame them. Our distress, dear Lizzy, is immense. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of W. Instead of carrying out their first plan, they may have found it more suitable for various reasons to marry secretly in town; even if Lydia, in her position, had such intentions, which is impossible, can I think Lydia would disregard everything? –Impossible. On the other hand, Colonel F.'s inclination not to believe they are married greatly distresses me; when I expressed my hopes, he shook his head and said he feared W. was not a trustworthy man. My poor mother is ill, confined to her room. It would be good for her to show herself, but we cannot expect it; as for my father, I have never seen him so upset in my life. Poor Kitty is blamed by everyone for keeping their companionship a secret; but what could she do, things told in confidence. I am truly glad, dear Lizzy, that you are not here to witness these distressing scenes; but now that we have passed the initial shock, may I confess that I wish for your return? However, if it is not convenient, I am not selfish enough to insist. Goodbye. I have taken up my pen again to do what I just said I would not, but the circumstances are such that I cannot help it, I beg you all to come here as soon as possible. Knowing my dear uncle and aunt well, I am not hesitant to make this request, but there is one more thing I ask of them. My father is going to London immediately with Colonel Forster to search for them. I do not know what he intends to do; but his extreme distress will not allow him to conduct any business properly and safely; Colonel Forster must return to Brighton by tomorrow evening. In such an urgent situation, my uncle's advice and assistance would be most beneficial; he will immediately understand what I feel; I rely on his compassion.""",31.945,31.842,"By this time, dearest sister, you will have received my hurried letter. I hope this one is more intelligible; but, although I have time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot be coherent. Dear Eliza, I would rather not write to you, but I have bad news to give you and I cannot delay it. However imprudent the marriage of Wickham and our poor Lydia may be, we are anxious to know that it has already taken place, for there are ample reasons to fear that they have not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster arrived yesterday; he left Brighton a few hours after the couple themselves. Although Lydia's letter to Mrs. Forster implied that they were going to Gretna Green, Denny said that he was aware and that Wickham never intended to go there nor to marry Lydia; upon learning this, Colonel Forster became alarmed and immediately left Brighton with the idea of catching up with them. He indeed followed their trail easily to Clapham, but could not continue further, because upon reaching that point they took a hired carriage, leaving the post chaise that had brought them from Epsom. And nothing more is known except that they were seen taking the road to London. I do not know what to think. After making all possible inquiries from there to London, Colonel Forster came to Hertfordshire to repeat them at all the toll gates and inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any result; no one has seen those persons there. With the greatest regret, he arrived at Longbourn to inform us of everything, in a manner that does him honor. I am truly sorry for him and his wife; no one can reproach them. Our grief is very great. Father and mother expect the worst, but I cannot believe that Wickham is so wicked. Many circumstances may have driven them to marry secretly in the capital instead of following their first plan; and even in the case that he had plotted the ruin of a girl from a good family like Lydia, which is not likely, should I believe her so lost? Impossible. It dismays me, however, to see that Colonel Forster does not trust that they have married; when I expressed my hopes to him, he shook his head and expressed his fear that Wickham is not to be trusted. My poor mother is truly ill and does not leave her room. As for my father, I have never seen him so affected. Poor Catherine is desperate for having concealed Lydia and Wickham's romance, but it is not surprising that the girls confided in each other. Dearest Lizzy, I am sincerely glad that you have been spared these painful scenes. But now that the first blow has passed, I confess that I long for your return. I am not selfish, however, to the extent of asking you to come back if you cannot. Goodbye. I take up the pen again to do what I just told you I would not do, but the circumstances are such that I cannot help but implore the three of you to come as soon as possible. I know our dear uncles so well that I do not doubt they will agree. I also have another request to make of our uncle. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster to see if they can find her. I do not know what they plan to do, but he is so dejected that he will not be able to take the best and most expeditious measures, and Colonel Forster has no choice but to be in Brighton by tomorrow night. In this situation, our uncle's advice and assistance would be of great help. He will understand this; I count on his kindness.",27.239,27.128

But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment, that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural.

In any case, she regretted seeing him leave; and in the first instance of the consequences of Lydia's disgrace, she was even more distressed when recalling this unfortunate event. Since reading Jane's second letter, she had never hoped that Wickham would marry her sister. She thought no one, except Jane, could be complacent with such a hope. In her feelings about this matter, surprise held the smallest place.

Be that as it may, she saw Darcy leave with great sorrow, and this first example of the misfortunes that Lydia's infamy could cause increased the anguish she felt when thinking about that disastrous matter. As soon as she read Jane's second letter, she did not believe that Wickham intended to marry Lydia. No one but Jane could have had that hope. Surprise was the last of her feelings.

You will easily understand from all the details that Mr. Wickham's situation is not as desperate as has been believed. People have been mistaken, and I am pleased to affirm that after all debts are paid, there will still be some money left to endow my niece as an addition to her own fortune. If, as I hope, you send me full powers to act on your behalf in this matter, I will immediately instruct Haggerston to draft the appropriate document. There is no need for you to return to the capital; therefore, stay calm in Longbourn and trust in my diligence and care. Answer me as soon as possible and try to write clearly. We have thought it best for my niece to leave my house to get married, which I have no doubt you will approve. She is coming today. I will write to you again as soon as there is any news.

BENNET had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.","In the past, Mr. Bennet had often wished that instead of spending all his income, he would save a portion each year to later provide for his children and his wife, should she outlive him. Now he wished for this more than ever. If he had fulfilled his duty in this way, Lydia would not have to be indebted to her uncle for having to buy any honor or reputation for her. Thus, the satisfaction of having persuaded one of the most worthless men in England to marry his daughter might have been rightly placed.",20.165,19.115,"Mr. Bennet, before this period of his life, often wanted to set aside a sum of money each year to ensure a better life for his children and wife after his death, instead of spending all his income. He now wished he had done this more than ever. Had he fulfilled this duty, Lydia would not be indebted to her uncle for the respectability or credibility that could now be bought for her. The satisfaction of having persuaded one of the most worthless young men in England to be her husband could then be felt in the right place.",34.274,33.666,"Previously, Mr. Bennet had often wanted to save a certain annual amount to improve the fortune of his daughters and his wife, if she survived him, instead of spending all his income. And now he regretted not having done so. This would have prevented Lydia from indebting herself to her uncle for everything he now had to do for her, both in terms of honor and money. Moreover, he could have had the pleasure of tempting any of the brightest young men in Great Britain to marry her.",19.814,19.007

1656,"When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.","When Mr. Bennet had just gotten married, the couple did not need to think about frugality because, of course, they would have a son, they believed so. This son would inherit the estate as soon as he came of age, and the widowed mother and the sisters would be provided for from this inheritance. The five daughters were born one after another without a son, while Mrs. Bennet, many years after giving birth to Lydia, still believed she would have a son. Eventually, this became hopeless, but it was too late to save up. Mrs. Bennet was not frugal and her husband liked to be free and easy, so for this reason alone they could not prevent overspending their income.",21.926,21.168,"When Mr. Bennet first got married, saving money seemed utterly unnecessary; because surely they would have a son. This son, as soon as he came of age, would remove the mortgage, and his widow and younger children would not suffer from financial difficulties thanks to him. Five daughters came into the world one after another, but still no son; Mrs. Bennet was confident that a son would come even years after Lydia was born. When hope was finally lost for this event, it was too late to start saving. Mrs. Bennet had no understanding of saving, and it was only thanks to her husband's love of independence that they managed not to spend more than they earned.",21.944,21.206,"In the early days of Mr. Bennet's marriage, it was considered that there was no need for economy, as it was assumed that a male heir would be born and that he would inherit the estate upon reaching the appropriate age, thus ensuring the widow and daughters would be provided for. But five daughters were born in succession, and the male heir did not appear. Years after Lydia's birth, Mrs. Bennet still believed that the heir would come, but eventually, she gave up hope.

1657,"Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within that sum.","The marriage terms specified a sum of five thousand pounds for Mrs. Bennet and the children. But how this sum would be divided depended on the will of both Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. Now it was necessary to settle the inheritance finances, at least for Lydia, and Mr. Bennet did not hesitate to meet the immediate demands placed before him. Accompanied by sincere words of gratitude for his brother-in-law's kindness, though concisely expressed, he wrote down his complete approval of all the arrangements made, confirming that he would meet the demands placed upon him. Previously, he had never thought that persuading Wickham to marry his daughter would be so inexpensive for him under the current arrangement. By providing an annual allowance of one hundred pounds for his daughter, he would only spend about ten pounds a year, because with the living expenses and pocket money plus the amounts given by her mother, all the costs for his daughter were now almost equal to that allowance.",15.92,15.355,"As per the conditions of the marriage, five thousand pounds were allocated to Mrs. Bennet and the children.

In terms of appreciating his brother-in-law's kindness, he acknowledged on paper, albeit briefly, that he fully approved of everything that had been done and agreed to fulfill the commitments made on his behalf. It had never occurred to him before that if Wickham could be persuaded to marry his daughter, it could be done without causing him any inconvenience, as stated in the agreement before him. The hundred pounds to be paid to them would either cost him ten pounds a year or not; because with her food, drink, pocket money, and the constant financial support from her mother, Lydia's expenses would only just be covered by that amount.",21.166,20.664,"In the marriage settlements, five thousand pounds were secured for Mrs. Bennet and her daughters; but the distribution depended on the will of the parents. Finally, this point was to be decided concerning Lydia, and Mr. Bennet did not hesitate to agree to the proposal. In terms of gratitude for his brother-in-law's kindness, though expressed very concisely, he entrusted to paper his approval of everything done and his desire to fulfill the commitments made in his name. He would never have believed that Wickham would consent to marry Lydia at the cost of so few inconveniences as those resulting from that arrangement. Ten pounds annually was the most he was going to lose by giving the hundred he had to give them, for between the fixed ordinary expenses, the loose money he gave Lydia, and the continuous cash gifts her mother made to her, little less than that amount was spent on Lydia.",15.26,14.657

To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant farm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery was considered certain.","The good news spread quickly within the house, and just as quickly in the surrounding area. The neighbors added a bit of serious philosophy.

The people around received the news reasonably. Of course, the gossip would have been more enjoyable if Miss Lydia Bennet had fallen into the city streets, or better yet, retreated to a distant farmhouse.

That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible.

She could not comprehend how his anger could lead to such unimaginable resentment, to the point of not wanting to grant his daughter a favor, making the wedding seem hardly legitimate.

His refusal to do such a kindness for his daughter would take the wedding out of the realm of weddings; it was inconceivable that his anger had reached such an unimaginable point of resentment.

1722,"“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you. Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know, that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both—Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he had another motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in —— Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been his design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything being settled between them, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together. They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times; but this is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve, or anybody’s reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair. When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything. It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. He was exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and, as Lydia imformed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour.","Auntie just received your letter, and she spent the entire morning writing a reply, because she anticipated that if she wrote briefly, it wouldn't be enough to convey everything she wants to say to you. I must say that Auntie was surprised when she received your request; she didn't think such a request would come from you. However, don't think that Auntie is upset, because she just wants you to understand that she thinks you don't need to inquire in such a manner. If you don't want to understand Auntie, she apologizes for digressing. Your uncle was just as surprised as Auntie. He did those things only because he thought you were involved. But if you are truly unaware and innocent, Auntie needs to clarify further. ""On the very day you returned home from Longbourn, your uncle received an unexpected guest. Mr. Darcy came to visit, and the two talked for many hours. By the time you arrived, they had finished; therefore, your curiosity was not as tormenting as mine. Mr. Darcy came to inform Mr. Gardiner that he had found the place where your sister and Mr. Wickham were hiding, and he had met and talked with both of them, several times with Wickham, and once with Lydia. If I remember correctly, he left Derbyshire just one day after we returned, and went to the city with the determination to find them. He explained that his motivation in this was because he thought that due to him, not many people were aware of Wickham's true character, otherwise he could have prevented respectable young women from mistakenly falling in love with him. Mr. Darcy blamed his misplaced pride for the entire affair, confessing that he previously thought it beneath him to expose the private actions of the other man to everyone. Therefore, he felt it was his duty to act and try to rectify the mistake he had caused. If Mr. Darcy had any other motivation, I think it would not cause him any shame. “He came to the city and within just a few days found two people, because he had some clues that we didn't have, and his awareness of this was another reason why he was determined to help you search. It seems there was a woman, Mrs. Younge, who was previously a governess for Miss Darcy, but was later dismissed for some reason that Mr. Darcy did not disclose. She moved to a large house on Edward Street, and since then has been living by renting out rooms. Mr. Darcy knew this woman was close to Wickham, so as soon as he arrived in the city, he went to find her to inquire. But it took one or two days for her to give him any information. I think this woman didn't want to betray Wickham's trust unless there was money involved, because she really knew where her friend was staying. In fact, Wickham went to find her as soon as the two of them arrived in London, and if she had the means to accommodate them, they would have stayed at her place. However, in the end, our kind friend Mr. Darcy managed to get the information. He went to meet Wickham, and then insisted on meeting Lydia. Mr. Darcy said his purpose was to persuade her to get out of the disgraceful situation, to return to her family as soon as they showed willingness to take her back and support her. But he found Lydia determined to stay where they were hiding. She didn't care about her family, she didn't want him to help her, she didn't want to hear about leaving Wickham. She was convinced that she and Wickham would get married someday, but didn't specify when that would be. ""Mr. Darcy thought that given her feelings, the only thing left to do was to expedite the wedding, although in his first conversation with Wickham, Mr. Darcy clearly saw that this was never in his intentions. Wickham only talked about resigning from the militia due to pressing debts of honor, without considering the negative consequences of Lydia's elopement, which were solely due to her own foolishness. He intended to resign as an officer immediately, and as for his future, he had no concrete plans. He had to go somewhere but did not know where, and he was well aware that he had no income to live on. Mr. Darcy asked him why he did not marry your sister right away. Although no one thought Mr. Bennet was wealthy, he could still do something for him, and his situation would improve thanks to the marriage. But from Wickham's response, Mr. Darcy realized that he still harbored hopes of securing a better fortune through marriage elsewhere. However, given the circumstances, he still wanted to quickly escape his current difficulties. The two met several times as there were many matters to discuss. Of course, Wickham wanted more than what he could receive, but in the end, the two reached a reasonable agreement. ""Everything was agreed upon by the two of them. Next, Mr. Darcy intended to explain his plan clearly to your uncle, and he went to Gracechurch Street one evening before your aunt returned home. But he did not meet Mr. Gardiner, and upon further inquiry, Mr. Darcy found out that your father was with him, but would be leaving the city the next morning. He thought your father was not someone he could consult as effectively as your uncle, so he waited until your father left before meeting your uncle. He did not leave his name, so until the next day, everyone only knew that a gentleman wanted to discuss business matters. He returned on Saturday. By then, your father had left, your uncle was at home, and as your aunt mentioned above, they talked for a long time. They met again on Sunday; that was when your aunt also met him. It wasn't until Monday that they agreed on everything, and immediately after, your uncle sent an urgent letter to Longbourn. “But Mr. Darcy is very stubborn, Lizzy, I think this stubbornness is truly a flaw of Mr. Darcy. At different times, he must have been condemned for different faults, but this is the real flaw. Nothing can be done unless he takes charge himself, although I am sure your uncle is willing to take care of everything. They kept arguing with each other for a long time, longer than two young people deserve to be concerned about. But in the end, your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to act to help his niece, he only received credit for the arrangement. This goes against his nature, and I truly think your letter made him infinitely happy; this explanatory letter helped him remove the false mask of gratitude and place the benefactor in his rightful position. But, Lizzy, you should not reveal this to anyone, at most only to Jane. I think you already know quite well how they arranged things for the two young people. I believe the amount of money to cover his debts was more than a thousand pounds, plus another thousand pounds for her in addition to what she received from her family, and the cost for him to join the army. The reason why Mr. Darcy wanted to do all this, I mentioned above. Mr. Darcy thinks that because of him, due to his reserve and lack of prudent judgment, others did not understand Wickham's character, hence the incident occurred. There may be some truth in this, but I am not sure whether to blame his reserve or the reserve of anyone else. “But despite having such a clever way of speaking, my dear Lizzy, you can rest assured that your uncle would never have conceded if he and your aunt did not believe that Mr. Darcy had another interest in arranging this matter. Once they had agreed on everything, he returned to his friends who were still staying at Pemberley, but they agreed that he would return to London once more on the wedding day, at which time all the financial matters would be settled. ""I think I have now told you everything clearly. The relationship you mentioned to me will surprise and delight you; I hope at least it does not bother you. Lydia is staying with us, and Wickham often visits. He is still the same person I understood him to be in Hertfordshire. As for Lydia, I wouldn't want to tell you that I am not very pleased with her attitude if I hadn't realized, through Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her behavior when visiting home would be the same, so now saying it won't cause you any more pain. I often speak to her in the most serious manner, showing her all the harm her actions have caused and all the suffering she has brought to the family. If she happens to hear what I say, it is by luck, because I am certain she does not listen. Sometimes I get annoyed, but I think of dear Jane and Elizabeth, and for their sake, I try to endure her. “Mr. Darcy returned as promised, and as Lydia informed you, he attended the wedding. The next day, he dined with the family, and he will leave the city on Wednesday or Thursday. My dear, you may be very angry with me if I take this opportunity to say that I am very fond of him. In every aspect, his demeanor is as pleasant as when we were in Derbyshire. All his knowledge and opinions please me; he only lacks a bit of liveliness, but his wife could influence him in this regard, if he chooses his spouse carefully. I think he is quite reserved – he almost never mentions your name. But discretion seems to be a fashionable trait. Forgive me if I have any undue thoughts, or at least do not punish me by forbidding me from coming to P. I will never be satisfied until I have the opportunity to take a full tour around the garden. A four-wheeled carriage with a pair of small horses is sufficient. But I cannot write any more. My children have been clamoring for me for half an hour now.",21.218,21.162,"I just received your letter; since I anticipate that a short writing will not suffice to explain everything I need to tell you, I will dedicate the entire morning to replying. I must confess that I am surprised by your request; I did not expect this from you. Do not think that I am angry, but I want you to know that I did not think you would need to ask such questions. If you are having difficulty understanding me, please excuse my intervention. Your uncle was as surprised as I was – he would never have acted this way if he believed you were aware of the matter. But if you are truly unaware, then I must be more explicit. The day I returned home from Longbourn, your uncle received an unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy came, and they locked themselves in a room for several hours. Everything was over before I arrived; therefore, my curiosity was not as agonizing as yours. Mr. Darcy came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, had seen them, had spoken with Wickham frequently, and with Lydia once. As far as I can understand, he left Derbyshire a day after us and came to the city with the aim of finding them. The reason for his action was that he felt responsible for the fact that Wickham's villainy was not sufficiently known; if it were known, it would be impossible for well-bred girls to love or trust him. He found all the blame in his own faulty pride; he admitted that he did not consider it appropriate to reveal private matters to the public. Therefore, he felt it his duty to come forward and make an effort to remedy a wrong he had caused. If there is another reason, I am sure it is not one that would embarrass him. He spent a few days in the city until he found them; unlike us, he knew where to direct his search; knowing this was another reason he decided to follow us. It appears there is a lady, someone named Mrs. Younge, who was Miss Darcy's governess for a while; he did not say exactly what happened, but she was dismissed for some reason. The lady then rented a large house on Edward Street and has been making a living by renting rooms since then. He knew that Mrs. Younge was well acquainted with Wickham and went to her for information as soon as he arrived in the city. But it took two or three days to get what he wanted from her. Apparently, he had to bribe her to betray Wickham because she really knew where her friend was. Wickham had actually gone to her first when he came to London; if she could have accommodated him, they would have stayed with her. But in the end, our kind-hearted friend got the address he wanted. They were on ------- street. He saw Wickham and then insisted on seeing Lydia. His initial aim regarding Lydia was to persuade her to end that disgraceful situation and return to her relatives, as soon as they were willing to accept her, and he offered to help as much as he could to achieve this. But he saw that Lydia was determined to stay where she was. She did not care about her relatives, did not want his help, and would not even hear of leaving Wickham. At some point, she was sure they would marry, and the timing did not matter much. Given her feelings, he thought the only thing left was to secure and hasten the marriage; in his first conversation with Wickham, he easily learned that he had no such intention. Wickham himself admitted that he had to leave the regiment due to some urgent gambling debts; he did not hesitate to attribute all the bad consequences of Lydia's elopement solely to her foolishness. He intended to leave the regiment immediately; he had no clear idea of what he would do in the future. He had to go somewhere, but he did not know where; he also did not know how he would make a living. Mr. Darcy asked him why he did not marry your sister immediately. Although Mr. Bennet was not very wealthy, he could do something for him, and his situation could improve through marriage. But in response to this question, Mr. Darcy learned that Wickham still held out hope of making a more substantial fortune through marriage in another region. However, it was not easy for him to resist the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times because there was much to discuss. Of course, Wickham wanted more than he could get, but eventually, he agreed to a reasonable amount. Once everything was settled between them, Mr. Darcy's next step was to inform your uncle of the situation; he visited Gracechurch Street the evening before my first arrival. But Mr. Gardiner was not around; after doing some more research, Mr. Darcy learned that your father was with him but would leave the city the next day. Thinking he could not speak as comfortably with your father as with your uncle, he postponed the meeting until your father left. He did not leave his name; until the next day, all that was known was that a gentleman had called on business. He came again on Saturday. Your father was gone, your uncle was home, and as I said, they talked extensively in private. They met again on Sunday, and that was when I saw him. Everything was settled by Monday: a courier was immediately sent to Longbourn. But our guest was very stubborn. It seems to me, my dear Lizzy, that stubbornness is his true character flaw. He has been found to have many faults at different times; but this is the real flaw. He did not allow anything to be done that he did not do himself; yet I am sure (I am not saying this to expect thanks, so do not say anything) your uncle would have wholeheartedly handled the entire matter. They struggled over this for a long time, much more than the gentleman or lady involved deserved. But in the end, your uncle had to agree; he had to be content with the probable reputation of being truly helpful to his niece rather than actually being so, which he could not bear at all; therefore, I believe your letter this morning pleased him greatly because it asked for an explanation that would free your uncle from his borrowed crown and return the praise to where it belonged. However, my dear Lizzy, no one should know about this except you and perhaps Jane. I believe you know very well what was done for the young couple. Wickham's debts, which I believe exceed a thousand pounds, will be paid, and another thousand will be added to Lydia's own money in her name, and Wickham's rank in the army will be purchased. All this was done solely by him for the reason I mentioned above. It was Mr. Darcy's fault, negligence, and thoughtlessness that Wickham's character was so misunderstood and consequently accepted by society. There may be some truth in this; but I doubt that the reason was his or anyone else's negligence. Nevertheless, despite all these fine words, my dear Lizzy, rest assured, your uncle would not have agreed if he did not think there was another reason related to this matter. When all this was decided, Mr. Darcy returned to his friends still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he would come to London once more for the wedding; all financial matters would be finalized then. I believe I have now told you everything. You said this explanation would surprise you greatly; I hope at least it will not upset you. Lydia came to us; Wickham was allowed to come and go as he pleased. Wickham was just as he was when we knew him in Hertfordshire; I was not going to tell you how repulsive I found Lydia's behavior while she stayed with us, but from Jane's letter last Wednesday, I understand that her behavior when she arrived home was the same; so what I will now tell you will not cause you new pain. I spoke to Lydia very seriously and repeatedly, explaining the immorality of what she had done and how much she had made her family unhappy. If she heard me, it was by chance, because I am sure she did not listen. Sometimes I felt like I was losing control, but then I remembered my dear Elizabeth and Jane and showed patience for their sake. Mr. Darcy returned without delay and, as Lydia told you, attended the wedding. He had dinner with us the next day; he was to leave the city again on Wednesday or Thursday. If I take this opportunity to tell you how much I admire him (I had not found the courage to say this before), will you be angry with me, my dear Lizzy? His behavior towards us was as pleasant in every way as it was in Derbyshire. I like his intelligence and opinions; all he needs is a bit more liveliness, which, if he makes a wise marriage, his wife can teach him. I found him very tight-lipped; – he hardly mentioned your name. But being tight-lipped must be in fashion these days. If I have been building castles in the air, please forgive me, or at least do not punish me so severely as to ban me from Pemberley. I will never be happy until I thoroughly explore the grove. A small carriage with a pair of beautiful ponies will suffice and more. But I cannot continue any longer. The children have been calling me for half an hour.",28.244,28.2,"My dear niece: I have just received your letter and I am going to dedicate the whole morning to answering it, as I believe that in a few words I will not be able to tell you all that I have to share with you. I must confess that your question surprised me, as I did not expect it from you. Do not be upset, I only wish you to know that I did not think such clarifications were necessary on your part. If you do not want to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as surprised as I am, and only because of the belief that you are an interested party has he allowed himself to act as he has. But in case you are indeed innocent and know nothing at all, I will have to be more explicit. The same day I arrived from Longbourn, your uncle had a very unexpected visit. Mr. Darcy came and was locked up with him for several hours. When I returned, everything was already settled; so my curiosity did not suffer as much as yours. Darcy came to tell Gardiner that he had discovered the hiding place of Wickham and your sister, and that he had seen and spoken to both of them: to Wickham several times, to your sister only once. From what I can deduce, Darcy left Derbyshire the day after we did and came to London with the idea of finding them. The reason he gave is that he felt guilty for not having made Wickham's infamy sufficiently known to prevent a decent girl from loving or trusting him. He generously attributed it all to his blind pride, saying that he had previously deemed it unworthy of him to publish his private affairs. His conduct would speak for him. Therefore, he believed it his duty to intervene and remedy a wrong that he himself had caused. If he had another motive, I am sure it was not dishonorable... He had spent several days in the capital without being able to find them, but he had a lead that could guide him and that was more important than all of ours and that, moreover, was another reason that prompted him to come see us. It seems that there is a lady, a certain Mrs. Younge, who some time ago was Miss Darcy's governess, and had to be dismissed from her position for some reprehensible reason that he did not tell us. Upon leaving the Darcy family, Mrs. Younge took a large house on Edwards Street and since then made a living by renting out rooms. Darcy knew that this Mrs. Younge had close ties with Wickham, and he went to her for news of him as soon as he arrived in the capital. But two or three days went by without being able to obtain from that lady what he needed. I suppose she did not want to speak until she was bribed, for, in reality, she knew from the beginning where her friend was. Wickham, in fact, went to her upon his arrival in London, and if there had been room in her house, he would have stayed there. But, finally, our good friend obtained the address he was looking for. They were on X Street. He saw Wickham and then wanted to see Lydia. He confessed to us that his first intention was to convince her to leave that unfortunate situation and return to her family's bosom if it could be arranged for them to receive her, and he offered his help in everything within his reach. But he found Lydia absolutely determined to stay as she was. She did not care a bit about her family and rejected Darcy's help; she did not want to hear about leaving Wickham; she was convinced that they would marry someday and did not care when. In view of this, Darcy thought that the only thing to do was to facilitate and secure the marriage; in his first dialogue with Wickham, he saw that marriage was not in his plans. Wickham confessed that he had been forced to leave the regiment due to certain pressing debts of honor; he had no scruples in blaming Lydia's madness for all the unfortunate consequences of the elopement. He said he would immediately resign from his position, and as for the future, he did not know what would become of him; he had to go somewhere, but he did not know where and admitted that he did not have a penny to his name. Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister on the spot. Although Mr. Bennet might not be very wealthy, he could do something for him and his situation would improve with the marriage. But from Wickham's response, Darcy understood that he still harbored the hope of securing a more solid fortune by marrying another girl in some other country; nevertheless, given the circumstances he was in, he did not seem very averse to the temptation of obtaining an immediate solution. They met repeatedly because there were many things to discuss. Wickham, of course, needed much more than could be given to him, but in the end, he agreed to be reasonable. When everything was agreed upon between them, the first thing Mr. Darcy did was inform your uncle, for which he came to Gracechurch Street for the first time, the afternoon before my arrival. But he could not see Gardiner. Darcy found out that your father was still at our house, but that he was going to leave the next day. He did not believe that your father was a more suitable person than your uncle to handle the matter, and then postponed his visit until your father had left. He did not leave his name, and the next day we only knew that a gentleman had come on a business matter. He returned on Saturday. Your father had left and your uncle was at home. As I said before, the two of them talked for a long time. On Sunday they met again and then I saw him too. It wasn't until Monday that everything was decided, and then it was when the messenger was sent to Longbourn. But our visitor was very stubborn; I assure you, Elizabeth, that stubbornness is the true flaw in his character. He has been accused of many faults on various occasions, but that is the only true one. He wanted to do everything on his own, despite the fact that your uncle ––and I don't say this for you to thank me, so I beg you not to speak of it–– would have arranged everything instantly. They argued for a long time, much longer than the gentleman and the young lady in question deserved. But in the end, your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of allowing him to be useful to his niece, he reduced him to merely appearing to be so, much to your uncle's displeasure. So I imagine that your letter this morning has given him great pleasure by providing the opportunity to confess the truth and relinquish the credit that belongs to another. But I beg you not to disclose this and, at most, only tell Jane. I imagine you know what has been done for those young people. The debts of Wickham, which amount, I believe, to much more than a thousand pounds, have been paid; another thousand has been set aside to increase Lydia's dowry, and he has been secured a job. According to Darcy, the reasons for doing all this are solely the ones I mentioned before: because of his discretion, it was not known who Wickham was, and he was received and regarded in a way he did not deserve. There may be some truth in this, although I do not doubt that neither Darcy's discretion nor anyone else's has anything to do with the matter. But despite his nice words, my dear Elizabeth, you can be sure that your uncle would never have yielded had he not believed himself moved by another interest. When everything was resolved, Mr. Darcy returned to his friends who were still at Pemberley, but he promised to return to London for the wedding and to settle the financial arrangements. I think I have already told you everything. If what you say is true, this story will surprise you greatly, but I imagine it will not displease you. Lydia came to the house and Wickham had constant access to her. He was the same as I knew him in Hertfordshire, but I wouldn't tell you how much Lydia's behavior during her stay in our house displeased me, if it weren't for Jane's letter on Wednesday that made me understand that upon arriving at Longbourn she behaved exactly the same, so it shouldn't surprise you what I am now telling. I spoke to her many times with all seriousness, making her see the misfortune she had brought upon her family, but if she heard me it would be by chance, because I am convinced that she didn't even listen to me. There were times when she irritated me; but I remembered my dear Elizabeth and Jane and clothed myself with patience. Mr. Darcy returned punctually and, as Lydia told you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day. He was planning to leave London on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be angry with me, dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity to tell you what I never would have dared to say before, which is how much I like Darcy? His conduct with us has been as pleasant in every way as when we were in Derbyshire. His intelligence, his opinions, everything pleases me. He only lacks a bit of liveliness, and if he marries wisely, his wife will teach him that. It seems to me that he conceals it very well; he hardly mentioned your name. But it seems that concealment is in fashion. I beg you to forgive me if I have been too suspicious, or at least do not punish me to the point of excluding me from Pemberley. I will not be completely happy until I have taken a full tour of the estate. A low phaeton with a good pair of ponies would be ideal. I can't write to you anymore. The children have been calling me for half an hour.",25.38,25.331

1725,"The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister’s match—which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation—were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to him. Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him! For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,—proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.","The content of the letter caused Elizabeth's mind to be agitated with chaotic thoughts, in which it was difficult to discern whether joy or pain was more dominant. She had vague and confused speculations because she was unsure of what Mr. Darcy could have done with her sister's spouse, while she feared encouraging him to do something too good to be true. And at the same time, she dreaded having to be fair and then painfully thinking he had not done so. Now the speculations about the good deed had become too real! He had determined to track down the two people in the city, he had endured all difficulties and hardships in such a search, then had to plead with a woman he hated and despised terribly. He had to humble himself to meet a person he only wanted to avoid and whose name he did not want to mention, then had to meet this person repeatedly, reason with them, advise them, and finally spend money to bribe them. He had done all these things for a young girl he neither loved nor respected. Her heart whispered to her that he did all these things for her. But her hope was suppressed by other thoughts. She immediately thought that her vanity was still not enough to expect his feelings for her, for a woman who had once rejected him, now wanting him to overcome the natural disdain for a connection with Wickham. Wickham's brother-in-law! Every form of pride must oppose such a relationship. Surely he had helped a great deal. She felt ashamed when she thought of how much he had helped. But he had spoken about the reason for his intervention, and it was easy to see that this reason was legitimate. It was right that he believed he had been wrong; he had every right to act and every condition to act. Although she did not consider herself the main reason for his actions, perhaps she could believe that the remaining affection he had for her had supported his purpose to help her achieve peace of mind. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that those efforts were for someone who did not hope for any reciprocation. Her family owed him for Lydia's restoration, for Lydia's dignity, for everything. Oh! She was deeply grieved when she thought of every unkind thought she had harbored, every harsh word she had spoken to him. She felt ashamed for herself, but proud of him. Proud that in that goal of affection and honor, he had surpassed himself. She read and reread the part where her aunt praised him. Not much, but enough to make her happy. She also felt joy, though mixed with regret, when she saw that both her aunt and uncle firmly believed that there was always genuine affection and trust between her and Darcy.",18.092,17.872,"This letter's content threw Elizabeth into a tumultuous state of mind; it was difficult to decide whether joy or sorrow had the greater share. The disturbing doubts caused by not being sure of all the actions Mr. Darcy might have taken to hasten his sister's marriage, which Elizabeth feared to believe because they were impossibly kind, and at the same time was horrified by the obligation they implied, all turned out to be true in the end! He had deliberately followed them to the city, endured all the trouble and distress such an investigation could bring; he had to persuade a woman he despised, face, meet frequently, talk to, convince, and finally bribe a man he most wanted to avoid and couldn't even bear to hear the name of. He had done all this for a girl he wouldn't even consider a person. His heart told him he did it for Elizabeth. But this hope was immediately tested by other concerns; soon, when Elizabeth felt the need to trust in Darcy's love for her, a woman who had once rejected him, even his pride couldn't make him believe that this love could overcome a natural feeling like the disgust of being related to Wickham. Wickham's brother-in-law! Such a relationship would provoke every sense of pride. Of course, he had done a lot. Elizabeth felt ashamed when she thought of how much he had done. But he had given a reason for his intervention that was not so hard to believe. It was understandable for him to feel guilty; he was generous and had the means to be generous; Elizabeth did not see herself as Darcy's main reason, but she could believe that perhaps a lingering feeling of affection might have helped him strive for a goal that also concerned her peace of mind. They owed everything, including Lydia's regained respectability, to him. Oh! how she suffered for every ungrateful feeling she had harbored towards him, for every harsh word she had directed at him! For her part, she had learned her lesson; but she was proud of him. She was proud that he had managed to overcome himself for the sake of compassion and honor. She read over and over the parts where her aunt praised him. It wasn't enough, but it pleased her. When she saw how wholeheartedly her aunt and uncle believed in the love and affection between her and Mr. Darcy, she realized that she felt a certain pleasure, mixed with regret.",17.746,17.529,"The content of this letter left Elizabeth in a state of shock where it was impossible to determine whether pleasure or pain took the greater part. The vague suspicions she had conceived in her uncertainty about Darcy's role in her sister's wedding, without daring to entertain them because they implied acts of kindness too great to be possible, and fearing they were true because of the humiliation that gratitude would impose, were thus confirmed. Darcy had gone after them expressly, had assumed all the trouble and mortification inherent in that search, implored a woman he must detest and was forced to deal with frequently, to persuade and ultimately bribe the man he most wished to avoid and whose very name horrified him to pronounce. He had done it all to save a girl who must mean nothing to him and for whom he could feel no esteem. Elizabeth's heart told her he had done it for her, but other considerations repressed this hope and she soon realized she was flattering her vanity by explaining the fact in this way, for Darcy could not feel any affection for a woman who had rejected him and, if he did, he would not be able to overcome such a natural feeling as that of being related to Wickham. Darcy, Wickham's brother-in-law! The most basic pride had to rebel against that bond. It was true that Darcy had done so much that Elizabeth was confused, but he gave a very plausible reason. It was not unreasonable to think that Darcy believed he had acted wrongly; he was generous and had the means to demonstrate it, and although Elizabeth resisted admitting that she had been the main motive, it was possible to suppose that a remnant of interest in her had contributed to his efforts in a matter that compromised his peace of mind. It was very painful to be so indebted to a person to whom they could never repay what he had done. They owed him Lydia's salvation and reputation. How much Elizabeth was hurt by her ingratitude and the insolent words she had addressed to him! She was ashamed of herself, but proud of him, proud that he had behaved so compassionately and nobly. She read over and over again the praises her aunt bestowed on him, and although they did not seem sufficient, they pleased her.

1992,"THE discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time.","Elizabeth could not calm the turmoil in her mind caused by that unusual visit, and for many hours, she could not stop thinking about it. It seemed that Lady Catherine had taken the trouble to come from Rosings with the sole purpose of preventing her relationship with Mr. Darcy. Indeed, this was a reasonable assumption! But Elizabeth could not understand how news of their relationship had spread, and she recalled that he was a close friend of Bingley, while she was Jane's sister. That was enough to spark the idea, when the desire for a marriage made everyone excited about another wedding. She herself had not forgotten that her sister's marriage would certainly bring her and Darcy closer together more often. And thus, the neighbors at the Lucas house had concluded that this would surely and quickly happen, while she herself only hoped it could be possible in the future. She guessed that Lady Catherine had learned about it through the information exchanged between the Lucas and Collins households.",9.944,9.127,"It was not easy for Elizabeth to overcome the annoyance caused by this extraordinary visit; she could not manage to stop thinking about it for hours at a time. Lady Catherine had evidently gone to all the trouble of coming from Rosings to there just to break off her imaginary engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was indeed a clever plan! But Elizabeth had no idea where the rumor of their engagement could have originated; eventually, she thought that Darcy being Bingley's close friend, and him being Jane's brother, at a time when everyone was expecting one wedding, was enough to give rise to the idea of a second one. She had not forgotten that her sister's marriage would bring them together more frequently. So, their neighbors at Lucas Lodge (since they communicated with the Collinses, she concluded that the rumor had reached Lady Catherine through them) had conveyed what Elizabeth saw as a possibility for the future as if it were a done deal.",17.255,16.69,"Not without difficulty did Elizabeth manage to overcome the agitation caused by that extraordinary visit. She spent many hours unable to think of anything else. Apparently, Lady Catherine had taken the trouble to travel from Rosings to Hertfordshire with the sole purpose of breaking her supposed engagement with Darcy. Although Lady Catherine was very capable of such a project, Elizabeth could not imagine where she had gotten the news of said engagement, until she remembered that his being such a good friend of Bingley and she being Jane's sister could have given rise to the idea, since the marriage of one couple predisposed to suppose the marriage of the other. Elizabeth had indeed thought that her sister's marriage would bring her and Darcy closer together. That must have been why the Lucases—through whose correspondence with the Collinses Elizabeth presumed the conjecture had reached Lady Catherine's ears—considered immediate what she had also believed possible for later.",9.831,8.946
1993,"In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than she could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.","However, upon reconsidering Lady Catherine's words, she couldn't help but feel some unease about the consequences of her insistence on intervening. From her determined words to prevent the wedding, Elizabeth suddenly thought that she would surely persuade her nephew, and she dared not think how he would react to arguments about the detrimental aspects of their relationship. She was not exactly sure of his feelings towards his aunt, but naturally, one could assume that he thought more highly of Lady Catherine than she could. It was certain that when listing the drawbacks of a marriage with someone of unequal social standing, his aunt would exploit his weakest points. With his notions of propriety, he might think that the arguments, which Elizabeth found weak and laughable, were reasonable and solid.",14.181,13.431,"However, while contemplating Lady Catherine's statements, she couldn't help but feel a bit uneasy about the likely outcome of her insistence on this intervention. From what she said about her decision to prevent their marriage, Elizabeth thought she might be planning to make a request to her nephew; if she conveyed the same negatives of being related to him, Elizabeth dared not think how Darcy would respond. She did not know the exact degree of his attachment to his aunt or how much he valued her opinions, but it was natural for him to hold Lady Catherine in higher regard than Elizabeth could; moreover, it was certain that while listing the troubles of marrying someone whose close relatives were so inferior to his own, his aunt would be appealing to his weakest point. Darcy, with his views on nobility that Elizabeth found weak and ridiculous, would probably feel that these claims were reasonable and thoroughly considered.",18.241,17.632,"But upon reflecting on Lady Catherine's words, she could not avoid a certain uneasiness about the consequences that her interference might have. From what she said about her resolution to prevent the marriage, Elizabeth deduced that she intended to confront her nephew, and she did not know how Darcy would take the relation of the dangers that their union entailed. She was unaware of the extent of Darcy's affection for his aunt and how much he valued her opinion; but it was logical to suppose that he had more regard for Her Ladyship than she did, and she was sure that her aunt would touch a sore spot by enumerating the misfortunes of a marriage with a person from a family so unequal to his own. Given Darcy's ideas on that particular matter, Elizabeth believed it likely that the arguments that had seemed so weak and ridiculous to her might appear to him full of good sense and solid reasoning.",21.519,20.966

In that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.","If before he seemed to hesitate, not knowing what to do, now the advice and encouragement of such a close relative could dispel all doubts and determine that he immediately becomes happy in a way that an unblemished dignity can help him be happy. In this case, he would not return to her anymore. On the way, Lady Catherine might meet him in the city, and he would have to abandon the idea of returning to Netherfield with Bingley.",7.514,5.636,"If Darcy was undecided about what he should do until then, which often seemed to be the case, the suggestions and desires of such a close relative could dispel any doubt and lead him to happiness within the possibilities of unblemished nobility in an instant. In that case, he would not return. Lady Catherine could stop by to see him while going to the city; and the promise he made to Bingley to return to Netherfield would be forgotten.",12.89,11.069,"So if Darcy had hesitated before about what he had to do, which he often seemed to, the warnings and urgings of such a close relative might dispel all his doubts and incline him once and for all to be as happy as an immaculate dignity would allow him.

I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:—‘Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another, of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? ‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for cautioning you is as follows:—We have reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.’ Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It is admirable!”","- Of course, it's something that goes straight to the point. He began the letter with congratulations to Father on the upcoming wedding of his eldest daughter. It seems he heard the news from one of the kind-hearted, or gossiping, members of the Lucas family. Father didn't want to test your patience, so he didn't read this part. The part related to you is as follows: ""After expressing the sincerest congratulations from Mrs. Collins and myself on that happy event, I now briefly address another matter. According to the same source, it is speculated that your daughter Elizabeth will soon no longer bear the Bennet surname. After the eldest daughter has taken another name, and the partner she has chosen is one of the most illustrious figures in this country."" He spoke to Elizabeth while reading the letter: - Lizzy, can you guess who he is referring to? ""This young man is strangely endowed with many blessings, with everything that a mortal heart could dream of the most - magnificent wealth, noble lineage, and extensive patronage."" However, despite such temptations, I must warn my cousin Elizabeth, and warn you, about the calamities that may arise from hastily accepting his proposal, which with these advantages, of course, no one would want to overlook."" Lizzy, do you know who he is? But here you will know: ""The motivation that compels me to warn is this. We have reason to believe that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, views the marriage with disfavor."" He continued: - Mr. Darcy, my dear, it is him! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you. Could he, or the Lucas family, lie more blatantly than that when mentioning his name? Mr. Darcy, who always looks at women through their flaws, and who probably would never have looked at you in his entire life! It's truly remarkable!",22.075,21.837,"""Something aimed at the purpose, of course. Obviously, he heard from the good-hearted, gossiping Lucases, starting by congratulating on my eldest daughter's upcoming wedding. I will not test your patience by reading what he said on that matter. Here's what he said about you. ""After thus presenting the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me add a brief word on another matter we learned from the same source. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is said, will not bear the Bennet name for long after her sister leaves; her chosen life partner also deserves to be admired as one of the most magnificent personalities in this land."" ""I suppose you can guess whom I mean, can't you, Lizzy?"" ""This young gentleman is specially blessed with everything mortal hearts might desire – a dazzling fortune, noble blood, and generous patronage. Yet despite all this charm, I must warn my cousin Elizabeth and yourself about the troubles you might face due to the sudden cancellation of this gentleman's proposals, which you would naturally wish to accept immediately."" ""Do you have any idea who this gentleman is, Lizzy? But it is coming to light."" ""The reason I am warning you is this. We have reasons to believe that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look favorably upon the marriage."" ""Mr. Darcy, yes, our man is him! Now I must have surprised you, Lizzy. Could Mr. Collins or the Lucases find another man among our acquaintances whose name would make their lies so obvious? Mr. Darcy, a man who looks at women only to find faults, and who probably has never even looked at you in his life! They are magnificent, indeed!""",23.26,23.036,"––As expected, something very timely. He begins with congratulations on the upcoming wedding of my eldest daughter, of which he seems to have been informed by one of the kind and talkative Lucases. I won't bore you by reading what he says about that point. What concerns you is the following: After having congratulated you on behalf of Mrs. Collins and myself for such a fortunate event, allow me to add a brief warning about another matter, of which we have been informed through the same channel. It is assumed that your daughter Elizabeth will not bear the name Bennet for much longer once her elder sister has left it, and that the partner she has been fortunate enough to secure can reasonably be considered one of our most illustrious personalities. ––Can you guess, Lizzy, what this means? That young man possesses everything one could desire in this world: superb properties, a distinguished family, and an extensive patronage. But despite all those temptations, allow me to warn my cousin Elizabeth and yourself of the dangers you may face with a hasty acceptance of the proposals of such a gentleman, which, naturally, you might be inclined to consider advantageous. ––Do you have no idea who the gentleman is, Elizabeth? He's coming now. The reasons I have for informing you are as follows: your aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look favorably upon this marriage. ––As you see, the gentleman in question is Mr. Darcy. I believe, Elizabeth, that you must be stunned. Neither Collins nor the Lucases could have chosen a name from our circle of friends that better reveals that what they are spreading is a falsehood. Mr. Darcy, who only looks at a woman to criticize her, and who probably has never looked at you in his life! It's phenomenal!",21.131,20.882

I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr. Collins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it.

I think I have a duty to quickly inform my cousin of this news, so that she and her noble suitor are aware of the situation and do not hastily proceed with the marriage without proper consent."" He paused and then continued: - Mr. Collins continued writing like this: ""I am truly delighted to see that Miss Lydia's unfortunate affair has been adequately covered up. I am only concerned that people will know they lived together before the wedding ceremony. However, I should not forget my duties in my position, and I do not want to restrain my expression of surprise upon hearing that you welcomed the two into your home immediately after they were married. This is an attitude that encourages sin, and if I were the clergyman in charge of the Longbourn parish, I would actively prevent this. As a Christian, you should certainly forgive, but you should never allow them to come near, nor permit others to mention their names to you."" That is his view on the magnanimity of a Christian! The rest of the letter only talks about the situation of his dear Charlotte and his wish for an olive branch. But, Lizzy, it seems you are not happy.

Mr. Collins then adds, ""I was genuinely very pleased that my cousin Lydia's unfortunate affair had been so well resolved; my only concern is that it is widely known they lived together before the marriage. However, I will not neglect my professional duties and will not refrain from expressing how surprised I was to hear that you accepted the young couple into your home as soon as the marriage was solemnized.

At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness.

However, he endured it commendably.

Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.","The rude demeanor of Mrs. Phillips was a torment, perhaps the greatest torment, for his endurance. Although Mrs. Phillips, like her sister, respected him too much to adopt the familiar attitude that Mr. Bingley cheerfully encouraged, whenever she spoke, she revealed her rudeness.

Elizabeth did everything to ensure he was not overly noticed by the two ladies, always wanting him to stay close to her or with family members with whom he could converse comfortably.

Although her respect for her led to speaking less, it did not make her more graceful. Elizabeth did her utmost to shield Mr. Darcy from the frequent attentions of both, staying vigilant to keep him reserved for herself and the family members who could be spoken of without shame; although the discomfort arising from all this took away much of the pleasure of the courting season, it contributed to the hope for the future; Elizabeth began to eagerly anticipate the time when they would escape that tedious company and enjoy the comfort and elegance of family life at Pemberley.",15.601,14.894,"The vulgarity of Mrs. Philips was another and perhaps the greatest of the contributions imposed on her patience, for although this lady, like her sister, had too much respect for her to speak to her with the familiarity that Bingley's good humor allowed, she could not open her mouth without saying something vulgar. Not even that respect, which earned her a bit, managed to give her any elegance. Elizabeth did everything she could to protect him from everyone and always tried to keep him close to her or to the members of her family whose conversation did not mortify him. The annoyances that all this brought took away a good part of the pleasures of the courtship, but added greater hopes for the future.

Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and, in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.

However, she still assisted her sister within her means, by saving on her own expenses. She clearly saw that their combined income could never be enough for them to be wasteful in their destitution, and in a lifestyle that disregarded the future. Whenever they changed residences, they turned to Jane or Elizabeth for a little help in settling outstanding bills. Even when peace was restored, allowing them to return home, their way of life remained unstable. They always moved from place to place to find cheaper living arrangements, and always spent more than their income. His love for the youngest sister soon grew cold; her love lasted a little longer.
