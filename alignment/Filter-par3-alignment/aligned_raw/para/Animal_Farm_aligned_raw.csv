1,"Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the pop-holes. With the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring.","Phạm Minh Ngọc translated from the original English version, with reference to the Russian version by Лара Беспалова -2001г. Mr. Jones, the owner of the Manor Farm, closed the chicken coop, but because he was too drunk, he forgot to close the pigsty. With a hurricane lamp in hand, swaying, sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left, he staggered across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, and stepped into the kitchen to finish the last mug of beer of the day before climbing into bed, where his wife, Mrs. Jones, was already snoring.",24.923,24.195,"Mr. Jones, the owner of Manor Farm, had closed the henhouse door as he did every night, but because he was very drunk, he had forgotten to close the holes through which the chickens went in and out. As he stumbled and staggered across the yard, the light from the lantern in his hand was swaying this way and that. At the back door, he took off his boots and threw them aside, filled one last glass of beer from the barrel in the pantry and drank it in one gulp, then went upstairs to his bedroom. Mrs. Jones was snoring loudly.",23.163,22.392,"Mr. Jones, owner of Manor Farm, closed the henhouses for the night, but he was too drunk to remember that he had left the windows open. With the light of the lantern dancing from side to side, he crossed the yard, took off his boots at the back door, poured himself a final glass of beer from the barrel in the kitchen, and went straight to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring.",52.037,51.46
2,"As soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and a fluttering all through the farm buildings. Word had gone round during the day that old Major, the prize Middle White boar, had had a strange dream on the previous night and wished to communicate it to the other animals. It had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as soon as Mr. Jones was safely out of the way. Old Major (so he was always called, though the name under which he had been exhibited was Willingdon Beauty) was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone was quite ready to lose an hour’s sleep in order to hear what he had to say.","As soon as the light in the bedroom went out, rustling and whispering sounds suddenly arose here and there. That day, there was a rumor that the Leader, a white boar who had once won a medal at an exhibition, had a strange dream the night before and wanted to share it with all the animals. They agreed that as soon as Mr. Jones went to sleep, they would gather in the big barn. All the animals on the farm respected the Leader (they called him that, although at the exhibition he was known as Willingdon Handsome) and were willing to sacrifice their sleep to hear him speak.",20.423,19.711,"As soon as the light in the bedroom went out, a commotion and a rush began in all the buildings of the farm. It had been announced during the day: Old Major, the boar who had once won a prize, wanted to tell all the animals about a strange dream he had the night before. As soon as Mr. Jones was out of the way, it was decided that everyone would gather in the big barn. Old Major (he had entered the competition under the name Willingdon Beauty, but everyone called him Old Major) was so highly respected on the farm that everyone was willing to lose sleep to hear what he had to say.",36.093,35.554,"As soon as the light went out in the bedroom, the commotion began throughout the farm. During the day, word had spread that Old Major, the prize boar, had had a strange dream the previous night and wanted to share it with the other animals. They had agreed to all meet in the main barn once Mr. Jones retired. Old Major (that was always his name, although he had been exhibited under the name Willingdon Beauty) was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone was willing to lose an hour of sleep to hear what he had to say.",39.157,38.712
3,"At one end of the big barn, on a sort of raised platform, Major was already ensconced on his bed of straw, under a lantern which hung from a beam. He was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout, but he was still a majestic-looking pig, with a wise and benevolent appearance in spite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut. Before long the other animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable after their different fashions. First came the three dogs, Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in the straw immediately in front of the platform. The hens perched themselves on the window-sills, the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters, the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew the cud. The two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some small animal concealed in the straw. Clover was a stout motherly mare approaching middle life, who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal. Boxer was an enormous beast, nearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as any two ordinary horses put together. A white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid appearance, and in fact he was not of first-rate intelligence, but he was universally respected for his steadiness of character and tremendous powers of work. After the horses came Muriel, the white goat, and Benjamin, the donkey. Benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm, and the worst tempered. He seldom talked, and when he did, it was usually to make some cynical remark — for instance, he would say that God had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would sooner have had no tail and no flies. Alone among the animals on the farm he never laughed. If asked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh at. Nevertheless, without openly admitting it, he was devoted to Boxer; the two of them usually spent their Sundays together in the small paddock beyond the orchard, grazing side by side and never speaking.","The Leader sat on a straw-cushioned platform at the far end of the barn, under the light of a hurricane lamp hanging from the rafters. It was twelve years old, and although it had recently gained some weight, with its protruding canine teeth, it still looked dignified and benevolent. The other animals began to arrive one by one, each finding a favorable spot to sit. First came the three dogs, Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher, followed by the pigs; they sat on the straw pile in front of the platform. The hens perched on the window sills, the pigeons settled on the rafters, and the cows and sheep lay behind the pigs and began their cud-chewing. Two cart horses named Boxer and Clover also came in, slowly approaching the platform, carefully watching each step to avoid crushing any small animals beneath the straw. Clover, a gentle middle-aged mare, had become somewhat stout after giving birth four times. Boxer, a majestic horse nearly two meters tall and as strong as two ordinary horses. Because of a white stripe down his nose, he looked somewhat stupid, and indeed he was not very intelligent, but he was respected by the other animals for his steadiness and hard work. Next came a white goat named Muriel and a donkey named Benjamin. Benjamin was the oldest animal among them, but also the most ill-tempered. Benjamin spoke little, but whenever he did, it was always to make a sarcastic remark, such as once declaring that God had given him a tail to swat flies, but he would have preferred to have neither tail nor flies. He was the only animal that never laughed. If asked why, he would say: there was nothing to laugh about. Despite this, and although he never spoke of it, he was very loyal to Boxer; every Sunday, the two of them would quietly graze together in the paddock behind the orchard.",25.35,25.142,"The leader had already settled on a straw mattress laid on a platform illuminated by a lantern hanging from one of the beams in the ceiling, in a corner of the large barn. He was twelve years old, had recently put on a bit of weight; despite his long, sharp canine teeth never having been cut, he was an imposing pig who looked wise and fatherly. Soon, the other animals also began to arrive one after another and started to take their places in an orderly manner. First appeared three dogs named Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher; then the pigs came and settled on the straw right in front of the platform. The hens perched on the window sills, the pigeons settled on the roof beams, and the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew cud. Two cart horses named Boxer and Clover entered together; they walked slowly, carefully placing their large, hairy feet on the ground, worried that there might be a small animal among the straw that they couldn't see. Clover was a large, motherly mare who could be considered middle-aged; she had never quite regained her former shape after giving birth to her fourth foal. Boxer, on the other hand, was a very large animal, nearly two meters tall, with the strength of two horses. A white stripe down his forehead to his nose made him look somewhat stupid; indeed, he was not considered the smartest animal on the farm, but he had earned everyone's respect with his solid character and astonishing work ethic. After the horses, a white goat named Muriel and a donkey named Benjamin appeared. Benjamin was the oldest and most cantankerous animal on the farm. It couldn't be said that honey dripped from his mouth, but he spoke little and to the point: ""God gave me a tail to shoo away flies; but I wish there were no flies and no tail either."" He was the only animal on the farm who never laughed. To those who asked why he didn't laugh, he would reply, ""What's there to laugh at?"" But despite not showing it openly, he admired Boxer; the two of them would spend their Sundays together, usually grazing side by side in silence in the meadow behind the orchard.",22.649,22.41,"At one end of the main barn, on a sort of raised platform, Major was already settled comfortably in his straw bed, under a lantern hanging from a beam. He was twelve years old and had recently become quite fat, but he was still a majestic pig with a wise and good-natured appearance, despite his tusks never having been cut. After a short while, the other animals began to arrive and settle down comfortably, each in their own way. First came the three dogs, Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in the straw in front of the platform. The hens perched on the windowsills, the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters, the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew the cud. The two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover, entered together, walking slowly and placing their large hairy hooves with great care, fearing that some small animal might be hidden in the straw. Clover was a sturdy mare, getting on in years and with a maternal appearance, who had not managed to regain her figure after her fourth foal. Boxer was an enormous beast, nearly eighteen hands high and as strong as two ordinary horses put together. A white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid appearance, and indeed he was not very intelligent, but he was respected by all for his steadiness of character and tremendous powers of work.

4,"The two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings, which had lost their mother, filed into the barn, cheeping feebly and wandering from side to side to find some place where they would not be trodden on. Clover made a sort of wall round them with her great foreleg, and the ducklings nestled down inside it and promptly fell asleep. At the last moment Mollie, the foolish, pretty white mare who drew Mr. Jones’s trap, came mincing daintily in, chewing at a lump of sugar. She took a place near the front and began flirting her white mane, hoping to draw attention to the red ribbons it was plaited with. Last of all came the cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally squeezed herself in between Boxer and Clover; there she purred contentedly throughout Major’s speech without listening to a word of what he was saying.","As soon as the two horses lay down, the orphaned ducklings rushed into the barn, chirping softly as they scurried around, hoping to find a safe spot. Mrs. Fat used her front legs to create an enclosure for them, and the ducklings quickly nestled inside and fell asleep without realizing it. Just before the meeting began, Mollie, a foolish white mare who usually pulled Mr. Jones's small cart, sashayed in while chewing on a lump of sugar. She immediately took a spot in front of the platform and shook her mane, hoping the others would notice the red ribbon adorning it. Finally, there was a cat, which looked around and, as usual, sought out a warm place for itself. It squeezed in between Boxer and Mrs. Fat, purring contentedly, indifferent to whatever the Leader had to say.",14.965,14.217,"Just as the two horses had lain down, the orphaned ducklings, chirping loudly, entered the barn in a single file; waddling around, they were looking for a place where they wouldn't get trampled. Clover built a wall around the ducklings with her large foreleg; they huddled there and immediately fell asleep. At the last moment, Mollie, the white mare with long hair but short on brains, who pulled Mr. Jones's two-wheeled cart, arrived; with a lump of sugar in her mouth, she gracefully entered. She chose a spot at the front; hoping to draw attention, she began to sway her white mane, braided with red ribbons, from side to side. Finally, the cat appeared; true to its nature, it immediately began to look for the warmest spot and eventually nestled between Boxer and Clover; it purred contentedly throughout Old Major's speech –without listening to a single word he said.",20.406,19.741,"As soon as the two horses lay down, a group of ducklings that had lost their mother entered the barn, chirping weakly and wandering from side to side in search of a place where they wouldn't be in danger of being stepped on. Clover formed a sort of wall with her enormous front hoof, and the ducklings nestled there, falling asleep immediately. At the last moment, Mollie, the pretty and silly white mare that pulled Mr. Jones's cart, entered affectedly, chewing on a sugar lump. She positioned herself in front, flirting with her white mane to draw attention to the red ribbons with which it had been braided. The last to appear was the cat, who, as usual, sought the warmest place, finally settling between Boxer and Clover; there she purred contentedly during Major's speech, without hearing a single word of what he was saying.",32.562,32.1
5,"All the animals were now present except Moses, the tame raven, who slept on a perch behind the back door. When Major saw that they had all made themselves comfortable and were waiting attentively, he cleared his throat and began:","So all the animals in the Manor Farm were present, except for the raven Moses, who was sleeping on the fence just outside the back door.

8,"“But is this simply part of the order of nature? Is it because this land of ours is so poor that it cannot afford a decent life to those who dwell upon it? No, comrades, a thousand times no! The soil of England is fertile, its climate is good, it is capable of affording food in abundance to an enormously greater number of animals than now inhabit it. This single farm of ours would support a dozen horses, twenty cows, hundreds of sheep — and all of them living in a comfort and a dignity that are now almost beyond our imagining. Why then do we continue in this miserable condition? Because nearly the whole of the produce of our labour is stolen from us by human beings. There, comrades, is the answer to all our problems.

51,"This was early in March. During the next three months there was much secret activity. Major’s speech had given to the more intelligent animals on the farm a completely new outlook on life. They did not know when the Rebellion predicted by Major would take place, they had no reason for thinking that it would be within their own lifetime, but they saw clearly that it was their duty to prepare for it. The work of teaching and organising the others fell naturally upon the pigs, who were generally recognised as being the cleverest of the animals. Pre-eminent among the pigs were two young boars named Snowball and Napoleon, whom Mr. Jones was breeding up for sale. Napoleon was a large, rather fierce-looking Berkshire boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way. Snowball was a more vivacious pig than Napoleon, quicker in speech and more inventive, but was not considered to have the same depth of character. All the other male pigs on the farm were porkers. The best known among them was a small fat pig named Squealer, with very round cheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements, and a shrill voice. He was a brilliant talker, and when he was arguing some difficult point he had a way of skipping from side to side and whisking his tail which was somehow very persuasive. The others said of Squealer that he could turn black into white.","That incident happened at the beginning of March. The animals intensified their underground activities continuously for the next three months. The Leader's speech had created an entirely new way of life for the intelligent ones. They didn't know when the Rebellion that the Leader predicted would happen, nor did they think they would witness it, but they knew one thing clearly: they had the responsibility to carry out the preparations. Of course, the task of education and organization was assigned to the pigs because they were considered the most intelligent species. Two young male pigs named Snowball and Napoleon, who were being fattened by Mr. Jones for sale, were the most famous. Napoleon was a fierce-looking boar, the only Berkshire on the Manor Farm; he was known for being taciturn but reputedly patient. Snowball was more lively, more articulate, and had more ideas, but most believed his character was not as deep as Napoleon's. The rest were all meat pigs. The most prominent among them was named Squealer, a small, rather fat but nimble pig with chubby cheeks, darting eyes, and a shrill voice. He was an excellent speaker; when he needed to prove a difficult point, he would skip around and wag his tail, looking very persuasive. It was rumored that he could turn black into white with ease.",19.188,18.777,"It was the early days of March when the Leader died.

No one knew when the Rebellion he had predicted would occur; they also didn't know if they would live long enough to see such an uprising; but they could clearly see that their duty was to prepare for that day. The task of educating and organizing the others was naturally given to the pigs, who were generally considered the smartest of the animals. The most talented of the pigs were two young male pigs named Snowball and Napoleon, whom Mr. Jones had raised for sale. Napoleon was a large, fierce-looking Berkshire boar; in fact, he was the only Berkshire on the farm. He wasn't much of a talker, but he was known for getting his way by force. Snowball was a more lively, more spirited pig than Napoleon; he was also more eloquent and more inventive; but it was said that his character was not as strong as Napoleon's. All the male pigs on the farm were fattening pigs. The most famous among them was a plump pig named Squealer, with very round cheeks, constantly blinking eyes, a shrill voice, and a restless nature. He was a brilliant speaker; when discussing a difficult topic, he would jump from side to side and wag his tail rapidly; for some reason, these actions made him very persuasive.

They rolled on the dew-covered grass, plucked and devoured the sweet summer herbs, dug up the black soil and tossed it into the air, inhaling the beautiful scent of the earth. Then, they toured the entire farm and inspected it; they couldn't help but watch the field, the pasture, the orchard, the pond, and the grove in awe, as if they were struck dumb. It was as if they had never seen these places before; they still couldn't believe that all of this was now theirs.",18.964,18.401,"But they woke up at dawn, as usual, and, suddenly remembering the glorious event, they all went together to the meadow. A short distance away, there was a hill from which almost the entire farm could be seen. The animals hurried to reach the summit and looked around in the clear morning light. Yes, it was theirs; everything they could see was theirs! Possessed by this thought, they jumped everywhere, leaping into the air with great jumps of joy. They rolled in the dew, bit the sweet summer grass, kicked up clods of black earth, and inhaled its strong aroma. Then they made an inspection tour of the entire farm and looked with silent admiration at the plowed land, the hayfield, the orchard, the pond, the grove. It was as if they had never seen those things before, and they could hardly believe that everything was theirs.",32.733,32.347
67,"Then they filed back to the farm buildings and halted in silence outside the door of the farmhouse. That was theirs too, but they were frightened to go inside. After a moment, however, Snowball and Napoleon butted the door open with their shoulders and the animals entered in single file, walking with the utmost care for fear of disturbing anything. They tiptoed from room to room, afraid to speak above a whisper and gazing with a kind of awe at the unbelievable luxury, at the beds with their feather mattresses, the looking-glasses, the horsehair sofa, the Brussels carpet, the lithograph of Queen Victoria over the drawing-room mantelpiece. They were lust coming down the stairs when Mollie was discovered to be missing. Going back, the others found that she had remained behind in the best bedroom. She had taken a piece of blue ribbon from Mrs. Jones’s dressing-table, and was holding it against her shoulder and admiring herself in the glass in a very foolish manner. The others reproached her sharply, and they went outside. Some hams hanging in the kitchen were taken out for burial, and the barrel of beer in the scullery was stove in with a kick from Boxer’s hoof, otherwise nothing in the house was touched. A unanimous resolution was passed on the spot that the farmhouse should be preserved as a museum. All were agreed that no animal must ever live there.","Then the whole group returned together and quietly gathered in front of the main house. Although this house now belonged to them, they were still hesitant and did not dare to enter immediately. But Snowball and Napoleon quickly regained their composure and used their shoulders to break open the door, then each one cautiously stepped inside, careful not to disturb the items within. They tiptoed from room to room, whispering, nervously admiring the unbelievable luxury before their eyes: feather beds, mirrors, horsehair-stuffed chairs, velvet carpets, and a portrait of Queen Victoria hanging above the fireplace in the living room. But when they reached the bottom of the stairs, they suddenly realized that Mollie was missing. They turned back and found Mollie still standing in the most beautiful bedroom in the house. It turned out she had taken a blue ribbon from Mrs. Jones's dressing table, draped it over her shoulder, and was gazing at herself in the mirror. The others immediately grabbed her and dragged her out of the house. The hams hanging in the kitchen were buried, the beer barrel in the scullery was kicked open by Boxer, and almost everything else was left in its place. A resolution to keep the main house as a museum was unanimously passed on the spot. All agreed that no animal should ever live in this house.",17.332,16.873,"Then, they lined up and returned to the farm buildings; when they reached the front door of the farmhouse, they held their breath and stopped. This house was theirs now, but they were afraid to go inside. Then, with Snowball and Napoleon shouldering the door and breaking it down, the animals entered in single file. They took great care with their steps to avoid making a mess; as they tiptoed from room to room, they whispered as if afraid their voices would be heard; they looked at the splendor inside, the feather mattresses, the mirrors, the horsehair-covered settee, the Brussels carpet, and the lithograph portrait of Queen Victoria above the fireplace in the sitting room with a mix of awe and fear. Just as they were descending the stairs, they noticed that Mollie was missing. A few of them rushed upstairs and began checking the rooms one by one. When they opened the door to the most elegant bedroom, what did they see! Wasn't Mollie admiring herself foolishly in the mirror, holding a blue ribbon, which seemed to have been taken from Mrs. Jones's dressing table, over her shoulder! They scolded Mollie severely and left the house. The hams hanging in the kitchen were taken out and buried, and the beer barrel in the pantry was smashed by Boxer with a kick, that's all; nothing else in the house was touched. Right then and there, they made a unanimous decision: The farmhouse would be preserved as a museum. There was not the slightest disagreement among them: No animal should live in this house.",21.359,21.016,"They returned afterward to the farm buildings and, hesitantly, stopped in silence before the door of the house. It was theirs too, but they were afraid to enter. A moment later, however, Snowball and Napoleon pushed the door with their shoulders and the animals entered in single file, walking with the utmost care for fear of spoiling something. They tiptoed from one room to another, afraid to raise their voices, gazing with a kind of reverent awe at the incredible luxury there: the beds with their feather mattresses, the mirrors, the horsehair sofa, the Brussels carpet, the lithograph of Queen Victoria hanging above the mantelpiece in the drawing-room. They were coming down the stairs when they realized that Mollie was missing. Retracing their steps, they discovered that the mare had stayed in the best bedroom. She had taken a piece of blue ribbon from Mrs. Jones's dressing table and, holding it against her shoulder, was admiring herself foolishly in the mirror. The others reproached her sharply and went out. They took out some hams that were hanging in the kitchen and buried them; the barrel of beer was smashed with a kick from Boxer, and nothing else in the house was touched.

70,"The pigs now revealed that during the past three months they had taught themselves to read and write from an old spelling book which had belonged to Mr. Jones’s children and which had been thrown on the rubbish heap. Napoleon sent for pots of black and white paint and led the way down to the five-barred gate that gave on to the main road. Then Snowball (for it was Snowball who was best at writing) took a brush between the two knuckles of his trotter, painted out MANOR FARM from the top bar of the gate and in its place painted ANIMAL FARM. This was to be the name of the farm from now onwards. After this they went back to the farm buildings, where Snowball and Napoleon sent for a ladder which they caused to be set against the end wall of the big barn. They explained that by their studies of the past three months the pigs had succeeded in reducing the principles of Animalism to Seven Commandments. These Seven Commandments would now be inscribed on the wall; they would form an unalterable law by which all the animals on Animal Farm must live for ever after. With some difficulty (for it is not easy for a pig to balance himself on a ladder) Snowball climbed up and set to work, with Squealer a few rungs below him holding the paint-pot. The Commandments were written on the tarred wall in great white letters that could be read thirty yards away. They ran thus:","So the two pigs said that thanks to the elementary books Mr. Jones found in the trash, they had been studying for the past three months and now they could read and write. Napoleon ordered to fetch a can of red paint, a can of white paint, and then led the group to the main gate. Snowball (because he had the best handwriting) held the paintbrush between his two hooves, erased the words Manor Farm, and wrote Animal Farm on the top plank of the gate. From now on, that would be the official name of the farm. After that, the group returned to the house, and Snowball and Napoleon ordered to find a ladder and set it up against the end wall of the barn. They explained that after a period of diligent research, in the past three months, they had distilled the principles of Animalism into Seven Commandments. The Seven Commandments would be inscribed on the wall and would be the unalterable law for all members of Animal Farm. Snowball climbed the ladder with difficulty (because pigs have trouble balancing on ladders) and began to write, while Squealer held the paint can below a few rungs.

From now on, the farm would be known by this name. Afterwards, they returned to the farm buildings; Snowball and Napoleon had a ladder brought and leaned it against the wall of the big barn. As a result of their three months of work, the pigs had managed to condense the fundamental principles of Animalism into seven commandments. Now these seven commandments would be written on the wall, and from now on, all the animals on Animal Farm would adhere to these unchanging laws for the rest of their lives.

89,"All through that summer the work of the farm went like clockwork. The animals were happy as they had never conceived it possible to be. Every mouthful of food was an acute positive pleasure, now that it was truly their own food, produced by themselves and for themselves, not doled out to them by a grudging master. With the worthless parasitical human beings gone, there was more for everyone to eat. There was more leisure too, inexperienced though the animals were. They met with many difficulties — for instance, later in the year, when they harvested the corn, they had to tread it out in the ancient style and blow away the chaff with their breath, since the farm possessed no threshing machine — but the pigs with their cleverness and Boxer with his tremendous muscles always pulled them through. Boxer was the admiration of everybody. He had been a hard worker even in Jones’s time, but now he seemed more like three horses than one; there were days when the entire work of the farm seemed to rest on his mighty shoulders. From morning to night he was pushing and pulling, always at the spot where the work was hardest. He had made an arrangement with one of the cockerels to call him in the mornings half an hour earlier than anyone else, and would put in some volunteer labour at whatever seemed to be most needed, before the regular day’s work began. His answer to every problem, every setback, was “I will work harder!”— which he had adopted as his personal motto.","The farm work went smoothly throughout that summer. The animals felt extremely happy; they had never thought that such a thing could happen. Eating was a joy, because now the food was theirs, made by them and for them, not something begrudgingly given by a stingy master anymore. After they had driven away the useless parasitic humans, each animal's portion naturally increased. And although they lacked experience, they still had more leisure time. They did encounter some difficulties, for example, when harvesting grain they had to use their strength to blow away the chaff because the farm didn't have a threshing machine, but with the intelligence of the pigs and the strength of Boxer, there was nothing they couldn't accomplish. Boxer was highly respected. Even when Mr. Jones was still around, he was already diligent, but now he worked three times as hard, sometimes it seemed like the entire farm's work fell on his shoulders. He pulled and pushed from dawn till dusk and was always present at the most difficult spots. He asked a rooster to wake him up half an hour earlier and voluntarily did some of the most urgent tasks before the official workday began. In the face of any difficulty or obstacle, he would say, ""I will work harder!"" This phrase had become his personal motto.",9.937,9.325,"That summer, everything was going well on the farm. The animals were happier than they could ever have imagined. They were no longer dependent on the meager food given by their stingy owners; they were eating food produced by themselves and for themselves, and they savored every bite. Since the worthless, parasitic humans had disappeared, there was more food for everyone. Despite their lack of experience, they were able to find more free time. They faced many difficulties; for example, as the season progressed and harvest time came, they had to thresh the grain with their feet and winnow it by blowing it into the air, just like in ancient times, because there was no threshing machine on the farm; but with the intelligence of the pigs and the strong muscles of Boxer, they were able to overcome every challenge. Everyone admired Boxer. Boxer, who had been an indefatigable animal even during Jones's time, was now working with the strength of nearly three horses; there were days when the entire burden of the farm's work fell on his strong shoulders. He was always there where the work was hardest; from morning till night, he worked tirelessly. He had made an arrangement with one of the young roosters to wake him up half an hour earlier than the others in the mornings; before the daily tasks began, he would rush to the place where he was most needed and work there voluntarily. It was as if he had made work a law for himself: If a problem or a setback arose, he would immediately say, ""I will work even harder!"" and get to work.",18.384,18.024,"Throughout the entire summer, work on the farm went smoothly.

Of course, they encountered many difficulties, for example: when they harvested the corn, they had to tread it in the old-fashioned way and remove the waste by blowing, since the farm did not have a threshing machine, but the pigs with their intelligence and Boxer with his powerful muscles always got them out of trouble. Everyone admired Boxer. He had been a great worker even in Jones's time, but now he resembled three horses rather than one; on certain days it seemed that all the work rested on his strong shoulders. He pulled and dragged from morning till night and always where the work was hardest. He had agreed with a rooster that it would wake him half an hour earlier than the others, and he would do some voluntary work where it was most needed before starting the normal daily tasks. His response to every problem, to every setback, was: ""I will work harder!""; it was like a personal refrain.",27.38,27.08
90,"But everyone worked according to his capacity. The hens and ducks, for instance, saved five bushels of corn at the harvest by gathering up the stray grains. Nobody stole, nobody grumbled over his rations, the quarrelling and biting and jealousy which had been normal features of life in the old days had almost disappeared. Nobody shirked — or almost nobody. Mollie, it was true, was not good at getting up in the mornings, and had a way of leaving work early on the ground that there was a stone in her hoof. And the behaviour of the cat was somewhat peculiar. It was soon noticed that when there was work to be done the cat could never be found. She would vanish for hours on end, and then reappear at meal-times, or in the evening after work was over, as though nothing had happened. But she always made such excellent excuses, and purred so affectionately, that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions. Old Benjamin, the donkey, seemed quite unchanged since the Rebellion. He did his work in the same slow obstinate way as he had done it in Jones’s time, never shirking and never volunteering for extra work either. About the Rebellion and its results he would express no opinion. When asked whether he was not happier now that Jones was gone, he would say only “Donkeys live a long time. None of you has ever seen a dead donkey,” and the others had to be content with this cryptic answer.","The other animals also worked with all their might. For example, the chickens and ducks managed to gather up to two quintals of grain. Petty theft; complaints about food and drink; quarrels and fights; jealousy - those bad habits of the past had completely disappeared. No animal shirked work - or rather, almost no animal. Mollie didn't like getting up early and tried to slip away, claiming that a small stone had gotten into her hoof. The cat's attitude was also suspicious. Whenever needed, it invariably disappeared beforehand. She often went off somewhere for a long time and only appeared, as if nothing had happened, right before meals or in the afternoon when the work was done. But she always found a way to explain and purred so charmingly that it was hard to doubt her goodwill. Only the old donkey Benjamin remained the same. He still did his work with the same slow pace as in Mr. Jones's time, never shirking but never doing more either. He said nothing about the Rebellion or the changes that followed. If asked whether he felt happier than in Mr. Jones's time, he would say: ""Donkey's life is long. You have never seen a dead donkey"" - he always said such a cryptic sentence.",9.669,9.002,"Actually, everyone was working well according to their own strength and ability. For instance, the chickens and ducks had saved nearly twenty bushels of grain by collecting the scattered grains. No one was stealing, no one was grumbling about their assigned rations; fights, bites, and jealousies, which were once considered normal features of life on the farm, had almost entirely disappeared. No one was shirking work, except for one person. Yes, Mollie had a problem with not being able to get up early in the mornings; moreover, she would sometimes leave work early, using a stone in her hoof as an excuse. In truth, the cat was also peculiar. After a while, it was understood that she never appeared when there was work to be done. She would disappear for hours, but when it was time to eat or when the work was finished in the late afternoon, she would appear as if nothing had happened. But each time, she would come up with such good excuses and purr so affectionately that she managed to convince everyone of her good intentions. The old donkey Benjamin seemed unchanged since the Rebellion. Just like in Mr. Jones's time, he was still sluggish and stubborn; he neither shirked work nor was he eager to work too hard. He did not express the slightest opinion about the Rebellion and its consequences. When asked if he was happier after Jones left the farm, he would simply say, ""Donkeys live a long time. Have you ever seen a dead donkey in your life?"" and leave everyone to settle for this ambiguous answer.",18.268,17.881,"But each one acted according to their ability. The hens and ducks, for example, recovered five bushels of corn during the harvest by picking up the lost grains. Nobody stole, nobody complained about their ration; the arguments, fights, and envies that were a natural component of daily life in the old days had almost completely disappeared. Nobody shirked work, or almost nobody. Mollie, in truth, was not very diligent about getting up in the morning, and she had the habit of leaving work early, claiming that a stone had gotten into her hoof. And the behavior of the cat was somewhat strange. Soon it was noticed that when there was work, she was nowhere to be found. She would disappear for entire hours, and then show up at mealtime or at dusk, when the work was over, as if nothing had happened.

Snowball had found in the harness-room an old green tablecloth of Mrs. Jones’s and had painted on it a hoof and a horn in white. This was run up the flagstaff in the farmhouse garden every Sunday morning. The flag was green, Snowball explained, to represent the green fields of England, while the hoof and horn signified the future Republic of the Animals which would arise when the human race had been finally overthrown. After the hoisting of the flag all the animals trooped into the big barn for a general assembly which was known as the Meeting. Here the work of the coming week was planned out and resolutions were put forward and debated. It was always the pigs who put forward the resolutions. The other animals understood how to vote, but could never think of any resolutions of their own. Snowball and Napoleon were by far the most active in the debates. But it was noticed that these two were never in agreement: whatever suggestion either of them made, the other could be counted on to oppose it. Even when it was resolved — a thing no one could object to in itself — to set aside the small paddock behind the orchard as a home of rest for animals who were past work, there was a stormy debate over the correct retiring age for each class of animal.

Snowball explained that the green color symbolized the fields of England, while the hoof and horn were symbols of the future Animal Republic, once the humans were completely overthrown. After the flag-raising, all the animals would gather in the big barn, which they called the Meeting. They would plan the coming week and discuss and pass resolutions on various proposals there. Only the pigs made proposals. The other animals only voted but never proposed anything. Snowball and Napoleon were the most active in discussions. But these two always opposed each other: whenever one proposed an idea, the other would immediately counter it. Even when a matter had been decided, such as setting aside a small piece of land behind the orchard for retirement, which no one could oppose, these two would still argue fiercely over which species and at what age they should retire.

But these two never agreed: Whatever one proposed, the other was sure to oppose. Even when a decision was reached that no one could dispute, they found a way to quarrel with each other. For example, after it was decided that the pasture behind the orchard would be set aside as a grazing area for animals no longer able to work, they argued over what the retirement age for the different types of animals should be.

Surely, comrades,” cried Squealer almost pleadingly, skipping from side to side and whisking his tail, “surely there is no one among you who wants to see Jones come back?”","""Comrades,"" it said, ""I hope you don't think that we pigs are doing this out of selfishness and privilege, do you? Many pig comrades are also sick of milk and apples. I don't like those two things either. Our purpose in eating those things is solely to protect our health. Milk and apples (Comrades, science has proven) contain many substances that are extremely necessary for the health of pigs. We pigs do intellectual work. We handle all the organization and management of this farm. For your prosperity, we have to work day and night. We drink milk and eat apples for your own benefit. Can you imagine what would happen if we pigs couldn't handle our duties? Mr. Jones would come back! Yes, Mr. Jones would come back! Surely none of us want Mr. Jones to come back, do we?"" it pleaded loudly, shouting and jumping from right to left, its tail wagging furiously, ""Surely none of us want Mr. Jones to come back, right?""",22.746,22.272,"Squealer, who was tasked with making the necessary explanations to the other animals, shouted, ""Comrades!"" ""I hope you do not think that we pigs are doing this out of selfishness or a love for privilege. In fact, most of us do not like milk and apples. I do not like them either. The only reason we are taking these apples is to preserve our health. There are certain substances in milk and apples that are absolutely necessary for the health of pigs. Science has proven this, comrades. We pigs are the brainworkers. We are responsible for the management and organization of this farm. We work day and night to safeguard your well-being. We drink this milk and eat these apples for your sake. Do you know what would happen if we pigs failed to perform our duty properly? Jones would come back! Yes, Jones would come back! Have no doubt about that, comrades."" Then, jumping from side to side and wagging his tail, he shouted: ""I believe there is not a single animal among you who wants Jones to come back!""",28.979,28.588,"—Comrades —he shouted—, I imagine you don't suppose that we pigs are doing this with a spirit of selfishness and privilege. Many of us, in fact, have an aversion to milk and apples. Personally, I don't like them. Our only purpose in eating these foods is to preserve our health. Milk and apples (this has been proven by Science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary for the health of a pig. We pigs work with our brains. The entire administration and organization of this farm depend on us. Day and night we are watching over your happiness. For your sake, we take that milk and eat those apples.

The importance of keeping the pigs in good health was all too obvious. So it was agreed without further argument that the milk and the windfall apples (and also the main crop of apples when they ripened) should be reserved for the pigs alone.","Surely no animal wanted Mr. Jones to come back. When put that way, no animal dared to speak up anymore. The health of the pigs was of utmost importance, that was unquestionable.

104,"Most of this time Mr. Jones had spent sitting in the taproom of the Red Lion at Willingdon, complaining to anyone who would listen of the monstrous injustice he had suffered in being turned out of his property by a pack of good-for-nothing animals. The other farmers sympathised in principle, but they did not at first give him much help. At heart, each of them was secretly wondering whether he could not somehow turn Jones’s misfortune to his own advantage. It was lucky that the owners of the two farms which adjoined Animal Farm were on permanently bad terms. One of them, which was named Foxwood, was a large, neglected, old-fashioned farm, much overgrown by woodland, with all its pastures worn out and its hedges in a disgraceful condition. Its owner, Mr. Pilkington, was an easy-going gentleman farmer who spent most of his time in fishing or hunting according to the season. The other farm, which was called Pinchfield, was smaller and better kept. Its owner was a Mr. Frederick, a tough, shrewd man, perpetually involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard bargains. These two disliked each other so much that it was difficult for them to come to any agreement, even in defence of their own interests.","Meanwhile, Mr. Jones almost every day sat in the Red Lion restaurant in Willingdon, lamenting to anyone who would listen about being robbed of his property by the useless animals. The other farm owners were sympathetic, but they didn't offer any help. Moreover, deep down, they were looking for ways to take advantage of his misfortune. Fortunately, the owners of the two farms adjacent to Animal Farm were always at odds with each other. One farm was called Foxwood, a large but neglected farm, cultivated in the old-fashioned way, with overgrown areas, trampled grazing grounds, and dilapidated fences. The owner of this farm, Mr. Pilkington, was an easygoing man who spent most of his time hunting and fishing. The second farm was called Pinchfield, smaller but better maintained. The owner of this farm, Mr. Frederick, was a tough, shrewd man, constantly involved in lawsuits and notorious as a cunning swindler. These two men hated each other so much that they couldn't find common ground even in protecting their own interests.",23.652,23.284,"Meanwhile, Mr. Jones spent most of his time lounging at the Red Lion tavern in Willingdon; whenever he found someone to listen to him, he would immediately start complaining, saying he had been terribly wronged and driven out of his farm by a bunch of lowly animals. The other farmers had met him with understanding, but initially, they were not very inclined to help. Each of them was secretly thinking about how they could benefit from Jones's misfortune. Fortunately, the owners of the two farms neighboring Animal Farm could never get along with each other. Foxwood was a large, neglected, and run-down farm; it was overgrown with bushes, its pastures had withered, and its fences were in tatters. The owner of Foxwood, Mr. Pilkington, spent most of his time fishing during the fishing season and hunting during the hunting season; he was a laid-back, gentlemanly man. Pinchfield Farm, on the other hand, was smaller but better maintained. The owner of Pinchfield, Mr. Frederick, was a bully and a cunning man; he was constantly involved in lawsuits; money was his religion, and once he got his hands on something, he wouldn't let go.

At first they pretended to laugh to scorn the idea of animals managing a farm for themselves. The whole thing would be over in a fortnight, they said. They put it about that the animals on the Manor Farm (they insisted on calling it the Manor Farm; they would not tolerate the name “Animal Farm”) were perpetually fighting among themselves and were also rapidly starving to death. When time passed and the animals had evidently not starved to death, Frederick and Pilkington changed their tune and began to talk of the terrible wickedness that now flourished on Animal Farm. It was given out that the animals there practised cannibalism, tortured one another with red-hot horseshoes, and had their females in common.

But when it turned out after a while that the animals were not dying of starvation, they changed their tune and started talking about the mind-boggling devilry at Animal Farm.

Above all, the tune and even the words of ‘Beasts of England’ were known everywhere. It had spread with astonishing speed. The human beings could not contain their rage when they heard this song, though they pretended to think it merely ridiculous. They could not understand, they said, how even animals could bring themselves to sing such contemptible rubbish. Any animal caught singing it was given a flogging on the spot. And yet the song was irrepressible. The blackbirds whistled it in the hedges, the pigeons cooed it in the elms, it got into the din of the smithies and the tune of the church bells. And when the human beings listened to it, they secretly trembled, hearing in it a prophecy of their future doom.","But not many people believed that story.

The melody and lyrics of the song ""Beasts of England"" spread to every nook and cranny. It was disseminated at an unprecedented speed. The song drove people mad, but they pretended it was just a ridiculous joke. Even animals couldn't possibly sing such vile rubbish, they said. Any animal caught singing that song was immediately beaten on the spot. Yet it still couldn't be completely banned. Birds sang it on the fences, pigeons cooed it in the trees, the song entered the chirping of crickets, and even the church bells.

Although people claimed to find it very ridiculous, they couldn't help but feel great anger when they heard this song. They argued that they couldn't even comprehend how such a disgraceful and absurd song could be sung by animals. Animals caught singing the song were whipped on the spot, yet the spread of the song could not be prevented.

109,"As the human beings approached the farm buildings, Snowball launched his first attack. All the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five, flew to and fro over the men’s heads and muted upon them from mid-air; and while the men were dealing with this, the geese, who had been hiding behind the hedge, rushed out and pecked viciously at the calves of their legs. However, this was only a light skirmishing manoeuvre, intended to create a little disorder, and the men easily drove the geese off with their sticks. Snowball now launched his second line of attack. Muriel, Benjamin, and all the sheep, with Snowball at the head of them, rushed forward and prodded and butted the men from every side, while Benjamin turned around and lashed at them with his small hoofs. But once again the men, with their sticks and their hobnailed boots, were too strong for them; and suddenly, at a squeal from Snowball, which was the signal for retreat, all the animals turned and fled through the gateway into the yard.","Tuyet Tron ordered an attack as soon as the group of people approached the row of houses in the farm. Thirty-five pigeons were dispatched, flying back and forth and defecating on the heads of the people below. While they were busy dodging and brushing off, the geese, ambushed behind the fence, rushed out and bit their legs. But that was just a tactical move to disrupt the enemy's ranks because it was easy for people to use sticks to drive the geese away. The second wave of attack was launched. Muriel, Benjamin, and the entire flock of sheep, led by Tuyet Tron himself, charged forward, surrounding the people and butting them while Benjamin turned his back on them and kicked wildly. But this time, the animals did not win either; the sticks and spiked shoes used by the humans were too strong for them. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Tuyet Tron neighed loudly, which was the signal to temporarily retreat, and the animals quickly fled into the yard.",15.457,14.866,"As the people approached the farm buildings, Snowball initiated the first attack. Exactly thirty-five pigeons flew over the men's heads, defecating on them. While the men tried to chase away the pigeons, the geese, hidden behind the fence, suddenly rushed forward and began savagely pecking at their calves. However, this was merely a feint to cause some confusion; indeed, the men easily drove the geese back with their sticks. This time, Snowball initiated the second attack. Muriel, Benjamin, and all the sheep, led by Snowball, charged forward, butting and horn-thrusting the men from all sides; meanwhile, Benjamin kept kicking back. But with their sticks in hand and hobnailed boots on their feet, the men were still stronger than the animals. When Snowball suddenly squealed, signaling a retreat, all the animals turned back, dashed through the passage, and plunged into the yard.",24.606,24.18,"When the human beings approached the farm buildings, Snowball launched his first attack.

But that was a mere skirmish intended to create a bit of disorder, and the men easily drove the geese away with their sticks. Snowball launched the second line of attack: Muriel, Benjamin, and all the sheep, with Snowball at the head, advanced, charging and shoving the men from all sides, while Benjamin turned around and began kicking with his hind legs. But again, the men, with their sticks and hobnailed boots, were too strong for them, and suddenly, upon hearing Snowball's squeal, which was the signal to retreat, all the animals turned around and went through the gate into the yard.",44.242,43.973
110,"The men gave a shout of triumph. They saw, as they imagined, their enemies in flight, and they rushed after them in disorder. This was just what Snowball had intended. As soon as they were well inside the yard, the three horses, the three cows, and the rest of the pigs, who had been lying in ambush in the cowshed, suddenly emerged in their rear, cutting them off. Snowball now gave the signal for the charge. He himself dashed straight for Jones. Jones saw him coming, raised his gun and fired. The pellets scored bloody streaks along Snowball’s back, and a sheep dropped dead. Without halting for an instant, Snowball flung his fifteen stone against Jones’s legs. Jones was hurled into a pile of dung and his gun flew out of his hands. But the most terrifying spectacle of all was Boxer, rearing up on his hind legs and striking out with his great iron-shod hoofs like a stallion. His very first blow took a stable-lad from Foxwood on the skull and stretched him lifeless in the mud. At the sight, several men dropped their sticks and tried to run. Panic overtook them, and the next moment all the animals together were chasing them round and round the yard. They were gored, kicked, bitten, trampled on. There was not an animal on the farm that did not take vengeance on them after his own fashion. Even the cat suddenly leapt off a roof onto a cowman’s shoulders and sank her claws in his neck, at which he yelled horribly. At a moment when the opening was clear, the men were glad enough to rush out of the yard and make a bolt for the main road. And so within five minutes of their invasion they were in ignominious retreat by the same way as they had come, with a flock of geese hissing after them and pecking at their calves all the way.","The victorious cheers echoed. The attackers saw that the enemy had fled as expected, so without needing to reorganize their ranks, they hurriedly rushed forward to pursue. Just as Snowball had anticipated. When everyone had entered the yard, three horses, three cows, and all the remaining pigs that had been lying in ambush in the cow shed rushed out to cut off the retreat. Snowball ordered a full assault. He charged straight at Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones saw him coming and pulled the trigger. The shotgun blast wounded Snowball along his back, blood streaming out, and killed a sheep. Without hesitating for a second, Snowball continued to thrust his hefty body into Mr. Jones's legs. He fell sprawling into a pile of dung, his gun flying far away. But the most terrifying was Boxer, who stood on his hind legs and brought down his iron-shod hooves on the man's head. His first blow knocked the Foxwood farmhand to the ground, unconscious. Several people threw down their sticks and fled. Not missing the opportunity, the animals chased them around the yard. They butted them up, then bit, kicked, and trampled. There wasn't a single animal on the farm that didn't take part in the revenge in its own way. Even the cat leapt from the roof of the cow shed onto a cowherd's shoulders, biting his neck and screeching as if in a fit. As soon as they saw an opening to retreat, everyone hurriedly ran out of the yard to the main road. Thus, having penetrated for less than five minutes, they had to flee, with the geese biting their legs and honking as they chased them.",17.149,16.832,"The men shouting victory cries, thinking their enemies were fleeing, ran chaotically after them. This was exactly what Snowball wanted. Once they all entered the yard, the three horses, three cows, and the other pigs who were lying in ambush in the barn suddenly appeared and cut off the men's retreat. It was at that moment that Snowball gave the signal to attack and charged straight at Jones. Seeing Snowball coming at him, Jones aimed his rifle and fired. The pellets opened bloody furrows on Snowball's back; one of the sheep died on the spot. Without a moment's hesitation, Snowball, with his hundred-kilo body, lunged at Jones's legs. As Jones tumbled onto a manure pile, his rifle flew out of his hand. But the most terrifying was Boxer; rearing up on his hind legs, he fought like a stallion, swinging his massive iron-shod hooves. The first blow landed on the head of a stable boy from Foxwood Farm, who collapsed into the mud and died on the spot. Seeing this, many of the men dropped their sticks and tried to flee. They were seized with panic. At that moment, all the animals chased after the men, pursuing them around the yard. They gored, kicked, bit, and trampled anyone who lagged behind. Not a single animal on the farm failed to take its revenge on the men. Even the cat suddenly leaped from the roof onto a cowherd's back, digging its claws into his neck and making him scream in pain. The men, finding an opportunity, bolted out of the yard and started running full speed towards the main road. It had been less than five minutes since they had raided the farm, yet they were retreating in disgrace, just as they had come. A flock of geese, hissing as they followed, pecked at their legs all the way down the road.",22.153,21.863,"The men let out a cry of triumph. They saw —or so they imagined— their enemies in flight and ran after them in disarray. That was precisely what Snowball had been expecting. As soon as they were inside the yard, the three horses, the three cows, and the other pigs, who had been lying in wait in the cowshed, suddenly appeared behind them, cutting off their retreat. Snowball gave the signal to charge. He himself attacked Jones. Jones saw him coming, aimed his shotgun, and fired. The pellets left their bloody mark on Snowball's back, and a sheep fell dead. Without hesitating for an instant, Snowball hurled his fifteen stone against Jones's legs, who fell onto a pile of manure as the shotgun slipped from his hands.

There was not a single animal on the farm that did not take revenge in its own way. Even the cat suddenly leaped from a rooftop onto a cowboy's back and sank its claws into his neck, making him scream horribly. When the exit was clear, the men were glad to escape the yard and flee like lightning to the main road. And so, five minutes after their invasion, they were in shameful retreat along the same access route, with a flock of geese pecking at their calves all the way.",41.082,40.913

128,"In January there came bitterly hard weather. The earth was like iron, and nothing could be done in the fields. Many meetings were held in the big barn, and the pigs occupied themselves with planning out the work of the coming season. It had come to be accepted that the pigs, who were manifestly cleverer than the other animals, should decide all questions of farm policy, though their decisions had to be ratified by a majority vote. This arrangement would have worked well enough if it had not been for the disputes between Snowball and Napoleon. These two disagreed at every point where disagreement was possible. If one of them suggested sowing a bigger acreage with barley, the other was certain to demand a bigger acreage of oats, and if one of them said that such and such a field was just right for cabbages, the other would declare that it was useless for anything except roots. Each had his own following, and there were some violent debates. At the Meetings Snowball often won over the majority by his brilliant speeches, but Napoleon was better at canvassing support for himself in between times. He was especially successful with the sheep. Of late the sheep had taken to bleating “Four legs good, two legs bad” both in and out of season, and they often interrupted the Meeting with this. It was noticed that they were especially liable to break into “Four legs good, two legs bad” at crucial moments in Snowball’s speeches. Snowball had made a close study of some back numbers of the ‘Farmer and Stockbreeder’ which he had found in the farmhouse, and was full of plans for innovations and improvements. He talked learnedly about field drains, silage, and basic slag, and had worked out a complicated scheme for all the animals to drop their dung directly in the fields, at a different spot every day, to save the labour of cartage. Napoleon produced no schemes of his own, but said quietly that Snowball’s would come to nothing, and seemed to be biding his time. But of all their controversies, none was so bitter as the one that took place over the windmill.","As January arrived, the weather became extremely harsh. The ground was as hard as rock, making it impossible to do any work. Meetings were moved to the large barn, and the pigs focused on planning for the next season. They agreed that since the pigs were the smartest, they would be responsible for the overall direction of the farm, but their decisions had to be approved by an absolute majority. Everything would have been perfect if Snowball and Napoleon didn't constantly oppose each other. The two disagreed on every issue whenever they had the chance. If one said more barley should be sown, the other would insist on sowing more oats; if one said a certain field was suitable for cabbages, the other would argue that only turnips could be grown there. Each had a number of supporters, so the debates were often very intense. Thanks to his eloquence, Snowball usually won the majority in the Meetings, while outside, the majority supported Napoleon. The most loyal to Napoleon were the sheep. Recently, the sheep often chanted ""Four legs good, two legs bad"" for any reason or no reason at all, frequently interrupting the Meetings. Especially during the most important parts of Snowball's speeches, the sheep would invariably shout ""Four legs good, two legs bad"". Snowball had studied the ""Agriculture and Livestock"" magazine found in the main house thoroughly, and his head was full of plans for reforming and modernizing production. He talked about drainage systems for the fields, silage pits, and phosphate fertilizers for the entire farm; he even drafted a sanitation schedule so that each animal would ""go"" in a different place each time to save on transportation later. Napoleon, on the other hand, didn't draft anything but whispered to the others that Snowball was just talking nonsense and seemed to be waiting for the right moment to act. But the fiercest dispute between the two was over the construction of the windmill.",13.233,12.889,"In January, the weather became extremely cold. The ground was so hard that it was impossible to work in the fields. Meeting after meeting was being held in the large barn, and the pigs were trying to plan the work for the coming season. The authority to make decisions on all matters related to farm politics was given to the pigs, who were clearly more intelligent than the other animals; although their decisions had to be approved by a majority vote. If it weren't for the constant quarrels between Snowball and Napoleon, who clashed on almost every issue, this system would have worked quite well. If one proposed to expand the area planted with barley, the other would argue that the area planted with oats should be expanded; if one said a field was suitable for growing cabbages, the other would claim that nothing but root crops could be grown there. Both had their supporters; sometimes fierce arguments would break out. With his brilliant speeches, Snowball often managed to win the majority of votes at meetings; but Napoleon was no less skilled at garnering support through behind-the-scenes work. He was particularly good at influencing the sheep. The sheep, who had recently developed the habit of bleating ""Four legs good, two legs bad!"" at every opportunity, were frequently disrupting the meetings. It was particularly noticeable that they would start bleating ""Four legs good, two legs bad!"" at the most crucial points of Snowball's speeches. Snowball had read and studied old issues of a magazine called Farmer and Stockbreeder, which he found in the farmhouse, and had come up with a lot of plans for the renovation and improvement of the farm. He gave speeches demonstrating how well he knew topics such as opening water channels in the fields, preserving fodder in silos, and how to make use of manure. He had developed a complex plan for all the animals to defecate directly in the fields, in a different spot each day; this way, they would also save the labor and time spent transporting manure to the fields by cart. Napoleon, on the other hand, did not come up with a single original idea, quietly spreading the notion that Snowball's plans were useless, as if he were waiting for the right moment.

129,"In the long pasture, not far from the farm buildings, there was a small knoll which was the highest point on the farm. After surveying the ground, Snowball declared that this was just the place for a windmill, which could be made to operate a dynamo and supply the farm with electrical power. This would light the stalls and warm them in winter, and would also run a circular saw, a chaff-cutter, a mangel-slicer, and an electric milking machine. The animals had never heard of anything of this kind before (for the farm was an old-fashioned one and had only the most primitive machinery), and they listened in astonishment while Snowball conjured up pictures of fantastic machines which would do their work for them while they grazed at their ease in the fields or improved their minds with reading and conversation.","On the grass field, not far from the rows of houses of the farm, there was a small mound, which was also the highest point in the farm. After surveying, Snowball declared that this was the best area to build a windmill, and they would install a generator on it to supply electricity to the entire farm. The barns would then have electric lights, and in winter, there would be heaters, not to mention using electricity to run the saw, the grass cutter, the red beet slicer, and the milking machine. The animals had never heard of such things before (this farm was quite backward, only having the simplest machines), and they listened in amazement as Snowball enthusiastically talked about the wonderful machines that would do the work for them while they could leisurely graze in the fields or sit reading books and debating to gradually improve their minds.",27.101,26.585,"There was a small hill in the meadow that stretched out just beyond the farm buildings. This was the highest point of the farm. After carefully examining the ground, Snowball declared that this was the most suitable place for a windmill. The windmill could operate a dynamo and provide electrical power to the entire farm. Thus, the barns could be illuminated and heated in winter; tools such as a circular saw, hay and straw cutter, beet slicer, and electric milking machine could be used. The animals had never heard of such a thing before (Beilik Farm, being an ancient farm, only had the most primitive tools); they listened to Snowball in astonishment as he conjured up those fantastical devices before their eyes. According to Snowball's descriptions, these incredible devices would handle all the farm's work, and they would lounge in the fields, enjoying themselves, reading books, and engaging in conversations to improve themselves.",22.764,22.194,"In the long prairie, near the buildings, there was a small hill that was the highest point of the farm. After studying the terrain, Snowball declared that this was the ideal place for a windmill, which could be used to run a dynamo and supply electricity to the farm. This would provide light for the animals' stalls and heat them in winter, and it would also run a circular saw, a thresher, a cutter, an electric milker, etc. The animals had never heard of such things (because the farm was old-fashioned and had the most primitive machinery), and they listened in astonishment to Snowball as he described to them pictures of fantastic machinery that would work for them, while they grazed peacefully in the fields or improved their minds through reading and conversation.",43.52,43.131
130,"Within a few weeks Snowball’s plans for the windmill were fully worked out. The mechanical details came mostly from three books which had belonged to Mr. Jones —‘One Thousand Useful Things to Do About the House’, ‘Every Man His Own Bricklayer’, and ‘Electricity for Beginners’. Snowball used as his study a shed which had once been used for incubators and had a smooth wooden floor, suitable for drawing on. He was closeted there for hours at a time. With his books held open by a stone, and with a piece of chalk gripped between the knuckles of his trotter, he would move rapidly to and fro, drawing in line after line and uttering little whimpers of excitement. Gradually the plans grew into a complicated mass of cranks and cog-wheels, covering more than half the floor, which the other animals found completely unintelligible but very impressive. All of them came to look at Snowball’s drawings at least once a day. Even the hens and ducks came, and were at pains not to tread on the chalk marks. Only Napoleon held aloof. He had declared himself against the windmill from the start. One day, however, he arrived unexpectedly to examine the plans. He walked heavily round the shed, looked closely at every detail of the plans and snuffed at them once or twice, then stood for a little while contemplating them out of the corner of his eye; then suddenly he lifted his leg, urinated over the plans, and walked out without uttering a word.","Just a few weeks later, Tuyet Tron had completed the technical documents for the windmill project. The detailed mechanical drawings were drafted based on three of Mr. Jones's books: ""A Thousand Useful Household Items,"" ""Do-It-Yourself Masonry,"" and ""What a Beginner Electrician Needs to Know.""Tuyet Tron used the shed, which was previously an incubation area, as an office because it had a flat wooden floor that was very suitable for technical drawing. Tuyet Tron sat in there for hours on end. It placed a stone on the necessary book page, held a piece of chalk with one foot; it hopped back and forth, drawing as it hopped, sometimes squealing softly in delight. Gradually, the drawings, consisting of numerous interlocking shafts and gears, covered nearly half of the shed, and although the other animals didn't understand them, they were extremely impressed. Every day, the animals came to look at Tuyet Tron's drawings at least once. Even the chickens and ducks came, but they stood at a distance to avoid stepping on the chalk drawings. Only Napoleon didn't care at all. He opposed it from the beginning. Nevertheless, one day he came to inspect the project without informing any of the animals beforehand. He walked around the shed, then went in to scrutinize the drawings, sniffing here and there, then lifted his leg and urinated on them, after which he calmly walked out without saying a word.",10.984,10.244,"Snowball's plans for the windmill were finalized in a few weeks. A large portion of the mechanical details were obtained from Mr. Jones's three books: A Thousand and One Tips for Your Home, Do It Yourself Wall Building, and Electricity in Ten Lessons. Snowball was using the shed, where the incubators once stood and which had a smooth wooden floor suitable for drawing, as his study room. Sometimes he would lock himself in the shed for hours. He placed weights on the pages of the books he laid on the ground, held a piece of chalk between the hooves of his front foot, and as he quickly made the drawings, he would get so excited that he was out of breath, making short, gasping sounds from his throat. Snowball's drawings gradually turned into a complex heap of levers and gears, covering more than half of the shed. The other animals did not understand any of this, but they found it very impressive. They came to look at Snowball's drawings at least once a day. The chickens and ducks also came, struggling not to step on the chalk-drawn lines. Only Napoleon, who had declared his opposition to the windmill from the very beginning, stayed away from there. But he couldn't resist; one day, out of the blue, he came to see the drawings. He slowly wandered inside the shed, examined every detail of the drawings at length, sniffed and prodded them several times, stood there for a while watching out of the corner of his eye, then suddenly lifted his leg and urinated on the drawings, and left without saying a single word.",18.964,18.579,"In a few weeks, Snowball's plans for the windmill were completed. The technical details came mainly from three books that had belonged to Mr. Jones: ""A Thousand Useful Things to Do Around the House,"" ""Every Man His Own Bricklayer,"" and ""Electricity for Beginners."" As a study, Snowball used a shed that had once been used for incubators and had a smooth wooden floor, suitable for drawing. He would lock himself in there for hours on end. He kept his books open with a stone and, wielding a piece of chalk, moved quickly from side to side, drawing line after line and uttering small squeals of enthusiasm. Gradually, his plans transformed into a complicated mass of cranks and gears that covered more than half of the floor, which the other animals found completely indecipherable but very impressive. Everyone went to look at Snowball's plans at least once a day. Even the hens and ducks did so and took great care not to step on the chalk marks. Only Napoleon kept his distance. He had declared himself against the windmill from the beginning. One day, however, he unexpectedly came with the purpose of examining the plans. He walked heavily around, carefully observed every detail, and even sniffed once or twice; then he stood for a while, glancing at them sideways; then, suddenly, he lifted his leg, urinated on the plans, and walked away without saying a word.",40.388,40.157
131,"The whole farm was deeply divided on the subject of the windmill. Snowball did not deny that to build it would be a difficult business. Stone would have to be carried and built up into walls, then the sails would have to be made and after that there would be need for dynamos and cables. (How these were to be procured, Snowball did not say.) But he maintained that it could all be done in a year. And thereafter, he declared, so much labour would be saved that the animals would only need to work three days a week. Napoleon, on the other hand, argued that the great need of the moment was to increase food production, and that if they wasted time on the windmill they would all starve to death. The animals formed themselves into two factions under the slogan, “Vote for Snowball and the three-day week” and “Vote for Napoleon and the full manger.” Benjamin was the only animal who did not side with either faction. He refused to believe either that food would become more plentiful or that the windmill would save work. Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had always gone on — that is, badly.","Due to the construction of the windmill, the farm was divided into two opposing factions. Snowball did not hide the fact that building the windmill would require a great sacrifice. They would have to quarry and transport stone to the site, then build, and only after that install the blades, motor, and electrical wiring (how to obtain those things, Snowball did not say). But he still asserted that the project could be completed within a year. After that, he declared, the workload would decrease significantly, and they would only have to work three days a week. On the other hand, Napoleon argued that the most important task at present was food production, and if they wasted time on building the windmill, they would starve. The animals divided into two factions; one faction adopted the slogan: ""Support Snowball and three days of work a week""; the other adopted the slogan: ""Support Napoleon and a full belly."" Only Benjamin did not join any faction. He did not believe that food would become abundant, nor did he believe that the windmill would help reduce manual labor. With or without the windmill, it would be the same; they had lived as they did and would continue to live that way, meaning they would still suffer.",19.376,18.904,"The windmill issue had led to a deep division on the farm. Snowball did not deny that building the windmill would be very difficult. Stones would have to be carried from the quarry, walls built, the windmill's blades made, and then dynamos and cables would need to be found. (Snowball never mentioned how all these tasks would be accomplished) He merely claimed that all the work would be completed within a year. According to him, once the windmill was completed, work would become so easy that the animals would only need to work three days a week. In contrast, Napoleon argued that their greatest need was to increase food production and that if time was wasted on the windmill, everyone would die of starvation. The animals had split into two factions under the slogans ""Vote for Snowball and work three days a week!"" and ""Vote for Napoleon and never go hungry!"" The only animal who remained outside the factions was Benjamin. He believed neither in the coming of abundance nor that the windmill would make things easier. ""Whether there is a windmill or not, nothing will change in our miserable lives,"" he said.",22.531,22.103,"The entire farm was very divided on the matter of the windmill. Snowball did not deny that the construction would mean difficult work. They would have to extract stones from the quarry and with them build walls, then construct the blades, and after all that, they would need dynamos and cables (how they would obtain those things, Snowball did not say). But he maintained that everything could be done in a year. And henceforth, he declared, so much work would be saved that the animals would only have three working days per week. Napoleon, on the other hand, maintained that the great need of the moment was to increase food production, and that if they wasted time on the windmill, they would all starve to death. The animals grouped into two factions under the slogans: ""Vote for Snowball and the three-day week"" and ""Vote for Napoleon and the full manger."" Benjamin was the only animal who did not enlist in either of the two sides. He refused to believe that there would be more abundance of food or that the windmill would save work. ""With windmill or without windmill,"" he said, ""life will go on as it always has, that is, a disaster.""",48.026,47.799
132,"Apart from the disputes over the windmill, there was the question of the defence of the farm. It was fully realised that though the human beings had been defeated in the Battle of the Cowshed they might make another and more determined attempt to recapture the farm and reinstate Mr. Jones. They had all the more reason for doing so because the news of their defeat had spread across the countryside and made the animals on the neighbouring farms more restive than ever. As usual, Snowball and Napoleon were in disagreement. According to Napoleon, what the animals must do was to procure firearms and train themselves in the use of them. According to Snowball, they must send out more and more pigeons and stir up rebellion among the animals on the other farms. The one argued that if they could not defend themselves they were bound to be conquered, the other argued that if rebellions happened everywhere they would have no need to defend themselves. The animals listened first to Napoleon, then to Snowball, and could not make up their minds which was right; indeed, they always found themselves in agreement with the one who was speaking at the moment.","Besides the windmill, they also argued about defense. Everyone understood that although humans were defeated in the Battle of the Cowshed, they would certainly fight another battle, this one fiercer, to reclaim the farm for Mr. Jones. People were bound to do so because rumors of the humans' great defeat had spread throughout the countryside, and the animals in other farms had now become more rebellious than ever. As always, Snowball and Napoleon could not find common ground. According to Napoleon, the first thing to do was to purchase and learn to use firearms. According to Snowball, the urgent task now was to send flocks of pigeons to other farms to incite rebellions there. One believed that if they could not defend themselves, they would certainly be conquered by humans, while the other argued that if rebellions broke out everywhere, there would be no need for defense. The animals listened to Napoleon and then to Snowball, but could not decide who was right; in fact, whoever was speaking at the moment seemed right to them, as they had no firm opinions of their own.",25.207,24.773,"While the windmill debates continued, there was also the issue of defending the farm. Despite having been defeated in the Battle of the Cowshed, it was now understood by all the animals that the humans might make a second, more determined attempt to recapture the farm and return it to Mr. Jones. The news of their defeat had spread to all the villages, causing the animals on neighboring farms to become even more rebellious; thus, the likelihood of the humans launching another attack had increased. Snowball and Napoleon, as with everything else, could not agree on this matter either. According to Napoleon, the animals needed to find firearms from somewhere and learn how to use them. Snowball, on the other hand, believed that they should send more pigeons to the other farms and incite the animals to rebel. One argued that if they couldn't defend themselves, they would inevitably be defeated in the end; the other said that if uprisings broke out everywhere, there would be no need to defend themselves. The animals listened to Napoleon and Snowball in turn, but they couldn't decide who was right. More precisely, they agreed with whoever was speaking at the time.",26.645,26.236,"Apart from the discussions regarding the windmill, there was the issue of the farm's defense. It was perfectly understood that although the humans had been defeated in the ""Battle of the Cowshed,"" they might make another attempt, more determined than the previous one, to reclaim the farm and restore Mr. Jones. They had even greater reasons to do so, as the news of the defeat spread around and had made the animals more discontented than ever. As usual, Snowball and Napoleon were in disagreement. According to Napoleon, what the animals should do was procure firearms and train themselves in their use. Snowball believed they should send more and more pigeons and incite rebellion among the animals on the other farms. One argued that if they couldn't defend themselves, they were destined to be conquered; the other argued that if there were rebellions everywhere, they wouldn't need to defend themselves. The animals listened first to Napoleon, then to Snowball, and couldn't decide who was right; to be honest, they always agreed with whoever was speaking to them at the moment.",43.501,43.235
133,"At last the day came when Snowball’s plans were completed. At the Meeting on the following Sunday the question of whether or not to begin work on the windmill was to be put to the vote. When the animals had assembled in the big barn, Snowball stood up and, though occasionally interrupted by bleating from the sheep, set forth his reasons for advocating the building of the windmill. Then Napoleon stood up to reply. He said very quietly that the windmill was nonsense and that he advised nobody to vote for it, and promptly sat down again; he had spoken for barely thirty seconds, and seemed almost indifferent as to the effect he produced. At this Snowball sprang to his feet, and shouting down the sheep, who had begun bleating again, broke into a passionate appeal in favour of the windmill. Until now the animals had been about equally divided in their sympathies, but in a moment Snowball’s eloquence had carried them away. In glowing sentences he painted a picture of Animal Farm as it might be when sordid labour was lifted from the animals’ backs. His imagination had now run far beyond chaff-cutters and turnip-slicers. Electricity, he said, could operate threshing machines, ploughs, harrows, rollers, and reapers and binders, besides supplying every stall with its own electric light, hot and cold water, and an electric heater. By the time he had finished speaking, there was no doubt as to which way the vote would go. But just at this moment Napoleon stood up and, casting a peculiar sidelong look at Snowball, uttered a high-pitched whimper of a kind no one had ever heard him utter before.","Finally, Snowball completed all the drawings for his project. In the meeting on Sunday, the issue of building the windmill was put to a vote. All the animals gathered in the large barn, Snowball spoke first and although he was occasionally interrupted by the sheep, he convincingly presented the benefits of the windmill. Then it was Napoleon's turn. He calmly declared that the windmill was nonsense and advised everyone not to support the project; he spoke for only about thirty seconds and then sat down calmly, seemingly indifferent to the effect he had on the audience. Snowball stood up on his hind legs and immediately delivered a passionate speech to persuade the others to vote for the construction of the windmill, speaking so loudly that he drowned out the sheep. Previously, the farm was divided into two equal factions, but this time Snowball had convinced the majority to support him. He spoke about the future of Animal Farm, a very bright future where manual labor would no longer weigh heavily on their backs. His imagination went beyond straw cutters and beet slicers. Electricity, he said, could power threshers, plows, harrows, rollers; it could also provide lighting, hot water, cold water, and heating for all the stalls. The result of the vote was clear even before Snowball finished his speech. But just at that moment, Napoleon stood up, glanced sharply at Snowball, and let out a high-pitched squeal like a whistle, a sound none of them had ever heard before.",16.65,16.237,"In the end, Snowball's plans came true. In the Meeting to be held next Sunday, the proposal to start the construction of the windmill would be put to a vote. When the animals gathered in the big barn, Snowball stood up and, despite his speech being interrupted by the bleating of the sheep, he listed the reasons why the windmill should be built. Then, Napoleon stood up to respond. In a very calm voice, he said that the windmill was nothing but nonsense, that he could not advise anyone to vote for the windmill, and immediately sat down. His speech had not even lasted half a minute; he seemed unaware of the impact of his words. Upon this, Snowball jumped up, silencing the sheep who had started bleating again, and delivered a passionate speech about the benefits of the windmill. Until that moment, the number of animals in favor of the windmill and those against it seemed roughly equal, but Snowball's eloquence quickly broke the tie. With brilliant words, Snowball painted a picture of an Animal Farm where the animals would be freed from working like slaves, and his imagination now extended far beyond chaff cutters and beet slicers. He said that threshing machines, plows, harrows, rollers, reapers, and binders would all be powered by electricity, and that every barn would have its own light, hot and cold water, and its own electric heater. When he finished his speech, there was no doubt left about where the votes would go. But just at that moment, Napoleon stood up, glanced sideways at Snowball, and let out a high-pitched scream that no one had ever heard before.",23.886,23.562,"Finally, the day arrived when Snowball completed his plans. At the next Sunday Meeting, it would be put to a vote whether or not to start building the windmill. When the animals were gathered in the main barn, Snowball stood up and, although he was occasionally interrupted by the sheep's bleating, he laid out his reasons for defending the construction of the windmill. Then Napoleon stood up to respond. He calmly said that the windmill was nonsense and that he advised no one to vote for it. And he sat down immediately; he had spoken for barely thirty seconds, and he seemed indifferent to the effect he had produced. Next, Snowball jumped to his feet, and shouting to be heard despite the sheep, who had started bleating again, he launched into a passionate argument in favor of the windmill. Until then, the animals were more or less equally divided in their sympathies, but in an instant, Snowball's eloquence had convinced them. With fiery phrases, he painted a picture of what ""Animal Farm"" could be like when the vile labor was lifted from the animals' backs. His imagination had gone far beyond threshers and reapers. ""Electricity,"" he said, ""could power the threshers, plows, harrows, rollers, reapers, and binders, as well as provide each stall with its own electric light, cold and hot water, and an electric heater."" When he finished speaking, there was no doubt about the outcome of the vote. But immediately Napoleon stood up and, casting a strange sidelong glance at Snowball, let out a high-pitched, shrill squeal that had never been heard from him before.",37.64,37.412
134,"At this there was a terrible baying sound outside, and nine enormous dogs wearing brass-studded collars came bounding into the barn. They dashed straight for Snowball, who only sprang from his place just in time to escape their snapping jaws. In a moment he was out of the door and they were after him. Too amazed and frightened to speak, all the animals crowded through the door to watch the chase. Snowball was racing across the long pasture that led to the road. He was running as only a pig can run, but the dogs were close on his heels. Suddenly he slipped and it seemed certain that they had him. Then he was up again, running faster than ever, then the dogs were gaining on him again. One of them all but closed his jaws on Snowball’s tail, but Snowball whisked it free just in time. Then he put on an extra spurt and, with a few inches to spare, slipped through a hole in the hedge and was seen no more.","There was a loud barking outside, then a pack of nine extremely large dogs with brass collars charged into the barn. They rushed straight at Snowball, but luckily he dodged their snapping jaws. Snowball hurriedly ran outside with the pack of dogs chasing after him. The remaining animals were extremely surprised and frightened, and they all rushed to the door to watch the chase. Snowball ran across the meadow towards the main road. He ran for his life while the pack of dogs kept right on his heels. Suddenly, he slipped, and it seemed like the dogs would catch him any moment. But he managed to get back up, this time running even faster with the dogs still in close pursuit. It seemed as if one of the dogs had caught Snowball's tail, but he managed to flick it to the side just in time. He sped up again, this time gaining some distance from the dogs, and then he squeezed through a hole in the fence. None of the dogs could see Snowball anymore.",19.954,19.38,"At that moment, terrifying barks were heard from outside, and soon nine large dogs with spiked collars burst in like a spear. They lunged straight at Snowball. If Snowball hadn't leaped out of the way just in time, he would have been devoured by the ferociously attacking dogs. He immediately threw himself outside, with the dogs in pursuit. The animals, struck dumb with astonishment and fear, crowded at the door and began to watch the chase. Snowball was running as fast as a pig could run, trying to cross the meadow and reach the main road. But the dogs were right on his heels. Suddenly, he slipped and fell; just when everyone thought he was surely caught, he got back up and started running even faster. The dogs were like a storm, they were about to catch their prey. One of them was just about to grab his tail, but Snowball pulled it away just in time. With the dogs nearly an inch away from him, he made one last effort and dashed forward, escaping through one of the holes in the fence. Snowball was never seen again.",16.257,15.679,"Immediately afterwards, terrible barking was heard coming from outside, and nine enormous dogs wearing collars studded with nails burst into the barn. And they went straight for Snowball, who jumped from his spot just in time to dodge their ferocious fangs. In an instant, he was on the other side of the door with the dogs after him. Too astonished and scared to say anything, all the animals crowded at the door to watch the chase. Snowball was running at full speed across the long meadow that led to the road. He ran as only a pig can, but the dogs were hot on his heels. Suddenly, he slipped and seemed to be easy prey for the dogs, but as soon as he regained his balance, he kept running faster than ever, though the hounds were gaining on him again. One of them was about to close its jaws on Snowball's tail, but he managed to dodge the bite just in time. And with a supreme effort, he managed to slip through a hole in the hedge, thus putting himself out of danger.",35.459,35.113
135,"Silent and terrified, the animals crept back into the barn. In a moment the dogs came bounding back. At first no one had been able to imagine where these creatures came from, but the problem was soon solved: they were the puppies whom Napoleon had taken away from their mothers and reared privately. Though not yet full-grown, they were huge dogs, and as fierce-looking as wolves. They kept close to Napoleon. It was noticed that they wagged their tails to him in the same way as the other dogs had been used to do to Mr. Jones.","Extremely frightened, the animals silently turned back to the barn. The hunting dogs also returned shortly after. At first, each one wondered: where did those dogs come from? But then it was no longer a secret: these dogs had been taken by Napoleon when they were young and raised separately. Though not fully grown, they looked big and fierce like wolves. They stood right next to Napoleon. They also wagged their tails at Napoleon just like the others used to do for Mr. Jones.",12.485,10.249,"The animals, silent and cowed, returned to the barn. Soon after, the dogs came running. At first, no one could understand where these monsters had come from, but the truth soon emerged. These were the pups that Napoleon had separated from their mothers and specially trained. Although they were not fully grown, they were quite large; they looked as wild as wolves. They never left Napoleon's side. Just as the other dogs had fawned over Mr. Jones, it did not escape anyone's notice that they wagged their tails at Napoleon.",22.143,21.119,"Silent and terrified, the animals stealthily returned to the barn. The dogs also returned, leaping about. At first, no one could imagine where those beasts had come from, but the problem was quickly clarified; they were the puppies that Napoleon had taken from their mothers and raised in seclusion. Although they were not yet fully grown, they were immense dogs, fierce as wolves. They never strayed far from Napoleon. And it was observed that they wagged their tails before him as the other dogs used to do with Mr. Jones.",31.044,30.246
136,"Napoleon, with the dogs following him, now mounted on to the raised portion of the floor where Major had previously stood to deliver his speech. He announced that from now on the Sunday-morning Meetings would come to an end. They were unnecessary, he said, and wasted time.

Even Boxer was vaguely troubled. He set his ears back, shook his forelock several times, and tried hard to marshal his thoughts; but in the end he could not think of anything to say. Some of the pigs themselves, however, were more articulate. Four young porkers in the front row uttered shrill squeals of disapproval, and all four of them sprang to their feet and began speaking at once. But suddenly the dogs sitting round Napoleon let out deep, menacing growls, and the pigs fell silent and sat down again.

The four porkers in the front row shouted in protest, then all four jumped up and spoke in unison.

Boxer, who had now had time to think things over, voiced the general feeling by saying: “If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right.” And from then on he adopted the maxim, “Napoleon is always right,” in addition to his private motto of “I will work harder.”","Its argument was indeed hard to refute. Surely, none of them wanted Mr. Jones to come back, and if the Sunday debates gave him an excuse to return, they would stop arguing.

On the contrary, it was he who had advocated it in the beginning, and the plan which Snowball had drawn on the floor of the incubator shed had actually been stolen from among Napoleon’s papers. The windmill was, in fact, Napoleon’s own creation. Why, then, asked somebody, had he spoken so strongly against it? Here Squealer looked very sly. That, he said, was Comrade Napoleon’s cunning. He had SEEMED to oppose the windmill, simply as a manoeuvre to get rid of Snowball, who was a dangerous character and a bad influence. Now that Snowball was out of the way, the plan could go forward without his interference. This, said Squealer, was something called tactics. He repeated a number of times, “Tactics, comrades, tactics!” skipping round and whisking his tail with a merry laugh. The animals were not certain what the word meant, but Squealer spoke so persuasively, and the three dogs who happened to be with him growled so threateningly, that they accepted his explanation without further questions.","In the afternoon, Squealer came to explain to each animal that actually Napoleon was not opposed to the construction of the windmill. On the contrary, from the very beginning, he had supported the project, and the drawings they saw in the incubator were stolen by Snowball from Napoleon. The windmill was Napoleon's own initiative. Then why - some animals asked - was Napoleon so adamantly against it before? Squealer appeared very cunning. That - he explained - was the cleverness of Comrade Napoleon. He only pretended to be against it to get rid of Snowball, a dangerous enemy who could lead them astray at any moment. Now, with Snowball gone, they could proceed without fearing any more disturbances from him. That is called tactics, Squealer said.

Comrade Napoleon appeared to be against the windmill to get rid of him."" According to Squealer, now that Snowball was out of the picture, the windmill project could be easily implemented.

There was a good quarry of limestone on the farm, and plenty of sand and cement had been found in one of the outhouses, so that all the materials for building were at hand.

There seemed no way of doing this except with picks and crowbars, which no animal could use, because no animal could stand on his hind legs. Only after weeks of vain effort did the right idea occur to somebody-namely, to utilise the force of gravity. Huge boulders, far too big to be used as they were, were lying all over the bed of the quarry. The animals lashed ropes round these, and then all together, cows, horses, sheep, any animal that could lay hold of the rope — even the pigs sometimes joined in at critical moments — they dragged them with desperate slowness up the slope to the top of the quarry, where they were toppled over the edge, to shatter to pieces below. Transporting the stone when it was once broken was comparatively simple. The horses carried it off in cart-loads, the sheep dragged single blocks, even Muriel and Benjamin yoked themselves into an old governess-cart and did their share. By late summer a sufficient store of stone had accumulated, and then the building began, under the superintendence of the pigs.","The construction of the windmill encountered quite a few troubles.

Sometimes Clover would warn him not to push himself too hard, but Boxer never listened to her.

And in many ways the animal method of doing things was more efficient and saved labour. Such jobs as weeding, for instance, could be done with a thoroughness impossible to human beings. And again, since no animal now stole, it was unnecessary to fence off pasture from arable land, which saved a lot of labour on the upkeep of hedges and gates. Nevertheless, as the summer wore on, various unforeseen shortages began to make them selves felt. There was need of paraffin oil, nails, string, dog biscuits, and iron for the horses’ shoes, none of which could be produced on the farm.

Moreover, the animals' methods were often efficient and quick. For example, they weeded faster and more neatly than humans. Now that no animal was stealing, there was no need to repair the fences and gates between the pasture and the cultivated area anymore. But from that summer, shortages began to occur, now this thing, now that thing. They needed oil, nails, ropes, dog biscuits, iron for horseshoes, things that Animal Farm could not produce.

From now onwards Animal Farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms: not, of course, for any commercial purpose, but simply in order to obtain certain materials which were urgently necessary. The needs of the windmill must override everything else, he said. He was therefore making arrangements to sell a stack of hay and part of the current year’s wheat crop, and later on, if more money were needed, it would have to be made up by the sale of eggs, for which there was always a market in Willingdon.

From now on, Animal Farm would engage in trade with neighboring farms. Undoubtedly, not for commercial purposes, but solely to acquire some urgently needed supplies. Napoleon said, ""The needs of the windmill must be prioritized above everything else."" Therefore, he was making arrangements to sell a large stack of hay and a portion of that year's wheat crop; later, if more money was needed, eggs, which always had a market in Willingdon, could also be sold. According to Napoleon, the hens should see this as their special contribution to the construction of the windmill and should not hesitate to make such a sacrifice.",30.116,29.555,"One Sunday morning, when the animals gathered to receive orders, Napoleon announced that he had decided to adopt a new system. Henceforth, ""Animal Farm"" would negotiate with the neighboring farms; and not, of course, for any commercial purpose, but simply to obtain certain materials that were urgently needed. ""The needs of the windmill are above everything else,"" he stated. Consequently, he was taking the necessary measures to sell a portion of the hay and another part of that year's wheat harvest, and later on, if they needed more money, they would have to obtain it by selling eggs, for which there was always a market in Willingdon. ""The hens,"" said Napoleon, ""should gladly accept this sacrifice as a special contribution to the construction of the windmill.""",40.291,39.857
153,"Once again the animals were conscious of a vague uneasiness. Never to have any dealings with human beings, never to engage in trade, never to make use of money — had not these been among the earliest resolutions passed at that first triumphant Meeting after Jones was expelled? All the animals remembered passing such resolutions: or at least they thought that they remembered it. The four young pigs who had protested when Napoleon abolished the Meetings raised their voices timidly, but they were promptly silenced by a tremendous growling from the dogs. Then, as usual, the sheep broke into “Four legs good, two legs bad!” and the momentary awkwardness was smoothed over. Finally Napoleon raised his trotter for silence and announced that he had already made all the arrangements. There would be no need for any of the animals to come in contact with human beings, which would clearly be most undesirable. He intended to take the whole burden upon his own shoulders. A Mr. Whymper, a solicitor living in Willingdon, had agreed to act as intermediary between Animal Farm and the outside world, and would visit the farm every Monday morning to receive his instructions. Napoleon ended his speech with his usual cry of “Long live Animal Farm!” and after the singing of ‘Beasts of England’ the animals were dismissed.","Once again, the animals felt anxious. No dealings with humans, no engaging in trade, no use of money - weren't these the resolutions passed at the first Meeting celebrating the victory after driving out Mr. Jones? All the animals remembered that they had passed those resolutions, or at least they thought they remembered. The four pigs who had stood up to protest when Napoleon announced the cancellation of the weekend Meetings were about to speak again, but they quickly shut their mouths because the dogs had started barking loudly. As always, the sheep began chanting ""Four legs good, two legs bad!"" and everything settled down. Finally, Napoleon raised his hoof to call for order and declared that he had resolved everything satisfactorily. No animal would have to deal with humans, as it was not a pleasant task. He would take full responsibility for that heavy task. A lawyer currently living in Willingdon named Whymper had agreed to act as an intermediary between Animal Farm and the neighboring farms; he would take up his duties on Monday mornings each week. As usual, Napoleon ended his speech by shouting the slogan ""Long live Animal Farm"" and after singing ""Beasts of England,"" the animals dispersed.",18.976,18.498,"The animals, once again, had become vaguely uneasy. Never do business with humans! Never engage in trade! Never use money! Weren't these the first decisions made at the Victory Meeting held after Jones was expelled from the farm? All the animals remembered these decisions being approved, or at least they thought they remembered. The four little pigs who had protested against Napoleon abolishing the meetings timidly raised their voices, but suddenly fell silent in the face of the dogs' terrifying growls. Immediately after, as usual, the sheep began to bleat ""Four legs good, two legs bad!"" and the tense atmosphere was diffused. Soon after, Napoleon raised his foreleg to silence everyone and announced that he had already arranged everything. Knowing that it would be extremely problematic for the farm animals to interact with humans, he had decided to create conditions where this would not be necessary. He would take all the responsibility himself. A lawyer named Mr. Whymper, who lived in Willingdon, had agreed to mediate in the dealings between Animal Farm and the outside world; he would come to the farm every Monday morning to receive instructions from Napoleon. After Napoleon, as always, concluded his speech with the cry ""Long live Animal Farm!"" the animals sang the Beasts of England song and dispersed.",26.279,25.914,"Once again the animals felt themselves gripped by a vague unease. “Never to have any dealings with humans, never to engage in trade, never to use money,” weren’t those the first resolutions adopted at that triumphant meeting, after Jones had been expelled?

154,"Afterwards Squealer made a round of the farm and set the animals’ minds at rest. He assured them that the resolution against engaging in trade and using money had never been passed, or even suggested. It was pure imagination, probably traceable in the beginning to lies circulated by Snowball. A few animals still felt faintly doubtful, but Squealer asked them shrewdly, “Are you certain that this is not something that you have dreamed, comrades? Have you any record of such a resolution? Is it written down anywhere?” And since it was certainly true that nothing of the kind existed in writing, the animals were satisfied that they had been mistaken.","After that, Chỉ Điểm went around the camp to conduct ideological work. He assured that the decision not to trade and not to use money had never been put to a vote, let alone passed. That was just a fabrication, and if traced back to the beginning, it might have been made up by Tuyết Tròn. But some still did not believe, so Chỉ Điểm asked: ""Comrade, are you sure you didn't imagine it? Do you have any documents confirming that? Where is that decision recorded?"". Surely those decisions were not recorded anywhere, so in the end, the animals believed they were mistaken.",7.767,6.102,"Before long, Squealer set about touring the farm to dispel the doubts that had arisen in the animals' minds. With a convincing tone, he explained that no decision had ever been made regarding not engaging in trade or using money, and furthermore, that such a proposal had never even been suggested. All of this was most likely a figment of the imagination, stemming from the lies Snowball had spread in the early days. Noticing that some still harbored doubts, Squealer cunningly asked, ""Could this be something you dreamed, comrades? Is there any document of such a decision? Is it written down anywhere?"" Indeed, since there was no such written document to be found, the animals were forced to admit they were mistaken.",14.39,13.483,"Then Squealer went around the farm and reassured them.

155,"Every Monday Mr. Whymper visited the farm as had been arranged. He was a sly-looking little man with side whiskers, a solicitor in a very small way of business, but sharp enough to have realised earlier than anyone else that Animal Farm would need a broker and that the commissions would be worth having. The animals watched his coming and going with a kind of dread, and avoided him as much as possible. Nevertheless, the sight of Napoleon, on all fours, delivering orders to Whymper, who stood on two legs, roused their pride and partly reconciled them to the new arrangement. Their relations with the human race were now not quite the same as they had been before. The human beings did not hate Animal Farm any less now that it was prospering; indeed, they hated it more than ever. Every human being held it as an article of faith that the farm would go bankrupt sooner or later, and, above all, that the windmill would be a failure. They would meet in the public-houses and prove to one another by means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it did stand up, then that it would never work. And yet, against their will, they had developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which the animals were managing their own affairs. One symptom of this was that they had begun to call Animal Farm by its proper name and ceased to pretend that it was called the Manor Farm. They had also dropped their championship of Jones, who had given up hope of getting his farm back and gone to live in another part of the county. Except through Whymper, there was as yet no contact between Animal Farm and the outside world, but there were constant rumours that Napoleon was about to enter into a definite business agreement either with Mr. Pilkington of Foxwood or with Mr. Frederick of Pinchfield — but never, it was noticed, with both simultaneously.","Every Monday, Mr. Whymper came to the farm. He was a small-statured lawyer with long sideburns, just starting out in business, but quite shrewd, immediately recognizing that Animal Farm would definitely need a broker and that the commission would naturally be ""substantial."" The animals were afraid of Whymper and tried to avoid him as much as possible. Nevertheless, the fact that Napoleon, standing on four legs, gave orders to Whymper, who stood on two legs, instilled in them a legitimate sense of pride and somewhat mitigated their reaction to the new policy. Their relationship with humans was no longer the same as before. The humans' hatred for Animal Farm not only did not decrease but actually increased as it became more prosperous. Everyone believed that sooner or later the farm would go bankrupt, and the windmill was sure to fail. They often gathered in pubs and drew diagrams to prove that the windmill would definitely collapse, and even if it didn't, it would never work. But despite their dislike, they had to respect the animals because they managed the farm quite efficiently. The proof was that they had started calling it Animal Farm and had stopped pretending it was still named Manor Farm. They also no longer supported Mr. Jones, who had lost all hope of reclaiming the farm and had gone to work elsewhere. Although currently all relations between Animal Farm and the outside world were conducted through Whymper, there were rumors that Napoleon was about to sign a trade agreement either with Pilkington's Foxwood Farm or Frederick's Pinchfield Farm, but people also said that there would be no deal with both farms at the same time.",21.436,21.185,"Mr. Whymper, as previously arranged, visited the farm every Monday. Mr. Whymper, a lawyer who dealt with trivial matters, was a small man with sideburns and a mischievous look. But he was shrewd enough to realize long before that Animal Farm would eventually need a broker, and that this broker's share would not be insignificant. The animals watched his comings and goings with trepidation, avoiding encounters with him as much as possible. Nevertheless, seeing the four-legged Napoleon giving orders to the two-legged Whymper stroked their pride and helped them somewhat accept this new situation. Their relations with the human race were no longer quite the same. The humans' hatred for Animal Farm had not diminished; on the contrary, they hated it more than ever as they saw the farm prospering. They all wholeheartedly believed that the farm would eventually go bankrupt and, more importantly, that the windmill project would end in complete failure. They gathered in taverns, trying to prove to each other with drawings that the windmill could never be built, and even if it were, it would never work. On the other hand, they reluctantly admired the animals' skillful management of their own affairs. The fact that they had stopped insisting that the farm's real name was Manor Farm and had started using the name Animal Farm was an indication of this. They had also ceased defending Jones, who had lost hope of reclaiming his farm and had moved to another part of the country. There was no connection between Animal Farm and the outside world except for Whymper, but there were constant rumors that Napoleon was about to make a concrete business deal either with Mr. Pilkington of Foxwood Farm or Mr. Frederick of Pinchfield Farm, though it was said he would never make a deal with both at the same time.",24.784,24.536,"Every Monday, Mr. Whymper visited the farm, as had been agreed.

The animals watched his comings and goings with some fear, and avoided him as much as possible. However, the sight of Napoleon, on his four legs, giving orders to Whymper, who stood on his two feet, stirred their pride and partially reconciled them to the new situation.

156,"It was about this time that the pigs suddenly moved into the farmhouse and took up their residence there. Again the animals seemed to remember that a resolution against this had been passed in the early days, and again Squealer was able to convince them that this was not the case.

It was also more suited to the dignity of the Leader (for of late he had taken to speaking of Napoleon under the title of “Leader”) to live in a house than in a mere sty.

In addition, Napoleon ordered the almost empty bins in the store-shed to be filled nearly to the brim with sand, which was then covered up with what remained of the grain and meal.

Snowball was secretly frequenting the farm at night! The animals were so disturbed that they could barely sleep in their stables. Every night, it was said, he would sneak in under the cover of darkness and cause all sorts of damage. He would steal the corn, overturn the milk pails, break the eggs, trample the seedlings, gnaw the bark of the fruit trees. Whenever something went wrong, it became customary to always attribute it to Snowball. If a window was broken or a drain was clogged, it was a sure thing that someone would say Snowball had done it during the night, and when the key to the food shed was lost, the entire farm was convinced that Snowball had thrown it down the well. Curiously enough, they continued to believe this even after the lost key was found under a sack of flour. The cows unanimously declared that Snowball had slipped into their stalls and milked them while they slept. It was also said that the mice, which had been quite troublesome that winter, were in league with Snowball.",46.552,46.287

He snuffed in every corner, in the barn, in the cow-shed, in the henhouses, in the vegetable garden, and found traces of Snowball almost everywhere. He would put his snout to the ground, give several deep sniffs, ad exclaim in a terrible voice, “Snowball! He has been here!

He left no corner of the barn, the cow shed, the henhouses, or the vegetable garden unsniffed and found traces of Snowball almost everywhere.

Two other sheep confessed that they had chased and killed an old ram, known for his loyalty to Napoleon, around the fire while he was having a coughing fit. They were all slaughtered on the spot. The confessions and executions continued in this manner. In the end, they found themselves surrounded by corpses at Napoleon's feet. The smell of blood filled the air. Such a smell had not been sensed on the farm since the day Jones was expelled.",19.142,18.509,"The three hens, who were the ringleaders of the attempted rebellion over the eggs, stepped forward and declared that Snowball had appeared to them in dreams, urging them to disobey Napoleon's orders. They too were slaughtered. Then a goose stepped forward and confessed that it had hidden six ears of corn during the previous year's harvest and had eaten them at night. Then a sheep admitted that it had urinated in the drinking pool, instigated to do so, it said, by Snowball, and two other sheep confessed that they had murdered an old ram, very loyal to Napoleon, by chasing him around a bonfire when he was coughing. All of them were executed on the spot. And so the series of confessions and executions continued until a pile of corpses lay at Napoleon's feet and the air was heavy with the smell of blood, a smell that had been unknown since Jones's expulsion.",40.862,40.516
196,"When it was all over, the remaining animals, except for the pigs and dogs, crept away in a body. They were shaken and miserable. They did not know which was more shocking — the treachery of the animals who had leagued themselves with Snowball, or the cruel retribution they had just witnessed. In the old days there had often been scenes of bloodshed equally terrible, but it seemed to all of them that it was far worse now that it was happening among themselves. Since Jones had left the farm, until today, no animal had killed another animal. Not even a rat had been killed. They had made their way on to the little knoll where the half-finished windmill stood, and with one accord they all lay down as though huddling together for warmth — Clover, Muriel, Benjamin, the cows, the sheep, and a whole flock of geese and hens — everyone, indeed, except the cat, who had suddenly disappeared just before Napoleon ordered the animals to assemble. For some time nobody spoke. Only Boxer remained on his feet. He fidgeted to and fro, swishing his long black tail against his sides and occasionally uttering a little whinny of surprise. Finally he said:","The remaining animals after the execution, of course excluding the dogs and pigs, gathered into a group and quietly crawled out of the yard. They looked so small and miserable. They couldn't understand whether the betrayal of those associated with Snowball or the brutal punishment they had just witnessed was more shocking. In the past, they had witnessed equally barbaric massacres, but this time it was clearly more terrifying because it was them killing each other. Since old Jones left, no animal had been killed. Not even a rat had been killed. They went up the hill and lay close together for warmth next to the half-built windmill: Fatty lay next to Mona, Benjamin, then the cows, sheep, chickens, and geese, with only the cat missing, as it had slipped away just before Napoleon summoned them. They lay silently. Only Boxer remained standing. He kept pacing back and forth, his tail continuously hitting his sides, occasionally neighing softly with anxiety. Finally, he said:",16.032,15.517,"After everything was over, all the animals except the pigs and dogs huddled together and moved away from there. They had tucked their tails in and were trembling with fear. They couldn't decide which was more terrifying: the betrayal of the animals who had sided with Snowball, or the ruthless reprisals they had just witnessed? They had witnessed such bloody massacres before, but at least they weren't slaughtering each other. Since Jones was expelled, it had never been seen that one animal killed another. Not even a rat had been killed. When they reached the small hill where the half-completed windmill stood, they lay down close to each other as if trying to warm up. Clover, Muriel, Benjamin, the cows, the sheep, the geese, the chickens, everyone was there. Only the cat, who had suddenly disappeared just before Napoleon ordered all the animals to gather, was not among them. For a while, no one spoke. Only Boxer was standing.

199,"The animals huddled about Clover, not speaking. The knoll where they were lying gave them a wide prospect across the countryside. Most of Animal Farm was within their view — the long pasture stretching down to the main road, the hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the ploughed fields where the young wheat was thick and green, and the red roofs of the farm buildings with the smoke curling from the chimneys. It was a clear spring evening. The grass and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays of the sun. Never had the farm — and with a kind of surprise they remembered that it was their own farm, every inch of it their own property — appeared to the animals so desirable a place. As Clover looked down the hillside her eyes filled with tears. If she could have spoken her thoughts, it would have been to say that this was not what they had aimed at when they had set themselves years ago to work for the overthrow of the human race. These scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had looked forward to on that night when old Major first stirred them to rebellion. If she herself had had any picture of the future, it had been of a society of animals set free from hunger and the whip, all equal, each working according to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak, as she had protected the lost brood of ducklings with her foreleg on the night of Major’s speech. Instead — she did not know why — they had come to a time when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes. There was no thought of rebellion or disobedience in her mind. She knew that, even as things were, they were far better off than they had been in the days of Jones, and that before all else it was needful to prevent the return of the human beings. Whatever happened she would remain faithful, work hard, carry out the orders that were given to her, and accept the leadership of Napoleon. But still, it was not for this that she and all the other animals had hoped and toiled. It was not for this that they had built the windmill and faced the bullets of Jones’s gun. Such were her thoughts, though she lacked the words to express them.","The group of animals huddled around Mrs. Fat but none of them spoke up. From the top of the hill, they could see the entire area. They could see almost the entire Animal Farm - the grazing fields stretching to the main road, the grass fields, the forest, the water basin, the cultivated fields with green wheat growing, and the tiled roofs of the farmhouses with winding trails of smoke. It was a spring afternoon, the sky clear and cloudless. The twilight cast a golden hue on the grass and the distant hedges. They were surprised to remember that this farm was theirs, every inch of land here was their property, every inch was so precious. Mrs. Fat looked into the distance, her eyes filled with tears. If she could express all her thoughts, she would surely say that this was not what they intended when they decided to overthrow human rule. On the night the old Leader called for their uprising, they could not have imagined the terror and mass killings of today. If she had thought about the future then, it would have been a society where animals were no longer hungry, no longer beaten, all were equal, all worked according to their ability, the strong protected the weak, just as she had protected the orphaned ducklings on the night the old Leader spoke. Yet, she could not understand why now no one dared to speak their true thoughts anymore, the fierce hunting dogs roamed everywhere, and all had to witness the killing of comrades after they confessed to heinous crimes. But in her mind, there was no thought of disobedience or rebellion. After all, they were still better off than under old Jones, and the main thing was to prevent humans from returning. No matter what, she remained loyal to the cause, continued to work tirelessly, completed all tasks, and followed the path that Napoleon had chosen. But was this really what they had longed for, what they had worked so hard to create? No, they built the windmill for a completely different purpose, the life-and-death struggle with old Jones was also to create a society completely different from what they had received today. These were the thoughts that flashed through Mrs. Fat's mind, but she could not put them into words.",16.882,16.616,"The animals had gathered around Clover, and no one could utter a word. From the hill they were on, they could see the fields stretching out all around. A large part of Animal Farm was within their view: the pasture extending to the main road, the mown and dried hay, the grove, the trough, the lush, green crops beginning to sprout in the plowed fields, the red roofs of the farm buildings, and the smoking chimneys... It was a bright spring evening. The grass and the leaf-budding hedges illuminated by the sun's rays were sparkling. The farm had never looked so beautiful to their eyes. Suddenly, they remembered that this was their own farm; every inch of this land was theirs. As Clover looked down from the hill, her eyes filled with tears. If she could express her thoughts, she would say that when they set out years ago to overthrow the human race, this was never their goal. Could the violence and slaughter they now witnessed be what they had envisioned on the night Old Major first called for the Rebellion? In the future she had imagined, there was a society where animals were free from hunger and the whip, where everyone was equal, everyone worked according to their ability, and the strong protected the weak just as Old Major had embraced the lost ducklings on the night he spoke. However, for some unknown reason, a society had emerged where no one dared to express their thoughts, wild, savage dogs roamed everywhere growling, and they were forced to watch their comrades being torn apart after confessing to horrific crimes. But thoughts of rebelling or rising up did not cross her mind. She knew that even their current situation was much better than it had been in Jones's time and that above all, it was necessary to prevent the humans from returning to the farm. No matter what, she would remain loyal to the administration, follow the orders given to her to the letter, and accept Napoleon's leadership. But still, this should not have been the result of so much hope and effort. Should this be the reward for building the windmill with such difficulty and braving the pellets from Jones's gun? She thought this way, but she could not put her thoughts into words and express them.",21.399,21.157,"The animals huddled around Clover, without speaking.

He ate alone, with two dogs to serve him, and always used the tableware that had been in the glass cabinet in the living room. It was also announced that the shotgun would be fired every year on Napoleon's birthday, just like on the other two anniversaries.",46.747,46.389
214,"Napoleon was now never spoken of simply as “Napoleon.” He was always referred to in formal style as “our Leader, Comrade Napoleon,” and this pigs liked to invent for him such titles as Father of All Animals, Terror of Mankind, Protector of the Sheep-fold, Ducklings’ Friend, and the like. In his speeches, Squealer would talk with the tears rolling down his cheeks of Napoleon’s wisdom the goodness of his heart, and the deep love he bore to all animals everywhere, even and especially the unhappy animals who still lived in ignorance and slavery on other farms. It had become usual to give Napoleon the credit for every successful achievement and every stroke of good fortune. You would often hear one hen remark to another, “Under the guidance of our Leader, Comrade Napoleon, I have laid five eggs in six days”; or two cows, enjoying a drink at the pool, would exclaim, “Thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon, how excellent this water tastes!” The general feeling on the farm was well expressed in a poem entitled Comrade Napoleon, which was composed by Minimus and which ran as follows:","Now they no longer address Napoleon as simply as before. His name always comes with titles like ""Our Leader, Comrade Napoleon,"" and the pigs even try to invent new titles such as: Father of All Animals, Terror of Mankind, Protector of the Sheep, Friend of the Ducks, etc. Whenever they speak of Napoleon's wisdom, kindness, and love as deep as the ocean for the animals, especially those still living in the dark bondage of other farms, Snowball's tears would wet his cheeks. All achievements were attributed to Napoleon. You could hear two hens confiding: ""Under the leadership of Comrade Napoleon, our Leader, I have laid five eggs in the past six days""; or two cows drinking water saying: ""Thanks to Comrade Napoleon's wise leadership, the water tastes so sweet these days!"" The general sentiment of the farm was expressed in a poem titled: ""Comrade Napoleon"" composed by Minimus: Comrade Napoleon!",20.507,20.081,"No one could simply refer to Napoleon as ""Napoleon"" anymore; it was required to formally address him as ""Our Leader Comrade Napoleon."" The pigs were competing with each other to come up with titles for him such as Father of All Animals, Terror of Humans, Protector Angel of the Sheep, and Dear Friend of the Ducklings. Squealer, with tears streaming from his eyes during his speeches, spoke of how wise and kind-hearted an animal Napoleon was, and how deeply he loved all the animals on earth, especially the unhappy animals still living like slaves in the darkness of ignorance on other farms. It had become a habit to attribute every success and every joyous event to Napoleon. It was even heard that a hen said to another hen, ""If it weren't for Our Leader Comrade Napoleon, I wouldn't have been able to lay five eggs in six days,"" and that two cows drinking water from the lake shouted, ""Would the lake's water be this sweet without Comrade Napoleon's leadership?""

In his speeches, Squealer spoke with tears in his eyes about Napoleon's wisdom, the kindness of his heart, and the deep love he felt for all animals everywhere, and especially for the unfortunate beasts that still lived in ignorance and slavery on other farms. It had become customary to attribute every successful feat and stroke of luck to Napoleon. It was often heard that one hen would say to another: ""Under the leadership of our Leader, comrade Napoleon, I have laid five eggs in six days,"" or two cows, while savoring the water from the trough, would exclaim: ""Thanks to our Leader, comrade Napoleon, how delicious this water tastes!""

Of the two, Frederick was the more anxious to get hold of it, but he would not offer a reasonable price. At the same time there were renewed rumours that Frederick and his men were plotting to attack Animal Farm and to destroy the windmill, the building of which had aroused furious jealousy in him. Snowball was known to be still skulking on Pinchfield Farm. In the middle of the summer the animals were alarmed to hear that three hens had come forward and confessed that, inspired by Snowball, they had entered into a plot to murder Napoleon. They were executed immediately, and fresh precautions for Napoleon’s safety were taken.

At the same time, there were rumors that Frederick and his men were plotting to attack Animal Farm to destroy the windmill because he hated this place bitterly. It was said that Snowball was still hiding at Pinchfield Farm. By mid-summer, the animals were once again thrown into a panic when they heard rumors that three hens had confessed to being incited by Snowball to plot Napoleon's assassination. They were executed immediately, and stricter security measures for Napoleon were implemented. From now on, at night, four dogs would guard each corner of Napoleon's bed, and to avoid being poisoned, a dog named Pinkeye was assigned to taste all his food before Napoleon ate it.",29.172,28.738,"Meanwhile, Napoleon had entered into complicated relations with Frederick and Pilkington through Whymper.

The relations between Napoleon and Pilkington, though they were only conducted through Whymper, were now almost friendly. The animals distrusted Pilkington, as a human being, but greatly preferred him to Frederick, whom they both feared and hated. As the summer wore on, and the windmill neared completion, the rumours of an impending treacherous attack grew stronger and stronger. Frederick, it was said, intended to bring against them twenty men all armed with guns, and he had already bribed the magistrates and police, so that if he could once get hold of the title-deeds of Animal Farm they would ask no questions. Moreover, terrible stories were leaking out from Pinchfield about the cruelties that Frederick practised upon his animals. He had flogged an old horse to death, he starved his cows, he had killed a dog by throwing it into the furnace, he amused himself in the evenings by making cocks fight with splinters of razor-blade tied to their spurs. The animals’ blood boiled with rage when they heard of these things beingdone to their comrades, and sometimes they clamoured to be allowed to go out in a body and attack Pinchfield Farm, drive out the humans, and set the animals free. But Squealer counselled them to avoid rash actions and trust in Comrade Napoleon’s strategy.","Around that time, there was news that Napoleon had decided to sell timber to Pilkington; moreover, it was planned to establish regular product exchanges between Animal Farm and Foxwood Farm. The relationship between Napoleon and Pilkington, even though it was only through the intermediary Whymper, had become quite friendly. Pilkington, like everyone else, was never trusted by the animals, but they still preferred him over Frederick, whom they both hated and feared. As the end of summer approached, when the windmill was nearly completed, rumors of a treacherous attack increased. Some said that Frederick planned to attack with an army of twenty men fully armed and had bribed the government as well as the police to act freely. Additionally, news of his cruel deeds towards the animals at Pinchfield Farm was revealed. He beat an old horse to death, starved the cows, threw a dog into the furnace, and every evening he incited the roosters to fight each other, not just any fight, but he also tied razor blades to their spurs for extra thrill. When they heard that their comrades were being treated so barbarically, every animal's blood boiled with anger, and sometimes they shouted for an attack on Pinchfield Farm to drive out the humans and reclaim freedom for the animals there. But Squealer advised them to avoid hasty actions and to trust in Comrade Napoleon's strategic plan.",16.242,15.772,"In the same days, it was announced that Napoleon had decided to sell the timber to Mr. Pilkington; furthermore, a suitable agreement was to be made regarding the exchange of some products between Animal Farm and Foxwood Farm.

As summer progressed and the construction of the windmill neared completion, rumors of an imminent and relentless attack on the farm increased. According to what was said, Frederick had gathered twenty armed men and had already bribed judges and police so that they would not question him when he seized the deeds of Animal Farm. Moreover, from Pinchfield Farm, chilling information about how cruelly Frederick treated his animals was leaking out. If true, he had whipped an old horse to death, starved the cows for days, thrown one of the dogs into the furnace; in the evenings, he took pleasure in making roosters fight with sharp razors attached to their spurs. As the animals heard about what was done to their comrades, they were furious with rage, and from time to time, they asked for permission to attack Pinchfield Farm together and drive out the humans to set the animals free. Squealer, however, said that if they acted in anger, they would suffer losses, and advised them to trust in Comrade Napoleon's knowledge and experience.",26.64,26.303,"More or less around that time, it was disclosed that Napoleon had agreed to sell the pile of wood to Mr. Pilkington; a formal agreement was also to be celebrated for the exchange of certain products between ""Animal Farm"" and Foxwood.

Frederick, it was said, intended to bring against them twenty men, all armed with shotguns, and had already bribed the magistrates and the police so that, in the event he could obtain the property titles of ""Animal Farm,"" they would not investigate. Moreover, some terrible stories were leaking from Pinchfield regarding the cruelties Frederick inflicted on the animals. He had whipped a horse to death; starved his cows, killed a dog by throwing it into an oven, and entertained himself at night with cockfights, tying pieces of razor blades to the spurs.

239,"Nevertheless, feeling against Frederick continued to run high. One Sunday morning Napoleon appeared in the barn and explained that he had never at any time contemplated selling the pile of timber to Frederick; he considered it beneath his dignity, he said, to have dealings with scoundrels of that description. The pigeons who were still sent out to spread tidings of the Rebellion were forbidden to set foot anywhere on Foxwood, and were also ordered to drop their former slogan of “Death to Humanity” in favour of “Death to Frederick.” In the late summer yet another of Snowball’s machinations was laid bare. The wheat crop was full of weeds, and it was discovered that on one of his nocturnal visits Snowball had mixed weed seeds with the seed corn. A gander who had been privy to the plot had confessed his guilt to Squealer and immediately committed suicide by swallowing deadly nightshade berries. The animals now also learned that Snowball had never — as many of them had believed hitherto — received the order of “Animal Hero, First Class.” This was merely a legend which had been spread some time after the Battle of the Cowshed by Snowball himself. So far from being decorated, he had been censured for showing cowardice in the battle. Once again some of the animals heard this with a certain bewilderment, but Squealer was soon able to convince them that their memories had been at fault.","The hatred towards Frederick increased day by day. One day, on a Sunday, Napoleon appeared in the warehouse to explain to the animals that he had never thought of selling the wood to Frederick, saying that such types were not worthy of his dealings. The pigeons, which were still being sent to call on animals in other farms to rise up in rebellion, were forbidden from approaching Foxwood Farm, and the slogan ""Death to Humanity!"" was replaced with ""Death to Frederick!"". By the end of summer, another crime of Snowball was discovered. This time it was the wheat field full of weeds - after investigation, it was discovered that Snowball had sneaked into the farm at night and mixed weed seeds with the wheat seeds. A male goose, an accomplice in this affair, confessed his guilt to Squealer and then immediately swallowed a poisonous nightshade berry to commit suicide. The animals were also informed that, contrary to what many believed, Snowball had never been awarded the title of Animal Hero, First Class. That story was fabricated by Snowball himself right after the Battle of the Cowshed. Not only was he not rewarded, but he was also heavily criticized for showing cowardice during the battle. As always, this news confused some of the animals, but Squealer quickly convinced them that it was simply due to their poor memory.",17.865,17.4,"However, the hatred for Frederick was growing day by day. One Sunday morning, Napoleon came to the barn and declared that he had never even considered selling the timber to Frederick, as he could not bear the dishonor of dealing with such a vile creature. The pigeons, which were still being sent to neighboring farms to spread the idea of rebellion, were instructed not to set foot on Foxwood Farm, and they were ordered to abandon the slogan ""Death to Humanity"" and instead use the slogan ""Death to Frederick."" Towards the end of summer, another one of Snowball's schemes was uncovered. No one could solve the mystery of the weeds that had been plaguing the crops for some time; finally, it was discovered that Snowball had secretly entered the farm one night and mixed weed seeds with the wheat seeds. A male goose, who had been an accomplice to Snowball, confessed his crime to Squealer and then committed suicide by swallowing poisonous yew berries. Meanwhile, the animals learned that, contrary to what many had known until that day, Snowball had never received the ""Animal Hero, First Class"" medal. Snowball had fabricated this story himself some time after the Battle of the Cowshed. Far from being rewarded with a medal, he had been condemned for showing cowardice in the battle.

240,"In the autumn, by a tremendous, exhausting effort — for the harvest had to be gathered at almost the same time — the windmill was finished. The machinery had still to be installed, and Whymper was negotiating the purchase of it, but the structure was completed. In the teeth of every difficulty, in spite of inexperience, of primitive implements, of bad luck and of Snowball’s treachery, the work had been finished punctually to the very day! Tired out but proud, the animals walked round and round their masterpiece, which appeared even more beautiful in their eyes than when it had been built the first time.

Napoleon himself, attended by his dogs and his cockerel, came down to inspect the completed work; he personally congratulated the animals on their achievement, and announced that the mill would be named Napoleon Mill.","The windmill was completed in the fall, right at the time of the harvest, and they had to work until they were exhausted. Although the equipment still needed to be installed, which Whymper was negotiating to purchase, the main thing was that the workshop was already built. Despite numerous difficulties, lack of technology and experience, and even sabotage by Snowball, they still managed to complete the construction on the scheduled date! Even though they were very tired, the animals still tried to walk around the windmill many times, full of pride, and at this moment, it looked even more beautiful than the first time it was built. Not to mention, the walls this time were twice as thick as before. Now, it would be impossible to destroy it without explosives! And when they thought about the amount of work done, the difficulties overcome, the changes that would come when the windmill blades started to turn, when the generator started running; when they thought about those things, all their fatigue disappeared, and they ran around the windmill together, shouting loudly. Even Napoleon, escorted by a few dogs and a rooster, came to see it, congratulated everyone on the completion of the project, and declared that the project would be named the Napoleon Mill.",13.658,13.021,"The windmill was completed in the autumn; but since the harvest also needed to be gathered around the same time, they were exhausted from fatigue.

When they thought about how much effort they had put in, how many disappointments they had overcome, and how different their lives would be once the gears turned and the dynamos worked, their fatigue melted away; they began to hop and skip around the windmill, shouting victory cries. Shortly after, Napoleon arrived with his dogs and rooster, inspected the windmill, congratulated the animals on their success, and announced that the windmill would henceforth be known as Napoleon Mill.",17.122,16.581,"In the autumn, through a tremendous and exhausting effort—because the harvest had to be done almost simultaneously—the windmill was completed.

All these rumours had probably originated with Snowball and his agents.

At the same time, Napoleon assured the animals that the rumors about the attack on Animal Farm were completely unfounded, and that the reports of Frederick's mistreatment of livestock had been greatly exaggerated. It was likely that Snowball and his agents had spread these rumors. It turned out that Snowball not only was not hiding in Pinchfield Farm but had never been there at all; in fact, he was living quite comfortably, according to reports, in Foxwood Farm: he had sold himself to Pilkington long ago.",27.863,27.266,"All relations with Foxwood Farm had been cut off, and denunciatory messages were sent to Pilkington.

But the superior quality of Napoleon’s mind, said Squealer, was shown in the fact that he trusted nobody, not even Frederick. Frederick had wanted to pay for the timber with something called a cheque, which, it seemed, was a piece of paper with a promise to pay written upon it. But Napoleon was too clever for him. He had demanded payment in real five-pound notes, which were to be handed over before the timber was removed.

Frederick had tried to pay for the timber with a check that was nothing more than a piece of paper promising payment; but Napoleon had outsmarted him, insisting that the payment be made in five-pound banknotes before the timber was moved.

There were fifteen men, with half a dozen guns between them, and they opened fire as soon as they got within fifty yards. The animals could not face the terrible explosions and the stinging pellets, and in spite of the efforts of Napoleon and Boxer to rally them, they were soon driven back.

There were wounded. They had taken refuge in the farm buildings, watching the outside through cracks and knot holes. The large pasture and the windmill had fallen into enemy hands. Even Napoleon was stunned, unsure of what to do. He was silent, pacing the room rapidly with his tail held high. All eyes were on the road to Foxwood Farm.

A mighty cry for vengeance went up, and without waiting for further orders they charged forth in a body and made straight for the enemy. This time they did not heed the cruel pellets that swept over them like hail. It was a savage, bitter battle. The men fired again and again, and, when the animals got to close quarters, lashed out with their sticks and their heavy boots. A cow, three sheep, and two geese were killed, and nearly everyone was wounded. Even Napoleon, who was directing operations from the rear, had the tip of his tail chipped by a pellet. But the men did not go unscathed either.

A too rigid equality in rations, Squealer explained, would have been contrary to the principles of Animalism. In any case he had no difficulty in proving to the other animals that they were NOT in reality short of food, whatever the appearances might be. For the time being, certainly, it had been found necessary to make a readjustment of rations (Squealer always spoke of it as a “readjustment,” never as a “reduction”), but in comparison with the days of Jones, the improvement was enormous. Reading out the figures in a shrill, rapid voice, he proved to them in detail that they had more oats, more hay, more turnips than they had had in Jones’s day, that they worked shorter hours, that their drinking water was of better quality, that they lived longer, that a larger proportion of their young ones survived infancy, and that they had more straw in their stalls and suffered less from fleas. The animals believed every word of it. Truth to tell, Jones and all he stood for had almost faded out of their memories. They knew that life nowadays was harsh and bare, that they were often hungry and often cold, and that they were usually working when they were not asleep. But doubtless it had been worse in the old days. They were glad to believe so. Besides, in those days they had been slaves and now they were free, and that made all the difference, as Squealer did not fail to point out.","Currently, their lives must be said to be quite difficult. This winter is as cold as last year, but food is even scarcer. Rations, except for dogs and pigs, have all been reduced. Absolute equality, Squealer explained, is contrary to the principles of Animalism. He easily proved to the others that they actually had enough food, and that the food shortage was merely an illusion. Of course, certain adjustments were necessary at this time (Squealer said ""adjustments"" rather than ""reductions""), but compared to the days of old Jones, the improvement was clear. In a rapid, shrill voice, he presented very specific figures, proving that they harvested more oats, more hay, more turnips than in Jones's time, the work was lighter, the water quality was better, they lived longer, the infant survival rate was higher, they had more straw for bedding, and fewer lice. All the animals believed this. In fact, they had almost forgotten all about the days of Mr. Jones. They only knew that life now was very hard, arduous, they were often hungry, cold, and as soon as they opened their eyes, they had to work. It must have been even harder before.

Squealer was very good at soothing hearts. Undoubtedly, for now, they had to readjust the rations (Squealer never used the word ""cut,"" preferring to say ""readjustment""), but compared to Jones's era, there was still a significant improvement. Reading the numbers in a high-pitched voice and quickly, he demonstrated that compared to Jones's era, they ate more oats, more hay, and more turnips, worked fewer hours, had better quality drinking water, lived longer, saw a significant reduction in the number of dead offspring, had more straw in the barns, and were less infested with fleas. The animals believed whatever he said. To be honest, what happened during Jones's time had almost entirely faded from their memories. They knew that nowadays they lived a poor and harsh life, often going hungry and freezing from the cold, spending every minute working except for sleeping. But they believed that the old days were even worse and took solace in that.

For the time being, the young pigs were given their instruction by Napoleon himself in the farmhouse kitchen. They took their exercise in the garden, and were discouraged from playing with the other young animals.

The young pigs were spotted, and since Napoleon was the only boar on the farm, it was not difficult to guess their paternal origin. It was announced that later on, when bricks and wood were purchased, a school would be built in the garden. Meanwhile, the piglets were educated by Napoleon himself in the house's kitchen. They did their exercises in the garden, and were discouraged from playing with the other young animals. At that time, the rule was also established that when a pig and any other animal met on the path, the latter had to step aside; and likewise, that pigs of any category would have the privilege of adorning themselves with green ribbons on their tails on Sundays.",45.904,45.601
276,"The farm had had a fairly successful year, but was still short of money. There were the bricks, sand, and lime for the schoolroom to be purchased, and it would also be necessary to begin saving up again for the machinery for the windmill. Then there were lamp oil and candles for the house, sugar for Napoleon’s own table (he forbade this to the other pigs, on the ground that it made them fat), and all the usual replacements such as tools, nails, string, coal, wire, scrap-iron, and dog biscuits. A stump of hay and part of the potato crop were sold off, and the contract for eggs was increased to six hundred a week, so that that year the hens barely hatched enough chicks to keep their numbers at the same level. Rations, reduced in December, were reduced again in February, and lanterns in the stalls were forbidden to save oil. But the pigs seemed comfortable enough, and in fact were putting on weight if anything. One afternoon in late February a warm, rich, appetising scent, such as the animals had never smelt before, wafted itself across the yard from the little brew-house, which had been disused in Jones’s time, and which stood beyond the kitchen. Someone said it was the smell of cooking barley. The animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered whether a warm mash was being prepared for their supper. But no warm mash appeared, and on the following Sunday it was announced that from now onwards all barley would be reserved for the pigs. The field beyond the orchard had already been sown with barley. And the news soon leaked out that every pig was now receiving a ration of a pint of beer daily, with half a gallon for Napoleon himself, which was always served to him in the Crown Derby soup tureen.","This year has been quite successful, but money is still lacking. We still have to buy bricks, lime, and sand to build the school; and we also have to save up to buy machinery for the windmill. Then we need to buy oil for lamps, candles, and sugar for Napoleon alone (he forbids the other pigs from eating sugar for fear they will gain weight) and many other things like tools, nails, ropes, coal, wire, roofing sheets, and biscuits for the dogs. We have to sell some hay and potatoes, the contract to sell eggs has increased to six hundred eggs per week, so the number of chickens has almost not increased, if not decreased, because the number of eggs they leave for hatching is too few. In December, the rations were reduced once, in February they were reduced again, and to save money, from now on, no lights are allowed to be lit in the barns at night. But the pigs seem to be living well, at least each one has gained weight. Once, on a February afternoon, a strong fragrance suddenly filled the farmyard, a smell the animals had never encountered before. It turned out the smell came from the house behind the kitchen, which in Jones's time was used for brewing beer, but had been abandoned for a long time. Someone said it was the smell of brewing barley. The animals sniffed the strong, spicy aroma and tried to guess if they would get to eat the ""mash"" that night. But that night there was no ""mash"", and on Sunday they were informed that from now on the barley would be reserved exclusively for the pigs. The plot of land next to the garden had already been sown with barley. Then there was news that from now on each pig would get half a liter of beer a day, while Napoleon would get two liters, and he had to drink it from a crystal goblet.",17.904,17.603,"That year, although things were going well on the farm, they were still experiencing financial difficulties. They had to buy bricks, sand, and lime for the classroom and save money for the windmill's machinery. Additionally, they needed to buy kerosene and candles for the house, and sugar for Napoleon's table (he had banned sugar for the other pigs to prevent them from getting fat); tools, nails, string, coal, wire, scrap iron, and dog biscuits were also necessary. Some of the hay and potatoes had been sold; since the number of eggs in the contract had been increased to six hundred per week, the hens had not been able to hatch enough chicks that year. In February, the rations, which had been reduced in December, were restricted again, and lanterns were banned in the barns to save kerosene. But the pigs were comfortable; in fact, it could even be said that they were getting fatter. Towards the end of February, one evening, a warm, delicious, appetizing smell that the animals had never smelled before spread into the yard from the small brewery behind the kitchen, which had never been used during Jones's time. One of the animals said that it was the smell of barley being cooked. The hungry animals, inhaling the smell, couldn't help but wonder if a hot mash was being prepared for dinner. But far from a hot mash, it was announced the next Sunday that all the barley would be reserved for the pigs. Barley had already been planted in the field behind the orchard. Soon, a rumor spread: Each pig was now being given half a liter of beer a day, and Napoleon was receiving four liters, drinking his beer from the soup bowl of the Crown Derby set.",23.543,23.255,"The farm had a fairly prosperous year, but they were still short of money. They still needed to acquire the bricks, sand, and cement necessary for the school, and it was going to be necessary to save again for the mill machinery. Additionally, oil was required for the lamps, candles for the house, sugar for Napoleon's table (he prohibited this for the other pigs, claiming it made them fat), and all the usual supplies like tools, nails, threads, coal, wire, iron, and biscuits for the dogs. A stack of hay and part of the potato harvest were sold, and the egg sale contract was increased to six hundred per week, so that year the hens barely hatched enough chicks to keep the numbers at the same level.

277,"But if there were hardships to be borne, they were partly offset by the fact that life nowadays had a greater dignity than it had had before. There were more songs, more speeches, more processions. Napoleon had commanded that once a week there should be held something called a Spontaneous Demonstration, the object of which was to celebrate the struggles and triumphs of Animal Farm. At the appointed time the animals would leave their work and march round the precincts of the farm in military formation, with the pigs leading, then the horses, then the cows, then the sheep, and then the poultry. The dogs flanked the procession and at the head of all marched Napoleon’s black cockerel. Boxer and Clover always carried between them a green banner marked with the hoof and the horn and the caption, “Long live Comrade Napoleon!” Afterwards there were recitations of poems composed in Napoleon’s honour, and a speech by Squealer giving particulars of the latest increases in the production of foodstuffs, and on occasion a shot was fired from the gun. The sheep were the greatest devotees of the Spontaneous Demonstration, and if anyone complained (as a few animals sometimes did, when no pigs or dogs were near) that they wasted time and meant a lot of standing about in the cold, the sheep were sure to silence him with a tremendous bleating of “Four legs good, two legs bad!” But by and large the animals enjoyed these celebrations. They found it comforting to be reminded that, after all, they were truly their own masters and that the work they did was for their own benefit. So that, what with the songs, the processions, Squealer’s lists of figures, the thunder of the gun, the crowing of the cockerel, and the fluttering of the flag, they were able to forget that their bellies were empty, at least part of the time.","Although there are still many difficulties, life is much more worth living than before. Never before have they been able to sing, listen to talks, attend rallies, and protest as much as they do now. Napoleon ordered that there must be a Parade every week, which he called Spontaneous, with the purpose of praising the struggle and achievements of Animal Farm. At the designated time, everyone would immediately leave their work, form ranks, starting with the pigs, followed by the horses, cows, sheep, and finally the chickens and ducks, and march around the farm. Napoleon's black rooster always led the way, while the dogs flanked the parade. Warrior and Fat Lady carried the green flag with the horn and hoof emblem and the slogan ""Long live Comrade Napoleon."" The rallies always ended with the recitation of a poem praising Napoleon and a report from the Pointer on the achievements in production increases over the past period; celebrations often included gun salutes as well. The sheep particularly enjoyed the parades, and if any of them complained (especially when the dogs and pigs were absent) that the parades were just cold and a waste of time, they would immediately chant their eternal prayer: ""Four legs good, two legs bad,"" so loudly that it drowned out all (even any) complaints and grumbles. But generally, the majority liked such ceremonies. They felt somewhat comforted because such gatherings reminded them that they were truly the owners of the farm and everything they did was for themselves alone. The songs, the parades, the Pointer's statistics, the gun salutes, the rooster's crowing, and the flag fluttering in the wind helped them forget, even if just for a moment, the gnawing hunger that tormented them.",12.239,11.793,"Although the difficulties never ceased, the animals consoled themselves to some extent by thinking that they now lived much more honorably than before. More songs were sung, more speeches were made, and more ceremonies were held. Napoleon had ordered Spontaneous Demonstrations to be held once a week to celebrate the struggles and victories achieved on Animal Farm. At the designated time, the animals would stop working and march around the farm in military formation: pigs at the front, followed by horses, then cows, sheep, and finally poultry at the back... The dogs would walk on either side of the parade, and Napoleon's black rooster would lead the way. Boxer and Clover always carried a flag bearing the image of a hoof and horn, with the words ""Long live Comrade Napoleon!"" Afterwards, poems written in honor of Napoleon were read, followed by Squealer giving a speech detailing the latest increases in food production, and occasionally a gun would be fired. The greatest enthusiasts of the Spontaneous Demonstrations were the sheep; if any animal tried to complain that they were wasting time and doing nothing but standing in the cold (some animals did indeed complain when the pigs and dogs were not around), the sheep would immediately silence them by bleating ""Four legs good, two legs bad!"" at the top of their lungs. But generally, the animals enjoyed these ceremonies. After all, the reminder that they were their own masters and worked only for their own benefit was heartening. Thus, with the songs, parades, Squealer's statistics, the gun's roar, the rooster's crowing, and the flag's fluttering, they could occasionally forget their hunger.",18.306,17.968,"But although there were no shortages of hardships to endure, they were partly compensated by the fact that life had greater dignity than before.

Boxer and Clover always carried a green flag marked with the hoof and horn and the slogan: ""Long live Comrade Napoleon!"" Then came recitals of poems composed in honor of Napoleon and a speech by Squealer giving details of the latest increases in food production, and on some occasions, a shotgun would be fired. The sheep were the most enthusiastic about the Spontaneous Demonstrations, and if anyone complained (as some animals did sometimes when there were no pigs or dogs around) saying that it was a waste of time and involved standing around in the open for a long time, the sheep would invariably silence them with a loud: ""Four legs good, two legs bad!"" But, in the end, the animals liked these celebrations. It was satisfying to remember that, after all, they were really their own masters and that all the work they did was for the common benefit. And so, with the songs, the parades, Squealer's lists of figures, the thunder of the shotgun, the rooster's crowing, and the waving of the flag, they could forget for a while that their bellies were almost empty.",37.889,37.693

279,"In the middle of the summer Moses the raven suddenly reappeared on the farm, after an absence of several years. He was quite unchanged, still did no work, and talked in the same strain as ever about Sugarcandy Mountain. He would perch on a stump, flap his black wings, and talk by the hour to anyone who would listen. “Up there, comrades,” he would say solemnly, pointing to the sky with his large beak —“up there, just on the other side of that dark cloud that you can see — there it lies, Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest for ever from our labours!” He even claimed to have been there on one of his higher flights, and to have seen the everlasting fields of clover and the linseed cake and lump sugar growing on the hedges. Many of the animals believed him. Their lives now, they reasoned, were hungry and laborious; was it not right and just that a better world should exist somewhere else? A thing that was difficult to determine was the attitude of the pigs towards Moses. They all declared contemptuously that his stories about Sugarcandy Mountain were lies, and yet they allowed him to remain on the farm, not working, with an allowance of a gill of beer a day.","After many years of absence, Moses suddenly reappeared in the middle of last summer. He had hardly changed, still refusing to do anything and spending all day telling fanciful stories about Sugarcandy Mountain. He often perched on a tree branch, flapping his black wings and talking for hours on end, as long as there was someone willing to listen. ""Up there, comrades,"" It said while pointing its beak towards the sky, ""above those black clouds is Mount Rice, where we, the wretched animals, will rest forever."" It also said that it had once flown there, had seen clover fields lush all year round, and had seen gardens full of flaxseed cakes and sugar cubes. Yet there were many hostages. They thought they were starving, suffering, and struggling; so the idea of a more peaceful world somewhere else seemed only fair.

Apart from the regular work of the farm, and the rebuilding of the windmill, there was the schoolhouse for the young pigs, which was started in March.

It was only his appearance that was a little altered; his hide was less shiny than it had used to be, and his great haunches seemed to have shrunken.

He said that Comrade Napoleon had learned with the very deepest distress of this misfortune to one of the most loyal workers on the farm, and was already making arrangements to send Boxer to be treated in the hospital at Willingdon. The animals felt a little uneasy at this. Except for Mollie and Snowball, no other animal had ever left the farm, and they did not like to think of their sick comrade in the hands of human beings. However, Squealer easily convinced them that the veterinary surgeon in Willingdon could treat Boxer’s case more satisfactorily than could be done on the farm.

The animals felt a bit uneasy. Until that day, no animal except Mollie and Snowball had ever left the farm; they did not like the idea of their sick comrade being handed over to humans.

Whymper had bought himself a dogcart. The windmill, however, had not after all been used for generating electrical power. It was used for milling corn, and brought in a handsome money profit.

308,"Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the animals themselves any richer-except, of course, for the pigs and the dogs. Perhaps this was partly because there were so many pigs and so many dogs. It was not that these creatures did not work, after their fashion. There was, as Squealer was never tired of explaining, endless work in the supervision and organisation of the farm. Much of this work was of a kind that the other animals were too ignorant to understand. For example, Squealer told them that the pigs had to expend enormous labours every day upon mysterious things called “files,” “reports,” “minutes,” and “memoranda”. These were large sheets of paper which had to be closely covered with writing, and as soon as they were so covered, they were burnt in the furnace. This was of the highest importance for the welfare of the farm, Squealer said. But still, neither pigs nor dogs produced any food by their own labour; and there were very many of them, and their appetites were always good.","The farm became wealthier, but except for the pigs and dogs, the lives of the other animals remained the same as before.

Squealer tirelessly explained that organizing and supervising the farm's work were tasks that had to be done regularly and continuously. And other species couldn't handle it; this job required a lot of intelligence. For example, Squealer said that the pigs spent a lot of effort drafting what they called ""documents,"" ""data,"" ""reports,"" ""minutes,"" and ""memos."" These were large sheets of paper filled with writing, and after they were written, they were taken to the furnace to be burned.

310,"And yet the animals never gave up hope. More, they never lost, even for an instant, their sense of honour and privilege in being members of Animal Farm. They were still the only farm in the whole county — in all England! — owned and operated by animals. Not one of them, not even the youngest, not even the newcomers who had been brought from farms ten or twenty miles away, ever ceased to marvel at that. And when they heard the gun booming and saw the green flag fluttering at the masthead, their hearts swelled with imperishable pride, and the talk turned always towards the old heroic days, the expulsion of Jones, the writing of the Seven Commandments, the great battles in which the human invaders had been defeated. None of the old dreams had been abandoned. The Republic of the Animals which Major had foretold, when the green fields of England should be untrodden by human feet, was still believed in. Some day it was coming: it might not be soon, it might not be with in the lifetime of any animal now living, but still it was coming. Even the tune of ‘Beasts of England’ was perhaps hummed secretly here and there: at any rate, it was a fact that every animal on the farm knew it, though no one would have dared to sing it aloud. It might be that their lives were hard and that not all of their hopes had been fulfilled; but they were conscious that they were not as other animals. If they went hungry, it was not from feeding tyrannical human beings; if they worked hard, at least they worked for themselves. No creature among them went upon two legs. No creature called any other creature “Master.” All animals were equal.","Anyway, they still kept hoping. Moreover, they were always proud to be citizens of Animal Farm. In this country, which is indeed England, this is the only farm run by animals and managed by animals! All the animals, from the smallest ones to those newly bought from tens of kilometers away, were proud of this. Especially when they heard the sound of gunfire, when they saw the green flag flying, their hearts would beat excitedly, and at that moment, no matter what they were talking about, they would return to the topic of those glorious years, about overthrowing Mr. Jones, about establishing the Seven Commandments, and about the heroic battles against the invading humans. They also did not forget to remind each other of the initial expectations. They believed that the prophecy of the old Leader about the day of establishing the Animal Republic across the entire territory of England, the day when humans would be expelled from this land, would definitely come. Their dreams would come true, that day would definitely come, even if it was far away, even if all the animals currently living would not witness it, but that day would definitely come. They also did not forget the song ""Beasts of England,"" every animal knew how to sing this song, but they only dared to sing it quietly to each other. Even though life was still difficult, even though not all of their dreams were realized, deep down they knew that they were special animals. Even though they were not yet full, they did not have to work to feed the cruel humans; even though they still had to labor hard, it was for themselves. No animal walked on two legs, there was no master-servant relationship. All were equal.",11.053,10.547,"However, the animals never lost their hope. More importantly, they never forgot for a moment how honorable and respectable it was to be a member of Animal Farm.

Even the youngest, and those who had been brought from farms twenty or thirty kilometers away, saw this as a miracle. When they heard the sound of the rifle, when they saw the green flag waving on the pole, their chests swelled with pride; the conversation inevitably turned to the old heroic days, the expulsion of Jones from the farm, the drafting of the Seven Commandments, and the defeat of the humans who tried to take over the farm. They had not given up on any of the old dreams. They had not lost their belief in the Animal Republic foretold by Old Major, where not a single human foot would tread on the green fields of England. One day it would definitely come true; maybe it wouldn't happen immediately, maybe those who were alive now wouldn't see those days, but their dreams would definitely come true one day. Even the tune of the song ""Beasts of England"" was being hummed secretly here and there; although none of them dared to sing it out loud, it was certain that every animal on the farm knew the song by heart. They might have been living a hard life, their hopes might not have all come true, but they were aware that they were different from other animals.

There had been a time — not that he, or any of the present company, had shared such sentiments — but there had been a time when the respected proprietors of Animal Farm had been regarded, he would not say with hostility, but perhaps with a certain measure of misgiving, by their human neighbours. Unfortunate incidents had occurred, mistaken ideas had been current. It had been felt that the existence of a farm owned and operated by pigs was somehow abnormal and was liable to have an unsettling effect in the neighbourhood. Too many farmers had assumed, without due enquiry, that on such a farm a spirit of licence and indiscipline would prevail. They had been nervous about the effects upon their own animals, or even upon their human employees. But all such doubts were now dispelled.

Unfortunately, there were a few clashes, and some misconceptions were circulated. There was an opinion that a farm run by pigs and managed by pigs was an abnormal thing, and there was no doubt that this farm would have an undesirable influence on the surrounding farms. Many landowners, quite a few, without any investigation, hastily concluded that there would be many excessive and undisciplined behaviors here. They were worried about the influence of this farm not only on the animals but also on their hired workers. But all those doubts have ended. Today, he and his colleagues have been invited to visit the farm, they have examined it very carefully, and what did they find? Not only the most modern technology but also the discipline and order of the farm are worthy of emulation by farms everywhere.

Between pigs and human beings there was not, and there need not be, any clash of interests whatever. Their struggles and their difficulties were one. Was not the labour problem the same everywhere? Here it became apparent that Mr. Pilkington was about to spring some carefully prepared witticism on the company, but for a moment he was too overcome by amusement to be able to utter it. After much choking, during which his various chins turned purple, he managed to get it out: “If you have your lower animals to contend with,” he said, “we have our lower classes!” This BON MOT set the table in a roar; and Mr. Pilkington once again congratulated the pigs on the low rations, the long working hours, and the general absence of pampering which he had observed on Animal Farm.","He said he wished for the friendship between Animal Farm and other farms to last forever. The interests of pigs and humans do not and should not conflict with each other. Both share common goals and common difficulties. The issue of labor is the same everywhere, isn't it? At this point, it was clear that Pilkington intended to say a humorous remark he had prepared for a long time, but it was so funny that he couldn't utter it. After a moment of trying to suppress his emotions, Pilkington said the following sentence: ""If you have to deal with lower animals, then we, we also have to deal with lower classes."" In response to that meaningful remark, there was laughter that seemed to shake the house, and Pilkington again congratulated the pigs on eating little, working hard, and the discipline and order of the farm.",9.988,9.156,"He wanted to end his words by once again emphasizing the feelings of friendship that existed and should continue between Animal Farm and its neighbors.

Wasn't the labor problem the same everywhere? Mr. Pilkington was about to make a clever joke that seemed to have been prepared in advance, but he had to stop his speech when he couldn't contain his laughter. After laughing until his chubby cheeks turned purple, he delivered the joke: ""If you have to deal with your lower-class animals,"" he said, ""we have to deal with our lower-class humans!"" The joke drowned the table in laughter.

There was, and should be, no clash of interests of any kind between the pigs and the human beings. Their efforts and their difficulties were identical. Wasn't the labor problem the same everywhere?” Here it seemed that Mr. Pilkington was about to tell some pre-prepared joke, but for a moment laughter overcame him, and he couldn't utter a word. After a moment of choking during which his various chins turned red, he managed to explain: ""While you have to deal with your lower animals,"" he said, ""we have our lower classes!""

For a long time there had been rumours — circulated, he had reason to think, by some malignant enemy — that there was something subversive and even revolutionary in the outlook of himself and his colleagues. They had been credited with attempting to stir up rebellion among the animals on neighbouring farms. Nothing could be further from the truth! Their sole wish, now and in the past, was to live at peace and in normal business relations with their neighbours. This farm which he had the honour to control, he added, was a co-operative enterprise. The title-deeds, which were in his own possession, were owned by the pigs jointly.","Napoleon always spoke briefly and got straight to the heart of the matter. Napoleon said that he was also very pleased to have cleared up all misunderstandings. Previously, there had been rumors, certainly propagated by hostile forces, suggesting that he and his associates were pursuing subversive ideas, if not revolutionary ones. They were accused of intending to incite animals in other farms to revolt. Slander, fabricated from start to finish! Their sole desire, now as in the past, was to live in peace and have normal business relations with their neighbors. The farm that he had the honor of leading, Napoleon added, was a kind of cooperative. Everything under his management was the common property of all the pigs on the farm.",14.386,13.604,"As always, he spoke briefly and concisely. He was also very happy because the period of disagreement had ended. For a long time, there had been rumors that his and his friends' attitudes and behaviors were destructive, moreover revolutionary. These rumors must have been spread by one of his ill-hearted enemies. It was said that they incited the animals on neighboring farms to revolt. Such a lie had never been seen before, indeed! However, their only desire had always been to live in peace with their neighbors and to maintain business relations properly. The farm he was proud to manage was a cooperative venture. The co-owners of the title deeds in his hand were the pigs.",8.836,7.642,"As in all his speeches, Napoleon was brief and to the point. “He too,” he said, “was glad that the period of disagreements had come to an end. For a long time, there had been rumors spread —he had good reasons to believe by some malicious enemy— that there was something subversive and even revolutionary in his and his colleagues' views. They were attributed the intention of fomenting rebellion among the animals of neighboring farms. Nothing could be further from the truth!

334,"He did not believe, he said, that any of the old suspicions still lingered, but certain changes had been made recently in the routine of the farm which should have the effect of promoting confidence still further. Hitherto the animals on the farm had had a rather foolish custom of addressing one another as “Comrade.” This was to be suppressed. There had also been a very strange custom, whose origin was unknown, of marching every Sunday morning past a boar’s skull which was nailed to a post in the garden. This, too, would be suppressed, and the skull had already been buried. His visitors might have observed, too, the green flag which flew from the masthead. If so, they would perhaps have noted that the white hoof and horn with which it had previously been marked had now been removed. It would be a plain green flag from now onwards.","Napoleon said that he believed all doubts had been cleared and the recent changes had further increased mutual trust. Until now, the animals on the farm had an unpleasant habit of calling each other ""Comrade"". This habit will be abolished. Another habit, whose origin is unknown, is the practice of marching in formation every morning around a pig's skull mounted on a post. This habit will also be abolished and the pig's head has already been buried. The guests must have had the opportunity to see the green flag flying. If indeed they have seen it, they must have noticed that the symbol of the white hoof and horn has also been removed. From now on, the flag will be pure green only.",12.911,12.15,"Although he never believed that the old suspicions still persisted, he nevertheless saw the benefit in noting that some changes had recently been made to further increase the trust placed in the farm's operations. Until today, among the animals on the farm, there was a silly habit of calling each other ""Comrade."" This habit would be put to an end. Another strange habit, the origin of which they did not know, was their ceremonial march past the pig's head mounted on a stump in the garden every Sunday morning. This habit would also be put to an end. They had already buried the pig's head in the ground. If the guests had looked carefully at the green flag waving on the pole, they must have noticed that the white hoof and horn had been removed from the flag.

335,"He had only one criticism, he said, to make of Mr. Pilkington’s excellent and neighbourly speech. Mr. Pilkington had referred throughout to “Animal Farm.” He could not of course know — for he, Napoleon, was only now for the first time announcing it — that the name “Animal Farm” had been abolished. Henceforward the farm was to be known as “The Manor Farm”— which, he believed, was its correct and original name.","He said that he would like to make a few minor adjustments to Mr. Pilkington's extremely concise and well-intentioned speech.

From now on, the farm would once again be known by its original name, ""Manor Farm.""",14.4,12.898,"»I had to make only one criticism of Mr. Pilkington's magnificent and friendly speech. Mr. Pilkington referred throughout to ""Animal Farm"". He could not know, of course —because he, Napoleon, was going to announce it for the first time— that the name ""Animal Farm"" had been abolished.

337,"There was the same hearty cheering as before, and the mugs were emptied to the dregs. But as the animals outside gazed at the scene, it seemed to them that some strange thing was happening. What was it that had altered in the faces of the pigs? Clover’s old dim eyes flitted from one face to another. Some of them had five chins, some had four, some had three. But what was it that seemed to be melting and changing? Then, the applause having come to an end, the company took up their cards and continued the game that had been interrupted, and the animals crept silently away.","Applause rang out, and everyone raised their glasses. But the animals standing outside felt like something strange was happening. Why did the faces of the pigs look like that? Mrs. Fat's cloudy eyes looked from one to another. Some had five chins, some had four, and some had three. Why did everything become so blurry and change so quickly? The applause ended, the banquet returned to the unfinished card game, and the animals watching outside slowly crawled away.",18.643,17.934,"With a heartfelt enthusiasm, they shouted, ""Cheers!""; the beers were finished in one gulp. However, while the animals outside were watching this scene, they sensed something strange. There was something different about the faces of the pigs, but what was it? Clover's old dull eyes were wandering over the faces one by one. The jaws of some of the pigs had become fivefold, some fourfold, and some threefold. But what was the thing that was melting and changing? A little later, the shouting ceased, those at the table picked up their papers and resumed their interrupted game; the animals quietly moved away from there.",14.33,13.281,"The same cordial cheering as before was repeated and the glasses were emptied in one gulp. But to the animals, who were observing the scene from outside, it seemed that something strange was happening. What was it that had changed in the faces of the pigs? The old and dim eyes of Clover quickly and alternately passed from one face to another. Some had five chins, others had four, those had three. But what was it that seemed to be fading and transforming?

338,"But they had not gone twenty yards when they stopped short. An uproar of voices was coming from the farmhouse. They rushed back and looked through the window again. Yes, a violent quarrel was in progress. There were shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp suspicious glances, furious denials. The source of the trouble appeared to be that Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington had each played an ace of spades simultaneously.","But they had just crawled about twenty meters when all of them stopped. There was a loud shouting coming from the building. They immediately turned back and continued looking through the window. The argument was at its peak. There were shouts, table banging, arguments, and suspicious glances. The cause of the argument was probably because Napoleon and Pilkington both played the queen of spades at the same time.",9.661,7.635,"They had only moved about twenty or thirty meters away when they stopped in their tracks. A commotion had erupted in the farmhouse. They turned back and ran quickly to the house, peeking inside through the window.

Apparently, the cause of the fight was that both Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington had drawn the ace of spades.",18.097,16.856,"But they had not taken twenty steps when they stopped abruptly.

339,"Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.","Twelve angry mouths spoke at once, and only heaven could distinguish who was who.
