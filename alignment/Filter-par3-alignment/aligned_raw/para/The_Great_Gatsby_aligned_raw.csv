1,In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.,"During the years when I was young and easily influenced, my father gave me some advice, and it was this advice that changed my thinking from that moment on.",20.053,17.405,"When I was younger and more fragile, my father gave me a piece of advice that I will never forget for the rest of my life.",18.291,14.168,"When I was younger and more vulnerable, my father gave me a piece of advice that I have not stopped thinking about since then.",24.41,20.803
2,"“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”","""Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that not everyone in this world has had the advantages that you've had.""",32.757,30.322,"“When you feel like criticizing someone,” he said, “remember that not everyone has had the advantages that you’ve had.”",37.381,35.505,"""Before criticizing anyone,"" he told me, ""remember that not everyone has had the advantages you've had.""",20.292,16.277
3,"He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.","My father said. My father didn't say much more, but because there was always a subtle way of communicating between us, I understood that his words contained much deeper meanings. As a result, that advice made me inclined to be cautious in all my judgments, helping me to see and understand the strange natures of those around me, but at the same time, it also made me a victim of not a few who came to bother and annoy me. The characteristic I just mentioned, if manifested in an ordinary person, would quickly attract abnormal minds to them. Therefore, when I was still studying at university, I was often unfairly labeled as a political merchant, because I knew many sad, private, and secret stories of people, even the stories of libertine men I didn't know. It's not that I went out of my way to seek out the private matters of others. I often had to pretend to sleep, pretend to be busy, or act indifferent and unfriendly when I noticed clear signs that a private matter was about to be revealed. In fact, the confessions of young men, or at least the words they used to express themselves, were often just borrowed ideas and phrases from others that they had edited and trimmed, making their thoughts no longer coherent or clear. Being cautious in judgment is actually about constantly nurturing hope. I was always afraid that if I forgot to do so, I would miss out on many things, just like the things my father proudly pointed out and I also proudly repeated, which is that the basic awareness of polite conduct is not always equally distributed to everyone at birth.",8.931,8.462,"He hadn't said anything else, but since we understood each other without much talking, I realized he wanted to convey much more. As a result, I preferred to keep my judgments about people to myself. This habit allowed me to meet many peculiar individuals, but it also condemned me to a considerable number of annoying people. Those who think differently immediately recognize this trait in a normal person and quickly become attached to it. While I was in university, for this very reason, that is, because some crazy, unknown young people did not hesitate to tell me their secrets, I was accused of being overly political for no reason. However, I often did this unintentionally. The moment I sensed someone was about to confide in me, depending on the situation, I would either pretend to be asleep, act as if I were very busy, or dismiss them with a joke. Because these intimate revelations of young people, or at least the expressions they use to tell them, are usually either borrowed from here and there or are suppressed emotions. Keeping judgments about people to oneself is, in my opinion, an endless hope. I still fear forgetting this saying of my father's, which he uttered wisely and I wisely agreed with: some fundamental subtleties are unjustly distributed in the world.",8.717,8.102,"That was all, but within our reserve, we have always understood each other in an uncommon way, and I understood that his words meant much more. Consequently, I tend to reserve my judgments, a habit that has allowed me to discover very curious characters and has also made me the victim of quite a few incorrigible bores. The anomalous mind detects and quickly takes advantage of that quality when it perceives it in an ordinary person, and it so happened that at university I was unjustly accused of being an intriguer, for being aware of the secret sorrows of some inaccessible and difficult individuals. Most of the confidences I did not seek: many times I have pretended to sleep, or to be absorbed in my own concerns, or I have shown a hostile frivolity at the first unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was looming on the horizon; because the intimate revelations of the young, or at least the terms in which they make them, are generally plagiarized and suffer from obvious omissions. Not judging is a reason for infinite hope. I still believe that I would lose something if I forgot that, as my father suggested with a certain snobbery, and as I now repeat with a certain snobbery, the most basic sense of decency is unequally distributed at birth.",25.65,25.28
4,"And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.","After boasting about my patience like that, I must also confess that my patience for enduring has its limits. Human conduct can be built on solid rock or on a swampy foundation, but at some point, I no longer care what it was built on. Last autumn, when I returned home from the East, I felt that I wanted the whole world to wear uniforms and to forever stand in ranks with moral uprightness. I no longer wanted noisy, boisterous entertainments with the privilege of glimpsing into people's hearts. Only Gatsby, the person whose name I used for this book, was an exception to my reaction. Gatsby represented everything I scorned. If human nature is a series of successful expressions, then he was indeed admirable. With a heightened sensitivity that could perceive the future, he was like a complex machine capable of recording earthquakes from thousands of miles away. This sensitivity of his had nothing to do with the weak, sentimental sensitivity respected under the term ""creative temperament."" It was merely a rare gift for hope, a romantic readiness that I have never found in anyone else and probably never will. In the end, Gatsby was good, and it was precisely what tormented and haunted Gatsby, the filthy dust that floated above his awakened dreams, that temporarily closed my interest in the sorrows and short-lived joys of people.",17.561,17.118,"After boasting so much about my tolerance, I must admit that it has its limits. There may be a hard rock or a swamp beneath human behaviors, but after a certain point, I can't say that I care much. When I returned from the east of the country last fall, I realized that I wanted the world to be an example and for honor to reign supreme forever. I no longer wanted those uneasy excursions into the privileged views of people's hearts. I exclude only one person from this, Gatsby, who also gives his name to this book. Gatsby, the person who embodies everything I despise. If a series of successful gestures is a sign of personality, Gatsby had something magnificent, an exaggerated sensitivity to life's promises. He was like those complex devices that can record earthquakes thousands of miles away. But this had nothing to do with that loose sensitivity glorified under the name of ""creative temperament."" His was an extraordinary ability to hope, a romantic madness that I had never seen before and don't think I will ever see again. No - Gatsby ultimately achieved his desire. It was what caught Gatsby off guard, what covered him in ash and dust when he awoke from his dreams, that caused my interest in the futile sorrows and short-lived happiness of people to disappear for a while.",19.435,19.016,"And, after boasting about my tolerance, I find myself forced to admit that it has a limit. I don't care, once a certain point is surpassed, whether the behavior is founded on stone or on swampy ground. When I returned from the East last autumn, I was aware that I desired a world in military uniform, in a kind of permanent moral vigilance; I no longer wanted wild excursions and privileged glimpses into the human heart. The only exception was Gatsby, the man who gives this book its title: Gatsby, who represented everything for which I feel genuine contempt. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something magnificent about Gatsby, an extraordinary sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were connected to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes from fifteen thousand kilometers away. Such sensitivity has nothing to do with the soft sentimentality that we dignify with the name of ""creative temperament"": it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in anyone else and probably never will again. No: Gatsby, in the end, turned out all right. It was what preyed on him, the foul dust that floated in the wake of his dreams, that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.",44.745,44.528
5,"My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.","Through three generations, my family has been a reputable and affluent family in this Midwestern city. The Carraway lineage lived like a clan; according to tradition, we are descendants of the Duke of Buccleuch. However, to be precise, the founder of our branch was my grandfather's brother. He came here in 1851, then sent a substitute to fulfill his duty in the Civil War, and established a wholesale business in metal mechanical tools that my father has inherited and managed up to this day.",14.191,12.712,"My family consists of wealthy and respectable people who have lived in this Midwestern city for three generations. We Carraways are like a kind of clan. It is rumored that we are descended from the Duke of Buccleuch. But the real person who laid the foundation of our lineage is my grandfather's brother.

6,"I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.","I have never seen the face of this great-uncle, but I believe I resemble him, based on the stern face in the portrait hanging in my father's room. I graduated from Yale University in New Haven in 1915, exactly a quarter of a century after my father. After that, I joined the fight against the German immigrants, known to everyone as the First World War. I participated in the counterattack so zealously that when I returned home, I was still quite restless. The Midwest is no longer the most exciting center of the world for me; it now seems to have become a tattered edge of the universe. Therefore, I decided to go to the East to learn about stocks and financial securities. Everyone I knew was in this industry, so I thought the market could still support another single young man like me. All my aunts and uncles discussed this matter as if they were choosing a preparatory school for me. Finally, they declared ""Alright"" with serious and hesitant faces. My father agreed to support me for a year. After various delays, I finally arrived in the East in the spring of 1922, thinking I would stay there forever.",22.332,21.892,"I never met this great uncle, but those who saw the sharp-featured portrait hanging in my father's workplace said I resembled him a lot. In 1915, exactly a quarter-century after my father, I graduated from New Haven. Soon after, I joined the delayed German expansion movement known to the world as the Great War (World War I). Our counterattacks gave me such great pleasure that I was saddened to return. The Midwest had ceased to be a bustling center of the world and had turned into a remote corner of the universe. So I decided to go East and get into the bond business. Everyone I knew was doing this job, and I thought that a bachelor like me could easily make a living this way. After all the aunts, uncles, and cousins had long discussions on the subject as if they were choosing a suitable college for me, they said ""Alright"" with serious and concerned faces. My father agreed to send me money for a year, and after a few delays, I finally came East and settled permanently in the spring of 1922.",19.976,19.465,"I never got to know my great-uncle, but they say I resemble him, especially the stern portrait my father has hanging in his office. I finished my studies in New Haven[2] in 1915, exactly a quarter of a century after my father, and shortly thereafter I participated in that aborted Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counteroffensive so much that I returned full of unease. The Midwest no longer seemed to me the burning center of the world, but the last and miserable edge of the universe, and I decided to go East and learn the secrets of bond trading. All my acquaintances were involved in bonds, so I thought the business could support one more. My aunts and uncles debated the matter as if they were looking for a school for me, and finally said: ""Well, well... yes,"" very seriously, with an expression of doubt.

7,"The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for a few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.","If I were to look for a room to rent in the city, it would probably be more practical and convenient for me. However, since it was the warm season at that time, and I had just left an area with vast grasslands and plenty of trees, when a young colleague suggested that the two of us rent a house in the suburbs, I immediately thought it was a good idea. My colleague found a house, a weather-beaten wooden bungalow, for eighty dollars a month. But in the end, the company transferred him to Washington, and so I had to move to the suburbs alone. I had a dog - at least it stayed with me for a few days before it ran away - an old Dodge car, and a Finnish maid.

When a young boy from work suggested renting a house in one of the nearby suburbs, it seemed like a great idea to me. He found the house. For eighty dollars a month, it was a damp-worn, shabby building. When the company sent him to Washington at the last minute, the house was left to me. I got a dog, but it ran away a few days later.

8,"It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.","I felt lonely and lost for about a day or so, until one morning when a man who had just moved into the area behind me stopped me on the road.",29.261,26.765,I spent a couple of days alone like this.,2.885,1.115,"I felt lonely for a day, more or less, until one morning someone who had arrived after me stopped me on the road.",38.723,35.737

10,"I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighbourhood.","This person asked, bewildered. I gave him directions, and as I continued walking, I no longer felt lonely; I had become a guide, a pathfinder, a pioneer. This man, by chance, made me feel comfortable with the area I lived in.",16.635,14.622,"I showed how to get there. When I started walking again, I had the feeling that I was no longer alone. I was a guide, one of the locals, giving directions to those around. Unknowingly, he had granted me the freedom of being his neighbor.",19.36,17.522,"I told him.

11,"And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.","And then, under the rosy sunlight and the explosive sprouting of new buds on the trees, everything around grew rapidly like in a time-lapse film, it reminded me of a common reasoning, that life will start anew when summer comes.",10.896,8.048,"I couldn't help but feel that familiar sense of life beginning anew with the arrival of summer, as the bright sunlight filled those trees with lush green leaves at a speed reminiscent of the movies.",7.086,3.889,"And so, with the sunlight and the splendid explosion of leaves growing on the trees like things grow in time-lapse films, I had the well-known certainty that life begins again with the summer.",33.796,31.687
12,"There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air.

And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” This isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.","There are too many books to read and so much abundant health to be enjoyed from fresh, youthful air.

Of course, I would read other books as well. I was interested in literature when I was at university. I had written serious and quality articles for a year in the school newspaper called Yale News.

13,"It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land.

It is a long, narrow, and rich island stretching eastward from New York. Among the other rare and strange sights there are two strips of land with peculiar shapes.

The two eggs protrude, encroaching into the most tamed saltwater area in the Western Hemisphere, the Long Island Sound, a vast wet livestock farm. These two strips of land are not entirely oval. Like the egg in Columbus's anecdote, both are flattened at the end where they connect to the mainland. The similarity in shape is the reason why the seagulls flying overhead are constantly confused.

My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season.

It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.","In addition to many different physical achievements, Tom, Daisy's husband, was once one of the strongest rugby players in New Haven.

The living-room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.

After that, Jordan lied about it. The incident suddenly reminded me of the story I couldn't recall the night at Daisy's house. At a major golf tournament that Jordan first participated in, there was such an uproar that it almost made the newspapers. Someone accused Jordan of moving her golf ball from a disadvantageous position. This incident had the magnitude of a scandal, but then it was suppressed.

722,"I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the “period” craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.","I went out of the house through the back way, just as Gatsby had done about half an hour earlier when he was nervously pacing around the house. I quickly ran to hide under a large, gnarled tree, whose lush foliage formed a rain shelter for me. Then the sky poured rain down onto my rugged garden, which Gatsby's gardener had meticulously trimmed. The lawn was now pockmarked with puddles and muddy patches, looking like prehistoric terrain. Standing under the tree, there was nothing to look at except Gatsby's grand house, so I stared at it for half an hour, just like Kant gazing at his church steeple. A bootlegger had built it a decade ago during the trend of constructing houses in classical architecture. According to the story, he had agreed to pay property taxes for all the neighboring houses for five years if the owners would thatch their roofs. Perhaps the refusal of these people had disappointed him to the point of losing interest in his project. His health immediately deteriorated severely. His descendants then sold the house while the mourning wreath was still hanging on the door. Americans, while occasionally willing to bow down as slaves, are always stubbornly unwilling to be farmers.",17.936,17.445,"Half an hour earlier, Gatsby had done the same thing, running in a semicircle in the rain. I took shelter under the tree in the front yard, its black trunk full of knots, and its large leaves resisting the raindrops. The rain had intensified, creating small ponds and swamps in my neglected garden covered with the short grass cut by Gatsby's gardener. The only place I could see from under the tree was Gatsby's magnificent mansion. Like Kant gazing at the church bell tower, I stared at it for half an hour. The building had been constructed ten years ago by a beer manufacturer in accordance with the 'period' fashion. According to a rumor, he had promised to cover the taxes for a year for the owners of the surrounding cottages if they agreed to thatch their roofs. The neighborhood's lack of enthusiasm for this family plan must have broken his heart, as his health suddenly deteriorated, and his children sold the mansion without even waiting for the black wreath on the door to be taken down. Americans occasionally desire to be bound to the land, but they have always resisted being part of the peasant class.",10.464,9.667,"I went out through the back door—the same path that Gatsby, nervous, had taken half an hour earlier to go around the house—and ran towards an immense and gnarled black tree whose leafy branches wove a screen against the rain. It was pouring again, and my uneven lawn, freshly mowed by Gatsby's gardener, was teeming with tiny muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes. There was nothing to look at from the base of the tree except Gatsby's enormous house, so I dedicated myself to looking at it, like Kant at the steeple of his church, for half an hour. A brewer had built it at the beginning of the ""period architecture"" fashion, ten years earlier, and it was said that he had committed to paying the taxes of all the neighboring country houses for five years if the owners thatched their roofs. Perhaps the general rejection dissuaded the brewer from his plan to Found a Family: the decline began immediately. His children sold the house while the funeral wreath still hung on the door.

The usual people had come – or rather, the people who came were of the usual type – once again we had plenty of champagne, and once again the party was dominated by a colorful and noisy chaos; however, there was an unpleasant atmosphere, a tension that never quite released, which I hadn't felt at the previous ones. Perhaps I had grown accustomed to these parties by starting to see West Egg, with its unique standards and types, as a world of its own that could easily defy the outside world because it didn't care about anything beyond itself. That night, I was looking at everyone and everything at the party through Daisy's eyes.

There were the same people, or at least the same type of people, the same abundance of champagne, the same bustle of voices and colors, but I sensed something unpleasant in the air, a harshness in everything that hadn't existed before. Or maybe I had simply become accustomed to accepting West Egg as a complete world in itself, with its own rules and its own great figures, not inferior to anything because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was seeing it again, through Daisy's eyes.

But what gave the house an intensity that made it hard to breathe was that Daisy lived there. And to her, the house seemed as normal as Gatsby's tent at the camp seemed to him. Deep and mysterious, it promised more beautiful and cooler bedrooms upstairs than other bedrooms, radiant and joyful activities along its hallways, romances that didn't smell of mustiness and lavender, but new, fragrant and throbbing like the splendid latest model cars, like the dances where the flowers had just begun to wilt.

Yet, none of the garage owners had seen him. Therefore, it was considered that he had found an easier and more certain way to learn what he wanted. Later, it was heard that he was seen in West Egg around half-past two in the afternoon, asking someone about Gatsby’s house. So by that time, he had already obtained Gatsby’s name.",15.043,14.451,"His movements —always on foot— were later reconstructed: from Port Roosevelt to Cad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich he did not eat and a coffee. He must have been tired and walking slowly, as he did not reach Cad’s Hill until noon. It was not difficult up to that point to reconstruct his hours: there were kids who saw an individual behaving ""like a madman,"" and drivers whom he stared at in a strange way from the roadside. Then he disappeared for three hours. The police, based on what he had told Michaelis, that he ""knew how to find out,"" assumed he had been going from garage to garage in the area, asking about a yellow car. But among the garage owners, none reported having seen him, and he might have resorted to an easier and safer way to find out what he wanted to know. No later than two-thirty, he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the way to Gatsby's house. So by that time, he already knew Gatsby's name.",31.376,31.001

A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool.

West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon.

I saw it like an evening scene in a painting by the famous artist El Greco: hundreds of houses, a mix of both traditional and absurdly bizarre, hiding under a gloomy, heavy, sorrowful sky and a dim moon. The main foreground of the painting is four solemnly dressed men in suits walking along the sidewalk, carrying a stretcher on which lies a woman in a white evening gown, completely drunk.

I liken this place, with its hundred traditional yet grotesque houses crouching under a low, sullen sky and a dull, lackluster moon, to a night scene painted by El Greco. In the foreground, four serious men, dressed in tailcoats, walk with a stretcher in their hands, on which a woman in a white dress lies drunk.

I see it as a nocturnal scene painted by El Greco: a hundred houses, both conventional and grotesque, huddled under a sullen and oppressive sky and a lusterless moon. In the foreground, four solemn men, dressed in formal attire, walk along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in an evening gown.
