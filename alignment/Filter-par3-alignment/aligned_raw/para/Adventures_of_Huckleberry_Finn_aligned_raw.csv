1,"You don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly—Tom’s Aunt Polly, she is—and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.","Perhaps you won't know me if you haven't read the book called ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer""; but that's alright. The author of that book is Mr. Mark Twain, and in it, he mostly tells the truth. There are some parts where he exaggerates a bit, but the majority of the stories are true. I've never seen anyone lie repeatedly like Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe even Mary. Aunt Polly is Tom's aunt, then there's Mary, and the widow Douglas; all of these people appear in the aforementioned book, and, as I said, it is mostly a true book, except for a few slight exaggerations.",28.553,27.907,"If you haven't read the book titled The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, you wouldn't know me, but it doesn't matter. That book was written by Mr. Mark Twain, and he mostly tells the truth. He exaggerated some things, but what he said is mostly true. What does it matter anyway. One way or another, I haven't met anyone who doesn't lie, except Aunt Polly, and the widow lady, maybe Mary too. Aunt Polly – that is, Tom's Aunt Polly – and Mary, and also the Widow Douglas are mentioned in that book; as I said earlier, mostly true things are said in the book, but there are also exaggerated parts.",23.018,22.202,"YOU WON'T KNOW WHO I AM if you haven't read a book titled The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, but it doesn't matter. That book was written by Mr. Mark Twain and he told the truth, most of the time. Some things he exaggerated, but most of the time he told the truth. That is nothing. I've never seen anyone who didn't lie at some point, except Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. About Aunt Polly — she is Tom's Aunt Polly — and Mary and Widow Douglas, everything is told in that book, which is mostly true, with some exaggerations, as I said before.",40.713,40.199
2,"Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six thousand dollars apiece—all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round—more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn’t stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.","Aunt Polly is Tom's aunt, then there's Mary, and the widow Douglas; all of these people appear in the aforementioned book, and, as I said, it is mostly a true book, except for a few slight exaggerations. The book has the following content: Tom and I, one day, stumbled upon a stash of money hidden by robbers in a secret cellar, and suddenly we became very rich. Divided up, each of us got as much as six thousand dollars, all in gold. Piling up that amount of gold was quite intimidating. Then Judge Thatcher immediately took our money and lent it out at interest: as for us, every few days he gave each of us a dollar, and it went on like that all year round. Widow Douglas treated me as if I were her own son, and she took it upon herself to civilize me. But I thought living around in that house was miserable, because I had to force myself to comply with all her rules and regulations. So, when I couldn't stand it anymore, I had to figure out a way to escape. I put on my old, tattered clothes again, and took my jar of candy with me, so I set off and was free and happy once more. But somehow Tom Sawyer tracked me down and said that he was about to form a gang of robbers and could let me join, but now he advised me to go back to the widow and behave well first. So I went back again.",11.189,10.653,"At the end of that book, the situation was like this: Tom and I had found the money the robbers hid in the cave and had become rich. Each of us had six thousand dollars – all in gold. When you piled up the money somewhere, you couldn't take your eyes off it. Judge Thatcher took the money and invested it at interest, so we earned a dollar every day throughout the year – so much money that one wouldn't know where to spend it. Miss Douglas adopted me like her own child and thought she could make a gentleman out of me, but staying at home all the time was not easy at all, moreover, the widow was so meticulous and proper in every way that it was enough to drive a person crazy; so when I couldn't stand it any longer, I ran away. I returned to my old rags and my sugar barrel; now I was free, I was happy. But Tom Sawyer tracked me down and found me and said he was going to form a robbery gang. If I went back to the widow and became respectable, I could join too. So I went back.",19.686,19.18,"Well, the book ends like this: Tom and I found the money that the thieves had hidden in the cave and we became rich. We each got six thousand dollars: all in gold. The truth is, it was impressive to see all that money piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher took charge of it and invested it at interest and gave us a dollar a day, all year long: so much that one wouldn't know what to spend it on. Widow Douglas adopted me as her son and said she was going to civilize me, but it was hard to live in the house all the time, because the widow was horribly normal and respectable in everything she did, so when I couldn't take it anymore, I put on my old clothes again and took my sugar skin and felt free and happy. But Tom Sawyer came looking for me and said he was going to organize a band of thieves and that I could join if I went back to the widow and was respectable. So I went back.",28.183,27.738
3,"The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn’t do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time. When you got to the table you couldn’t go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn’t really anything the matter with them,—that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.","The widow saw me return and burst into tears, she told me I was a poor lost bird, then called me by all sorts of strange names, but she really didn't mean any harm. She made me wear new clothes, the kind that made me sweat and feel like I was being tied up. Well, the old scenes in this house started to repeat themselves. The widow rang the bell to call for dinner, and you had to make sure to be on time. Even after sitting at the table, you couldn't eat right away, you had to wait for her to arrive and ramble on about the dishes, which really weren't worth talking about. Because the food was always the same, just leftovers mixed together and poured around some kind of sauce.",12.272,11.457,"When the widow saw me, she opened her arms with tears in her eyes, called me a poor lost lamb, and gave me many other names, but there was no malice in it. She dressed me in new clothes again. I sweated and sweated, and moreover, I couldn't move. Thus, our old life started again. The widow would ring a bell for dinner, and you had to be on time for the meal. When you sat at the table, you couldn't start eating right away; you had to wait for the widow to bow her head and mutter something about the meal; although there was nothing wrong with the meal. In fact, each dish was cooked separately. However, if you threw them all into one pot over the fire, it wouldn't be the same; everything would mix together, and the juices would blend with everything; that's what I call a meal.",19.904,19.315,"The widow started crying when she saw me and told me I was a poor little lamb and called me a bunch of other things, but without any bad intention. She put the new clothes back on me and all I could do was sweat and sweat and feel tight in them. Then the same thing happened as before. The widow rang a bell at dinner time and you had to be on time. When you got to the table, you couldn't just start eating, you had to wait for the widow to bow her head and mumble something over the food, although there was nothing wrong with it; well, except that everything was cooked separately. When everything is put together, the flavors mix and the juices combine and things taste better.",19.186,18.581
4,"After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by-and-by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take no stock in dead people.","After eating and drinking, she taught me about Moses... I thought hard but still couldn't understand who Moses was; but gradually I came to understand that Moses had been dead for a very long time. So I gave up, not bothering to care about Moses anymore, because why should I be interested in stories about dead people?",13.065,11.03,"After the meal, he would take out his book and teach me the story of Moses and the Reeds. I was working diligently to learn everything about Moses, but then he let slip that Moses had died quite some time ago; so I lost all interest in him, because I don't concern myself with the affairs of the dead.",12.253,9.648,"After dinner, he would take out the book and tell me the story of Moses and the reeds, and I was eager to learn all about that story, but eventually, he let slip that Moses had been dead for many years, so I no longer cared, because I am not interested in the dead.",17.01,15.22
5,"Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she wouldn’t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn’t clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They get down on a thing when they don’t know nothing about it. Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself.","Later, when I wanted to smoke, I asked the widow for permission to smoke. She absolutely refused. She said it was a bad habit and not clean, and she tried hard to persuade me to quit smoking. There are people like that, they get involved in things they know nothing about. Just like she worried about Moses, who wasn't related to her and didn't benefit anyone, since Moses had been dead for ages. Yet she still tried to make me learn from him, thinking it was very good. But she herself smoked, of course she thought it was fine, because she was the one smoking.",15.702,14.68,"After a while, I craved some tobacco and asked the widow for permission. She was adamant and wouldn't budge. She said it was a bad habit, that it made the surroundings dirty, and that I should make an effort to quit. Some people are just like that. They criticize what they don't understand. She was fixated on Moses, even though the man wasn't a relative or anything, he was of no use to anyone, he had passed away; yet she found all sorts of faults in me for engaging in a somewhat virtuous activity. Moreover, she herself used snuff, but of course, that was fine because she was the one doing it.",12.371,11.251,"Then I would feel like smoking and would ask the widow for permission. But she wouldn't give it to me. She said it was an ugly and dirty habit and that I had to try to quit. That's what happens to some people. They have a grudge against things they know nothing about. As for her, she was very interested in Moses, who wasn't even a relative of hers, and who was of no use to anyone because he was already dead, right? But she thought it was very bad that I did something I liked. And besides, she took snuff; of course, that seemed fine to her because she was the one taking it.",13.47,12.204
6,"Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up. I couldn’t stood it much longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, “Don’t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don’t scrunch up like that, Huckleberry—set up straight;” and pretty soon she would say, “Don’t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry—why don’t you try to behave?” Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn’t mean no harm. All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn’t particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn’t say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn’t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn’t try for it. But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn’t do no good.","Her sister, Miss Watson, was an old lady, quite thin, with white glasses, who had just come to live in the house with the widow. Now it was Miss Watson's turn to trouble me with the spelling book. She taught me with great effort, and every hour the widow would give her a break, and I couldn't endure it any longer. During that hour, I was bored to death and couldn't sit still. Miss Watson would constantly say: Huck, don't prop your feet up like that, then: Huck, don't twist around like that, sit up straight, or: Huck, don't yawn and stretch like that, why don't you sit properly? Then she said that I would end up in miserable places. I said that I wanted that, and she got really mad. But I really didn't mean to tease her. I just wanted to go somewhere, I just wanted a change, I didn't ask for anything special. She said my words were nonsense, she just wanted to live in a way that would lead to a good place. But I thought her way wasn't good, so I didn't care. But I didn't say it out loud, because I was afraid it would cause more trouble.",14.954,14.423,"He also had a sister, Miss Watson. Miss Watson, an elderly, never-married, very thin woman who wore huge glasses, had recently come to live with him, and this time she stood over me with a spelling book in her hand. After making me work diligently for nearly an hour, the widow told her to take a break. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to endure it any longer. The next hour was so stifling that I couldn't sit still anymore. Miss Watson kept saying, ""Don't put your feet there, Huckleberry,"" and ""Don't slouch, Huckleberry... sit up straight,"" and after a while, she started saying, ""Don't yawn and stretch, Huckleberry... why don't you try to sit properly?"" Then she told me everything about the bad place, and I said I wanted to be there. When I said that, she went crazy, but I didn't mean any harm. All I wanted was to go somewhere; I just wanted a change, it wasn't about going to a specific place. She said it was a sin to say that, that she would never say such a thing in this world; she intended to live in a way that she could go to the good place. Well, I couldn't see any good in going where she was going, so I decided not to bother trying for it. But I didn't say that, because it would only get me into trouble.",24.665,24.352,"Her sister, Miss Watson, was a rather skinny spinster who wore glasses, had just come to live with her, and had gotten it into her head to teach me the alphabet. She made me work quite hard for an hour and then the widow would tell her that was enough. I couldn't stand it any longer. Then I would spend an unbearably boring hour and I would get nervous. Miss Watson would say, ""Don't put your feet there, Huckleberry"" and ""Don't slouch like that, Huckleberry; sit up straight,"" and then she would say, ""Don't yawn and stretch like that, Huckleberry; why don't you try to behave?"" Then she would tell me all the details about the bad place and say she wished I were there. It was because she got angry, but I didn't mean to offend. All I wanted was to go somewhere, to get a change of scenery. I didn't care where. She said that what I said was bad; she said she wouldn't say it for anything in the world; she was going to live to go to the good place. Well, I didn't see any advantage in going where she was, so I decided not to even try. But I never said it because it would only create problems and it wouldn't be worth it.",33.268,32.965
7,"Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn’t think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.","She said that going to that place, people would spend all day wandering around singing. I didn't care about that either, but I didn't bother to say it. I asked her if Tom Sawyer could go to that good place, and she said he couldn't. Hearing that made me happy, because I wanted the two of us to stay together, not go anywhere.",13.228,12.064,"Now that he had started talking, he began to tell everything he knew about the good place. According to him, the only thing a person had to do there was to wander around all day, playing the harp and singing songs, forever, without ever stopping. So, it didn't seem like a place worth going to. But I definitely didn't express this. I asked if Tom Sawyer could go there too, and it seemed he definitely couldn't. I was happy about this because I didn't want us to ever be separated.",15.754,14.501,"Then she would start telling me all about the good place. She said that the only thing they did there was spend the day singing with a harp, always the same thing. So it didn't seem like a big deal to me. But I didn't say anything. I asked her if she thought Tom Sawyer would go there and she said not at all, and I was glad, because I wanted to be in the same place as him.",28.524,27.713
8,"Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. By-and-by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn’t no use. I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn’t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that’s on its mind and can’t make itself understood, and so can’t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn’t need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn’t no confidence. You do that when you’ve lost a horseshoe that you’ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn’t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you’d killed a spider.","Miss Watson kept pestering me like that, it was really annoying, but right after that, they called the black servants in, and everyone prayed and then went to bed. I also returned to my room, carrying a candle to place on the table. I plopped down on the chair by the window, trying to think of something fun, but I couldn't think of anything. At that moment, I felt so lonely and wished that I could just die. In the sky, the stars were twinkling. The sound of rustling leaves in the forest was incredibly mournful. I heard the distant hoot of an owl as if it were calling out to someone who had passed away, then the cry of a forest bird or a dog howling about someone who was about to die, and the wind seemed to whisper something to me that I couldn't figure out what it was trying to say. Thinking that, I shivered and felt a chill run through my body. Then after a while, from the distant forest came a sound like a ghost trying to express its worries but couldn't make anyone understand; it seemed like it couldn't rest peacefully in its grave and had to wander mournfully every night like that. Thinking that made me even more terrified, and at that moment, I wished there was someone sitting next to me. Suddenly, a spider jumped onto my shoulder from somewhere, crawling on my shirt, I quickly flicked it off with my hand, and it shot straight into the burning candle, and before I could pull it out, it was dead. At that moment, I didn't need anyone to tell me that it was a bad omen and that I would face misfortune, I was already very scared and frantically shook my clothes. I jumped up, spun around three or four times, and then made the sign of the cross many times. Then I took a string and tied up my hair to make a charm to ward off evil spirits. But then I didn't believe it either. This was the custom when someone lost something, after finding it, they were supposed to tie a bow at the front door; but I had never heard anyone say that doing so would prevent bad luck after killing a spider.",11.991,11.575,"While Mrs. Watson was listing her advice and scoldings one after another, I felt increasingly exhausted and lonely. Soon after, they brought in the black slaves and started praying, then everyone retired to their beds. I took a candle and went to my room, placing the candle on the table. I sat on a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it didn't work at all. I felt so utterly alone that I wished I were dead. The stars were shining brightly and the leaves in the forest were rustling mournfully, I heard an owl hooting in the distance; it was saying puuu-huuu for someone who had died; also, a whip-poor-will and a dog were howling to announce that someone nearby was going to die; the wind was trying to whisper something to me, but I couldn't understand what it was, so a cold shiver ran down my spine. Then, from the depths of the forest, I heard a sound like that made by ghosts who, unable to convey their troubles, leave their graves in despair and wander around every evening in torment. I was so demoralized and so scared that I wished someone were with me. Soon after, a spider started climbing up my shoulder, and when I flicked it, it fell onto the candle; before I could even move, it was scorched. No one needed to tell me that this was a terribly bad omen and would bring me bad luck, I started trembling like a leaf out of fear. I stood up and turned around three times, making the sign of the cross each time; then I tied a piece of string to a lock of my hair to keep the witches away. But I still didn't feel at ease. You know how when you find a horseshoe but lose it before you can nail it above the door, you do this, but I had never heard of anything you could do to ward off bad luck when you kill a spider.",22.796,22.543,"One day Miss Watson wouldn't stop picking on me, and I started to get tired and feel lonely. Then they called the slaves to say prayers and everyone went to bed. I went to my room with a piece of candle and put it on the table. Then I sat in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it was useless. I felt so lonely that I almost wanted to die. The stars were shining and the leaves of the trees were rustling with a very sad sound; far away an owl was hooting because someone had died and a whippoorwill and a dog were crying that someone else was going to die, and the wind was trying to tell me something and I couldn't understand what it was, so I got chills. Then, out in the forest, I heard that noise ghosts make when they want to say something they're thinking and can't make themselves understood, so they can't rest in the grave and have to stay up all night. I felt so discouraged and scared that I wanted company. Then a spider climbed up my shoulder and I brushed it off and it fell into the candle, and before I could reach out, it was already all burned up. No one needed to tell me that this was very bad luck and that it was going to bring me misfortune, so I got scared and almost tore my clothes off. I got up and walked three circles making the sign of the cross each time, and then I tied a lock of my hair with a thread so that witches wouldn't come near me. But I wasn't sure at all. That's what you do when you've lost a horseshoe you found, instead of nailing it above the door, but I had never heard anyone say it was the way to keep bad luck away when you had killed a spider.",28.806,28.59
9,"I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn’t know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom—boom—boom—twelve licks; and all still again—stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees—something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!” down there. That was good! Says I, “me-yow! me-yow!” as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.","I sat down on the chair again, feeling restless and uneasy. I took out a cigarette to smoke, because by now the house was as silent as death, and the widow had no idea what was going on. Then after a while, quite a long time, I heard the distant clock chime - bong - bong - bong, striking twelve times, and then everything was quieter than ever. After a moment, I suddenly heard the sound of a dry branch breaking in the dark bushes - it seemed like something was moving. I sat silently and immediately heard clearly the sound of a meow coming from that direction. Great! I softly responded with a meow, then extinguished the candle, climbed out the window, headed towards the darkness, quickly slid down to the ground, and slipped into the bushes. It was indeed Tom Sawyer waiting for me there.",11.309,10.26,"Shivering violently, I sat down again and took out my pipe to smoke; because now there was a deathly silence in the house, and not even the spirit of the widow would hear me smoking. Anyway, after a long time, I heard the town clock strike twelve with a tonk-tonk-tonk, and then silence fell again, the surroundings were even quieter than before. Shortly after, I heard a branch break in the darkness among the trees – something was stirring. I sat quietly and listened intently. From below, a faint “Meow! Meow!” sound was heard. That was good! I also said as quietly as possible, “Meow! Meow!”, then blew out the candle and stepped out onto the veranda through the window. Slipping down from the veranda, I started crawling among the trees and, of course, found Tom Sawyer waiting for me there.",15.708,14.854,"I sat down again, all trembling, and took out the pipe to smoke, because the house was now quieter than a tomb, so the widow wouldn't find out. Well, after a long time I heard the town clock start to chime: boom... boom... boom... twelve strokes and everything remained just as calm, quieter than ever. Shortly after, I heard a branch snap in the darkness among the trees: something was moving. I straightened up and listened. Soon I barely heard a ""meow! meow!"" down there. Great! I went and said ""meow! meow!"" as low as I could and then turned off the light and climbed down the window to the shed. Then I dropped to the ground and crawled among the trees, and of course, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.",27.576,27.047

11,"We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow’s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson’s big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:","The two of us tiptoed along the small path under the trees at the corner of the widow's garden, and had to bend down to avoid hitting our heads on the branches. When passing by the kitchen door, I tripped over a tree root, making a noise. The two of us quickly lay flat on the ground, completely silent. The big black man working for Miss Watson, named Jim, was sitting at the kitchen door at that moment. We could see Jim very clearly because there was a light behind him. Hearing the noise, Jim jumped up, stuck his head out to listen for a while, then asked:",17.933,17.071,"We dove into a path winding to the back through the trees to exit the old lady's garden, bending low to avoid getting our heads caught in the branches, and tiptoeing to avoid making any noise. As we passed by the kitchen, I tripped over a root, making a bit of noise. We immediately crouched down and stayed completely still. Mrs. Watson's big, burly black slave named Jim was sitting on the threshold of the kitchen door; we could see him clearly because the light was shining behind him. He stood up and stretched his neck to listen around for a while. Then he called out:",20.31,19.379,"WE TIPTOED along a path between the trees at the end of the widow's garden, bending down so the branches wouldn't hit our heads. When we passed by the kitchen, I tripped over a root and made a noise. We crouched down and stayed silent. Miss Watson's big black man, named Jim, was sitting at the kitchen door; we could see him very clearly because he had the light behind him. He stood up, stretched his neck for a minute listening, and then said:",35.784,35.061
12,“Who dah?”,- Who is it?,24.028,10.682,“Who is there?”,37.606,23.644,—Who is it?,31.947,15.974
13,"He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn’t a sound, and we all there so close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders. Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t scratch. Well, I’ve noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain’t sleepy—if you are anywheres where it won’t do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim says:","Listening for a while and hearing nothing, he tiptoed down and stood right between the two of us. Just by reaching out, we could touch him. For a long time, it seemed like several minutes passed without a single sound, and the three of us were right next to each other like that. At that moment, my ankle felt itchy, then my back, right between my shoulder blades. It felt like if I couldn't scratch it at that moment, I would die. Right then, Jim spoke up:",9.348,8.613,"He listened a little more; then he came on tiptoe and stood right between the two of us, we could touch him if we reached out, that's how close he was. The three of us stayed there, so close together, for maybe minutes without a sound. A spot near my ankle started to itch, but I couldn't risk scratching it, then my ear started to itch; then an itch appeared right in the middle of my back, between my shoulder blades. If I didn't scratch, I would almost die right there. Such things had happened to me many times before. If you're around polite people, at a funeral, or trying to sleep even though you're not sleepy – in short, if you're in a place where it's not appropriate to scratch, thousands of places on your body start to itch. A little later, Jim called out again:",14.218,13.422,"He stayed listening for a while; then he tiptoed out and stood between the two of us; we could almost have touched him. Well, I bet minutes and minutes passed without a sound being heard, even though we were very close together. My ankle started to itch, but I didn't dare scratch it, and then my ear started to itch, and then my back, right between my shoulders. I thought I was going to die if I didn't scratch. Since then I've noticed it many times. If you're with refined people, or at a funeral, or trying to fall asleep when you're not sleepy, if you're anywhere where it's not appropriate to scratch, then you itch all over, in more than a thousand places. And then Jim goes and says:",24.935,24.289
14,"“Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn’ hear sumf’n. Well, I know what I’s gwyne to do: I’s gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin.”","- Hey, where are you? Strange, I clearly heard some noise here. Alright, I have a plan. I'll just sit here until I hear the noise again.",5.373,2.954,"“Who is there? Where are you? If I haven't heard anything, let me be damned. Alright, I know what to do. I'll sit here and wait to hear it again.”",12.764,9.575,"—Hey, who is it? Where are you? May I die if I didn't hear something. Well, I know what I'm going to do: I'm going to sit here and listen to see if I hear it again.",23.116,20.757
15,"So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my eyes. But I dasn’t scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn’t know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn’t stand it more’n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore—and then I was pretty soon comfortable again.","After saying that, he plopped right down on the ground, between me and Tom. He leaned his back against the tree trunk, stretched out his legs, and almost touched me with his feet. My nose started to itch again. That torment lasted for six or seven minutes and seemed even longer. Now, I felt itchy in a total of eleven places on my body. I thought I couldn't endure it for another minute, but I gritted my teeth and prepared to bear it. Just then, I heard Jim panting, followed by his snoring. Immediately, I felt relieved.",12.663,11.984,"Thus, he collapsed to the ground between Tom and me. He leaned his back against a tree and stretched his legs out so far that they almost touched one of mine. My nose started to itch. It itched so much that my eyes watered. But I couldn't muster the courage to scratch it. Then an itch started inside my nose. Next thing I knew, my lower parts were itching. I didn't know how I was going to keep still without moving. This ordeal must have lasted six or seven minutes; but it felt much longer to me. By now, eleven different parts of my body were itching. I felt like I couldn't endure another minute, but I gritted my teeth and prepared to hold on a bit longer. Just then, Jim's breathing grew heavier; then he started to snore – and with that, I scratched myself freely.",23.715,23.148,"So he sat on the ground between Tom and me. He leaned his back against a tree and stretched his legs until one of them almost touched me. My nose started to itch. It itched so much that tears came to my eyes. But I didn't dare scratch it. Then it started to itch inside. Then below. I didn't know how to keep sitting without doing anything. That torture lasted at least six or seven minutes, but it seemed much longer. Now I was itching in eleven different places. I thought I couldn't stand it for another minute, but I gritted my teeth and prepared to try. Just then Jim started breathing very regularly, and I immediately felt comfortable again.",25.272,24.69
16,"Tom he made a sign to me—kind of a little noise with his mouth—and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they’d find out I warn’t in. Then Tom said he hadn’t got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn’t want him to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome.","Tom signaled to me and I responded by quietly clearing my throat. The two of us crawled away again. About ten steps away from there, Tom whispered in my ear that he wanted to tie Jim to a tree for fun, but I told him not to, in case Jim woke up and made a fuss, then the people in the house would know I wasn't there. Tom then said that there were no candles, and he wanted to sneak into the kitchen to get some. I didn't want him to do that, I told him that if Jim woke up and ran in, what would we do then. But Tom was determined to take the risk; so we sneaked in and grabbed three candles, then Tom left five cents on the table to pay for them. Then we stepped out, I was anxious to run away immediately, but for some reason, Tom crawled back to where Jim was, and I saw him bending over as if he was messing with something above Jim's head. I had to wait for quite a while. Everything around was still and quiet.",13.788,13.062,"Tom gave me a signal – he made a soft sound with his mouth – then we began to crawl away on our hands and knees. After moving three or four meters away, Tom whispered that he wanted to tie Jim to a tree for fun; but I said no; he could wake up and make a noise, and they would realize I wasn't inside. Then Tom said he didn't have enough candles with him and suggested quietly going into the kitchen to get some more. I didn't want him to attempt such a thing. I said Jim could wake up and come. But Tom wanted to take the risk; so we slipped inside and took three candles. Tom left five cents on the table for the candles. When we got outside, I wanted to get away as soon as possible, but it was impossible to stop Tom. He crawled on his hands and knees to where Jim was and did something to him. The surroundings were so quiet and deserted that it felt like I had waited for quite a long time.",28.779,28.35,"Tom made a signal to me —a sort of little noise with his mouth— and we started crawling on all fours. When we were about ten feet away, Tom whispered to me that it would be fun to tie Jim to the tree. But I told him no; he could wake up and make a racket, and then they would see that I wasn't at home. Tom said that he didn't have enough candles and that he was going to sneak into the kitchen to get more. I didn't want him to try. I said that Jim could wake up and come in. But Tom preferred to take the risk, so we crawled in and took three candles, and Tom left five cents on the table to pay for them. Then we went out, and I was dying to leave, but Tom was determined that he had to crawl over to where Jim was and play a prank on him first. I waited and it seemed like a long time passed, with everything so quiet and so lonely.",25.17,24.644
17,"As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence, and by-and-by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house. Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn’t wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance, and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by-and-by he said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, “Hm! What you know ’bout witches?” and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn’t touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.","Waiting for Tom to return, we ran along the small path around the garden fence, then after a while ran up the hill on the other side of the house. Tom said he had lifted the hat off Jim's head and hung it on a branch right above where he was sleeping; Jim stirred a bit but did not wake up. Later on, Jim himself spread the story that a ghost had taken his soul, led him wandering all over the place, and another time he recounted this story, Jim said that the ghost had led him down to New Orleans. Another time, each time he retold this story, he added a bit more, gradually until he said that the ghost had taken him all over the world, making him nearly dead tired, and his back was swollen all over. Jim was very proud of this story, which made him pay less attention to the other black folks. People would travel five or six miles to hear Jim retell this ghost story, gradually in the area, Jim became more respected than the others. Black folks from afar would gape at Jim all over, considering him a wonder. Black folks often waited until night, sitting by the fire talking about ghosts and spirits; whenever someone started talking about such things and acted like they knew all about ghosts, suddenly Jim would show up and say: Huh! What do you know about ghosts? And the other person would immediately fall silent and move to the back to make room for him. Jim always had two five-cent coins tied to a string around his neck, boasting that it was a charm given to him by spirits themselves, telling him that he could use it to heal people; and that he could summon ghosts anytime, just by whispering a few words to the coins. But he never told anyone what he would say to the charm. Black folks in the area would bring anything to Jim just to see those five-cent coins. But no one dared to touch them because they feared the spirits' hands had been on them. It was truly dangerous for Jim, being a servant, to boast about having met spirits and being led around by ghosts everywhere.",15.766,15.477,"As soon as Tom returned, we set off, circled the garden fence, and then climbed to the steep summit of the hill on the other side of the house. Tom told me that Jim had taken off his hat and hung it on a branch right above him. Jim had stirred a little, but he hadn't woken up. Later, Jim said that witches had cast a spell on him and made him pass out. They had ridden on his back all around the State; they brought him back under the trees and hung his hat on a branch to show him who had done it. The next time, Jim said they had taken him all the way to New Orleans: In his later recountings, he said he went farther each time, and finally, he started saying they had ridden him all around the world until he was dead tired and had sores on his back. Jim was immensely proud of all that had happened, and he even looked down on the other black people because of it. Black people came from miles away to listen to Jim's story, and he had become the most respected black slave in the area. Black people who saw him for the first time stared in amazement with their mouths open, scrutinizing him from head to toe as if he were a miracle. Black people liked to talk about witches by the stove in the kitchen when it got dark, but now whenever someone started talking about it and claimed to know everything, Jim would immediately interrupt and ask, ""Huh! What do you know about witches?"" and that black person couldn't continue and had to back down. Jim also wore the five cents we had left him on a string around his neck and said that the devil had given it to him with his own hand. With this charm, he could heal anyone he wanted and summon witches with a single word whenever he wished; but, of course, he never said what that word was. Black people came from all around and gave Jim whatever they had just to see the five cents; but they couldn't touch it, because the devil's hand had touched it. Jim had almost become unable to serve, because he was so puffed up with pride for having seen the devil and carried witches on his back.",18.106,17.817,"As soon as Tom returned, we started running down the path, rounded the fence, and finally reached the top of the hill on the other side of the house. Tom said he had taken Jim's hat and hung it on a branch above his head, and that Jim had moved a little but hadn't woken up. Later, Jim would say that the witches had enchanted him and put him in a trance, and that they had ridden him all over the state and then placed him back under the trees and hung his hat on a branch to show who had done it. And the next time he told it, Jim said they had taken him to New Orleans, and each time he told it, he lengthened the journey, until finally he said they had made him travel the whole world and almost killed him from exhaustion, and that his back was covered with boils. Jim was so proud that he hardly paid attention to the other blacks. There were blacks who traveled miles and miles to hear what he had to say, and they respected him more than any other black in the area. There were blacks who came from afar and stood with their mouths open, staring at him as if he were a wonder. Blacks spend their lives talking about witches in the dark, by the fireplace, but when one of them started talking and suggested that he knew a lot about these things, Jim would come and say: ""Well! And what do you know about witches?"" and that black was done for and had to keep quiet. Jim always wore that five-cent coin tied with a string around his neck and said it was a talisman given to him by the devil himself, telling him that he could cure anyone with it and call the witches whenever he wanted if he said some words, but he never told what he had to say. Blacks from all around would come and give Jim whatever they had, just to see that five-cent coin, but they didn't want to touch it because the devil had held it in his hands. Jim was practically no longer useful as a servant because he was too proud of having seen the devil and of the witches having ridden him.",25.566,25.326
18,"Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.","When Tom and I reached the hillside, looking towards the hill, we saw three or four flickering fires; perhaps someone there was ill. The late-night stars above us were still twinkling beautifully. Down there, near the village, was a river almost a mile wide, silently flowing in a terrifying manner. As we descended the hill, we saw Joe Harper, Ben Rogers, and two other boys hiding in the old tannery. We untied a small boat and then rowed downstream for more than two miles. We only went ashore when we reached a large mound on the hillside.",10.606,9.243,"Anyway, when Tom and I reached the top of the hill, we turned and looked at the town and saw three or four lights on. There were probably sick people around there; also, the stars were shining a tremendous light from above. The river started below the town. The river, almost two kilometers wide, was as smooth as a sheet and unbelievably magnificent. When we descended the hill, we found Jo Harper, Ben Rogers, and two or three of the other boys hiding in the old tannery. We all untied a small boat, got in, and went down the river, traveling four kilometers until we reached that big rock on the hillside, and then we went ashore again.",18.934,18.107,"Well, when Tom and I reached the edge of the hill, we looked down from up there towards the town and saw three or four lights flickering, where there might have been sick people, and above the stars shone wonderfully, and next to the town ran the river, which was a whole mile wide and flowed grandly in silence. We came down from the hill and met up with Joe Harper and Ben Rogers and two or three more boys, who were hiding in the old tanneries. So we untied a boat and went two and a half miles down the river, where the great gap between the hills was, and disembarked.",22.301,21.312
19,"We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole. We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:","We went to a dense thicket, and Tom made us all swear to keep it a secret.

Anyone not in the group was not allowed to use that symbol. If someone else used it, they would be prosecuted, and if they reoffended, they would be executed.

Why can’t the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole? Why can’t Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to myself, there ain’t nothing in it. I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was “spiritual gifts.” This was too many for me, but she told me what she meant—I must help other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn’t see no advantage about it—except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn’t worry about it any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body’s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow’s Providence, but if Miss Watson’s got him there warn’t no help for him any more. I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong to the widow’s if he wanted me, though I couldn’t make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.","Once, I sat deep in the forest and pondered for a long time about that matter.

Why couldn't Miss Watson get fatter? No, there's no such thing; I told myself that. So I went and told the widow my thoughts, and she said that the things people pray for are only spiritual blessings. That was really hard for me to understand. But then she said what she meant was this: that one must help others, do everything one can for others, always take care of others, and never think of oneself. If I understood correctly, this should include Miss Watson too. I went back out into the woods and kept wandering around, thinking about it for a long time, but I couldn't see how it would benefit me, only others. Finally, I decided not to worry about it anymore and just let it be. Sometimes the widow would pull me aside and talk about God's blessings; it sounded so tempting. But then the next day, Miss Watson might take up the same topic and say something completely different. I thought I had figured out that there were two kinds of God; those who were miserable followed the God the widow talked about, but if someone unfortunately encountered Miss Watson's God, then there was no hope for them.

Why can't Mrs. Watson gain weight? No, I said to myself, there's no way that thing called prayer works. I went and told the widow about this, and she said that a person can only gain ""spiritual gifts"" by praying. I couldn't grasp this much, but then she explained it clearly – I should help other people, do everything I can for others, constantly look out for them, and never think of myself. As far as I understood, this included Mrs. Watson as well. I went back to the forest and pondered this for a long time, but I couldn't see any good in it – that is, it only benefited others. Finally, I decided not to bother myself with this anymore and to let everything take its course. From time to time, the widow would pull me aside and speak about God in a way that made my mouth water; but maybe the very next day, Mrs. Watson would catch me and tell me the opposite of everything I had learned. In the end, I concluded that there were two Gods. A poor boy couldn't get enough of listening to the widow's God, but if he fell into the hands of Mrs. Watson's God, he had no chance. After thinking about all this over and over, I decided to belong to the widow's God, if He would accept me.

Sometimes the widow would take me with her and talk to me about Providence in a way that made one's mouth water, but maybe the next day Miss Watson would undo it all again. It seemed to me that there might be two Providences and that one, poor fellow, would do very well with the widow's Providence, but if it was Miss Watson's, there was nothing to be done. I thought it all over and figured that if she wanted, I would go with the widow's, although I didn't see what she would gain by having me on her side that she didn't have before, given how ignorant and insignificant and ordinary I was.",21.387,21.069

He used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around. Well, about this time he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so people said. They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all like pap; but they couldn’t make nothing out of the face, because it had been in the water so long it warn’t much like a face at all. They said he was floating on his back in the water. They took him and buried him on the bank. But I warn’t comfortable long, because I happened to think of something.

That also makes me feel relieved, because I don't want to see my father anymore. Whenever he wasn't drunk and caught me, it was only beatings; so I always ran into the forest, especially when my father was wandering around the house. Back then, people found my father drowned in the river downstream, about twenty miles from the town. They said that the drowned person had the same build as my father, with tattered clothes and a long, unkempt hair. And those things were exactly like my father. But no one could clearly see the face, because the body had been in the water for too long, so the face was no longer recognizable. They said my father was floating face up on the water. They retrieved the body and buried it on the riverbank. But I wasn't at ease for long before I suddenly thought of something. I knew clearly that a drowned man never floats face up, but face down. If that's true, then that body wasn't my father, but perhaps a woman dressed in men's clothing. Thinking that made me worried again. I guessed that he would soon come back. And I kept hoping he wouldn't come back anymore.",12.779,12.173,"It had been over a year since my father disappeared, and this suited me just fine; I no longer wanted to see him.

At one point, they said he was found drowned in the river about twenty kilometers upstream from the town. More precisely, they guessed that the person they found was my father, because the drowned man was exactly his height, looked very disheveled, and had unusually long hair – they were describing my father exactly – but they couldn't identify him by his face; because he had been in the water so long that his face had become unrecognizable. They said he was found floating on his back. They immediately took him out of the water and buried him on the shore. But the relief I felt didn't last long, because something important came to my mind. I knew very well that a drowned man would turn face down, not face up. So, the drowned person was not my father, but a woman dressed like a man. My peace was disturbed again. I was no longer in doubt that he would eventually show up, but deep down, I wished he would never come back.",17.678,17.165,"It had been over a year since anyone had seen my father, and I was so happy; I didn't want to see him again.

They said he was floating on his back in the water. They took him out and buried him on the riverbank. But I didn't stay calm for long, because something occurred to me.

We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs “ingots,” and he called the turnips and stuff “julery,” and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and marked. But I couldn’t see no profit in it. One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand “sumter” mules, all loaded down with di’monds, and they didn’t have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things. He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready. He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn’t worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before. I didn’t believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. But there warn’t no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn’t no camels nor no elephants. It warn’t anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.","Occasionally, we pretended to be robbers, played for almost a month, then I withdrew and stopped playing. The whole group stopped as well. We never robbed anyone, never killed anyone, we just pretended like that. We often ran out into the forest, pretending to attack shepherds and women carrying vegetables to the market. But we never gathered to take anything from them. Tom Sawyer called the sheep gold bars and the turnips and cabbages clothes and furniture. Afterwards, our whole group would gather in the cave to discuss our recent actions, counting how many people we had killed and how many marks we had made on the dead. But then I found it useless. Once, Tom sent someone to town, holding a bright torch which he called the signal (our group's sign whenever we gathered). Then he said he had just received secret news from his scouts; reporting that the next day a caravan of very wealthy Spanish and Arab merchants would pass by, camping at Hole Cave; this caravan had two hundred elephants, six hundred camels, and more than a thousand mules, all carrying diamonds and jewels; and they only had four hundred guards. So we would set up an ambush, Tom said, ambush and quickly rob them of those items. He instructed us to thoroughly clean our knives, swords, and guns and be ready. His kind couldn't even handle a vegetable cart, but he insisted on having swords and guns cleaned until they shone to do those things; although the swords and guns were just wooden sticks, broom handles, no matter how much they were cleaned or polished, they were still worth no more than a pile of firewood. I didn't believe we could defeat such a caravan of Spanish and Arabs, but I wanted to see the elephants and camels, so the next day I also joined the ambush. That Saturday, after receiving the order, we left the forest and ran down the hill. But we didn't see any Spaniards or Arabs, nor any camels or elephants. It was just a group of small schoolchildren from the convent school on a Saturday afternoon picnic. We rushed into that group and herded the children into the cave. But we didn't get anything except a sweet bread and some bacon, Ben Rogers grabbed a ragged doll, Joe Harper grabbed a church hymn book and a small Bible. Then suddenly the teacher appeared, making us drop everything and run away.",15.107,14.823,"We played at being robbers whenever we found time for a month, then I left the gang. All the children left. We hadn't robbed anyone, we hadn't killed anyone, we had just pretended to rob and kill. We would suddenly emerge from the forest and attack pig herders or the carts of women taking vegetables and fruits to the market, but we never captured any of them. Tom Sawyer called pigs ""gold bars"" and turnips or similar things ""jewels. "" Then we would return to the cave and tell each other what we had done; we would talk about the many people we had killed and marked. But I couldn't understand what good it would do us. Once, Tom made one of the boys run through the town with a burning torch in his hand. He said it was a password (a signal for the gang to gather). Then he claimed he had received secret information from his spies. The next day, a lot of Spanish merchants and rich Arabs were supposed to camp at Rocky Cave with two hundred elephants, six hundred camels, and over a thousand mules. All the animals were loaded with diamonds and they had no guards other than four hundred soldiers. So, as he put it, we would ambush them and kill everyone and plunder the goods. He said we needed to take care of our swords and weapons and get ready. He couldn't even keep up with a turnip cart, but he made sure we cleaned our swords and weapons; and these were just sticks and broom handles, no matter how much you scrubbed them, they didn't look any different than before.

After the meal, I stepped outside, feeling anxious and fearful, not knowing where that misfortune would befall me and not knowing what it would be like.

After breakfast, I was anxious and uneasy. It was uncertain where and how the bad luck would catch up with me.

His hat was laying on the floor—an old black slouch with the top caved in, like a lid.","My father is about fifty years old. His hair is long, messy, hanging down, and dirty. Through that hair, you can see his bright eyes shining out, as if he were hiding behind a grapevine and looking at you. His hair is completely black without a single gray strand, and the long sideburns intertwine with each other as well. Looking at his face, except for the places without hair, there is no other color, just white, not the kind of white everyone has, but a white that makes the flesh of people cringe. A white like that of a climbing plant, a white like the belly of a fish. As for his clothes, apart from a few tattered pieces, there is nothing else. He sits cross-legged, the shoe on the leg that is crossed over has its mouth open, a toe sticking out, occasionally wiggling. His hat thrown on the floor is a wide-brimmed, black hat, old, with a huge hole on the crown that looks like a door frame leading down to a ship's hold.",7.762,6.79,"He was almost fifty years old, and he looked his age. His long, greasy, and disheveled hair fell over his face, making his eyes shine as if they were behind ivy. There was no gray in his hair, nor in his long and tangled sideburns. As far as could be seen from his hair, its color had faded; his face was ghostly white; but not white like others, a stomach-turning white, a hair-raising white – the white of a tree frog, the white of a fish belly. His clothes were– truly rags. He had one ankle resting on the opposite knee; on that foot, he kept wiggling the two toes visible through the hole in the tip of his boot. He had placed his hat on the ground; the wide-brimmed, shabby black hat had its crown caved in, looking like a pot lid.",15.094,14.156,"He was almost fifty years old and he looked it.

There was no color in his face, where it was visible; it was all white, not like other men, but a white that was disgusting, a white that made you itch, a white like a tree frog, like a fish's belly. And his clothes: rags and nothing more. He had one ankle resting on the other knee; the boot on that foot was torn and two of his toes were visible, which he moved from time to time.

When it was time to go to bed, my father stood up, spread his arms, and said:",14.722,14.194,"After getting out of prison, the new judge said he would straighten him out. He took my father into his own home, dressed him up in fine clothes, and, as the saying goes, treated him like an old friend, giving him breakfast, lunch, and dinner at his family's table. After dinner, he gave such a speech to make him quit drinking that our old man burst into tears, saying he had been foolish until then and had wasted his life; now he would turn over a new leaf and become a man no one would be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him. When the judge heard these words, he almost wanted to embrace him. He too started crying, and his wife also burst into tears. My father said he had always been misunderstood until that day, and the judge said he believed him. Our old man said all he wanted was to be shown empathy; the judge agreed with him, and they started crying again. When it was time to go to bed, our old man stood up, extended his hand to them, and said:",25.504,25.103,"When he left, the new judge said he was going to turn him into another man. So he took him to his house, gave him good and clean clothes, and invited him to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner with the family, and he behaved like a brother to him, so to speak. And after dinner, he talked to him about temperance and things like that until the old man started to cry and said he had been an idiot and had wasted his life on foolishness, but now he was going to change completely and be a man that no one would be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge would help him and not despise him. The judge said that made him want to hug him, and even he and his wife started to cry; father said he had been a man whom no one had understood until then, and the judge said he believed it. The old man said that what a fallen man needed was solidarity, and the judge said that was true; so they started crying again. And when it was time to go to bed, the old man got up, extended his hand, and said:",40.225,39.941

You mark them words—don’t forget I said them. It’s a clean hand now; shake it—don’t be afeard.”","- Here, ladies and gentlemen, look at me. Please take my hand and let me shake hands with you. This is a hand that used to be like a pig's hoof; but now it is not anymore; this is the hand of a person who has started to step into a new life. If I ever go back to the old ways, I would rather die. Ladies and gentlemen, please remember these words well, and do not forget that it was I who said them. Now this is a clean hand, so please shake hands without fear.",8.886,7.107,"“Take a good look at this hand, gentlemen and ladies. Hold this hand. Squeeze this hand.

130,"So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried. The judge’s wife she kissed it. Then the old man he signed a pledge—made his mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was the spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up. And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it.","One by one, people came to shake hands, and then everyone cried. The judge's wife even bent down to kiss that hand. Then my father made a solemn vow. The judge said that it was truly the most sacred moment, or almost so. Then they took my father to a splendid room, which was a private room. At night, when my father was extremely thirsty, he climbed over the gate roof, clung to a column, slid down to the ground, took the coat they had just given him to exchange for a bottle of liquor, then climbed back to the room and drank to his heart's content until dawn, when he crawled out, drunk, crashing into the gate so hard that his left hand got injured in several places. In the morning, when someone found him, he was nearly frozen to death. When everyone entered that private room, they saw that the furniture was all in disarray.",8.622,7.495,"Thus, crying, he shook hands with each one of them. The judge's wife even took his hand and kissed it. Then our old man had a contract written up and signed it. The judge said something about it being the most sacred moment up to that day. They placed our father in a very nice room where no one else stayed. After everyone went to bed, he couldn't stand the thirst, climbed out the window onto the veranda roof, slid down a support beam, and sold his jacket for a bottle of the hardest liquor. Then he climbed back into the room and had a grand old time. In the early morning, unable to see an inch in front of him, he climbed out the window again, rolled off the veranda roof, fell, and broke his left arm in two places. When someone found him after the sun had risen, he was on the verge of freezing to death. When they went up to the room where he had been sleeping, they struggled to make sense of the damage he had caused.",12.552,11.892,"So everyone shook his hand, one after another, and cried. The judge's wife kissed it. Then the old man signed a promise: he made his mark. The judge said it was the most sacred moment he could remember, or something like that. Then they made the old man lie down in a very nice room, which was the guest room, and that same night, a while later, he got very thirsty and climbed down the porch roof, down one of the columns, and traded his new jacket for a jug of rat poison whiskey and went back to the room and had a great time, and towards dawn he went out again, drunk as a skunk, and rolled down the porch roof and broke his left arm in two places, and had almost frozen to death when someone found him after the sun came up. And when they went in to see what was in that guest room, they had to find a pilot to show them the way.",33.32,32.925
131,"The judge he felt kind of sore. He said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn’t know no other way.","The chief judge was very sad. He said that perhaps only a gunshot could help my father change his ways, as there was no other way.",15.114,11.613,"The judge was furious. He said that our old man could only be reformed at gunpoint, that no other way was possible.",12.179,9.193,"The judge felt a bit bitter.

133,"Well, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he went for me, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him or outrun him most of the time. I didn’t want to go to school much before, but I reckoned I’d go now to spite pap. That law trial was a slow business—appeared like they warn’t ever going to get started on it; so every now and then I’d borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was just suited—this kind of thing was right in his line.","Then, right after that, my father got up again, walked around, went to Mr. Thatcher's house to make him return the money, and then came to me asking why I hadn't quit school yet. He held onto me for a long time and beat me. But I still kept going to school as usual. All day long, I had to avoid him and run away. Before, I didn't really want to go to school, but now I thought I had to go to school to show my father. The legal proceedings were so slow. It seemed like they hadn't even started yet. Occasionally, I had to borrow a few dollars from Mr. Thatcher to give to my father to avoid being beaten. Every time he had money, he would get drunk, and every time he got drunk, he would cause trouble in town, and every time he caused trouble, he would end up in jail. It became a habit, a routine.",13.193,12.493,"Before long, our father recovered and started wandering around. He filed a lawsuit against Judge Thatcher to get the money, and because I didn't stop going to school, he started chasing after me. He caught me a few times and beat me terribly, but I continued going to school and mostly either stayed out of his sight or lost him by running faster. Actually, I didn't really want to go to school before, but I guess I started going just to spite my father. The court was progressing quite slowly, and as far as I could tell, it hadn't even started yet. So, to avoid getting beaten by my father, I occasionally borrowed two or three dollars from the judge for him. As soon as he got his hands on some money, he would drink like a fish, and every time he drank, he would cause a commotion in the town. Naturally, they would throw him in jail every time. He was living a life that suited him perfectly; this behavior was just his style.",12.855,12.125,"WELL, the old man soon recovered and then he got involved with Judge Thatcher in the courts to force him to give him that money, and then with me for not stopping going to school. He grabbed me a couple of times and thrashed me, but anyway I kept going to school and most of the time I either hid from him or outran him. Before, I didn't have much desire to go to school. But now I thought I would go just to spite my father. The lawsuit was going very slowly: it seemed like it was never going to start; so from time to time I borrowed two or three dollars from the judge to give to him and avoid a beating. Every time he had money he got drunk, and every time he got drunk he caused a commotion in town, and every time he caused a commotion they put him in jail. And he was so happy: that kind of life was what he liked.",27.413,26.917
134,"He got to hanging around the widow’s too much and so she told him at last that if he didn’t quit using around there she would make trouble for him. Well, wasn’t he mad? He said he would show who was Huck Finn’s boss. So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn’t no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn’t find it if you didn’t know where it was.","My father kept hanging around the widow, and the widow said if he didn't go find food somewhere else, she would make trouble for him. Well, I don't know if he's crazy or not; he even said he would show everyone who has the right to know who has authority over Huck Finn. Then one spring day, he somehow caught me, took me down to a boat, and went upriver about three miles; then rowed up to the Illinois shore, in a place with dense trees, where there wasn't a single house except an old cabin hidden by thick foliage, and anyone who didn't know the place wouldn't be able to find it.",17.061,16.211,"He started hanging around the widow a lot. Finally, the widow told him that if he showed up again, he would be in big trouble. Upon hearing this, he went completely mad. He said he would show him who Huck Finn's boss was. One day in spring, he set a trap by the creek and caught me, put me in a boat, and took me about three miles up the river. From there, he took me across to the Illinois side of the river. This side was forested and had nothing but an old wooden cabin. The trees were so dense that it was impossible to find the cabin without knowing its exact location.",13.335,12.099,"He started spending too much time hanging around the widow's house, so she finally told him that if he didn't stop hanging around there, he was going to get into some trouble. Man, did he get mad. He said he was going to show who was in charge of Huck Finn. So one day he waited for me at the spring, grabbed me, and took me three miles upriver in a boat and crossed over to the Illinois side, where there were forests and no houses except for an old log cabin in a place with so many trees that you couldn't find it unless you already knew the way.",18.416,17.275
135,"He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off. We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights. He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every little while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found out where I was by-and-by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn’t long after that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it—all but the cowhide part.","Day and night, he kept me close by his side, I had no way to escape to go to school. So the two of them lived in that hut. My father locked the door all day; at night he kept the key at the head of his bed. He had a gun that I guessed he had stolen from somewhere. The two of them went fishing and hunting, living like that day after day. Occasionally, he would lock the door, trapping me inside, then go down to a store three miles away, at the ferry to trade birds and fish for whiskey, come back drunk at night, and beat me. Later, the widow found out where I was, and sent someone to spy and take me back. But my father chased them away with his gun.

I liked everything except for the beatings.",12.032,11.275,"Since he never let me out of his sight, I never had a chance to escape even once. We were living in that old cabin, and at night he always locked the door and put the key under his pillow. Somehow, he had managed to steal a rifle. We were getting by through hunting and fishing there. From time to time, he would lock me inside, jump into the boat, and go to a store three miles down to trade the fish he caught or the animals he hunted for whiskey. When he came back home, he would drink and get drunk, then beat me. The widow eventually found out where I was and sent a man to bring me back, but my father chased him away with a gun.

136,"It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and fishing, and no books nor study. Two months or more run along, and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn’t see how I’d ever got to like it so well at the widow’s, where you had to wash, and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time. I didn’t want to go back no more. I had stopped cussing, because the widow didn’t like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn’t no objections. It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it all around.","It was a kind of laziness that was quite pleasant. All day long, just relaxing, smoking, fishing, no books and no studying at all. About two months later, my clothes were dirty and tattered. I didn't think that when I was living with the widow, I ever liked it as much as this. Because there, I had to wash clothes. I had to eat with bowls and plates, comb my hair, go to bed and get up on time, always worry about books and notebooks, and listen to Miss Watson's nagging all day long. I didn't feel like going back to that place anymore. Before, I had stopped using bad language because the widow didn't like it. But now, I started again because my father didn't forbid it at all. Living in the forest was truly enjoyable, everywhere was just as delightful.",10.475,9.426,"Spending the whole day smoking tobacco and fishing, lying around without studying at all, both made a person lazy and brought them joy.

137,"But by-and-by pap got too handy with his hick’ry, and I couldn’t stand it. I was all over welts. He got to going away so much, too, and locking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was dreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn’t ever going to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn’t find no way. There warn’t a window to it big enough for a dog to get through. I couldn’t get up the chimbly; it was too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time. But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out—big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap’s gun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.","But gradually, when my father became too familiar with this forest, I began to feel that I couldn't stand it anymore. I kept getting beaten all the time. He often went far away and locked me in the house. Once, he locked the door and kept me inside for three whole days. I felt terribly lonely. I thought that if he drowned somewhere, I would be stuck here, unable to get out. I was so scared and thought to myself that I definitely had to find a way to escape. I had tried several times but failed. There wasn't a single window big enough for a dog to squeeze through. The chimney was also too narrow to crawl through. The door was thick, made entirely of very sturdy ebony planks. My father was careful not to leave a knife or any other object in the house whenever he went away. I figured I had searched the house hundreds of times, always thinking of ways to escape, and spent all my time on that, but it was still to no avail. But this time, I found something. I found an old, rusty saw blade without a handle, wedged under the roof crevice. I cleaned it and started working. There was a piece of felt used to pad the saddle, nailed to the crumbling part of the wall in the corner of the house, right behind the table, to block the wind from blowing through the gaps and extinguishing the lamp. I crawled under the table, lifted the piece of felt, and sawed a hole just big enough for me to squeeze through. It was quite a time-consuming task, but I tried my best to see it through. In the midst of it, I heard my father's gunshot in the forest. I erased all traces, let the felt fall back down, and hid the saw. Just as I finished, my father stepped in.",17.097,16.745,"But after a while, my father increased the beatings so much that I couldn't bear it anymore.

I thought he had drowned somewhere and that I would never be able to get out. I was very scared. I decided to find a way to escape from there. Previously, I had tried very hard to get out of the cabin but couldn't find a way. The windows were so small that even a dog couldn't fit through. I tried the chimney, but it was too narrow as well. The door was made of thick oak planks. My father was careful not to leave any knives or such in the house when he was outside. I searched every corner of the cabin maybe a hundred times. In fact, I had no other job than to explore the surroundings, because it was the only way to pass the time. But this time, I finally managed to find something. It was a rusty, handleless saw wedged between the roof beam and the ceiling planks. I oiled the saw and started working. There was an old horse blanket nailed to the wood behind the table at the back of the cabin to prevent the wind from blowing out the candle through the cracks in the wall. I crawled under the table, lifted the edge of the blanket, and started working to cut the lowest log to create a hole big enough for me to pass through. This took quite a long time, but I was about to finish when I heard my father's gunshot in the forest. I immediately cleaned up the sawdust around, hung the blanket back in place, and hid my saw. Soon after, my father appeared at the door.",18.298,17.92,"But little by little, father started to get too fond of beating me, and I couldn't take it anymore. I was covered in bruises.

There was a horse blanket nailed to the logs at one end of the cabin, behind the table, so the wind wouldn't come through the cracks and blow out the candle. I got under the table, lifted the blanket, and started sawing a section of the big log below, big enough for me to fit through.

138,"Pap warn’t in a good humor—so he was his natural self. He said he was down town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there’d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This shook me up considerable, because I didn’t want to go back to the widow’s any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn’t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn’t know the names of, and so called them what’s-his-name when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing.","He didn't seem very happy at that moment. Besides, it had always been like that. He said he had just returned from the province, and the work was a complete mess. The lawyer told my father that he would win the lawsuit and get money if they brought the matter to trial. But then they found ways to prolong the matter, and old Judge Thatcher was very skilled at this sort of thing. Then he said that people outside the province were hoping for another trial to get me away from my father and bring me back to the widow so she could take care of me, and they believed that this time they would definitely succeed. That made me very confused, because I didn't want to go back to the widow to be bound and civilized as I used to say. After that, my father started cursing, cursing everything and everyone. He cursed anyone he thought of. He cursed and cursed to show that he wouldn't spare anyone, and after he had cursed everyone, he made a summary curse, including a lot of people whose names he didn't even know. That meant those people whom he had to refer to as ""that guy... what's his name"" whenever he cursed them. After getting tired of cursing, he started cursing from the beginning again.",12.353,11.808,"His mood wasn't very good – in other words, it was as usual.

Also, another case had been filed to take me from my father and appoint the widow as my legal guardian to place me in her care, and it seemed like they were going to win this time. I felt uneasy when I heard this because I no longer wanted to go to the widow's house, be restricted, and ""become a man."" Our old man started cursing, he cursed everything and everyone that came to his mind, then to make sure he didn't miss anyone, he cursed them all again, and finally, he gave a thorough cursing to everything in general as a final touch. When it came to some of the last things he cursed, he didn't even know their names, so he would say ""whatever its name is"" and then continue.",11.288,10.547,"Father was not in a good mood, which is to say, he was as usual.

He said that according to people, there was going to be another trial to separate me from him and make the widow my guardian, and they estimated that this time she would win. That made me very nervous, because I no longer wanted to go back to the widow’s house and to so much discipline and civilization, as they called it. Then the old man started cursing everything and everyone he could think of, and then cursed them again to make sure he hadn't forgotten anyone, and ended with a sort of general curse against everyone, even a bunch of people whose names he didn’t know, so when he got to them he would say whatever their name is, and kept on cursing.",27.668,27.258

He hopped around the cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But it warn’t good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body’s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous.

I could hear him through the blanket.","Then he knelt on all fours, crawling and bowing to be forgiven, then curled himself up in a blanket, then when he got close to the old table made from a pine stump; his mouth kept begging, begging until he was tired, then he cried.

149,"By-and-by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he see me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me, and then I couldn’t come for him no more. I begged, and told him I was only Huck; but he laughed such a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.","Then a little later, he threw off the blanket and stood up straight. His face looked even more ferocious, staring intently at me and stepping closer. He chased me around the house, holding a pocket knife, calling me the Grim Reaper, and saying he would kill me. So I couldn't get close to him. I begged, telling him that I was just Huck. But he let out a terrifying laugh, roared curses back, and kept chasing me. I ran, then suddenly turned around and slipped under his arm, somehow he managed to grab the back of my shirt. I thought to myself that I was done for. But as quick as lightning, I slipped out of my shirt and escaped. After a while, he got so tired that he collapsed, leaning against the door, and said he would rest for a minute before killing me. He tucked the knife into his waistband, saying he would take a nap to regain strength and then show me what he could do.",19.173,18.621,"After a while, he came out from under the table, sprang to his feet in a frenzy, saw me, and immediately walked towards me.

I begged him, told him that I was just poor Huck; but he let out a terrible, shrill laugh, continued to chase me, roaring and cursing. Once, when I suddenly turned and tried to slip under his arm, he grabbed me by the collar of my jacket. I thought I was done for, but then I slipped out of the jacket like lightning and saved myself. Soon after, he became exhausted again, leaned against the door to catch his breath, and said that after resting there for a while, he would kill me.

I begged him; I told him I was just Huck, but he laughed with a screeching laugh and didn't stop roaring, cursing, and chasing me. Once, when I stopped suddenly and was about to dodge under his arm, he grabbed me by the jacket between the shoulders, and I thought that was the end of me, but I quickly slipped out of the jacket like lightning and saved myself.

150,"So he dozed off pretty soon. By-and-by I got the old split-bottom chair and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the gun. I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down behind it to wait for him to stir. And how slow and still the time did drag along.","Then he nodded off to sleep. A moment later, I slipped under the seat, quietly crawled up, without making a sound, and took down the gun. I pulled out the magazine to check if it was loaded, then placed the gun on the crate of radishes, aiming it directly at my father. Then I sat there quietly, waiting to see if he would move. At that moment, time seemed to pass so slowly and silently.",12.71,11.416,"He soon fell completely asleep. I quietly and slowly pulled the old chair with the broken seat as best as I could, climbed on it, and took the rifle down from the wall.

Time was passing so slowly, and it was so quiet around.",12.087,10.426,"So he fell asleep very quickly. Then I took out the old chair that had the broken seat and climbed onto it very calmly, so as not to make any noise, and took down the shotgun.

I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at the town. The June rise used to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts—sometimes a dozen logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood-yards and the sawmill.","My father unlocked the door, and I dashed out to the riverbank. Seeing a few floating branches and scattered pieces of bark, I knew the water had started to rise. I thought to myself that if I were in the city right now, I would be playing and having fun.

161,"I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t’other one out for what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck. I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just expected there’d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they’d raise up and laugh at him. But it warn’t so this time. It was a drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this—she’s worth ten dollars. But when I got to shore pap wasn’t in sight yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: I judged I’d hide her good, and then, ’stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I’d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot.","I followed along the riverbank, heading upstream, keeping an eye on my father while also looking to see if the rising water might bring anything useful. Suddenly, a boat drifted by, a very beautiful boat, about three or four meters long, with its bow raised like a duck's beak. From the riverbank, I dove in headfirst like a frog, fully clothed, towards the boat. I guessed that there must be someone lying inside the boat, because it was common for people to lie inside and then pop their heads out to laugh at you. But this time, there was no one. It was surely an abandoned drifting boat. I climbed in and used my feet to paddle the boat towards the shore. I thought to myself that my father would be very pleased to see it - the boat was worth ten dollars - but when I reached the shore, he was still nowhere to be seen. I pushed the boat into a small inlet, overgrown with small leaves and willows, and suddenly had another idea. I planned to hide the boat well, so instead of running into the forest, I could drift down the river about fifty miles and anchor somewhere, saving time and avoiding the effort of running on foot.",8.388,7.589,"While looking to see if my father was coming and also investigating what the flood was bringing, I walked up the shore. Before long, I saw a canoe. It was very beautiful, about four meters long, and gliding like a duck. Without even taking off my clothes, I immediately dived headfirst into the water like a frog and swam towards the canoe. I thought someone was lying in it waiting, because people often do this as a joke. When someone gets close enough with a boat, they suddenly sit up and laugh at their reaction. But this time, it wasn't like that. It was clear that it was an abandoned canoe. I got into the canoe and brought it to the shore. I thought our old man would be happy to see the canoe – it was worth almost ten dollars. But when I reached the shore, my father was still nowhere to be seen. As I was pulling the canoe into a small creek mouth covered with ivy and willows, another idea came to my mind. I would hide the canoe well, and instead of escaping through the forest, I would go down the river about fifty miles and set up camp somewhere. That way, my feet wouldn't get sore from walking.",14.003,13.48,"I climbed up the shore with one eye on father and the other on what the rising water might bring.

I imagined there might be someone inside, because that's what some people do to trick others, and when someone is about to pull a boat to shore, they stand up and start laughing. But not this time. It was a canoe truly drifting, and I got into it and took it to the shore. I thought the old man would be happy when he saw it: it would be worth ten dollars. But when I reached the shore, father was still not in sight, and as I was taking it into a half-hidden stream, all covered with willows and vines, another idea occurred to me: I thought of hiding it well and then, instead of going into the woods when I escaped, I would go down the river about fifty miles and camp in a place forever, without the trouble of wandering around on foot.",22.769,22.368

Then we went to have lunch. If it had been anyone else but my father, they would have waited there all day to see if they could pick up anything else, but my father was not like that. Those nine pieces of the raft were enough for one meal, as he could take them to town and sell them. So he locked the door, locked me in, and went out to take the small boat to tow the raft pieces.

So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up at that place and didn’t quite touch ground. If you stood four or five foot away and didn’t know it was sawed, you wouldn’t never notice it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn’t likely anybody would go fooling around there.","Because I had to crawl through the hole to get out and move a lot of furniture through it, the ground in that spot was dug up quite a bit.

I wedged two pebbles underneath and one on top to hold the plank firmly in place, and that spot sloped down without touching the ground. If someone stood four or five steps away, they wouldn't be able to see the sawed spot and wouldn't know about it; besides, this was the back of the house, and probably no one would bother to go around there anyway.",16.924,16.046,"By going in and out of the shed and carrying a lot of things, I had made quite a few tracks on the ground. So, I carefully erased my tracks from the outside and cleaned up the sawdust. Then I placed the piece of plank firmly in its place, putting two stones underneath and one in front to keep it steady – because it didn't fit perfectly and didn't touch the ground. But I had placed it so well that someone standing a meter or two away, who didn't know it had been cut, wouldn't even notice it, plus this was at the back of the cabin where hardly anyone would come.",13.595,12.514,"I had left all the ground packed down with the exit of the hole and with the transport of so many things. So I fixed it as best as I could, throwing dirt on top, which disguised the packed part and the sawdust that had fallen. Then I put the piece of log back in its place and put two stones underneath it and another one on the side so it wouldn't fall, because that part was irregular and didn't quite touch the ground. If one stayed four or five feet away, without knowing it was sawed, it couldn't be seen, and besides, that was the back of the cabin and it wasn't likely that anyone would look around there.",25.193,24.413
170,"It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn’t left a track. I followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the river. All safe. So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.","From here to the hiding place, it's all grass, so there are no traces left behind. I walked around once to check again. I stood on the riverbank looking out into the distance. Everything was safe. Then I took the gun and walked a distance into the forest. Usually, when domestic pigs escape from the pen, they easily turn into wild boars. I immediately shot this pig and dragged it back home.",14.156,12.816,"The road up to Kanoya was covered with grass, so I hadn't left any tracks there. To be sure, I went back and forth once to check. Then I went to the shore and watched the river. Everything was fine. I took the rifle and went into the forest, looking for a bird to hunt. Instead, I encountered a wild boar. Pigs that escaped from large farms would become feral after staying in the forest for a while. I shot the boar and took it to the hut.",7.845,6.179,"Until reaching the canoe, there was nothing but grass, so no tracks were left. I took a walk around to be sure. I stayed on the riverbank and looked upstream and downstream. There was no danger. So I grabbed the shotgun and went a little into the forest. I was looking for birds to hunt when I saw a wild pig; the pigs would quickly go wild around that area when they escaped from the prairie farms. I shot this one and took it to the camp.",19.622,18.413
171,"I took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it considerable a-doing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground—hard packed, and no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it—all I could drag—and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that.","I took the axe and struck the door with a strong blow. It took a lot of hitting, quite a long time to break the door. I dragged the pig inside, pulled it near the table, then struck the pig's neck with an axe, leaving it on the ground for a while to let the blood flow out. I say ground because it was real ground, just compacted earth, not wood flooring, then I grabbed an old bag, filled it with large pebbles, heavy enough for me to drag, then from the pig's location, I dragged the bag of pebbles to the door, through the woods to the riverbank, and threw it down there. The bag of pebbles sank, disappearing completely. Anyone could see that something had been dragged along the ground. I wished Tom Sawyer were here at this moment because I knew he would love this kind of thing and would add more details to make it even more thrilling. For such stories, no one could boast more than Tom Sawyer.",16.034,15.433,"I took the axe and broke the door – I had hit it with all my strength and shattered the planks. I took the pig inside and brought it to a spot near the table, then cut its throat with the axe. I left it on the ground so the blood could drain – I say ground because there was no flooring, no planks laid, just the compacted earth beneath. Then I took an old sack and filled it with large stones – just enough that I could still drag it. I dragged the sack from where the pig was, through the door, down to the riverbank among the trees, and left it in the water there. It immediately sank and disappeared from sight. It was clear that something had been dragged on the ground. I wish Tom Sawyer had been with me... I knew very well how keen you were on such schemes, if he saw it now, who knows what cunning ideas would come to his mind. I've never seen anyone in my life whose mind worked as sharply as Tom Sawyer's in such matters.",15.832,15.244,"I grabbed the axe and jumped over the door. I smashed it as much as I could. I brought the pig inside and dragged it almost to the table, then I cut its throat with the axe and left it on the ground to bleed; I say on the ground because it was dirt: compacted and without floorboards. Then I took an old sack and filled it with large stones —all that I could drag—, starting where the pig was, and dragged it to the door and through the woods to the river, where I threw it; it sank and disappeared. It was easy to see that something had been dragged across the ground. I thought that I wished Tom Sawyer had been there; I knew he was interested in these things and that he would add the precise details. Nobody knew how to embellish things like Tom Sawyer in a matter like this.",28.22,27.753
172,"Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn’t drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn’t no knives and forks on the place—pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking. Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes—and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away, I don’t know where, but it didn’t go to the river. The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I dropped pap’s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn’t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.","Then I pulled out some hairs, smeared blood all over the axe blade, stuck some hairs onto the axe, and threw it in the corner of the house. I picked up the pig, held it against my chest, covered it with my shirt (so that the blood wouldn't drip), and carried it to a spot behind the house to throw it into the river. At that moment, I thought of something else. I went to the boat to get a bag of flour and a saw and brought them into the house. I put the bag of flour back in its original place, used the saw to poke a hole at the bottom of the bag, because there wasn't a pocket knife around to do everything. Then I carried the bag of flour about a hundred yards past the grass field, through the willow bushes to the east of the cabin, to a shallow but wide hole about five miles long, filled with reeds that in season would also be full of ducks. There was a small stream leading to the far side of the lake, several miles away. I didn't know exactly where it went, but I was sure it didn't run into the river. The flour fell through the hole in the bag, leaving a long trail from the house to the lake. I also threw my father's whetstone there, to make it look accidental. Then I tied a string around the hole in the flour bag to stop it from spilling out. Then I took the bag of flour and the saw back to the boat.",19.196,18.789,"Then I pulled out a few strands of my hair, covered the axe thoroughly with blood, stuck the hair onto it, and threw the axe into a corner. Then I took the pig, wrapped it in my jacket (so the blood wouldn't drip on the ground), and pressed it against my chest. Finally, after walking downstream and getting quite far from the house, I threw the blood-stained jacket and the pig into the river. Then another idea came to mind. I took the sack of flour and the old saw from the canoe and brought them back to the house. After placing the sack in its usual spot, I made a hole in the bottom with the saw – since my father handled everything with his switchblade, there were no knives or forks in the house for cooking. I carried the sack about a hundred meters through the willows east of the house to a shallow lake that was five miles wide and covered with reeds – there were also many ducks in season. On the other side of the lake, there was a pond or stream that went on for miles. I didn't know exactly where it went, but it definitely didn't flow into the river. The flour spilling from the sack left a thin trail all the way to the lake. On the shore, I also threw down my father's whetstone; it would look like it had fallen accidentally. Then I tied the bottom of the flour sack tightly with a rope, and once I was sure it wasn't spilling anymore, I took it back to the canoe along with the saw.",24.657,24.332,"Well, the last thing I did was pull out some of my hair, stain the axe with blood, and leave it in the back, thrown in a corner. Then I grabbed the pig and covered it against my chest with the jacket (so it wouldn't drip) until I got far away from the house, and I threw it into the river. Then I thought of something else. So I went to take the sack of flour and the old saw from the canoe and brought them to the house. I left the sack where it usually was and made a hole in the bottom with the saw, because there were no knives or forks there: father cooked everything with the pocket knife. Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards through the grass, among the willows, to the east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five miles wide and full of reeds and also ducks when it was the season. There was a stream or a brook that came out from there on the other side and ran for miles and miles, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river. The flour kept moving and leaving a small trail all the way to the lake. There I also threw father's sharpening stone, to make it look like something accidental. Then I closed the hole in the sack of flour with a string so that no more would fall out and took it back with the saw to the canoe.",32.871,32.604
173,"It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by-and-by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself, they’ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me. And they’ll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things. They won’t ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They’ll soon get tired of that, and won’t bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson’s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson’s Island’s the place.","At this time, the sky was nearly dark. I pushed the boat downwards, to the spot where the willow trees on the shore drooped down, and I sat there waiting for the moon to rise. I tied the boat to the base of the willow, took out a piece of bread to eat, and after eating, I lay back in the boat, smoked a cigarette to think of a new plan. I told myself that they would surely follow the trail of the gravel bag to the riverbank and then along the shore to find me. Then they would follow the flour trail to the hole, and follow the stream to somewhere to find the robbers who had killed me and taken my belongings. They would scour the river with the sole task of finding my body. They will get tired of searching and won't bother thinking about me anymore. Great, I can stop wherever I want. Jackson Island is a place where I can take refuge. I know that island very well, no one ever goes there. Then at night, I can paddle up to the top, wander around, and steal whatever I need.",13.462,12.808,"It was about to get dark. I lowered the canoe a bit further down and went under the willows hanging over the water, and began to wait for the moon to rise. I tied the canoe to a willow trunk. Then I ate something and soon lay inside the canoe, smoking my pipe and starting to think about my plan. They would follow the stone sack to the shore and then search the river for my body. Additionally, they would follow the flour trail to the lake, and from there, they would search along the creek to find the robbers who killed me and took my belongings. They would find a lot of things in the river besides my dead body. Eventually, they would get tired and give up searching. It was all set, I could go wherever I wanted. Jackson Island was just right for me. I knew the island well and no one ever went there. At night, I could row down to the town and sneak around to take whatever I needed. Jackson Island was perfectly fine.",15.144,14.48,"It was almost dark, so I left the canoe downstream covered by some willows that hung over the bank and waited for the moon to come out. I tied the canoe to a willow; then I ate something and after a while, I lay down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and make a plan. And I go and tell myself: ""They are going to follow the trail of that sack of stones to the shore and then they will drag the river to look for me. They will follow the flour trail to the lake, search the stream that comes out of it to find the thieves who killed me and took my things. They are only going to search the river for my corpse. Then they will soon get tired and won't worry about me anymore. Very well, I can stay wherever I please. Jackson's Island is enough for me; I know it very well and no one ever comes here. And then I can go to town at night, look around and take what I need. Jackson's Island is fine.""",29.053,28.634
174,"I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When I woke up I didn’t know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked around, a little scared. Then I remembered.

I couldn't count all the pieces of wood drifting, black and silent, a few hundred meters from the shore. Everything was as silent as death. It seemed very late at night, I could sense it was very late. I'm sure you understand what I mean - I can't find the right words to say it properly.",23.053,22.298,"As I was quite tired, I fell asleep while thinking about these things. When I woke up, I couldn't remember where I was for a moment. I sat up and looked around with some anxiety. Then I remembered everything. The river seemed to be miles wide.

175,"I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it’s a still night. I peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was—a skiff, away across the water. I couldn’t tell how many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn’t but one man in it. Think’s I, maybe it’s pap, though I warn’t expecting him. He dropped below me with the current, and by-and-by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him. Well, it was pap, sure enough—and sober, too, by the way he laid his oars.","I let out a long yawn and stretched. Just as I was about to take off my shirt and start on my way, I suddenly heard a distant sound on the water. I listened carefully and immediately recognized the creaking sound of oars grinding against the rowlocks in the stillness of the night. I poked my head out from the willow bushes and saw a boat gliding on the river. It was impossible to tell how many people were on the boat. Only when it came closer did I see that there was only one person on the boat. I guessed it might be my father, although deep down I thought he couldn't be back yet. The boat continued to drift with the current, past my hiding spot, and then after a while, it docked at the shore where the water was still. It came so close that I almost reached for my gun and aimed at him. Oh, it was indeed my father - and he wasn't drunk either, judging by the way he handled the oars.",10.913,10.063,"I stretched and yawned widely, and just as I was about to untie the rope and set off, I heard a sound coming from afar over the water.

When I looked through the willow branches, I saw it – there was a boat in the distance. I couldn't see how many people were inside. It was coming towards me, and when it got closer, I saw that there was only one person inside. I wasn't expecting anyone that night, but maybe it was my father. As the boat passed by me, it rippled the water, and soon after the water calmed, it continued rowing towards the shore. It had passed so close to me that I could have touched it with my rifle if I had extended it. This was definitely my father – and judging by his rowing, he was completely sober.",12.579,11.822,"I yawned and stretched comfortably, and I was about to untie to set off when I heard a noise in the water. I listened. Immediately I understood what it was. It was that rhythmic and muffled noise that oars make in the oarlocks in the silence of the night. I looked through the branches of the willows and there it was: a boat on the river. I couldn't see how many people it carried. It kept getting closer, and when it reached in front of me it only had one man. And I go and think: ""Maybe it's father,"" even though I wasn't expecting him. It went downstream with the current and after a while it reached the shore, where the water was calm, and passed so close that I could have touched it by extending the shotgun. Well, it was indeed father, and moreover calm, by the way he left the oars.",18.748,18.078

I heard people talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too—every word of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now. T’other one said this warn’t one of the short ones, he reckoned—and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn’t laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said let him alone.

Someone said that now the days are long and the nights are short. Another person said this was not yet one of the short nights; and both laughed. Then they woke up another person to laugh again, but the other person didn't laugh and uttered a vulgar phrase to let him sleep in peace. The first person said to stop and take that to tell his old wife - she would listen. Then he said that it was nothing compared to what he had said before. I heard someone else say that it was already almost three in the morning; wishing not to have to wait more than a week for it to be morning.

I could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little breeze up there.

I could see the sun through a few small holes, but the top was mostly covered by large tree branches, and the part underneath was a bit dim.

I rouses up, and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped up, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up—about abreast the ferry. And there was the ferry-boat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the matter now. “Boom!” I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferry-boat’s side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to the top.","I feel so comfortable and steady here that I become lazy and don't want to get up to cook a meal. But then, as I close my eyes to sleep again, I suddenly hear a boom outside by the river. I prop myself up on my elbows, listening intently. After a while, I hear another sound. I stand up and step out, looking outside through a gap in the bushes. A cloud of smoke spreads over the water, drifting farther away—perhaps all the way to the ferry dock. Then a boat full of people is coming down this way. Now I know what is happening. Boom! A puff of white smoke comes out from the boat. They are firing cannons into the river to make my body float to the surface.",10.799,9.704,"A great sense of ease and laziness had settled over me; I didn't even feel like getting up to prepare breakfast.

I quickly jumped to my feet and went to look around through a gap in the branches and leaves. High above, a small puff of smoke was rising over the water – it was level with the dock. There was the steamboat, coming down filled with people. Now I understood what was going on. ""Boom!"" I saw another white cloud of smoke emerge from the side of the steamboat.

I jumped up and went to look through a gap between the leaves, and I see a lot of smoke above the water, very far upriver: approximately in front of the ferry. And there was the ferry, full of people, floating down. Then I understood what was happening. ""Boom!"" I saw the white smoke coming out of the side of the ferry.

185,"I was pretty hungry, but it warn’t going to do for me to start a fire, because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning—so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I’ll keep a lookout, and if any of them’s floating around after me I’ll give them a show. I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have, and I warn’t disappointed. A big double loaf come along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out further. Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the shore—I knowed enough for that. But by-and-by along comes another one, and this time I won. I took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was “baker’s bread”—what the quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.","I was hungry, but I couldn't start a fire at that moment because they might see the smoke. So I had to sit there watching the cannon smoke and listening to the explosions. The river was wide and even more beautiful here. If there was anything to be curious about, I would sit there for a long time to see how they would search for my dead body. I wondered why people would put mercury into loaves of bread and let them float down the river, and then those loaves would stop exactly where there was a drowned body. I told myself to stay calm and see what happens; if I didn't see those loaves floating by to find me, I would reveal myself. I walked around the island to the Illinois shore to see if there was anything there. And I wasn't too disappointed. A large loaf of bread floated by. I used a long stick to pull it in, but I slipped, and the loaf floated away again. The spot where I was standing was where the current was closest to the shore, I knew that already. A while later, another loaf floated by, and this time I managed to catch it. I pried off the stopper, shook out the mercury, and then took a bite. Wow, it was a genuine piece of bread, very valuable, not like the miserable cornbread I had been eating before.",14.93,14.437,"I was very hungry, but I was hesitant to light a fire because they could see the smoke.

Then I remembered that they floated loaves of bread with mercury in them on the river. The loaf would always stop over the drowned body. I thought, I’ll watch to see if they’ll float a loaf after me, and if they do, I’ll find a way to get it. I went to the side of the island facing Illinois and tried my luck and wasn’t disappointed. A huge double loaf came, and with the help of a long stick, I almost caught it, but I slipped and the loaf drifted away. Of course, I was where the current was closest to the shore; I knew this very well. But a little later, another loaf came, and this time I won.

Well, then it occurred to me that they always put mercury in loaves of bread and let them float, because they usually go straight to where the drowned body is and stay there. So I said to myself, ""I'll keep an eye out, and if one of them floats by close to me, I'll give it a try."" I moved to the side of the island facing Illinois to see how lucky I would be, and it didn't go badly. A big loaf floated by and I almost grabbed it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and it kept floating.

Suddenly, I was startled; because at that moment I thought, what if the widow, or the schoolteacher, or someone had prayed for these pieces of bread to find me? If so, then there must be something in the bread. Meaning that when the widow's family or the schoolteacher prayed, it went into the bread? But I thought it probably wouldn't matter to me. And whatever it was, it would likely be something good for me anyway.",7.249,5.449,"I chose a good spot among the branches, sat on a log there, and enjoyed myself eating the bread and watching the steamboat.

I took a deep breath, then listened again; then took another breath. Seeing a fallen tree trunk, I thought there was someone.

I didn't linger to scout the surroundings, I cocked the rifle and tiptoed back as quickly as possible. From time to time, I would stop among the dense branches and listen around, but I was breathing so loudly from excitement that I couldn't hear anything else. After walking a bit, I stopped again to listen to the surroundings, then again, and again.

I didn't wait to keep looking further; instead, I assembled the shotgun and tiptoed as fast as I could in silence. From time to time, I would stop for a moment among the leaves and listen, but I was breathing so hard that I couldn't hear anything else. I kept moving forward a bit and listened again, and so on, over and over. If I saw a stump, I thought it was a man; if I stepped on a twig and broke it, I felt as if someone had cut my breath in two and I was left with only half, and the shorter half at that.",22.109,21.271

I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk, and says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people’s voices. I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn’t got far when I hear a man say:","It was already night by then. My stomach was growling with hunger. Waiting until it was completely dark, I slipped out from the shore, before the moon rose, and pushed the boat towards the Illinois shore, about half a mile away.

203,"So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day. I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn’t no luck somehow; I couldn’t seem to find the place. But by-and-by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow. By-and-by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting gray daylight now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson’s Jim! I bet I was glad to see him. I says:","Then I pushed the boat away from the shore a bit, and just let it drift downstream. The moon was shining brightly. Except for the places with shadows, the moonlight illuminated everything as if it were daytime. I paddled the boat for about an hour; everything was silent and asleep like stones. This time, I had reached the other end of the island. A gentle, cool breeze began to blow. This meant that the night was almost over. I kicked the water with my foot, turned the boat around, and headed towards the edge of the forest. I sat down on a fallen tree trunk, looking through the leaves. The moon had disappeared, and darkness once again covered the river. But after a while, looking up through the treetops and seeing a faint light, I knew that dawn was approaching. I took my gun and quietly approached the spot where I had seen the campfire earlier. Every minute or two, I stopped to listen. But unfortunately, I couldn't find any sign of the fire. I slowly and carefully walked to that spot. When I arrived, I saw someone lying on the ground. I thought it was a ghost. The person lying there had wrapped a piece of blanket around their head and was resting right next to the fire. I stood silently behind the bushes, about a meter away from where that person was lying, and stared intently. The sky was getting light. A moment later, the person yawned, stretched, and threw off the blanket. Oh, it turned out to be Jim, the black man who worked for Miss Watson. I was really glad to see Jim here. I spoke up:",14.265,13.895,"So I took the paddle and moved a few steps away from the shore, then the canoe already got caught in the current and started moving through the shadows. The moon was shining and everywhere outside the shadows was lit up like daytime. I drifted for an hour, but everything was as still as a rock and in a state of complete sleep. Meanwhile, I had reached the far end of the island. A calm and cool breeze started to blow, indicating that the night was about to end. I used the paddle to turn the canoe and pressed its nose against the shore; then I got out of the canoe, took my rifle, and plunged into the forest. I sat on a log and looked at the sky through the leaves. I saw that the moon had finished its watch and the darkness was starting to cover the river like a blanket. But soon a pale line appearing at the tops of the trees indicated that the day was coming. So I took my rifle and quietly moved towards the place where I saw the campfire, stopping every two minutes to listen around. But my luck wasn't very good, I couldn't find the place where the fire was. Then, after a while, a fire burning among the trees caught my eye. I approached there very carefully and slowly. Finally, I got close enough to take a look and saw a man lying on the ground. I started trembling with fear. He had pulled the blanket over his head and his head was almost in the fire. I crouched behind the bushes about one and a half to two meters away and started watching him without taking my eyes off. The air had turned a bit gray and was gradually getting lighter. Soon the man yawned, stretched, and pulled off the blanket, it was Miss Watson's black slave Jim in front of me! I had never been so happy to see him. Jumping out from the bushes, I said, ""What's up, Jim!""",19.252,18.939,"So I grabbed the paddle and went down just one or two steps from the shore, and then let the canoe drift into the shadows on its own. The moon was shining, and where there was no shadow it was almost like daylight. I was searching for almost an hour, in a silence like a tomb, while everything slept. Well, by then I had almost reached the tip of the island. A gentle, rippling, and fresh breeze started to blow, which meant that the night was about to end. I gave a stroke of the paddle and brought the canoe to the shore; then I took out the shotgun and slipped to the edge of the forest. There I sat on a log, looking through the leaves. I saw that the moon was finishing its shift and that the river was starting to get dark. But after a while, I saw a pale strip above the trees and knew that day was coming. So I took out the shotgun and advanced to where I had found that campfire, stopping to listen every minute or two. But I don't know why I wasn't lucky; it was as if I couldn't find the place. But after a while, finally, I saw a remnant of the fire's glow among the trees. I went towards it, very carefully and calmly. Soon after, I was close enough to take a look, and there was a man lying on the ground. It almost gave me a fit. He had his head wrapped in a blanket, right next to the fire. I sat next to some bushes about six feet from him, staring at him. It was already starting to get light with the gray of dawn. Soon after, he yawned, stretched, and took off the blanket, and it was Jim, Miss Watson's Jim! Boy, was I glad to see him! I go and say:",25.575,25.309

As the sky grew darker, everything outside took on a beautiful bluish-purple hue. The rain poured down so heavily that even the tops of the tall trees became indistinct; they looked just like spider webs. Then, with each gust of wind, those trees were bent over and the pale gray color beneath the branches changed. Then another, even fiercer gust of wind came, forcing the branches to stretch out like the arms of wild animals. After that, when everything had turned completely blue and purple, suddenly - oh my; it brightened up, and during that storm, if you looked at the distant treetops, you could see them hundreds of meters farther away than before; then in just a second, it became pitch dark again; at that moment, you could hear the thunder roaring terrifyingly, followed by rumbling sounds gradually descending from above and traveling to the other side of the world, just like the sound of an empty barrel rolling down a long staircase, with the same rumbling noise.",9.028,8.232,"We threw a blanket inside as a carpet and ate our meal on it.

You know, it gets so dark that the outside turns into a strange navy blue, creating a magnificent scene, the rain pours down so heavily that even the trees a short distance away become blurry, as if hiding behind a spider web. Sometimes, with a strong gust, the trees bend and the light-colored undersides of the leaves are revealed. As the wind intensifies, all the tree branches sway wildly. Then everything is cloaked in the darkest navy blue, but with the sudden splitting of the sky, everything turns white. Far away, even hundreds of meters further than before, the tops of the trees can be seen flapping in the wind.

There was a glow like glory and the treetops swaying in the distance in the middle of the storm, hundreds of yards farther than what could be seen before; they turned black as sin in a second and then the thunder returned with a terrifying drumroll that continued growling, rolling, and staggering across the sky to the other side of the world, as if barrels were being rolled down stairs, you know, very long stairs where the barrels bounce a lot.",18.13,17.683

The water was three or four feet deep on the island in the low-lying areas and on the Illinois shore.

279,"Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. We went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles—they would slide off in the water.

In the deep forest, it was even darker, although it was still sunny outside. We maneuvered the boat between the tree trunks. In many places, grapevines hung down, obstructing the way, so we had to turn back and find another route. In places where fallen trees lay, there could be rabbits, snakes, and other animals. Whenever the island was flooded for a few days, those animals became very tame because they were too hungry. At that time, you could paddle the boat right up to them and catch them with your hand. But with snakes and turtles, it wasn't possible because they would dive to the bottom of the water. In one spot in the cave, we also had many of these creatures, and if we wanted to catch and raise them, we could get plenty.",6.12,4.918,"During the day, we would explore every part of the island by canoe. Despite the sun being bright and scorching, the depths of the forest were very cold and dark. We would weave in and out of the trees; sometimes the branches were so dense that we had to turn back and find another path. On every fallen rotten tree, you could see rabbits, snakes, and other animals; after the island had been submerged for a day or two, the animals had become tame from hunger, and if you wanted, you could go right up to them and touch them; of course, except for the snakes and turtles – they would slip into the water immediately. The ridge where our cave was located was filled with animals. If we wanted, we could have had a lot of domestic animals.",12.199,11.07,"During the day, we would paddle around the island in the canoe.

Well, in every old hollow tree, you could see rabbits and snakes and such things, and when the island had been flooded for one or two days, they were so tame from hunger that you could approach them and pet them if you wanted, but not the snakes or the turtles, which would slip away into the water.

After that, I quietly went outside and threw the snake carcasses far away into the bushes; because I was determined to do everything I could so that Jim wouldn't learn it was all my fault.",19.112,18.362,"He was barefoot and the snake had bitten him on the heel. And all that because I had been so stupid that I didn't remember that whenever you kill a snake, its mate always appears and coils around it. Jim told me to cut off the snake's head and throw it away, then skin the body and roast a piece. That's what I did, and he ate it and said it would help cure him. He made me remove the rattles and tie them to his wrist. He said that would also relieve him. Then I went out quietly and threw the snakes far away into the bushes, because I wasn't going to let Jim find out that it was all my fault if I could help it.",40.429,39.99

Jim's foot swelled up very quickly, then his calf too. Gradually the liquor took effect and I thought Jim would be fine. But I also thought that being bitten by a snake would be better than gulping down my father's whiskey.",5.623,3.88,"Jim was constantly drinking, occasionally losing control and attacking and shouting at those around him, but every time he came to his senses, he would drink a little more from the bottle.

I made up my mind I wouldn’t ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn’t got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I’ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do. Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so they say, but I didn’t see it. Pap told me. But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool.","Jim lay bedridden for four days and nights. Then the swelling disappeared and Jim was able to walk again. I thought to myself that from now on, I would definitely not touch the shed snake skin anymore, because I had seen how harmful it could be. Jim said that he hoped I would believe him from now on. Then he reiterated that touching the shed snake skin was extremely unlucky, and perhaps we hadn't yet realized how harmful it could be. Jim said he would rather glance at the crescent moon over his left shoulder a thousand times than hold the shed snake skin in his hand. I felt the same way, because I also understood that looking at the crescent moon over one's left shoulder was one of the most careless and foolish things that no one ever did. Old man Huck Bunker once did that and kept boasting about it. Yet, in less than twenty years, he got drunk and fell from a high platform to the ground, lying flat like a log used to wedge a tree stump, so to speak; then they had to carry him through the window to put him in a coffin for burial. That's what they said, I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. My father said so too. Anyway, it was because the old man dared to look at the moon in such a way. Truly foolish.",16.575,16.136,"Jim couldn't get up for four days and nights. But then the swelling went down and he started walking around again.

He said he would prefer to look at the new moon over his left shoulder a thousand times rather than hold a snake skin with his hand. I had started to think like him, although I always thought that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder was one of the most thoughtless and foolish things a person could do. Old Hank Bunker did it once, and even bragged about it; within two years, he got drunk one day, fell from a shot tower, and hit the ground so hard he was almost flat; they say they buried him between two big doors instead of a coffin; I didn't see it. My father told me. Anyway, this happened to him because he foolishly looked at the moon that way.",26.451,26.108,"Jim lay down for four days and nights.

301,"Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn’t handle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there was a spool in it. Jim said he’d had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn’t ever seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat’s as white as snow and makes a good fry.","Day by day, the river water receded and lay between the two banks. The first thing we did was bait a big hook with a skinned rabbit. We cast the bait and caught a giant fish as big as a person, nearly two meters long and weighing almost a hundred pounds. We couldn't pull the fish up, and who knows, it might have dragged us all the way to Illinois. We had no choice but to leave it there and watch it thrash until it died. We found a bronze frame inside the fish's belly, with a ball inside, which contained a spool of wire. Jim said that it had been inside the ball all along, and they wrapped it outside to make the ball. I'm sure this is the biggest fish I've ever seen; I've never seen a fish bigger than this. If it were in the village, it would have sold for a lot of money. With a fish like this, they would cut it into many small pieces, each half a pound, and sell them at the market; everyone would want to buy a few pieces. Its meat is as white as snow and smells delicious when fried.",12.893,12.253,"Days later, the river receded to its old banks, and the first thing we did was bait one of the huge fishing hooks with a skinned rabbit and set a trap to catch a catfish almost as tall as a man. This fish, nearly two meters long, weighed almost ninety kilos. Of course, we couldn't hold it directly; it could have flung us all the way to Illinois. We just stood and watched it thrash and tear around until it drowned. We found a brass mallet, a perfectly round ball, and a bunch of odds and ends in the fish's stomach. When we split the ball with an axe, a spool came out of it. Jim said the spool had been in the fish's stomach for a long time, turning into a ball as it got coated over and over. It was probably the biggest fish ever caught in the Mississippi until that day. Jim said he had never seen a bigger fish either. If we were in the village, it would have fetched quite a good price. They had sold a fish this big by the kilo in the market, and everyone had bought a piece; the fish's flesh was as white as snow and made for good frying.",21.626,21.145,"Well, the days went by and the river flowed again between its banks, and one of the first things we did was bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and cast it, and we caught a catfish as big as a man, because it measured six feet and two inches and weighed more than two hundred pounds. Of course, we couldn't pull it in, because it would have dragged us to Illinois. We sat watching it thrash and struggle until it drowned. In its stomach, we found a copper button, a round ball, and lots of other things. We split the ball with the axe and inside there was a spool. Jim said it had swallowed it a long time ago and that's why it had formed a ball around it. It was one of the biggest fish ever caught in the Mississippi, I think. Jim said he had never seen a bigger one. In town, it would have been worth a lot of money. They sell those fish by the pound at the market; everyone buys some; their skin is as white as snow and they taste very good when fried.",28.996,28.618
302,"Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a stirring up some way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I must go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said, couldn’t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl? That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it. Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim said nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things, and by-and-by I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said I didn’t walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket. I took notice, and done better.","The next morning, I told Jim that I felt sad and tired, so I wanted to find some way to be a bit more active. I planned to go out to the river to see if there was anything there. Jim agreed, but told me to wait until evening to go and to be careful. He thought for a moment and then suggested that I should take off the old clothes I was wearing and disguise myself as a girl. That idea sounded good. So we took a short-cut dress, rolled up my pants to the knees, and then put the dress on. Jim used a fishhook to gather the back of the dress, making it look quite nice. I put on a wide-brimmed hat and tied the hat's string under my chin. If anyone wanted to look closely and see my face, they would have to bend down as if looking into a stove chimney. Jim said that no one would recognize me, even in broad daylight; it would be very hard to recognize me. All day long, I practiced walking to get used to it, and gradually I felt quite comfortable in that outfit; but Jim told me that my walk still didn't look like a girl's walk and that I should stop lifting the dress to put my hands in my pants pockets. I followed his advice and imitated more accurately.",8.915,8.104,"The next morning, I said that life was passing slowly and boringly and that I wanted a bit of action. I thought it would be good to cross the river and see what was happening. Jim agreed with me, but he said I should go in the dark and be very careful. Then, after thinking about the matter a bit more, he asked if I could go disguised as a girl using some of those old clothes. That was indeed a good idea. So we shortened one of the calico dresses, rolled up the legs of my pants to my knees, and I put on the dress. When Jim fastened the clasps at the back of the dress, it fit me perfectly. I put on the sun hat and tied its string under my chin; since the wide brim curved down on both sides, anyone wanting to see my face would have to look in like through a stovepipe. Jim said that no one would recognize me even in daylight. I practiced all day long and gradually started to move quite comfortably in the dress; according to Jim, the only thing that didn't resemble girls was my walk; he also told me to stop lifting my skirt and plunging my hand into my pocket. It got better when I paid attention to that.",13.887,13.256,"The next morning I said that everything was getting very boring and that I wanted to see some action. I said that I thought I was going to cross the river to see what was happening. Jim liked the idea; but he said I had to go at night and be very careful.

So we shortened one of the calico dresses and I rolled up the legs of my pants to my knees and put it on. Jim fastened it at the back with the hooks, and it fit me well. I put on the bonnet and tied it under my chin, and if someone looked at me and saw my face it was like looking through a chimney pipe. Jim said no one would recognize me, not even during the day. I spent the whole day training to get used to it, and after a while it fit me quite well, only Jim said I didn't walk like girls, and that I had to stop lifting my skirts to put my hands in my pockets.

There was a light burning in a little shanty that hadn’t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered who had took up quarters there. I slipped up and peeped in at the window. There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table. I didn’t know her face; she was a stranger, for you couldn’t start a face in that town that I didn’t know. Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had come; people might know my voice and find me out. But if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn’t forget I was a girl.","I went past the provincial area, down at the ferry dock a distance, the current carried my boat to the end of the province. I got off the boat and walked along the foot of the dyke. There was a light in a small hut that seemed to have been unoccupied for a long time. I was curious to know who had come to stay here. I cautiously approached and peeked through a crack in the window. Inside the hut, a woman about forty years old was sitting by a candle placed on a pinewood table. I did not recognize her face; she must have been new here because in this province there was no one whose face I did not know. This was fortunate; earlier I had been worried that someone might recognize my voice and discover who I was. But if that woman had been in this small province for two days, she might be able to tell me everything I wanted to know. Thinking that, I knocked on the door and reminded myself not to forget that I was pretending to be a daughter.",15.467,14.744,"I approached the town from a bit below the ferry dock and, with the help of the current, reached the shore from the very bottom of the town.

I approached quietly and looked inside through the window. Inside, a woman in her forties was sitting at a pine table, knitting by candlelight. Her face didn't look familiar to me; she must have been a stranger, because there wasn't a single person in the town that I didn't know. This was what you called luck, as I had started to feel a bit regretful, fearing that someone might recognize my voice and I would get caught.

Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don’t hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it; that’s the way a woman most always does, but a man always does t’other way. And when you throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side, like a boy. And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don’t clap them together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead. Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived the other things just to make certain.

Poor you, whenever you thread a needle, don't hold the needle still and then thread it; women always do that, but men do it differently. And whenever you throw a mouse or anything else, remember to stand on tiptoe a bit, raise your hand over your head to look very awkward, and throw it a few feet away from the mouse. You have to throw in a way that looks stiff all the way from the shoulder down, as if there's a pin in your shoulder that rotates your arm, so it looks like a girl, not throwing with your wrist or elbow and spreading your arm out to one side like a boy. And also remember that when a girl moves, she spreads her knees apart, not keeping them together like you did earlier to hold the lead piece.

If you run into any trouble, send word to me, Mrs. Judith Loftus. I'll do whatever I can to help you. Follow the river path, and next time you walk such a long distance, wear shoes and socks.

For heaven's sake, child, the next time you need to thread a needle, don't try to push the needle's eye through the thread; keep the needle steady and pass the thread through the eye... Women always do it this way, but men always do the opposite. Also, if you're going to throw something at a mouse or whatever, rise up on your toes, lift your hand as awkwardly as possible over your head, and then throw it two or three meters away from the mouse. Throw directly using your shoulder, as if your arm is moving from the shoulder... Do it like girls do; don't throw like a man by bending your wrist and elbow and opening your arm to the side. And remember, a girl spreads her knees apart to catch something that falls into her lap; she doesn't keep her knees together like you did when catching the lead ball.

A tow-head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.","When the first light of day appeared, we tied the raft to a crevice near a large beach on the Illinois side; using an axe, we cut some cottonwood branches to cover it, making it look as if there had long been a recess at this part of the riverbank.

379,"We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn’t afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn’t set down and watch a camp fire—no, sir, she’d fetch a dog. Well, then, I said, why couldn’t she tell her husband to fetch a dog? Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn’t be here on a tow-head sixteen or seventeen mile below the village—no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again. So I said I didn’t care what was the reason they didn’t get us as long as they didn’t.","On the Illinois side, there are mountains. On the Illinois side, there are only big trees. This stretch of the river has a creek flowing towards the Illinois side, so we weren't afraid of anyone passing by here. We lay there all day, watching the rafts and steamboats going down the Illinois side, and the boats going upstream roaring in the middle of the river. I told Jim about the time I sat chatting with that woman, and Jim said she was a strange woman; if she had been the one hunting us, she wouldn't have bothered sitting by the campfire, but instead, sir, she would have led the hunt herself. I asked why she didn't suggest her husband bring the dogs. Jim said he guessed she had thought of that when her husband was about to leave, and probably the man went to town to get the dogs, which took so much time. That's why we could run to this place, sixteen or seventeen miles away from the village; otherwise, we would still be stuck in that old town. I think as long as they haven't caught us, it doesn't matter why they haven't caught us yet.",17.619,17.087,"On the Missouri side, there were mountains, while on the Illinois side, there were dense forests, and since the river flowed from the Missouri side, we had no fear of encountering anyone where we were. We lay there all day watching the rafts and steamers descend towards Missouri and the steamers coming up struggle with the vast river in the middle. I told Jim about the conversation I had with that woman; he said she was a cunning woman, and if she were after us, she wouldn't just sit by the campfire – no, sir, she would definitely bring a dog with her. But couldn't she have told her husband to go get a dog? Jim said that the woman had probably already thought of that before the men set out and that they were likely delayed because they went to get a dog from the upper part of the town, otherwise, we wouldn't be at this shallow spot sixteen or seventeen miles down from the village – we would find ourselves back in the old town. I said that as long as they didn't catch us, I wouldn't care why they didn't catch us.",19.327,18.818,"We saw mountains on the Missouri side and a lot of forest on the Illinois side, and the channel, on that part, ran on the Missouri side, so we weren't afraid of running into anyone.

I told Jim everything that had happened when I was talking to the woman and Jim said she was very smart and that if she were the one looking for us, she wouldn't just sit by a fire; no, sir, she would go with a dog. Well, then, I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to get a dog?

380,"When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn’t have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn’t always run the channel, but hunted easy water.","It started to get dark, so we poked our heads out from the pile of cotton, looked around, and saw nothing. Then Jim lifted the planks on the raft and set them up into a tent so we could crawl into it when it rained or shone, and to keep our belongings from getting wet. Jim also built an additional wooden platform about thirty centimeters high on the outside so that when large waves from passing ships hit, they wouldn't splash onto our belongings. In the middle of the tent, we made a small depression, filled it with soil about a decimeter deep, and surrounded it with wood to make a fireplace for when it rained and got cold, and also to keep it inside the tent so people wouldn't see it. We erected a short stick with a notch at the top to hang an old lantern on whenever a ship was passing downstream, to avoid collisions. As for the boats going upstream, we didn't need to light the lantern unless we were crossing the river; because the surface water flowed quite strongly, and there were many hidden sandbars below, so upstream boats often didn't travel in the middle of the river but chose spots where the current was less strong.",9.33,8.711,"When it started to get dark, we poked our heads out from between the dense poplars and looked up, down, and across; there was nothing; so Jim took apart a few of the upper planks of the raft to make a narrow shelter to get under in the extreme heat and rain, and also to keep our belongings dry. He made space on the raft for the shelter, then raised it about half a meter above the raft's floor; this way, our blankets and traps would no longer be affected by the waves created by the steamers. We made a 15-centimeter deep hole in the middle of the shelter out of mud, and supported its perimeter with planks to prevent it from spreading; this was for making a fire in rainy or cool weather, and the shelter would block the fire from being seen from a distance. We also made an extra steering pole, because the others could get stuck somewhere and break. We set up a short forked stick to hang the old tattered lantern, because when you see a steamer coming down the river, you must light the lantern so it doesn't hit you; but if we weren't at one of those places they call ""crossings,"" there was no need to light the lantern for steamers going upriver. The river was still quite high, and the low-lying banks were still underwater; so the ships going upriver could prefer places with less current instead of using the usual channel.",16.553,16.091,"When it started to get dark, we poked our heads out among the poplars and looked up and down and to the sides but saw nothing, so Jim took some of the logs off the top of the raft and built a very comfortable wigwam for us to take shelter in when it got very hot or rained and to keep things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam and raised it a foot above the level of the raft, so that the blankets and traps were out of reach of the steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam, we put a layer of dirt five or six inches thick and surrounded it with a frame to keep it from spilling out; it was for making a fire when it rained or got cold; with the wigwam, it wouldn't be visible. We also prepared a spare rudder, because one of the ones we had could break or get caught or whatever. We set up a pole with a fork to hang the old lantern from, because we would always have to light it when we saw a steamboat coming downstream, so it wouldn't miss us, but we didn't have to light it for the ones going upstream unless we found ourselves in what they call ""between currents,"" because the river was still very high and the low banks were still submerged, so the boats going upstream didn't always go through the channel but looked for easier waters.",30.902,30.598

So we talked it over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons, or what. But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p’simmons. We warn’t feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable now.

So, it was better to take a few things and then tell them that we wouldn't take anything next time. And Jim thought that doing so would make it okay to borrow other things in the future. So we discussed whether to take melons, pumpkins, or other things. But by morning, we resolved the matter and decided to take wild apples and wild pears. Before that, we were worried that we were doing something wrong, but now we felt at ease.

Put a candle in your pocket, Jim; I can't wait until we've searched it. Do you think Tom Sawyer would just leave a place like this? No way. He would say it was an adventure, that's what he would say, and he would board that ship even if it was the last thing he did in his life. And he would surely do it in style; don't you think he would organize a great one? Man, you would think he was Christopher Columbus discovering the New World. I wish Tom Sawyer were here.",17.62,17.102

423,"Well, I catched my breath and most fainted. Shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that! But it warn’t no time to be sentimentering. We’d got to find that boat now—had to have it for ourselves. So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was, too—seemed a week before we got to the stern. No sign of a boat. Jim said he didn’t believe he could go any further—so scared he hadn’t hardly any strength left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again. We struck for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door, there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely see her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would a been aboard of her, but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says:","I was breathless, almost about to collapse. Being stuck on a wrecked ship with a bunch of pirates like this! But no, there’s no time to sit and lament. We had to find a way to get something out of there and escape. We walked while shaking the ship's sides, but why did it feel so slow, as if it would take a week just to reach the stern. There was no sign of any boat. Jim said he wasn't sure if he could walk anymore, he was so scared that he had no strength left to walk - that's what he said. But I urged him to keep going, if we got stuck on this wrecked ship, we would surely die. We continued to grope our way forward. We managed to reach the stern, clinging to the window frame, but the window was almost submerged. When we got to the main door to go to the passenger cabin, we saw a small boat there. It's definitely a boat, I can see it clearly. Oh my God! There is no greater joy than this. I was just about to climb up when the door suddenly opened. A person stuck their head out, just about half a meter away from me. I thought I was done for, but then the person pulled their head back in and said:",12.024,11.426,"My breath got stuck in my throat, I almost fainted. Being trapped in the same wreck with such a gang! But it was no time to get emotional. We had to find that boat immediately… we were going to use it ourselves. So, trembling with fear, we started to move towards the dock, progressing very slowly; it felt like it took a week to reach the stern. There was no trace of the boat. Jim said he couldn't go any further – he was so scared that he had no strength left. But I explained to him that if we stayed in this wreck, we would be in big trouble. So we started walking again. We passed behind the captain's cabin, then reached for the skylight, holding onto the covers as part of the window was underwater. As we got closer to the corridor door, we finally located the boat! I could barely see its silhouette. I didn't know how to thank God. A second later, I would have jumped onto the boat, but just then the door opened. One of the men poked his head out just a few steps away from me! At that moment, I thought I was done for, but he pulled his head back in and called out:",19.162,18.69,"WELL, I jumped and fainted. Trapped on a shipwreck with a band of murderers! But there was no time for whining. Now we had to find the boat and take it for ourselves. We went down trembling and shivering on the starboard side and it took a long time: it seemed like a week passed before we reached the stern. There was no sign of the boat. Jim said he didn't think he had the strength to go on: he was so scared he couldn't take it anymore, he said. But I told him: ""Come on, if we stay here, we're sure to have a bad time."" So we kept looking. We went to the stern of the upper deck and found it; then we climbed up through the skylight as best we could, grabbing onto every iron, because the edge of the skylight was already in the water. When we were quite close to the lobby, we found the boat, at last! I barely saw it. I felt very happy. One more second and I would have boarded, but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his head out just a couple of feet from me and I thought my final hour had come, but he pulled it back in and said:",26.136,25.764

The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck. We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and shoved for the light. As I got down towards it, three or four more showed—up on a hillside. It was a village. I closed in above the shore light, and laid on my oars and floated. As I went by, I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferry-boat. I skimmed around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by-and-by I found him roosting on the bitts, forward, with his head down between his knees. I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to cry.","That is the raft. We were extremely delighted and climbed back on. On the right bank, a little below us, we suddenly saw a light. I decided to go there. The boat was still full of the belongings that the robbers had taken and loaded in. We hauled a pile of them onto the raft. I told Jim to let the boat drift further downstream. I pointed out to him the light that he thought was nearly two miles away, but the light kept flickering until we got closer. I took up the paddle and pushed the boat towards the light. The closer I got, the more I saw three or four more lights flashing on the hillside. It turned out to be a village. I moved towards the light closest to the shore, keeping the paddle in place to let the boat drift gently. When I got there and looked closely, it turned out to be a lantern hanging on the mast of a wrecked ship. I stepped up to find the guard and saw a guy sleeping there, his head leaning forward and his knees tucked in as he slept. I gently tapped him on the shoulder twice and then spoke in a tearful tone.",10.467,9.754,"We had found it on Tuesday and were very happy when we got back on it.

As I got closer to the light, three or four more lights appeared – they were all on the hillside. So, this was a village. I pulled the oars out of the water just above the light on the shore and continued with the current. As far as I could see, this light was coming from a lantern hung on the mast of a double-hulled ferry. I searched around to find where the watchman was sleeping and finally found him curled up on the deck bollard at the bow, sleeping.

535,"We judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom of Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was after. We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.","We calculated that in just three more nights we would reach Cairo, which is at the southern tip of Illinois, where the Ohio River flows in, and that is exactly where we intended to go. We would sell the raft and board a steamboat to travel up the Ohio River through the free states, so there would be nothing to worry about anymore.",30.073,28.908,"We were calculating that if we went three more nights, we would reach Cairo, at the very bottom of Illinois, at the mouth of the Ohio River, which was exactly where we wanted to go. We would sell the raft, board a steamboat, and go up the Ohio to the free states, and then our troubles would be over.",28.896,27.596,"WE CALCULATED THAT in three nights we would arrive in Cairo, at the end of Illinois, where the waters of the Ohio River meet, and that was what we were looking for. We would sell the raft and take a steamboat up the Ohio to the free states, and there we would no longer have any problems.",38.336,37.225
536,"Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a tow-head to tie to, for it wouldn’t do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn’t anything but little saplings to tie to. I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went. I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and scared I couldn’t budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me—and then there warn’t no raft in sight; you couldn’t see twenty yards. I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke. But she didn’t come. I was in such a hurry I hadn’t untied her. I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so excited my hands shook so I couldn’t hardly do anything with them.","On the second night, the fog suddenly became so thick that we had to find a ravine to tie the raft. Because it was not wise to recklessly continue in the fog. But while I was rowing the boat upstream, carrying a hook pole, I couldn't find a place to hook it as there were only small reeds. I cast the fishing line to wrap it around a reed on the water's edge, but this spot had such a strong current that it uprooted the reed and it kept drifting away. The fog grew heavier, making me so scared that I couldn't move for half a minute. Without the raft here, I couldn't see more than twenty meters ahead. I jumped to the back of the boat, grabbed the paddle, and pushed back once. But the boat didn't budge. It turned out I was in such a hurry that I hadn't untied the rope. I stood up to untie the rope, but I was so nervous that my hands were shaking and I couldn't do anything.",11.109,10.354,"The second night, the fog set in and we pulled up to a shore to tie the raft, because there was no point in trying to escape in the fog; but as I rowed ahead with the canoe tied to the raft to speed up, I found nothing to throw the rope at except for thin saplings. I threw the rope and tied it to a sapling on the shore, but the current was so strong that the raft, which was a bit behind, passed me and pulled the rope so fast that it uprooted the sapling and drifted away. The fog was getting denser and denser. I felt terrible, I was so scared that I couldn't move a finger for almost half a minute… then I lost sight of the raft, it was impossible to see even twenty meters ahead. I jumped back into the canoe and went to the stern, grabbed the oars, but the canoe didn't move. I had been in such a hurry that I forgot to untie the oar's rope. I immediately got up and tried to untie the rope, but I was so excited that my hands were trembling and I couldn't do anything.",14.973,14.351,"Well, around the second night, the fog started to come down, and we went to look for a sandbar to moor because it was useless to go on with the fog; but when I went ahead with the canoe, rowing with the rope to tie up, there were only some small logs. I threw the rope to one of them, right next to the edge of the shore, but the current was so strong there that the raft was moving so fast it uprooted it and kept going. I saw the fog getting denser and felt so bad and scared that I couldn't move for almost half a minute, or so it seemed to me, and then the raft was no longer visible; you couldn't see beyond twenty yards. I jumped into the canoe and ran to the stern, grabbed the paddle, and gave a stroke, but it didn't move. I was in such a hurry that I hadn't untied it. I stood up and tried to untie it, but I was so nervous that my hands were trembling so much I could hardly do anything with them.",25.626,25.164
537,"As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right down the tow-head. That was all right as far as it went, but the tow-head warn’t sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn’t no more idea which way I was going than a dead man.","As soon as I untied the rope, I immediately rowed to find the raft, the cozy raft carrying our heavy belongings right at the head of that creek. I found it right away because it was only sixty yards away. Just as I got close, I ran into an even thicker fog, unable to find my way out; it was as if I were completely dead.",10.441,8.146,"I followed the raft down the river by keeping close to the shore. As long as I didn't stray from the shore, there was no problem, but the islet was only sixty meters long, and a few seconds after reaching its end, I found myself in a blinding white mist, with no idea where I was going.",8.152,6.288,"As soon as I managed to get going, I started chasing the raft at full speed, directly towards the sandbar. That was well thought out, but the bar wouldn't measure even sixty yards long, and as soon as I left it behind, I got into the middle of that white and dense fog without having the slightest idea of where I was going.",17.27,15.54
538,"Thinks I, it won’t do to paddle; first I know I’ll run into the bank or a tow-head or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it’s mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time. I whooped and listened. Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits. I went tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again. The next time it come, I see I warn’t heading for it, but heading away to the right of it. And the next time I was heading away to the left of it—and not gaining on it much either, for I was flying around, this way and that and t’other, but it was going straight ahead all the time.","I think perhaps we shouldn't row the boat anymore; first, let's get closer to the shore or land somewhere. I had to sit still and let the boat drift, and having to sit still with my hands tied at that moment was very distressing. I cleared my throat and listened. Far below, I heard a faint sound echoing back, which reassured me. I moved closer to hear more clearly. Getting even closer, it was on the left side. Then I heard nothing more, and I didn't search further because I had to keep turning the boat in all directions; instead, I just kept heading straight ahead.",4.339,3.038,"It occurred to me that rowing would be useless; I could crash into the shore or shallow water as soon as I started; I had to stay still and go with the current. In such a situation, it was really hard not to move your hands. I called out ahead and waited for a response. My spirits lifted when I heard someone faintly calling out from somewhere in the distance. I immediately started moving towards the sound, while also straining my ears to hear it again. When I heard it the second time, I realized I was going to the right of where the sound was coming from, not directly towards it. The next time, I was heading to the left of where the sound was coming from – and I hadn't gotten much closer, because I was rowing either to the right or the left, but the sound was coming straight from ahead.",11.847,11.011,"I thought it wasn't worth rowing; I knew that at the first sign of trouble I would run aground on the shore or on a sandbar or something like that; I stayed still letting the canoe drift, but one gets very nervous when they have nothing to do with their hands in a moment like that. I shouted and listened. In the distance, I don't know where, I heard another muffled shout and I felt somewhat encouraged. I went there at full speed, listening carefully in case I heard it again. The next time I heard it, I saw that I wasn't heading towards it, but to its right, and the next time to its left, and I wasn't making much progress either, because I was going around in circles, while that voice was going straight down the whole time.",13.13,12.23
539,"I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and directly I hears the whoop behind me. I was tangled good now. That was somebody else’s whoop, or else I was turned around.","At that moment, I wished that someone would just bang on a pot and bang it rhythmically so it would be easier to know where to look. But no one was banging, and the silence, punctuated by a few coughs, only made me more confused. I went further up, and suddenly I heard a howl behind me. Well, I was really surrounded. It was definitely the howl of someone else. I was definitely surrounded.",11.091,9.453,"I hoped that our foolish Jim would think of hitting something like a pan, he should have kept hitting it continuously; but since he didn't do that, the silences between his calls became a problem for me. I rowed forward with all my strength and soon heard the sound behind me. By now, I was completely bewildered. Either someone else was calling out or I was going in the wrong direction.",8.063,6.221,"What I wanted was for the very fool to think of starting to bang repeatedly on a pan, but he didn't think of it, or maybe he did, and what worried me were the silences between the screams. Well, I kept going and immediately heard the scream behind me. Now I was really confused. Either there was another person screaming or I had turned all the way around.",12.594,10.057
540,"I throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its place, and I kept answering, till by-and-by it was in front of me again, and I knowed the current had swung the canoe’s head down-stream, and I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering. I couldn’t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don’t look natural nor sound natural in a fog.","I threw the paddle down. Again, I heard the howling sound still behind me, but from a different place. It crept closer, it changed places, it answered itself, occasionally falling silent and then resounding in front of me; I knew that the current had already turned my boat downstream, and if it was Jim and not some other ferryman howling, I would be at ease. In the fog, nothing seen by the eyes or heard by the ears seems natural anymore.",17.69,16.496,"I threw the oar into the boat. I heard the voice again, it was behind me once more but in a different place; the voice kept coming and kept changing places, and I kept responding; finally, I started hearing the voice in front of me again and realized that the current had turned the canoe's head downstream and things were falling into place, of course, if the person calling out to me was indeed Jim and not someone else. I absolutely couldn't distinguish the sounds coming through the mist; because nothing looks natural in the mist, and the sounds don't seem natural either.",20.132,19.223,"I put down the oar. I heard the shout again; it was still behind me, but in a different place; it sounded over and over and always changed location, and I kept responding, until finally it was ahead of me again, and I realized that the current had turned the canoe around as it moved downstream and that I was going the right way if it was Jim and not another raftsman shouting. I couldn't understand any of the voices in the fog, because in a fog nothing seems or sounds natural.",27.402,26.539
541,"The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.","The howling continued, and about a minute later, I crashed right into a clearing with several large trees looming like ghosts, then the current pushed me to the left and I crashed into the bank again, amidst a pile of floating rotten wood that creaked when it hit the boat. And the water continued to quietly meander through the pile of wood.",10.138,7.791,"The sound continued and about a minute later, I was gliding along a steep shore where the ghostly forms of large trees loomed within the mists. The current grabbed me and flung me to the left, and as I passed through the water plants, the water roared and the current battered the plants.",9.471,7.293,"The screams continued and after a minute or so I found myself rushing down at full speed in front of a steep bank filled with blurry ghosts of large trees, and the current threw me to the left and kept going, dragging a bunch of logs that thundered down, due to the speed at which the current broke them.",12.922,10.854
542,"In another second or two it was solid white and still again. I set perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn’t draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.","Later, the fog became even denser. Even quieter. I sat completely still, listening to the pounding of my heart. I thought if my heart beat reached a hundred, I wouldn't be able to breathe anymore.",8.73,6.008,"A few seconds later, everything turned completely white again and the sounds ceased. I was listening to my heartbeat without moving, it must have beaten a hundred times until I took another breath.",9.706,6.629,"After one or two seconds, nothing could be seen but a white mass, and everything had fallen silent. Then I sat still, completely motionless, listening to the beats of my heart, and I think I didn't breathe even once in a hundred beats.",9.735,7.265
543,"I just give up then. I knowed what the matter was. That cut bank was an island, and Jim had gone down t’other side of it. It warn’t no tow-head that you could float by in ten minutes. It had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide.","I had to give up. And I know why it turned out this way. This stormy mass is an island, and Jim has drifted to the other side. There is no creek that can be crossed in about ten minutes. This island also has large trees like any other island; it is probably about five or six miles long and half a mile wide.",23.409,22.131,"Then I gave up trying. I had understood what the matter was. The shore we had just seen belonged to an island, and Jim was on the other side of the island. This was not a shore you could pass by in ten minutes. It had big trees like normal islands; it was five or six miles long and at least half a mile wide.",34.141,33.116,"Then I gave up. I knew what was happening. That steep shore was an island, and Jim had crossed to the other side of it. It wasn't like a sandbar that you could cross in ten minutes. It had big trees like a normal island; it could be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide.",46.242,45.443
544,"I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don’t ever think of that. No, you feel like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don’t think to yourself how fast you’re going, but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag’s tearing along. If you think it ain’t dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it once—you’ll see.","I remained still, listening intently for fifteen minutes. Of course, the boat continued to drift, at about five or six miles per hour. But deep inside, I didn't dare to hope for such a thing. It felt as if I were lying unconscious on the water. If no piece of wood floated by, it would be impossible to tell how fast or slow I was drifting. But I just held my breath, thinking and watching the piece of wood float by. If anyone has never experienced the loneliness and desolation of being alone in the fog late at night, they should try it once to understand.",5.628,4.218,"Without making a sound, I listened intently for fifteen minutes. Meanwhile, I was of course moving at four or five miles per hour, but I wasn't even thinking about it. No, it felt like you weren't moving at all on the water; if a passing branch caught your eye, you wouldn't think about how fast you were going; you'd hold your breath and think, wow, how fast that branch is moving. If you think you won't worry or feel lonely when you get lost alone in the fog at night, try it once – then you'll see.",16.369,15.242,"I remained silent, with my ear attentive, for about fifteen minutes, I estimate. Naturally, I kept floating downstream at four or five miles per hour, but one never thinks about that. No, one believes they are completely still in the water, and if some sticks pass by, one doesn't think about how fast they are going, but rather takes a breath and says: ""Wow! How fast those sticks are going."" If anyone thinks that being alone at night in the middle of such a fog is not one of the saddest and most terrible things, let them try it just once and they will find out.",13.4,12.288
545,"Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn’t do it, and directly I judged I’d got into a nest of tow-heads, for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me—sometimes just a narrow channel between, and some that I couldn’t see I knowed was there because I’d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks. Well, I warn’t long loosing the whoops down amongst the tow-heads; and I only tried to chase them a little while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o’-lantern. You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.","Then about half an hour later, I occasionally let out a scream. After that, I heard a distant reply, tried to follow it but couldn't, and I guessed that I had wandered into a place full of many intertwined streams. I looked at both banks and saw only darkness. Sometimes I clearly saw each small canal, sometimes I could only guess because I heard the sound of water hitting the banks. I didn't even bother to call out in this maze of uneven land anymore, but just walked a bit further, because it was worse than chasing will-o'-the-wisps. Never before had I heard echoes that lingered and shifted places so quickly.",10.221,9.339,"Then, for half an hour, I called out from time to time; finally, I heard someone shouting back from afar and tried to follow the voice, but I couldn't manage it. At that moment, I realized I had entered the sandbanks, because I could vaguely see sandbanks on either side of me, sometimes with only a narrow channel in between, and even when I couldn't see the sandbanks, I knew they were there because I could hear the current hitting dead branches and debris piled up on the shore. Soon, I lost the voices among the sandbanks, which I had only tried to follow for a short while anyway, because it was worse than trying to follow will-o'-the-wisps in the marsh. I had never thought that a voice could come from so many places and change location so frequently.",13.308,12.489,"Afterward, for about half an hour or so, I kept shouting from time to time, until I finally heard a response far away, and I tried to follow it, but I couldn't, and immediately I thought I had gotten myself into the middle of a labyrinth of sandbars, because I saw them blurry on both sides: sometimes with only a narrow channel in the middle, and other times I couldn't see them but knew they were there because I heard the current crashing against old dry logs and debris on the banks. Well, it didn't take long before I stopped hearing the shouts among the sandbars and only tried to follow them for a little while, in any case, because it was worse than chasing a will-o'-the-wisp. In my life, I had never heard a noise so difficult to follow nor that changed places so many times and so quickly.",18.853,18.197
546,"I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing—it was floating a little faster than what I was.","Four or five times, I had to take it down to avoid getting stuck on the shore and to prevent it from hitting the rocks in the river. I was sure the raft had also hit the shore many times; otherwise, it would have moved on and we could have heard it somewhere. The raft still drifted faster than the boat.",12.719,10.758,"I had to push off from the sandy shores four or five times with all my strength, because I didn't want to hit the islands here and there in the river; surely the raft must have been getting stuck in some places on the shore from time to time, otherwise it would have already gone down the river and become too far away to hear – it was just moving a little faster than me.",13.661,11.862,"Four or five times I had to push myself away from the shore to avoid bumping into it, so I figured that the raft must be hitting the shore from time to time, because otherwise, it would keep moving and you wouldn't be able to hear it anymore; it was floating a bit faster than I was.",17.766,15.558
547,"Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by-and-by, but I couldn’t hear no sign of a whoop nowheres. I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag, maybe, and it was all up with him. I was good and tired, so I laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn’t bother no more. I didn’t want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn’t help it; so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.","Then, it seems like I might have crashed into the river again, but I still haven't heard any howling sounds. I guess Jim must have crashed into some pile of wood, and maybe that's the end of it. I was so tired, I lay down in the boat and told myself not to care about it anymore. I thought maybe I should take a little nap.",7.311,5.774,"It seemed that I had once again reached a freely flowing part of the river, but I couldn't hear anyone calling from around. Maybe Jim had gotten caught on a branch or something, which would mean he was done for. I was now thoroughly exhausted and felt like lying down in the canoe and letting everything take its course. Of course, I didn't want to sleep, but I was so sleepy that I couldn't help it, so I decided to take a little nap.",16.788,15.458,"Well, after a while it seemed like I was in open river again, but there wasn't a sound anywhere. I figured that maybe Jim had gotten caught on a log and that it was all over for him. I was extremely tired, so I lay down at the bottom of the canoe and said I wasn't going to bother anymore. Of course, I didn't want to fall asleep, but I was so sleepy that I couldn't help it, so I thought I would just take a little nap.",24.424,23.355
548,"But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a big bend stern first. First I didn’t know where I was; I thought I was dreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week.","But it turned out it wasn't just a blink of an eye, because when I woke up, there were twinkling stars in the sky, the fog had cleared; I had taken a long nap at the stern. At first, I didn't know where I was. I thought I was still dreaming, but upon reflection, it gradually felt like the events that had just happened were from a week ago.",11.49,9.781,"It seems my sleep lasted longer than a nap, because when I woke up, stars were twinkling above me, the fog had completely lifted, and I had entered a wide bend of the river with my canoe in reverse. At first, I couldn't understand where I was; I thought I was dreaming; then I slowly began to remember what had happened before I fell asleep, but I could only vaguely recall it, as if it had happened not just a moment ago, but last week.",17.187,16.185,"But I figure it was more than a nap, because when I woke up the stars were shining brightly, the fog had disappeared, and I was drifting backward down a large bend of the river. At first, I didn't know where I was. I thought I was dreaming, and when I started to remember things, it seemed like everything had happened a week ago.",24.113,22.727
549,"It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see by the stars. I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the water. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn’t nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together. Then I see another speck, and chased that; then another, and this time I was right. It was the raft.","This part of the river is terrifyingly wide, with tall star-like trees lining both banks. I looked down at the river and saw something dark on the surface of the water. I approached it and found out it was just two rotten logs tied together. Then I saw another object, chased it, and it wasn't what I thought either. Then another time, and this time it was indeed our raft.",13.233,11.873,"The river was incredibly wide here, and on both banks, there were very tall and dense trees; as far as I could see in the starlight, they stood like a straight wall. When I looked downstream, I saw a black spot on the water. I immediately moved towards it, but when I got closer, I saw that it was nothing but a few logs tied together. Then I saw another spot and chased after it, then followed another one, and this time I had come to the right place. The raft was in front of me.",20.361,19.325,"There the river was monstrously large, with very tall and tightly packed trees on both banks; like a solid wall, as far as one could see by the light of the stars. I looked downstream and saw a black spot in the water. I went towards it, but when I got there it was nothing more than a couple of tied logs.

She had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty men, likely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. There was a power of style about her. It amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that.","We slept for most of the day, and at night we followed a large raft that was as long as a procession. At the four corners of the raft were four large and long oars, and we guessed the raft must carry about thirty to forty people.

586,"We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got hot. The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on both sides; you couldn’t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it. I said likely we wouldn’t, because I had heard say there warn’t but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn’t happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there, that would show. But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again. That disturbed Jim—and me too. So the question was, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo. Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and waited.","We rowed on and followed the river to a vast, expansive area. At night, the clouds rose high, and the sky began to heat up intensely. The river was very wide, and both banks were densely packed with large trees; it seemed as if there was no place for sunlight to penetrate through. We talked to each other about Cairo, wondering when we would finally reach and see Cairo. I said it seemed like we wouldn't get there, because I heard that there were only about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't light up at night, how would we know we had passed by? Jim said that the place where two large rivers meet is the right spot. But I said maybe we were circling around the head of an island and then returning to the old river or something. That made Jim worried - and me too, for the whole evening. So the question was: What do we do now? I said that whenever we saw lights, we should immediately turn to the shore, tell people that my father was following with a merchant ship, and since he was new to the job, he wasn't sure how far Cairo was. Jim thought that was a good idea. So we sat and smoked, waiting.",19.694,19.259,"We started to navigate around a big bend, the weather became cloudy and it started to warm up. The river was very wide and dense trees on both banks formed almost a wall; you couldn't see a single open spot or light. We started talking about Cairo and pondered how we would know when we arrived there. Most likely, we wouldn't realize when we got there, because I had heard that there were only about a dozen houses there, and if their lights weren't on as we passed by, how would we know we had passed through a town? Jim said we would know when we got there because two large rivers converged there. But I replied that we might think we had just passed the tip of an island and continued on the same river. Upon this, Jim started to waver... and so did I. So what would we do then? I said I would go ashore with the canoe at the first place we saw lights, and tell the people there that my father was coming behind us with a freight boat, and since he was new to this, he wanted to know how far Cairo was. Jim liked this idea, we lit our pipes and started to wait.",20.032,19.574,"We drifted down a large curve, the night became cloudy and it started to get very hot. The river was very wide and was surrounded by very dense forests on both sides; there was not a clearing or even a light to be seen in them. We talked about Cairo and wondered if we would recognize it when we arrived. I said no, because I had heard that there were only about a dozen houses, and if they didn't have lights, how would we know we were passing by a town? Jim said that if the two great rivers met there, that would indicate it to us. But I replied that we might think we were passing by the end of an island and returning to the same river as always. That worried Jim, and me too. So the question was, what to do? I said to row, row to the shore as soon as we saw the first light and tell them that father was coming behind in a merchant skiff, and that he was a novice at these things and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo. Jim thought it was a good idea, so we started smoking to celebrate it and set about waiting.",35.332,35.019
587,"There warn’t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and not pass it without seeing it. He said he’d be mighty sure to see it, because he’d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it he’d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom. Every little while he jumps up and says:","At this moment, there was nothing to do but to carefully watch out for the town to avoid passing by without noticing it. Jim said that we would definitely see it, because if we did, we would have to live in a land of slavery again and would not be able to find freedom anymore.

He often jumped up and said, ""There it is!""",16.749,15.522,"Now there was nothing left to do but be very attentive to the town and not pass by without seeing it. Jim said he was absolutely sure he would see it, because as soon as he saw it, he would be a free man, but if he didn't see it, it meant he was back in the zone of slavery and would never reach freedom.

589,"But it warn’t. It was Jack-o’-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set down again, and went to watching, same as before. Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he was most free—and who was to blame for it? Why, me. I couldn’t get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn’t rest; I couldn’t stay still in one place. It hadn’t ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. I tried to make out to myself that I warn’t to blame, because I didn’t run Jim off from his rightful owner; but it warn’t no use, conscience up and says, every time, “But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody.” That was so—I couldn’t get around that noway. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to me, “What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word? What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how. That’s what she done.”","But it wasn't. It was just a will-o'-the-wisp or a firefly. Then he sat down again, intently watching as before. Jim said that when he got close to the land of freedom, he felt himself trembling like he had a fever. As for me, I can say that it made me tremble feverishly just hearing Jim say that. Because I also began to feel that in his mind, he was the freest man. And who was responsible for that? It was me, of course. In my consciousness, I couldn't understand how or why that was? It made me so restless that I couldn't sit still, couldn't stand still in one place. Before, I was never familiar with that idea, but now I was thinking about it. Now, it haunted me, gripped my hands, and made me increasingly restless. I tried to tell myself that it wasn't my fault, because it wasn't me who made Jim run away from his rightful owner. But there was nothing I could do, always conscious of waking up and saying: you must know that Jim ran away for freedom, and you can't go ashore and tell anyone about it. That's it, I couldn't avoid that thought. And that's exactly where it appeared. Consciousness told me again: What did Miss Watson ever do to you that you could calmly watch her black man run away and not say a word? How did that poor woman treat you that you would treat her so badly? She taught you, fed you, and treated you well in every way. Isn't that so?",13.124,12.661,"But she was mistaken. The lights she saw turned out to be either swamp fire or fireflies; then she would sit back down and continue watching with her eyes wide open just like before. Jim said that being so close to freedom made him tremble violently and his heart start to beat rapidly. I must say that listening to him also made me tremble violently and my heart beat rapidly, because it was beginning to dawn on me that he would indeed soon taste freedom – and who was to blame for that? It was me. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't silence my conscience. I was so restless that I couldn't relax at all, I couldn't stay still. I had never felt the meaning of what I was doing so deeply before. But now I felt it; moreover, it had settled inside me and was burning my heart more and more. I tried to convince myself that it wasn't my fault, because I wasn't the one who helped Jim escape from his owner; but it was no use, because my conscience would stand up each time and say: “But you knew he wanted to be free and you could have gone ashore and told someone.” This was true – no matter how much I wanted to, I couldn't deny it. And that was what hurt the most. My conscience kept asking the same questions: “What did poor Miss Watson ever do to you that you watch her slave escape right before your eyes and don't say a word? What wrong did the poor woman do to you that you do such a despicable thing to her? She tried to teach you the book, she tried to teach you manners, she tried to do good to you in her own way. She has no other fault.”",17.026,16.657,"But he wasn't there. They were will-o'-the-wisps or fireflies, so he sat back down and watched just like before. Jim said that being so close to freedom made him tremble and feel feverish. Well, I can say that listening to him made me tremble and feel feverish too, because I was starting to realize that I was almost free, and who was to blame? Well, me. I couldn't get it off my conscience, no matter what I did. It worried me so much that I couldn't rest; I couldn't stay calm in one place. Until then, I had never realized what I was doing. But now I did, and I couldn't stop thinking about it and it irritated me more and more. I tried to convince myself that it wasn't my fault because I wasn't the one who made Jim escape from his rightful owner, but it was no use, because my conscience kept coming back and saying every time: ""But you knew he was running away in search of freedom and you could have rowed to the shore and told someone."" It was true: there was no way to deny it. That's where it hurt. My conscience said to me: ""What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you saw her negro escape right in front of you and didn't say a single word? What had that poor old woman done to you to treat her so badly? Well, she had tried to get you to learn your book, she had tried to teach you manners, she had tried to make you good by all the means she knew. That's what she had done.""",22.927,22.596

591,"Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children, and if their master wouldn’t sell them, they’d get an Ab’litionist to go and steal them.","While I was questioning myself, Jim kept talking loudly. He said that after reaching a free land, the first thing he would do is open a savings account and never spend a penny.

Then the couple would work to buy back their two children, and if the owner refused to sell them, they would hire someone to steal them back.",23.702,22.732,"While I was keeping everything to myself, Jim was openly expressing all his thoughts. He said that his first task upon reaching one of the free states would be to start saving money. With the money he saved without spending a single cent, he would first buy his wife.

Then, working together, they would buy their two children; if the owners were unwilling to sell the children, they would pay some abolitionists to steal them.",10.376,8.283,"Jim spoke out loud all the time while I spoke alone. According to him, the first thing he would do when he reached a free state would be to save money and not spend a cent, and when he had enough, he would buy his wife, who was a slave on a farm near where Miss Watson lived, and then they would both work to buy their two children, and if the owner of the children didn't want to sell them, they would get an abolitionist to steal them.",41.271,40.613
592,"It most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn’t ever dared to talk such talk in his life before. Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free. It was according to the old saying, “Give a nigger an inch and he’ll take an ell.” Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking. Here was this nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children—children that belonged to a man I didn’t even know; a man that hadn’t ever done me no harm.","I heard that and felt a chill run down my spine. Never before had he dared to speak of such things. Just try to imagine the moment when he felt he was about to be free, how different it was from before. It was exactly like the proverb people often say: Give a black man an inch and he will take a mile. I thought, this is because I didn't think it through beforehand. This is a black man whom I helped escape, and now he is determined to say that he will go and take back his child, whose child I don't even know; a black man who has never done anything to harm me at all.",8.331,6.664,"Hearing him talk like that chilled my blood. He would never have dared to say such things before. How much he had changed the moment he felt he was approaching freedom. Just like the old saying goes, ""give a Negro your hand and he'll take your arm."" This is the result of thoughtlessness, I was saying to myself. Here was the Negro I almost helped escape, now openly talking about committing a new crime by stealing children, and not just any children, but those of a man I didn't know and who had never done me any harm.",6.501,5.04,"Hearing those things almost froze my blood. Before, he would never have dared to say all that. That's how he had changed as soon as he thought he was almost free. It's like the saying goes: ""Give an inch and they'll take a mile.""

It was truly cowardly. My consciousness returned to its size, and I became more agitated. Until I responded to my consciousness: Okay, leave it to me, it's never too late.

Later, during difficult times, there would be no one to help or support me, and I might even be beaten.

No, I said, I would feel bad – just as I feel bad now. So what's the use of learning to do the right thing? Doing the right thing gets you into trouble; when you do the wrong thing, no one gets hurt, and in both cases, you feel bad. When I got to this point, I was stuck. I had no answer to give.

It got to be very late and still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river. We lit the lantern, and judged she would see it.

It was impossible to see the uneven riverbank clearly, and we couldn't see far anymore. It was very late at night and quiet. At that moment, a steamboat suddenly appeared, going upstream.

It was very late and there was no sound at all, then we noticed a steamboat coming directly towards us from upstream. We immediately lit our lantern so that they could see us.

There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam—and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight through the raft.","We could clearly hear the clattering sound but couldn't see the ship clearly until it got closer.

As the ship approached, we thought it might hit us, and it didn't seem to be veering away at all. The ship was very large and moving quickly, looking like a big dark cloud bristling with paddle wheels and surrounded by fireflies. But then suddenly it swerved, looming menacingly, with a row of lit windows resembling a large set of red teeth, and its paddles and oars seemed ready to crash down on us. There were shouts, then a bell rang to slow the engine, followed by curses, the sound of the engine screeching, and just as Jim jumped to one side and I jumped to the other, the ship's paddle wheel smashed our raft to pieces.",14.946,14.386,"We could hear the sound of the ship, but we didn't see it until it got really close.

I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I could hear her.","I plunged into the water and dived deep to the riverbed, because the large wheel, which was about eight or nine meters in diameter, could potentially hit my head, and I needed to stay far away from it. I could stay underwater for up to a minute, but this time I thought I had been at the bottom for about a minute and a half. Then I surfaced, as I was nearly out of breath. I raised my hand to rub the water out of my nose, snorting a few times. Of course, in this spot, the water was swift, and the ship would start its engine as usual after about ten seconds, as they never cared about the fate of those on small boats. At that moment, the ship chugged away and disappeared into the fog, although I could still hear the engine's sound echoing back.",15.987,15.302,"I dived – I even wanted to go all the way to the bottom, because the 10-meter diameter wheel was going to pass over me and I needed to make room for it.

I almost rose up to my armpits and blew out the water that had filled my nose, then took deep breaths.

There was no iron latch or wooden latch opened with a leather strap on the front door; instead, there was a brass handle like the ones in town houses, which you turned to open. There was no bed in the living room, not even anything resembling a bed; whereas almost all the living rooms in town had beds. There was a large hearth with bricks laid at the bottom, and they kept the bricks clean and red by pouring water on them and rubbing them together; sometimes they also dipped the bricks in a red paint called Spanish-coffee, as was done in town. The brass fittings in the house's fireplace were large enough to hold big logs. In the middle of the mantelpiece, I saw a clock, and below the glass of the clock's lower half, there was a picture of a town; the empty space in the middle of the clock symbolized the sun, and you could see the pendulum swinging right behind it. It was very nice to listen to the ticking of this clock; sometimes when one of the traveling repairmen cleaned and reset it, the clock could chime one hundred and fifty times before the spring fully unwound. Moreover, the repairmen never charged any money for the clock.",24.061,23.707,"It was a very nice family, and the house was also great. I had never seen such a good house with so much style. It didn't have an iron latch on the main door, nor a wooden one with a leather cord, but a brass knob to turn, just like the houses in the city. In the living room, there were no beds or signs of them, although there are plenty of living rooms in the cities where you can see beds. There was a very large fireplace, lined with bricks at the bottom, which they kept clean by using water and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they washed them with a red water paint called Spanish earth, just like in the city. They had some bronze fireplace irons with which you could grab an entire log. In the middle of the mantelpiece, there was a clock with a painting of a village on the bottom part of the glass cover, and a round opening in the middle for the dial, and behind it, you could see the pendulum swinging. It was a pleasure to hear the ticking of that clock, and sometimes when a tinker passed by and cleaned and tuned it, it would start ringing and give a hundred and fifty chimes before getting tired. They wouldn't have sold it for anything in the world.",27.494,27.168
716,"Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn’t open their mouths nor look different nor interested. They squeaked through underneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things. On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is, but they warn’t real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it was, underneath.","Then on either side of the clock, there were very strange-looking parrots, made of something like makeup, painted in bright colors. Next to the parrot on one side, there is a porcelain cat, and on the other side, there is a porcelain dog; every time you press its head, it lets out a squeak, but it doesn't open its mouth, nor does it show any signs of anger or joy. It squeaks from its bottom. Because there are two fans made from pheasant wings installed at the back. On the table in the middle of the room, there is a very beautiful porcelain bowl, filled with apples, oranges, peaches, and grapes, looking red and yellow and more beautiful than usual fruits; but they are not real fruits and you can see spots where the outer layer has peeled off, exposing the white clay inside.",13.932,13.236,"On each side of the clock, there was a showy parrot; made from something like chalk and painted in gaudy colors. Next to one of the parrots was a clay cat, and next to the other was a clay dog; if you pressed on the cat and dog, they would squeak, but their mouths wouldn't open, their appearance wouldn't change; they wouldn't react. They squeaked from their undersides. Behind these items, a pair of large fans made from wild turkey feathers were hanging. On a table in the middle of the room, there was also a very nice clay basket; filled with apples, oranges; peaches, and grapes that looked much redder, yellower, and more delicious than the real ones, but it was obvious they weren't real because in some places the white chalk or whatever the material was underneath was showing.",20.371,19.694,"And on each side of the clock there was a very strange parrot made as if from chalk and painted in many colors. Next to one of the parrots there was a porcelain cat and next to the other a porcelain dog, and when they were pressed they squeaked, but they did not open their mouths nor did they seem different or interested. Behind them there were two fans made of wild turkey feathers. On the table, in the middle of the room, there was a kind of beautiful porcelain basket that had apples, oranges, peaches, and grapes, all piled up, and much redder and yellower and prettier than real fruit, but it wasn't real because you could see where pieces had chipped off and underneath the white chalk or whatever it was.",33.435,32.936
717,"This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It come all the way from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books, too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. One was a big family Bible full of pictures. One was Pilgrim’s Progress, about a man that left his family, it didn’t say why. I read considerable in it now and then. The statements was interesting, but tough. Another was Friendship’s Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn’t read the poetry. Another was Henry Clay’s Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn’s Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead. There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books. And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too—not bagged down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.","On the table covered with an oilcloth tablecloth, beautiful, in the middle of the cloth is painted a blue and red eagle, with a border painted around it. They said that the cloth was brought back from Philadelphia. There were also a few books, carefully arranged in the corners of the table. One book was a Bible with many illustrations. Another book was ""The Pilgrim's Progress,"" about a man who left home without saying why. Occasionally, I still read this story. But the words in it are quite good, though a bit rough. Another book was ""Sacrifice for Friends,"" which had many good stories and poems, but I don't read poetry. One book was ""The Speeches of Henry Clay,"" and another was ""Gunn's Domestic Medicine,"" which talked about everything we need to do when someone in the house is sick or dies. Then there was a book about hymns, and a bunch of other books. There were also some very cute little chairs, with legs splayed out, and very sturdy to sit on, the seat not sagging or sunken like an old basket.",12.192,11.423,"On the beautiful oilcloth cover that was neatly laid on the table, a red and blue eagle with its wings spread was drawn within a colorful frame.

One of them was a large Holy Bible filled with pictures, suitable for family reading. Another one was ""On the Pilgrimage,"" about a man who left his home and family for an unspecified reason. I occasionally picked up this book and read quite a bit of it. The sentences were interesting but of a kind that was hard to understand. There was also a book called ""The Gifts of Friendship"" filled with beautiful writings and poems; but I did not read the poems. Besides a book titled ""Speeches of Henry Clay,"" there was also Dr. Gunn's ""Family Medicine,"" which explained everything to do if someone gets sick or dies. There was a Hymn Book and many other books. We were also sitting on very beautiful woven wicker chairs, and they were very sturdy – not like old baskets with sagging centers and broken bottoms.",15.889,15.344,"That table had a beautiful oilcloth tablecloth, with a red and blue eagle and a painted border all around.

718,"They had pictures hung on the walls—mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing the Declaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see before—blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.” Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.” There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.” These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn’t somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon—and the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.","They even have paintings hanging on the walls - especially paintings of Washingtons and Lafayettes depicting battles, depicting the Mary plateau, and a painting called The Signing of the Declaration. There are some paintings they call sketches, one of which depicts one of the daughters of this family who has passed away; she drew it herself when she was just fifteen years old. These paintings are different from any paintings I had seen before - they are mostly darker than usual paintings. One depicts a woman in a thin black dress, cinched under the arms, with cabbage-like flares at the wrists, wearing a bonnet with a black veil falling down, with two white ankles wrapped in black ribbons, wearing black shoes as small as blades; the woman in the painting is leaning down sorrowfully beside a tombstone on the right, under a weeping willow, holding a white handkerchief in one hand and a woven basket in the other; under the painting, it is written: Alas, I shall never see you again! Another painting depicts a young woman with all her hair combed up to the top of her head, tied in a knot in front with a comb that looks like the back of a chair, she is crying, face buried in a handkerchief, with a dead bird lying on its back in her other hand, legs upturned, and under the painting, it is written: Alas, I shall never hear you sing again! Then there is another painting of a young woman sitting by a window looking at the moon, tears streaming down her cheeks: one hand holding an open letter with a black seal on one side, lifting a small framed picture to her mouth with a string; under the painting, it is written: Is it true that you are leaving, oh my love! All those paintings are beautiful, I am sure, but somehow I do not like them much. Because whenever I am sad, they make me feel even heavier. Everyone regretted that she died, because she was planning to paint many more such paintings. Everyone felt that she had gained something while everyone else had lost something. But I think that with her temperament, it was better for her to rest in the cemetery. She only prayed to live long enough to finish that painting, but she still did not survive. It was a painting of a young woman in a long white dress, standing by the bridge, about to jump into the river, hair flowing down her back, face turned up looking at the moon, tears streaming down, arms crossed in front of her chest, with two other arms reaching forward, and two more arms reaching up towards the moon - the idea was to see which pair of arms was better, and the others would be erased. But as I mentioned earlier, she died before making a final decision; and now they still keep that painting hanging over her bed in her room. Every year on her birthday, they decorate that painting with flowers. There used to be a curtain covering it. The young woman in the painting has a small and pretty face, but because of the many arms, she looks like a spider, that's how I see it.",18.538,18.354,"There were paintings hanging on the walls – mostly Washingtons and Lafayettes, wars, Highland Marys, and also ""The Signing of the Declaration of Independence"". There were also pencil drawings, one of which was made by one of their deceased daughters when she was just fifteen years old. These were different from all the pictures I had seen so far; they were darker in color than all of them. In one of them, there was a woman in a thin black dress. The dress was cinched at the armpits with a belt, the cuffs were puffed up like cabbage, and there was a black veil in front of the shovel-like brimmed hat on her head, black ribbons were tied around her white thin wrists, and she wore small black slippers resembling chisels on her feet. The woman was standing pensively with her right elbow resting on a tombstone, under a weeping willow, and in her other hand hanging by her side, a white handkerchief and a handbag could be seen, and beneath the picture, it said, ""Alas, I Shall Never See You Again. "" In another picture, there was a young woman with her hair beautifully done up in a bun on top of her head, with a comb resembling a chair back attached behind the bun. She was crying, holding a handkerchief to her face with one hand, and in her other hand lay a dead bird with its claws up; beneath this picture, it said, ""Alas, I Shall Never Hear Your Sweet Song Again. ""In another picture, a young lady was looking at the moon through a window, with tears streaming down her cheeks; in one hand, she held an open letter sealed with black, and with the other hand, she was bringing a medallion on a chain to her lips. The inscription beneath this picture read: ""Ah, You Are Gone, Alas, You Are Gone."" These were probably beautiful pictures, but they weren't quite to my taste; because whenever I felt a bit down, looking at these pictures made me feel even worse. Everyone was very sad about the girl's death because she could have made many more of these pictures, and people realized what they had missed by looking at what she had done. But judging by the tendency in the pictures, she probably had a better time in the cemetery. They said that when she fell ill, she was working on her greatest piece and prayed day and night to stay alive until she finished it, but she never got the chance to complete it. This picture was of a young woman in a long white dress; she was standing ready to jump over the railings of a bridge, her hair let loose, looking at the moon with tears streaming down her face. She had her arms crossed over her chest, her arms extended forward, and she was reaching both towards the moon – she would later erase the other arms, deciding which looked better; but as I said, she died before making a decision, and now they keep this picture at the head of her bed in her room; they hung flowers on the picture on her every birthday. At other times, they covered it with a small curtain. The young woman in the picture had a beautiful and sweet face, but having so many arms made her look a bit like a spider to me.",21.464,21.282,"On the walls, they had hung pictures mostly of Washington and Lafayette and battles and Mary, Queen of Scots, and another one called The Signing of the Declaration. There were some called pastels, made by one of the daughters, who had died when she was only fifteen years old. They were different from all the pictures I had seen before: almost all darker than what you usually see. One was of a woman in a tight black dress, with a belt under her armpits and bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves and a large black hat shaped like a coif, with a black veil and thin white ankles bandaged with a black ribbon and very small black slippers, like spatulas, and she was leaning thoughtfully on a cemetery slab, resting on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, with the other hand hanging down to one side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and under the picture, a sign said ""I will never see you again, alas. "" Another was of a young lady with her hair all styled in a pompadour and made into a bun and tied at the back with a large comb like the back of a chair, crying into a handkerchief, and in the other hand, she held a dead bird on its back with its legs up, and under the picture, it said ""I will never hear your sweet trill again, alas. "" There was another where a young lady was looking at the moon through a window, and tears were streaming down her cheeks, and in one hand, she held an open letter with a black wax seal on the edge, and she was bringing a locket with a chain to her mouth, and under the picture, it said ""And you are gone, yes, you are gone, alas. ""I guess those pictures were of great merit, but I don't know why I didn't like them, because when I was feeling a bit down, they always gave me the creeps. Everyone was very sad because she had died, because she had many more pictures left to paint, and from the ones she had already painted, you could see what they had lost. But I figured that with that state of mind, she would be much better off in the cemetery. She was painting what they said was going to be her best picture when she got sick, and every day and every night she prayed to stay alive until she finished it, but she didn't get the chance. It was a picture of a girl in a long white dress, standing on the railing of a bridge and ready to jump, with her hair loose down her back looking at the moon, her face bathed in tears, with two arms crossed over her chest, two arms extended in front, and two arms reaching towards the moon, and the idea was to see which pair of arms would look best and then erase all the others, but as I was saying, she died before deciding, and now they had that picture above the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday came, they put flowers all around it. The rest of the time, it was covered with a curtain. The girl in the picture had a kind and pleasant face, but to me, it seemed that so many arms gave her a bit of a spider-like look.",32.063,31.936

745,"If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen, there ain’t no telling what she could a done by-and-by. Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn’t ever have to stop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn’t find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead. She warn’t particular; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful. Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with her “tribute” before he was cold. She called them tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker—the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person’s name, which was Whistler. She warn’t ever the same after that; she never complained, but she kinder pined away and did not live long. Poor thing, many’s the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little. I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn’t going to let anything come between us. Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive, and it didn’t seem right that there warn’t nobody to make some about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn’t seem to make it go somehow. They kept Emmeline’s room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there. The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly.","If Miss Emmeline Grangerford could write such poems at the age of fourteen, one wonders what she might have accomplished later on. Buck said that she could scribble out a poem as easily as playing. She was always thinking. He said she would jot down a line, and if she couldn't find another line to rhyme with it, she would erase it immediately and come up with another one, and so on. She had a particular liking for something, could write anything she chose, and if you asked her to write something, she would. But it had to be sad poetry. Whenever someone died, whether a man, woman, or child, she would write something to mourn the deceased before the body turned cold. She called these eulogies. The neighbors said that in order, it was first the doctor, then Emmeline, and they would arrive at the same time. Then she would enthusiastically come up with a rhyme for the deceased's name, calling it a Whistler. Later on, she gradually changed, never complained, but she kept wasting away and couldn't live any longer. It's so sad, many times I went up to the room where she used to work, took out her notebook to look at, and seeing the pictures she drew made me feel sad and pity her. I loved this family, even the deceased, all of them, and I didn't let anything happen. Poor Miss Emmeline, when she was alive, she wrote poems about the dead, but no one wrote any poems about her. So, I tried to rack my brain to think of a few lines, but I couldn't come up with anything. This family kept Miss Emmeline's room very clean and tidy, and everything was left as she liked it when she was alive, and no one slept there. Her mother herself cleaned and took care of this room, even though there were many black servants in the house. She would go into this room to sew and often read prayers there.",16.925,16.594,"If Emmeline Grangerford could write such poetry before she was fourteen, it was hard to imagine what she could write in the future. According to Buck, she could easily make up a poem in one go. She didn't even need to stop and think. He said that if she wrote a line and couldn't find a rhyme, she would immediately erase that line and write another one, and continue like that. Moreover, she wasn't fixated on a single topic; whatever you told her to write about, she could write on that topic, as long as it was sorrowful. Whenever a man, woman, or child died, she would come up with a piece expressing her love and respect for that person before the funeral had even cooled down. According to the neighbors, when someone died, first the doctor, then Emmeline, and then the undertaker would come; the undertaker had only once arrived before Emmeline. As a result, Emmeline, who was shaken by this, had delayed writing for the deceased person named Whistler. After that, the girl was never the same; she never complained, but she wasted away day by day and didn't live much longer. Poor thing; many times when her pictures disturbed me and I started to think of her less, I forced myself to go to the little room that used to be hers, and took out her wretched notebook to read what she had written. I loved everyone in the family, dead or alive, and I wouldn't allow anything to come between us. Poor Emmeline had written poems about all the dead while she was alive, and now that she was gone, it didn't seem right to me that no one would write anything for her; so I tried to write a few verses, but somehow I just couldn't manage it. They always kept Emmeline's room clean and tidy, everything inside was just as she liked it when she was alive, and no one slept in that room. Despite having a lot of black servants, the old woman cleaned the room herself, sewed a lot there, and usually read her Holy Bible there as well.",20.879,20.612,"If Emmeline Grangerford was capable of writing poetry like that before she turned fourteen, God knows what she could have done with time. Buck said that poetry came to her with complete ease. She didn't even have to stop to think. He said she would write a line and if she couldn't find anything that rhymed, she would cross it out and write another and keep going. She wasn't picky at all; she could write about anything someone gave her as a topic, as long as it was sad. Every time a man, or a woman, or a child died, there she was with her ""tribute"" before the corpse had even cooled down. She called them tributes. The neighbors said that first the doctor arrived, then Emmeline, and then the undertaker; the undertaker only beat Emmeline once, and that was because she couldn't find a way to rhyme with the name of someone named Whistler. From then on, she was never the same; she never complained, but she started to become melancholic and didn't live much longer. Poor thing; I would often go up to the little room that had been hers and take out her poor scrapbook and read it when her pictures had irritated me and I felt a bit angry with her. I liked that whole family, the dead and all, and I wasn't going to let anything come between us. Poor Emmeline wrote poetry for all the dead when she was alive, and it didn't seem right to me that there was no one to write one for her now that she was dead; so I tried to write one or two for her, but I don't know why they didn't come out. They always kept Emmeline's room tidy and clean, with everything exactly as she liked it when she was alive, and no one ever slept there. The old lady took care of the room herself, even though there were many black servants, and she spent a lot of time sewing and reading the Bible, mostly.",33.173,32.97

749,"Col. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all over; and so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and that’s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn’t no more quality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn’t no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn’t ever loud. He was as kind as he could be—you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards. He didn’t ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners—everybody was always good-mannered where he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always—I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn’t nothing go wrong again for a week.","Colonel Grangerford was an aristocrat, you see. He was an aristocrat in every way: so was his whole family. He came from a noble background, as people often say, and that is as valuable for a person as it is for a horse; as Widow Douglas used to say, and no one could deny that she was the top aristocrat in the province. My father used to say the same thing, although my father was no more valuable than a stray cat. Colonel Grangerford was tall but slender. He had a dusky, oily complexion, and his whole face lacked any rosy hue. Every morning, he shaved his entire gaunt face smooth. He had the thinnest lips, the smallest nostrils, a prominent nose, bushy eyebrows, the blackest eyes set so deep it seemed as if they were looking at you from a dark cavern, so to speak. His forehead was high, his hair grizzled, straight, and hanging down to his shoulders. His hands were both thin and long. Throughout his life, each day he wore a white undershirt and a suit made entirely of white flannel, dazzling to the eyes. Then on Sundays, he added a blue tailcoat with brass buttons. He carried a peachwood cane with a silver handle. He never appeared careless in the slightest, nor did he ever show anger towards anyone. He tried to be good to everyone, and you could feel that, which made you trust him. Occasionally, he smiled, and it was truly charming. But when he stood up straight like the Statue of Liberty, and a gleam began to shine from beneath his eyebrows, you might want to find a tree to climb up immediately, knowing something was about to happen. He didn't need to tell people to behave - yet wherever he went, everyone was obedient. Everyone liked having him around - he was like sunlight - I mean to say, it was like encountering good weather. When the sun went behind a cloud, it darkened for half a minute, and that was all. Then for about a week, nothing happened at all.",16.995,16.709,"Colonel Grangerford was a true nobleman.

His forehead was broad, and his black, straight hair reached down to his shoulders. His hands were long and thin; he wore a clean shirt every day and walked around in a snow-white linen suit; the suit was so white it dazzled the eyes. On Sundays, however, he wore a navy blue frock coat with brass buttons. He carried a mahogany cane with a silver knob. There was not a trace of frivolity in his demeanor, not at all; he was never seen raising his voice. A person could not be more kind-hearted – you felt this and trusted him. Sometimes he would smile, and seeing this smile made one feel very good; but sometimes he would stand as erect as a flagpole symbolizing freedom, and glare so fiercely from under his eyebrows that you felt like climbing a tree first and then asking what the matter was. He never needed to remind anyone of manners – everyone behaved politely in his presence. Moreover, everyone enjoyed having him around; he was almost always sunny – that is, you always felt like the weather was nice when he was around.

Every time one of them peeked out from the river side of the woodpile, they got shot. The two boys stood back to back behind the wood, so they could shoot in all directions.",32.616,31.694
820,"By-and-by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. They started riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. All the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the run. They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed. Then the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them. They gained on the boys, but it didn’t do no good, the boys had too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again. One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old.","After a while, they stopped running around and shouting. They headed towards the warehouse. Immediately, a boy stood up and fired a shot from the pile of wood, hitting one of the group who fell off his horse. They quickly jumped off their horses to pick up the injured person and take him back to the warehouse, just as the other two boys started to run away. The two boys had run halfway from there to where I was hiding when suddenly the others saw them and immediately mounted their horses to give chase. They almost caught up, but it was no use; the two boys ran very fast and quickly slipped into the pile of wood right in front of the tree where I was hiding. That gave them an advantage over the others. One of the two boys was Buck, while the other was a skinny boy about nineteen years old.",13.325,12.485,"After a while, the men stopped shouting and yelling around. They rode their horses towards the warehouse; at that moment, one of the boys stood up, took aim from the top of the woodpile, and shot one of the riders. The men immediately dismounted and dragged the wounded one by the arm towards the warehouse; just then, two boys started to run away. The boys did not attract attention until they were halfway to the tree I was sitting on. Then the men saw them, jumped on their horses, and chased after them. The men were coming fast, but they still couldn't catch up, because the boys were too far away; they reached the woodpile in front of my tree and took cover behind it again. One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slender young man around nineteen years old.",25.041,24.522,"A while passed and the men stopped circling and shouting. They started running towards the warehouse, and then one of the boys aimed steadily over the wood and knocked one of them off his horse. All the men dismounted from their horses, grabbed the injured man, and began carrying him towards the warehouse, and at that moment the two boys started running. They were halfway to the tree where I was before the men noticed. Then they saw them and jumped on their horses and raced after them. They were gaining ground on the boys, but it didn't help because the boys had a good lead; they reached the pile of wood in front of my tree and hid behind it, so they were protected from the men again. One of the boys was Buck and the other was a thin boy about nineteen years old.",31.493,31.057
821,"The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. As soon as they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. He didn’t know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first. He was awful surprised. He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or other—wouldn’t be gone long. I wished I was out of that tree, but I dasn’t come down. Buck begun to cry and rip, and ’lowed that him and his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this day yet. He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two or three of the enemy. Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush. Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations—the Shepherdsons was too strong for them. I asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia. He said they’d got across the river and was safe. I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because he didn’t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him—I hain’t ever heard anything like it.","Those people rummaged around for a while and then left. As soon as they were out of sight, I called out to Buck. At first, he came out. He was surprised and scared. Then he told me to keep a close watch and let him know if those people came back. He said those people had some sort of scheme and would definitely come back. I wanted to leave this tree, but I didn't dare to. Suddenly, Buck burst into tears and said that he and his cousin Joe (the one who ran with him) would have to keep hiding all day. He said his father and two brothers were all killed, and that two or three people on the enemy's side were also killed. He said the Shepherdsons had set up an ambush. He said his father and two brothers fought while waiting for their relatives to arrive, but the Shepherdsons were too strong. I asked what had happened to Harney and Miss Sophia. He said the two had crossed the river to the other side and were safe. I was very happy to hear that. But Buck wasn't; he was very upset thinking about how he couldn't kill Harney the other day in the forest. I had never seen anything like that before.",19.938,19.474,"The men wandered around the area a bit more, then they left. As soon as they disappeared from sight, I informed Buck. At first, he couldn't understand why my voice was coming from a tree. He was very surprised. He told me to keep my eyes wide open and to inform him if I saw the men again; they were certainly up to something – they wouldn't stay away for long. I wished I wasn't at the top of the tree, I thought, but I didn't dare to come down either. Buck started to cry and lament, while also venting his anger; he said that he and his cousin Joe (that is, the other boy) would settle today's account. His father and two brothers had died, and they had taken care of two or three of the enemy. It turned out that the Shepherdsons had lain in ambush waiting for them. According to Buck, his father and brothers should have waited for their relatives – the Shepherdsons had turned out to be too strong. I asked what had happened to young Harney and Miss Sophia. They had crossed the river and were safe. I was glad about that; but Buck was grumbling that he hadn't finished Harney off when he fired that day – I had never heard him talk like that before.",22.469,22.049,"The men circled for a while and then left. As soon as they were out of sight, I called Buck to see me. At first, he didn't understand why my voice was coming from a tree. He was very surprised. He told me to stay very alert and to let him know when the men reappeared; he said they were up to something and wouldn't take long. I preferred to leave that tree, but I didn't dare to come down. Buck started shouting and cursing, and swore that he and his cousin Joe (who was the other boy) would get revenge that very day. He said they had killed his father and two brothers and that two or three of the enemies had died. He said the Shepherdsons had ambushed them. Buck added that his father and brothers should have waited for their relatives because the Shepherdsons were too many for them. I asked him what was going to happen to young Harney and Miss Sophia. He replied that they had already crossed the river and were safe. I was glad, but Buck was furious for not having killed Harney the day he shot at him; in my life, I have never heard anyone say such things.",28.738,28.354
822,"All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns—the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses! The boys jumped for the river—both of them hurt—and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out, “Kill them, kill them!” It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree. I ain’t a-going to tell all that happened—it would make me sick again if I was to do that. I wished I hadn’t ever come ashore that night to see such things.

And while the two of them swam downstream, the others ran to the riverbank and shot at them, shouting ""Kill them, kill them."" I was so pained by what I heard that I almost fell from the tree. I dare not recount what happened afterward because it is too heartbreaking to speak of.

I won’t tell you everything that happened – otherwise, I’ll feel bad again. I keep thinking to myself, if only I hadn’t gone ashore that night, if only I hadn’t seen these things.

I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my mind I wouldn’t ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I was to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess wouldn’t ever happened.","I stayed up in the treetop until dusk, too scared to climb down.

831,"I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and judged that we was free and safe once more.

I ate and chatted with Jim very happily. I was glad to have escaped the plantation; and Jim was also glad to have escaped the swamp.

833,"Two or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by, they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. Here is the way we put in the time. It was a monstrous big river down there—sometimes a mile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up—nearly always in the dead water under a tow-head; and then cut young cottonwoods and willows, and hid the raft with them. Then we set out the lines. Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound anywheres—perfectly still—just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe. The first thing to see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull line—that was the woods on t’other side; you couldn’t make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and warn’t black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far away—trading scows, and such things; and long black streaks—rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by-and-by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there’s a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t’other side of the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way, because they’ve left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next you’ve got the full day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!","A few more days and nights passed; I think it can be said that I passed those nights, gliding through them, in a peaceful, gentle, and poetic manner. Here, we passed those days and hours like this. The river was both large and wide - in some places up to a mile, a mile and a half. We traveled day and night looking for a secluded spot to sleep. Near the end of the night, we would stop rowing, find a calm spot near a creek to tie the raft, then cut some wildflower branches or willow branches to cover the raft, and cast the fishing line. Then we would jump into the river to bathe, refreshing and invigorating ourselves. Then we would sit and wait on some sandy bank with water up to our knees, waiting for the daylight to come. All around, there was not a sound, complete tranquility, as if the entire world was asleep. Occasionally, we might hear the croaking of frogs. The first thing seen on the other side of the water was just a long, silent row of trees, nothing else could be seen. Then a faint light appeared in the sky, gradually spreading, making the river seem even wider; it was no longer black but grayish. In the distance, we could see black dots floating downstream, drifting endlessly, perhaps sailboats or something, long black objects from the rafts. Sometimes we could hear the splash of oars or the murmur of voices. It was so quiet that the sounds echoed far away. Occasionally, we would see a streak on the water; looking closely, we could recognize it as a tree uprooted and drifting, appearing like that, then mist would roll into coils on the water. In the east, the sky began to redden, then the river, and perhaps the wooden hut on the edge of the forest across the river, maybe a wooden basket of some sort, if suspected of containing something, a dog could be sent in to sniff around. Then a cool breeze would blow, feeling refreshing, gentle, with a fragrant scent of wood and forest flowers. But sometimes, instead, there would be the smell of dead fish around, rising up, pungent and strong. After that, it would be fully daylight. Everything seemed to smile under the sun, and the birds chirped merrily.",10.737,10.38,"Two or three more days and nights passed; or perhaps I should say flowed by, meaning they passed so quietly, smoothly, and pleasantly. Let me tell you how the time passed. As we went downstream, the river reached an immense width – in some places it was about a mile and a half; we traveled at night and stopped to hide during the day; in the last moments of darkness, we would move out of the current and tie up the raft. Almost every time, we would pull up to an island in the still water, then hide the raft nicely with poplar saplings and willow branches. Then we would cast our fishing lines. We would go into the river and swim a bit, thus both cleaning and cooling ourselves; we would watch the sunrise from a sandy spot where the water came up to our knees. There was not a sound around – complete silence – it was as if the whole world was asleep, only occasionally interrupted by the sound of frogs. When you looked at the horizon over the water, the first thing you saw was a dull line – this was the line of the forest on the opposite shore – nothing else could be distinguished; a pale band appeared in the sky above it; then it spread upward; then the color of the river lightened; it gradually turned from black to gray; you could see small black dots drifting away, continuously moving farther – these were barges and similar things; and there were long black streaks – rafts; sometimes we would hear the creak of an oar or indistinct conversations; it was so quiet that sounds from very far away would reach us; after a while, lines would start to appear on the water, and by looking at the position of the lines, you could tell that there were trees under the water with a fast current passing over them; you could also see the mist gathering and lifting off the surface of the water, the eastern side turning red, the river turning red, and you could make out a log cabin at the edge of the forest, most likely a wood depot on the other side of the river. Then a fresh breeze would come up and cool you, bringing the pleasant scents of the forest and flowers to your nose; but sometimes it wasn't so nice, because it would expose dead garfish or other fish, and as they rotted, they would smell really awful; then the day would fully break; everything would be smiling in the sunlight and the birds would start chirping madly!",13.188,12.87,"Two or three days and nights passed; I think I could say they swam by, so calm, smooth, and wonderful they slipped away. I'm going to tell you how we spent our time. The river was monstrously large there: in some places, it was a mile and a half wide; we navigated at night and rested and hid during the day; as soon as the night was about to end, we stopped navigating and moored, almost always in the still water under a landing place, and then we cut young poplars and willows and hid the raft underneath. Then we cast the fishing lines. Later, we would go into the river to swim for a while, to wash and refresh ourselves; then we would sit on the sandy bottom, where the water reached our knees, and wait for daylight to come. There wasn't a sound anywhere, everything was in absolute silence, as if the whole world had fallen asleep, except perhaps sometimes the croaking of frogs. The first thing you saw, if you looked over the water, was a kind of blurry line that was the forests on the other side; nothing else could be distinguished; then a pale spot in the sky and more paleness appearing, and then the river, soft and distant, which was no longer black but gray; you could see black spots drifting far away: barges and other boats, and long black lines that were rafts; sometimes you heard the creak of an oar, or voices mingled in the silence that made sounds carry from very far away; and after a while, you saw a line in the water, and by its color, you knew there was a current under the surface breaking it and making that line appear; and then you saw the mist floating as it rose from the water and the East turned red, and the river, and you saw a log cabin at the edge of the forest, over there on the other side of the river, which was probably a sawmill, and next to it, piles of wood with gaps made by some vagabonds, so a dog could pass through; then a nice breeze came from the other side, fresh and gentle, smelling very good because it came from the forest and flowers; but sometimes it wasn't like that because someone had left dead fish lying around, pikes and all that, and they smelled a lot, and then full daylight came and everything smiled at the sun, and the birds began to sing.",20.466,20.226
834,"A little smoke couldn’t be noticed now, so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast. And afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by-and-by lazy off to sleep. Wake up by-and-by, and look to see what done it, and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the other side you couldn’t tell nothing about her only whether she was a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn’t be nothing to hear nor nothing to see—just solid lonesomeness. Next you’d see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it chopping, because they’re most always doing it on a raft; you’d see the axe flash and come down—you don’t hear nothing; you see that axe go up again, and by the time it’s above the man’s head then you hear the k’chunk!—it had took all that time to come over the water. So we would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness. Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn’t run over them. A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing—heard them plain; but we couldn’t see no sign of them; it made you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air. Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:","At this moment, even if a little smoke rises, no one can see it. We lifted a few fish at the end of the line to make a hot meal. Then we sat back down to watch the deserted river. People started to get tired, and we lay down to sleep. From time to time, we woke up and looked outside to see if there was anything. Perhaps it was a boat laboriously climbing upstream on the far side of the river; from a distance, it was impossible to tell if it was a stern-wheeler or had paddle wheels on both sides. Then another hour passed, with nothing to see or hear, just silence. Later, a raft drifted by on the outer edge. Perhaps there was a guy on the raft chopping wood, because they often chop wood right on the raft. From inside here, they could see the glint of the axe being raised, and just as the axe was lifted above his head, there was a thud, a sound that took a moment to travel over the water before reaching our ears. Then we lay back down, listening to the quiet return. Once, in thick fog, boats and rafts had to clang pots and pans to avoid being hit by steamships. A ferry or raft or something passed by us, so close that we could clearly hear them talking, swearing, and laughing loudly, even though we couldn't see anything, as if we were blindfolded; it really felt like ghostly voices drifting through the air. Jim said maybe they really were ghosts. I said:",7.94,7.219,"We were preparing a warm breakfast with some of the fish caught on the lines, thinking a little smoke wouldn't attract attention anymore. Then we would watch the solitude of the river for a while; laze around; gradually get drowsy and eventually fall asleep. Then we would wake up to a noise and see a steamboat coughing its way upriver, but it would be on the other side of the river and so far away that it was impossible to tell whether its paddle wheel was on the side or the stern. Then for about an hour, nothing else would be heard or seen – just solitude. Then you would see a raft passing in the distance, perhaps with an inexperienced raftsman cutting wood on it, because such types always cut wood on the raft; you would see the axe glint as it rises and falls – but you wouldn't hear anything; then the axe rises again; as it reaches above the man's head, you hear the thud! sound, it takes that long for the sound to reach you over the water. That's how we spent the day, lazing around, listening intently to the silence. Once, a thick fog descended, and people on rafts and barges were clanging pots and pans to avoid being hit by steamboats as they moved along. A barge or raft passed so close to us that we could hear the people inside cursing and laughing – we could clearly understand what they were saying; but we couldn't see them for even a moment; this sent chills down our spines, as if we were listening to the voices of spirits gliding through the air. Jim even said he believed they were spirits.",11.774,11.196,"At that hour, it didn't matter to make a little smoke because it couldn't be seen, so we took the fish off the lines and prepared a hot breakfast. And then we would contemplate the solitude of the river and laze around, and little by little we would fall asleep. We would wake up, and when we looked to find out why, sometimes we saw a steamboat puffing upriver, so far on the other side that the only thing you could see was whether it had the wheel at the stern or on the sides; then, for an hour there was nothing to hear or see: only solitude. Then we would see a raft gliding in the distance, and sometimes one of the guys on board chopping wood, because that's what they almost always do on rafts, and you could see the axe shining and coming down, but you couldn't hear anything; you would see the axe rise again, and when it was above the man's head, then you would hear the chop, which had taken all that time to cross the water. And so we spent the day, lazing around, listening to the silence. Once a dense fog came down, and the rafts and everything that passed by made noise with pans so that the steamboats wouldn't overlook them. A skiff or a raft would pass so close that we could hear what the people on board were saying, their curses and their laughter, we could hear them perfectly, but we couldn't see any sign of them; it was a very strange feeling, as if they were spirits talking in the air. Jim said he thought they were, but I said:",17.388,16.969

836,"Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and talked about all kinds of things—we was always naked, day and night, whenever the mosquitoes would let us—the new clothes Buck’s folks made for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn’t go much on clothes, nohow.","Then it wouldn't be long before night came again, and we would set off once more. Once the raft reached the middle of the river, we let it drift, letting the current take us wherever it wanted. We lit our cigarettes, dangled our feet in the water, and talked about all sorts of things. All day and all night, we went shirtless, not caring about the mosquitoes. The outfit that Mrs. Buck's family made for me was so nice that it became inconvenient to wear. Besides, I didn't pay much attention to clothes anyway.",15.033,13.972,"Before long, it got dark and we had moved away from the shore. When we reached the middle of the river, we stopped rowing and the raft continued to float downstream with the current; then we lit our pipes, stretched our feet into the water, and started chatting about this and that. Whenever we got a break from the mosquitoes, we were always naked; the clothes Buck's family gave me were so high-quality that I couldn't feel comfortable in them, and besides, I don't really like fussing over my clothes.",10.765,9.214,"As soon as it was night, we would head to the river; when we had the raft approximately in the center, we would do nothing and let it float wherever the current took it; then we would light our pipes and dip our legs in the water and talk about all sorts of things; we were always naked, day and night, when the mosquitoes allowed us; the new clothes that Buck's family had made for me were too good to be comfortable; anyway, I didn't really like wearing clothes much either.",25.733,24.847
837,"Sometimes we’d have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe a spark—which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two—on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts. It’s lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would have took too long to make so many. Jim said the moon could a laid them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn’t say nothing against it, because I’ve seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they’d got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.","Sometimes it feels like this whole river belongs to us. Looking across the water, far away on the other side is the riverbank, and the island, and perhaps there is a light, a candle flame in the window frame. Sometimes there are also a few lights on the water's surface. Those are the lights on the rafts or ferries, and perhaps we can even hear the sound of a violin or singing echoing out. Living on a raft or a float, how interesting it is. Above us, there is only the high sky, dotted with stars, and we often lie on our backs looking up at the sky, debating with each other about who made those stars, and I just say they exist on their own. I said if someone made that many stars, it would surely take a lot of time. Jim said the moon gave birth to those stars. Well, it makes sense, so I couldn't say anything to refute that theory. And since I've seen frogs lay a lot of eggs, it could be that the moon gave birth to those stars. We also often look at shooting stars, watching their trails stretch down to the horizon. Jim said those are the bad stars, flying away from their nest.",10.015,9.355,"Sometimes there would be no one else on the river for a very long time except us. We would see the shores and islands ahead; maybe a spark – a candle seen from a cabin window – would catch our eye; sometimes we would see one or two sparks on the water – on a raft or a barge; sometimes we would hear the sound of a violin or someone singing from one of the river vessels. Living on the raft was very beautiful. The sky above would be speckled with stars, and we would lie on our backs and watch the stars, debating whether they were made or if they appeared suddenly – according to Jim, they were made, but I thought they appeared suddenly; in my opinion, there were too many of them to be made one by one. Jim had said that the moon might have laid them; well, since this seemed reasonable, I didn't object, because I had seen a frog with as many offspring as there were stars, so this was something that could happen. We would also see shooting stars and watch them descend. According to Jim, these were the rotten ones and that's why they were picked out and fell from the nest.",14.305,13.694,"Sometimes we had the whole river to ourselves for very long stretches. In the distance, we could see the banks and the islands on the other side of the water, and sometimes a spark that was a light in the window of a cabin, and sometimes in the middle of the water, we saw a spark or two: you know, a raft or a skiff, and you could hear a violin or a song coming from one of those boats.

Above us, we had the sky, all speckled with stars, and we would lie on our backs, look at them, and discuss whether someone had made them or if they had just appeared on their own. Jim always said that they had been made, but I maintained that they had just appeared; it seemed to me it would take too long to make so many. Jim said that the moon might have put them there; well, that seemed quite reasonable, so I didn't say anything against it, because I've seen frogs lay almost as many eggs, so it was certainly possible. We also watched the falling stars and saw the trail they left behind. Jim said it was because they had misbehaved and had been thrown out of the nest.",26.479,26.108
838,"Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by-and-by her waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the raft a bit, and after that you wouldn’t hear nothing for you couldn’t tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.","A few times during the dark hours, we would encounter passing ships, occasionally they would emit a whole sky full of sparks from their chimneys, and then those sparks would fall like rain onto the river, looking incredibly beautiful. Then it would turn to another direction, its twinkling lights gradually fading, its chugging sounds also quieting down, and the river would return to silence. A moment later, when the ship had gone far away, its waves would reach us, causing the raft to bob slightly; then we wouldn't hear anything anymore, and it was impossible to tell how long it had been. Perhaps only a few sounds of frogs or something else remained.",5.927,4.475,"Every night, we would see a steamship moving in the dark once or twice, spewing countless sparks from its chimney, and as the sparks descended burning onto the river, it would create a magnificent view; then, as the ship turned a corner, its lights would disappear from sight, its noise would cease, and the river would become silent again; long after it had vanished, its waves would slowly reach us and gently rock the raft, and then you would hear nothing, there would be a long silence of indeterminate length, interrupted only by frogs or similar sounds.",9.199,7.284,"At night we would see one or two steamboats passing in the darkness, and every now and then they would send out a whole world of sparks from one of the chimneys, which fell into the river and looked beautiful; then the boat would round a bend and the lights would wink and the noise of the boat would disappear, leaving the river silent again, and then the waves it had raised would reach us, long after the boat had disappeared, causing the raft to move a little, and then nothing could be heard for who knows how long, except maybe the frogs or things like that.",16.304,15.202

840,"One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shore—it was only two hundred yards—and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn’t get some berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it. I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was after anybody I judged it was me—or maybe Jim. I was about to dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung out and begged me to save their lives—said they hadn’t been doing nothing, and was being chased for it—said there was men and dogs a-coming. They wanted to jump right in, but I says:","One morning, just as the sun was rising, I found a boat, rowed through a swift current to reach the main shore, only a few hundred yards away. Then I rowed about half a mile further to a spot with bushes near a pine forest to see if I could find any berries. As I reached a narrow path just wide enough for cattle to pass through, suddenly two people came running out from that small path. I thought to myself, this is trouble, because if anyone is looking for someone here, it could only be me or Jim. I was about to slip away when those people ran up close, calling me and begging me to save them. They said they hadn't done anything wrong, yet people were chasing them.

So Jim and I started calling him your majesty, doing this and that for him, and standing until he told us we could sit. What we did made him feel very good, he became a cheerful and relaxed man again. But this time the duke was frowning; he didn't seem at all pleased with the turn of events; still, the king was really friendly to him, saying that his father loved the duke's great-great-grandfather and the other Dukes of Bridgewater very much and often invited them to the palace; but when the duke couldn't shake off his resentment for a while, the king finally said:",19.654,19.24,"Well, he burst into tears and got so upset that neither Jim nor I knew what to do, feeling both sorry for him and at the same time happy and proud that he was on the raft with us. So we set to work, just as we had done before with the duke, and tried to console him as well. But he said it was no use, that the only thing that could console him was to die once and for all and end everything; although he said that sometimes he felt more comfortable and better if people treated him according to his rights, knelt down to speak to him, always called him ""your majesty"" and served him first at meals and did not sit in his presence until he said so. So Jim and I started to ""majesty"" him, doing everything he asked of us and standing until he told us we could sit down. That made him feel really good and he became very cheerful and happy. But the duke seemed to get angry with him and didn't seem at all satisfied with how things were going; but the king was very friendly with him and said that the duke's great-grandfather and all the other dukes of Aguassucias had the highest regard for his father and could visit the palace many times, but the duke remained angry for quite a while, until finally the king goes and says:",24.241,23.876

So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see what the beds was like. My bed was a straw tick better than Jim’s, which was a corn-shuck tick; there’s always cobs around about in a shuck tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it makes such a rustling that you wake up.

The inside of my mattress was filled with straw and it was more comfortable than Jim's corn husk mattress; the husks would remain inside the mattress, poke your back, and hurt you; moreover, when you turned in bed, the dried husks would make a sound as if you were lying in a pile of dry leaves; they would creak so much that you would wake up.

898,"We got away as soon as it was good and dark. The king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town. We come in sight of the little bunch of lights by-and-by—that was the town, you know—and slid by, about a half a mile out, all right. When we was three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o’clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night. It was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn’t a turned in anyway if I’d had a bed, because a body don’t see such a storm as that every day in the week, not by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did scream along! And every second or two there’d come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you’d see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a h-whack!—bum! bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum—and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit—and then rip comes another flash and another sockdolager. The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn’t any clothes on, and didn’t mind. We didn’t have no trouble about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them.","We set off when it was completely dark. The king ordered us to push the raft to the middle of the river and only light the lamps once we were far enough from the city. A while later, we saw clusters of flickering lights by the river. That was the town. The raft smoothly glided past about half a mile. After nearly a mile, we hung up the lamps. Around ten o'clock at night, it started pouring rain, the wind howled intermittently, and thunder rumbled. The king told the two of us to take turns keeping watch carefully until the weather cleared up completely. Meanwhile, he and the duke crawled into the tent to sleep. I had to keep watch until midnight. But even if I were in bed, I probably wouldn't be able to close my eyes. In fact, it hadn't rained and stormed like this all week. The wind howled intermittently, chillingly. Occasionally, a streak of lightning illuminated the white-tipped land mounds stretching about half a mile. But the island, seen through the rain, looked as if it were covered in a veil of dust. The trees seemed to be whirling in the wind. The sound of crackling and rumbling arose, then gradually spread out into the distance. Waves splashed strongly, soaking me completely on the raft. But since I wasn't wearing any clothes, I wasn't afraid of getting wet. Luckily, thanks to the flashes of lightning, we could see the submerged rocks from afar and avoided hitting them.",10.16,9.703,"As soon as it got dark enough, we set out immediately. The king told us to stay in the middle of the river and not to show any light until we had gone quite a bit downstream of the town. After a while, we saw a small cluster of lights – this cluster was the town – and we passed it without any trouble about half a mile offshore. When we had gone about three-quarters of a mile downstream, we put up the signal lantern; around ten o'clock, it started to rain, and lightning began to illuminate everything around; the king told us both to keep watch until the weather cleared up; then he and the duke went into the shelter to get ready to sleep. The watch on the downstream side was mine until twelve, but even if I had a bed to sleep in, I wouldn't have gone into the shelter; because you can't see such a storm every day, you don't even get the chance to watch it from a distance. My God, how the wind was howling! Almost every second, there was a flash of light illuminating the foamy waves around us within a half-mile distance; we could see blurry islands in the rain and trees flapping in the wind; then crack! – the thunder rumbled and roared away with crashes and booms, then it went silent – then another crack of lightning and again a thunder. The waves were so big they almost knocked me off the raft, but I didn't care since I had no clothes on. The bushes and such that the raft could get caught on were no trouble at all; there was so much lightning that we could see them well in advance and steer the raft around them.",16.951,16.551,"We left as soon as it was dark enough. The king told us to head towards the center of the river and not to show any light until we had passed far enough from the town. Soon we came into view of the small cluster of lights that was the town and we slipped by about half a mile away, everything perfectly, everything perfectly. When we were three-quarters of a mile further down, we used our signal lantern, and around ten it started to rain, blow, thunder, and lightning like the devil; so the king told us two to keep watch until the weather improved; then he and the duke crawled into the wigwam to spend the night. I was on watch until twelve, but I wouldn't have gone to bed even if I had one, because you don't see a storm like that every day, not by a long shot. Good heavens, how the wind howled! And every one or two seconds there was a flash that lit up the waves for half a mile around and the islands looked dusty in the rain and the trees swayed in the wind; then there was a brrruuum!... boom! boom! boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom! and the thunder rolled away growling and buzzing until it disappeared, and then, wham!, there was another flash and another crash. Sometimes the waves almost knocked me off the raft, but since I wasn't wearing anything, I didn't mind. We had no trouble with the logs coming down; the lightning lit everything up so we could see the logs coming with more than enough time to steer this way or that and avoid them.",23.238,22.902

I crawled into the wigwam, but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn’t no show for me; so I laid outside—I didn’t mind the rain, because it was warm, and the waves warn’t running so high now. About two they come up again, though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because he reckoned they warn’t high enough yet to do any harm; but he was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard.

Jim is always very good to me. I crawled into the tent, but the king and the duke were sprawled all over, leaving no room for me. I had to sleep outside the tent, despite the howling wind and rain. Around two o'clock, the waves became more violent. Jim intended to call me but decided not to because he thought the waves weren't too dangerous yet. But he was wrong, right after that, a big wave surged over my head. Jim looked at me and laughed heartily. The waves kept crashing and splashing all over me. Jim laughed so hard he almost burst. He was a black man who laughed easily, something I rarely encountered.",12.034,11.296,"The second watch was mine, but I was getting really sleepy, so Jim said he could take the first half of my watch; Jim has always been such a kind-hearted person. I bent down and went inside the shelter, but I couldn't find a place for myself because the king and the duke were lying with their legs spread out; so I went back outside – I didn't mind the rain because the weather was warm and the waves weren't rising that much anymore. Around two in the night, the waves rose again, Jim was about to call out to me, but then he changed his mind because he thought the waves hadn't risen enough to cause any harm yet; however, he was wrong about that, because a little later a giant wave came and knocked me into the water. Jim almost died laughing. I've never seen a black man who laughs so easily at everything in my life.",13.813,12.956,"It was my turn for the middle watch, you know, but by that time I was quite sleepy, so Jim said he would take the first half; Jim always behaved very well in that regard.

But around two o'clock they started rising again and Jim was going to call me, although he changed his mind because he figured they weren't high enough to do us any harm, but he was wrong because very soon one of those huge ones came and threw me into the water.

901,"The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.

He told them that he was a pirate, that he had been a pirate for thirty years in the Indian Ocean, and that he had almost lost his crew last spring in a fight and now he had come back home to take some new sailors, but thank God last night he had been robbed and landed from a steamboat without a penny, and now he was glad; it was the best thing that had ever happened to him in his life, because now he was a changed man and felt happy for the first time in his life, and despite how poor he was, he was going to start working immediately to return to the Indian Ocean and spend the rest of his life trying to bring pirates back to the path of truth, because he could do it better than anyone else, as he knew all the pirate crews in that ocean, and although it would take him a long time to get there without money, he would go anyway, and every time he convinced a pirate he would say: ""Don't thank me, don't give me any credit; it all belongs to those wonderful people at the Pokeville religious meeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and to that dear preacher you see there, the truest friend a pirate has ever had!""",42.238,42.018

Then somebody sings out, “Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!” Well, a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, “Let him pass the hat around!” Then everybody said it, the preacher too.","Seeing this, everyone else also cried. Then a few people shouted. - Let's raise money to help him! So, five or six people rushed over, but someone said: - Tell him to hold out his hat and we'll put money into it. Everyone else said the same, even the pastor.",4.426,2.409,"Then she burst into tears, and everyone else started crying too. Then I heard someone shout: ""Let's collect money for her, come on, reach into your pockets!""

Occasionally, a few beautiful girls, with tears streaming down their faces, would step forward and ask for an old kiss to remember. He agreed immediately, and some were hugged tightly and kissed five or six times by him. Then he was invited to stay for a week. Everyone wanted to invite him to their home, saying it was an honor for them. But he declined because he was in a hurry to return to the Indian Ocean to persuade his comrades.",12.96,12.147,"Upon this, the king wiped away his tears and began to walk among the crowd with his hat; meanwhile, he was praying for them, praising and thanking them for doing so much good for the poor pirates far away; from time to time, very cute girls would stand up with tears streaming down their cheeks, kiss him, and beg him to allow them to keep his memory; he never objected, sometimes hugging and kissing some of them five or six times – he was invited to stay in the town for a week; everyone wanted to host him in their home and said it would be an honor; but the king said that since it was the last day of the meeting, it was not necessary, and moreover, he was in a hurry to set sail immediately towards the Indian Ocean and work among the pirates.",21.413,20.723,"So the king walked among the people with his hat, wiping his eyes and blessing the people, praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates far away, and at every moment, the prettiest of the girls, all tearful, would come and ask him if they could kiss him to have a memory of him, and he always kissed them, and some of them he kissed and hugged at least five or six times, and they invited him to stay for a week, and everyone wanted him to sleep in their houses because they said it was an honor, but he said that since it was the last day of the mission, he could no longer do any good, and besides, he was in a hurry to get to the Indian Ocean as soon as possible and start working with the pirates.",32.199,31.672
923,"When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. And then he had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods.

He said it warn’t no use talking, heathens don’t amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.","Upon returning to the wooden raft, he counted a total of eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.

Additionally, he had found and taken a three-gallon whiskey barrel from under a car on the way home.

And he had got in ten dollars’ worth of advertisements for the paper, which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance—so they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of his own head—three verses—kind of sweet and saddish—the name of it was, “Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart”—and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper, and didn’t charge nothing for it. Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he’d done a pretty square day’s work for it.","The duke thought that he had done something even more interesting than the king. He had printed some things for a few landowners, like horse purchase papers, and received four dollars. Then he earned another ten dollars for advertising in a newspaper.

The price of the newspaper was two dollars a year, but he had subscribed three people for half a dollar each on the condition that they paid upfront; the men, as usual, wanted to pay with wood and onions, but he had said that he had recently acquired the printing press, had lowered the price as much as possible, and therefore would only accept cash. He had made up a three-stanza poem from his own mind; the poem, which gave a feeling both sweet and sorrowful, was titled, “Damn this broken heart of mine, oh merciless world.” He had prepared the type and made it ready to be printed in the newspaper and had not taken any money for it. In the end, he had pocketed nine and a half dollars and thought that was quite good for a day.",15.432,14.883,"The duke had thought he had done quite well until the king showed up, but afterward, it didn't seem so.

This is the speech—I learned it, easy enough, while he was learning it to the king:","The Duke walked up and down looking very thoughtful, his eyebrows raised high, making him look very fierce. Then he sighed deeply, a hot tear rolled down his cheek, looking quite ridiculous. A moment later, he remembered and told us to pay attention. With a noble gesture, one foot forward, both hands extended in front, head slightly tilted back, he then began to grind his teeth, speaking deliriously and emphasizing certain parts.",2.997,2.36,"Thinking about this, he began to walk back and forth, occasionally furrowing his brows in a terrifying manner; then he would raise his eyebrows, place his hand on his forehead, and step back with a groan; then he would sigh, and shed a tear. It was very enjoyable to watch him. Gradually, he remembered. He told us to pay attention. He took his most noble stance, put one foot forward, spread his arms, threw his head back and looked up to the sky; he began to shout and scream wildly and grind his teeth; then he recited the tirade howlingly, making gestures with his arms and puffing out his chest. Honestly, it was a performance that surpassed all the actors I had seen until that day. I can repeat his words exactly... I memorized them all easily while he was teaching the king: There is one more possibility, do you mean dying?",16.583,15.904,"So he dedicated himself to pacing up and down, thinking and frowning horribly at every moment; then he would raise his eyebrows; then he would press his forehead with his hand and lean back, as if groaning; then he would sigh and shed a tear. It was wonderful to see. Finally, he remembered. He told us to listen to him. He adopted a most noble posture, with one leg forward, arms extended, and head thrown back, looking at the sky, and began to shout, groan, and gnash his teeth, and after that, throughout his entire speech, he was howling and moving and puffing out his chest and the truth is that it was the most wonderful performance I have seen in my life.

1005,"Then we went loafing around the town. The stores and houses was most all old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn’t ever been painted; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little gardens around them, but they didn’t seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out tin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that didn’t generly have but one hinge—a leather one. Some of the fences had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in Clumbus’s time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and people driving them out.","We went around the town to put up advertisements. The houses and shops here are all old and dilapidated. The doors are cracked, dry, and have not been repainted. The floors of the houses are all higher than the street level by about a small garden plot, but not much is cultivated, just a few marigold and cockscomb flowers, the rest is cluttered with torn wires, broken glass, trash, and tin cans. The gate is made of various pieces of wood patched together, looking very shabby, the duke said it was from the time of Columbus or something. Sometimes, there are even herds of pigs rummaging around in the garden.",6.843,5.913,"Then we started wandering around the town. Almost all of the shops and houses were old, dilapidated, and had never seen a coat of paint. All the structures were raised about a meter above the ground on stilts, so they stayed in a place where the river couldn't reach when it flooded. There were tiny gardens around the houses, but it looked like nothing grew in them except weeds, sunflowers, piles of ash, old and misshapen boots and shoes, broken bottles, rags, and battered kitchenware. The fences were made by nailing different types of wood at different times; most were leaning forward or backward, and their gates usually had only a single hinge – which was made of leather straps. Some of the fences had once been painted white, but according to the duke, they were probably painted in Columbus's time. There were generally pigs in the gardens, and people were trying to get them out.",17.37,16.634,"Afterwards, we strolled around the city.

The houses had little gardens, but it didn't seem like they grew much in them, except for jimsonweed, sunflowers, and piles of ashes, along with boots, broken shoes, and pieces of bottles, rags, and useless cans. The fences were made of different types of boards, nailed at different times and each leaning to its own side, and the gates usually had no more than one leather hinge.

There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching—a mighty ornery lot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but didn’t wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill, and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and used considerable many cuss words. There was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands in his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch. What a body was hearing amongst them all the time was:","The shops run along the entire street. In front of each house, there is an awning where customers can tie their horses. Under those small awnings are wooden platforms, where idle people sit all day, itching to carve the platforms with their knives; chewing tobacco noisily, occasionally yawning out of boredom and wandering from place to place, hands in their pockets, only taking them out to scratch or ask for a cigarette.

Most of them wore wide straw hats like umbrellas on their heads, but they had no jackets or vests; they called each other Bill, Buck, Hank, Joe, Andy, and so on; they spoke lazily and slowly and swore so much that it was grating on the ears.

But it's enough for a half-man, like that one, Buck Harkness, to shout 'Lynch him, lynch him!' and you're scared to back down, you're scared to show what you are: cowards, and that's why you start shouting and hang on to the coattails of that half-man and come here shouting, swearing the enormities you're going to do. The most pitiful thing in the world is a mob of people; that's what an army is: a mob of people; it doesn't fight with its own courage, but with the courage given by belonging to a mob and by its officers. But a mob without a man at the head is less than pitiful. Now what you have to do is tuck your tails between your legs and go home to hide in a hole. If you really are going to lynch someone, you'll do it at night, Southern style, and when you come, you'll do it with masks and you'll bring a man. Now, get out and take your half-man with you. Upon saying this last thing, he slung the shotgun over his left arm and cocked it.",15.83,15.275

I could a staid if I wanted to, but I didn’t want to.","The whole crowd suddenly backed away, then gradually dispersed, and then ran in all directions. Even the cowardly Buck Harness ran along with the crowd.",5.501,3.72,"The crowd suddenly recoiled, scattering in different directions in a state of disarray, and Buck Harkness, with his spirit broken, scurried after them. I could have stayed if I wanted to, but I didn't want to stay.",25.189,23.378,"The group suddenly recoiled and then dispersed, each one hurriedly going their own way, and Buck Harkness followed them, looking quite defeated.

1054,"I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by, and then dived in under the tent. I had my twenty-dollar gold piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because there ain’t no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from home and amongst strangers that way. You can’t be too careful. I ain’t opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain’t no other way, but there ain’t no use in wasting it on them.","I went to the circus and sneaked around to the back, waited for the guard to pass by, and then crawled under the tent. Even though I still had twenty dollars and some other money, I thought it would be better to save it because you never know when you might need it, especially when you're far from home and living among strangers. I'm not against paying to see the circus, but if I don't have to spend the money, that's even better.",19.336,18.306,"I went to the circus from there, waited at the back until the guards disappeared from sight, then lifted a flap of the tent and slipped inside. I had twenty dollars in gold and some more money, but it was better not to spend it, because you never know how much money you might need when you're so far from home and among strangers. No matter how careful I was, it wasn't enough. I'm not against giving money to circuses if there's no other option, but there's no point in wasting money at the circuses either.",12.064,10.477,"I went to the circus and kept wandering around the back until the guard passed by, and then I slipped under the canvas. I had my twenty-dollar gold coin and some more money, but I figured it was better to save it, because you never know when you might need it when you're far from home and among strangers and such things. You have to be very careful. I have nothing against spending money on circuses when there's no other choice, but it doesn't make sense to waste it on them either.",28.296,27.393
1055,"It was a real bully circus. It was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes nor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable—there must a been twenty of them—and every lady with a lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars, and just littered with diamonds. It was a powerful fine sight; I never see anything so lovely. And then one by one they got up and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and every lady’s rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips, and she looking like the most loveliest parasol.","It was a very respectable circus troupe. But the men and women riding horses in pairs looked truly spectacular. The men wore tight shirts and shorts, barefoot, with their hands resting easily and steadily on their thighs. As for the women, they were very beautiful, looking like queens, dressed in luxurious outfits worth millions of dollars, with diamonds even pinned to their clothes. I had never seen anything so beautiful. Each person took turns standing up and gracefully circling the arena. The men were tall, majestic, and dignified, while the women wore fluttering pink dresses, soft and delicate.",5.157,4.123,"It was truly a wonderful circus. A woman and a man on horseback coming onto the stage two by two was a very magnificent sight. The men were only wearing their underwear and vests, they were barefoot and without stirrups, and they were comfortably going with their hands on their waists –there were probably about twenty of them– the ladies were also very beautiful with their magnificent skin and looked like queens who had come together for this event; they were wearing dresses worth millions of dollars and were adorned with sparkling diamonds. It was a very magnificent sight, I had never seen such a beautiful show. Then they stood up one by one on their horses and started drawing circles on the stage like monuments of elegance; the men were tall, very stylish, and upright; they looked very straight. Their heads, moving in waves, reached all the way to the tent ceiling. The women's rose-petaled, tulle silk dresses were gently swaying around their hips, you could liken them to magnificent parasols.",8.678,7.789,"It was a truly amazing circus. It was the most wonderful thing ever seen when they all arrived on horseback two by two, gentlemen and ladies side by side, the men in shorts and t-shirts, without shoes or stirrups and with their hands resting on their thighs, so calm and so comfortable, at least twenty of them, and each lady so fine and all so beautiful like a gang of real queens, with dresses that cost millions of dollars and all covered in diamonds. It was truly a pleasure to see them; I have never seen anything more beautiful. And then they started standing up one by one and began circling around the ring, the men very tall, slender, and upright, with their heads moving slightly and almost touching the top of the tent, and with the ladies' rose-colored dresses swirling around their hips and puffed up, so that they looked like beautiful parasols.",18.644,18.04
1056,"And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one foot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and more, and the ring-master going round and round the center-pole, cracking his whip and shouting “Hi!—hi!” and the clown cracking jokes behind him; and by-and-by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves! And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild.","Each time they went faster, all of them dancing, lifting one leg and then the other. But the horse tilted its head as the handler walked around, whipping and shouting. Everyone applauded enthusiastically.",2.09,1.894,"They were accelerating gradually, all of them dancing, lifting one foot and then the other into the air; the horses were also leaning more and more to the side, the announcer cracked his whip and circled around saying ""Ha!.. Ha!"" and the clown was making jokes behind him; after a while, all the riders let go of the reins, all the ladies put their hands on their waists and the gentlemen crossed their arms over their chests, the horses were now leaning completely to the side and started running fast! Finally, the riders jumped onto the stage one by one, gave the most charming bow I've ever seen in my life, and quickly exited the stage as everyone applauded them wildly.",15.45,14.567,"And then they started going faster and faster, all of them dancing, first with one foot in the air and then with the other, with the horses leaning more and more and the ringmaster circling the central post, cracking the whip and shouting ""Jai! Jai!"", and the clown telling jokes behind him, until they all dropped the reins and each of the ladies put their hands on their hips and each of the gentlemen crossed their arms, and then the horses went and bent down until they were on their knees! So they went jumping into the ring one after another, with the most beautiful bows I've seen in my life, and then they left and everyone started clapping as if they had gone mad.",23.181,22.407
1057,"Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people. The ring-master couldn’t ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever could think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn’t noway understand. Why, I couldn’t a thought of them in a year. And by-and-by a drunk man tried to get into the ring—said he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn’t listen, and the whole show come to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, “Knock him down! throw him out!” and one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the ring-master he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn’t be no disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn’t make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse. So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down. And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t’other one on t’other side, and the people just crazy. It warn’t funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire too. He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn’t ever drunk in his life—and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them. He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum—and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.","During the performance, they did many very unusual tricks. When the clown came out, everyone laughed uproariously. I don't understand how he could come up with so many tricks and be so quick. Even if I practiced for a year, I couldn't do that. Suddenly, a drunken man appeared from somewhere and tried to step onto the stage, saying he wanted to ride a horse. He claimed he could ride a horse just as well as the performers earlier. They tried to hold him back, but he wouldn't listen, and the show had to be temporarily halted. The audience booed and cursed at him, making him even more frightened. Some spectators jumped out of their seats and stepped onto the stage, saying, ""Beat him up and throw him out!"" A few women screamed in fear. Then the circus owner said that if the drunken man promised not to cause any more trouble, he would let him ride the horse. Everyone laughed and agreed to let the man step onto the stage. As soon as he sat on the horse, it started bucking wildly all over the place. Two circus members ran out and tried to grab the reins but couldn't, while the drunken man clung tightly to the horse's neck. Each time the horse bucked, he would fly up, legs flailing in the air, making the audience laugh until they cried. Finally, the horse calmed down and slowly walked around the stage; the man still lay on the horse's back, clinging to its neck, with one leg dangling close to the ground, then the other. Everyone laughed uproariously. As for me, I didn't find it amusing at all; instead, I was scared for the man. But then, suddenly, he sat up, grabbed the reins, leaned to one side, then the other, and then jumped up, letting go of the reins and standing straight; the horse began to gallop like the wind. He stood effortlessly on the horse as if he weren't drunk at all. Then, while galloping, he started taking off his outer clothes and throwing them to the ground. He was wearing so many clothes, a total of seventeen layers. He revealed himself to be a handsome and clever young man, then he spurred the horse hard, making it neigh loudly. Finally, he jumped down, bowed to the audience, and ran inside.",7.11,6.721,"During the circus show, a lot of astonishing things were done, and in the meantime, the clown was making people laugh hysterically. The host couldn't get a word in edgewise because the clown would come up with the funniest responses in the blink of an eye; I couldn't understand where he found so many words and how he said them so spontaneously. Probably, even if I thought for forty years, those words wouldn't come to my mind. A little later, a drunk guy tried to get on the stage... He also wanted to ride a horse; he claimed he could ride as well as those there. They opposed him and tried to stop him, but he wouldn't listen, and because of him, the show was interrupted. People started to heckle and mock him, which made him even more furious, and he began to say whatever came to his mind. Then the crowd got riled up, a bunch of men stood up and approached the stage, shouting, ""Get him down! Throw him off the stage!"" and a few women screamed. Upon this, the host made a short speech, saying he hoped no more disturbance would be caused, and if the man promised not to cause any more trouble, he could ride the horse, that is, if he could stay on it...Everyone laughed and approved, and the man got on the horse. As soon as the man mounted, the horse started to buck, rear, and kick; two circus men were holding the reins trying to calm it down, and the drunk man was clinging to the horse's neck, with his feet flying up with each jump; the audience was on their feet, shouting and laughing until tears streamed down their faces. Finally, despite all the efforts of the circus workers, the horse broke free and started galloping around the stage like lightning; the drunk guy was clinging to its neck but had slipped to one side, his foot almost touching the ground, then he slipped to the other side, and again his foot almost touched the ground. The people were getting more and more excited. But to me, it wasn't funny at all; seeing how much danger he was in, I started to tremble. But soon enough, the man managed to climb back into the saddle and grabbed the reins, pulling them left and right; then suddenly, he let go of the saddle and stood up on the horse's back! The horse continued to run wildly as if there was a fire. The man stood on its back, traveling quite comfortably and confidently as if he had never drunk in his life – then he started to take off and throw away his clothes. He was dressed so thickly that clothes were everywhere, he had taken off and thrown a total of seventeen outfits. In the end, he transformed into a slim and handsome man, wearing the most ornate and dazzling outfit you could ever see, he started whipping his horse, causing it to speed up – finally, he jumped off the horse's back, took a bow, and hopped and skipped towards the dressing rooms; everyone was howling with joy and amazement.",12.758,12.477,"Well, everyone in the circus did the most amazing things, and the clown kept making jokes that had people almost dying of laughter. The ringmaster couldn't say a word without the other one responding as quick as lightning with the funniest things in the world, and what I couldn't understand at all was how he could come up with so many, so suddenly and so timely. Man, I couldn't have come up with them in a whole year. And then a drunk tried to get into the ring and said he wanted to ride a horse, and that he could ride as well as the best. They argued with him and tried to stop him, but he ignored them and the whole show came to a halt. Then people started shouting at him and laughing at him, and he got angry and started saying outrageous things, so the audience got angry and many men started coming down from the stands towards the ring, saying: ""Give him a beating! Throw him out!"" And one or two women started screaming. Then the ringmaster made a little speech saying he hoped there wouldn't be any incidents, and that if the man promised not to cause any more trouble, he would let him ride the horse if he thought he wouldn't fall. So everyone laughed and said okay, and the man mounted the horse. As soon as he was mounted, the horse started jumping, bucking, and prancing, with the circus staff holding onto the bridle, trying to stop it, and the drunk hanging onto the horse's neck, with his feet flying in the air with each jump, and all the people standing, shouting and laughing so hard they were in tears. And finally, of course, despite the circus staff, the horse broke free and ran like crazy, with the drunk clinging to it and holding onto the neck, first with one leg hanging down almost touching the ground and then with the other on the other side, and people dying of laughter. It didn't seem funny to me at all; I was screaming from the fear it gave me. But soon he managed to get back in the saddle and grab the bridle, falling first to one side and then the other, and after a moment he jumped up and let go of the bridle, and stood up!, with the horse running like mad. There he stayed, standing, letting the horse run, so calm, as if he had never been drunk in his life, and then he started taking off his clothes and throwing them to the ground. He took off so many things that they practically filled the air, and in total he shed seventeen outfits. And there he stood, slender and handsome, dressed in the most beautiful and striking way in the world, and he whipped the horse to make it run even faster, and then he jumped off, bowed, and danced his way to the dressing rooms, and everyone kept shouting in amazement and joy.",17.853,17.613
1058,"Then the ring-master he see how he had been fooled, and he was the sickest ring-master you ever see, I reckon. Why, it was one of his own men! He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn’t a been in that ring-master’s place, not for a thousand dollars. I don’t know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for me; and wherever I run across it, it can have all of my custom every time.","Everyone cheered loudly in amazement. The circus owner pretended to be someone who had just been fooled, but in reality, that guy was actually part of the circus! He had made up that joke without informing anyone beforehand. I don't know if there is any circus more decent than this, but anyway, I find it acceptable.",3.502,2.714,"The host realized how he had been tricked, and suddenly became the angriest host you could ever see. So that drunk was one of his own men! He had completely designed this prank himself and hadn't said a word to anyone. Actually, I was feeling dazed myself, but honestly, I wouldn't want to be in the host's place even if they gave me a thousand dollars. I don't know; maybe there are more wonderful circuses than this; but I haven't come across one yet. Anyway, it was quite good for me; wherever I come across it again, I will definitely go again.",18.175,17.375,"Then the ringmaster realized he had been tricked, and I think I have never seen a ringmaster so disheartened. But it was one of his own men! He had come up with that prank on his own, without telling anyone. Well, I also felt pretty foolish for having been deceived, but I wouldn't have wanted to be in that ringmaster's place, not even for a thousand dollars. I don't know; maybe there are better circuses than that one, but I haven't seen any yet. In any case, for me it was excellent, and when I come across it again, you can count on this customer as soon as I see it.",22.291,21.507
1059,"Well, that night we had our show; but there warn’t only about twelve people there—just enough to pay expenses. And they laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before the show was over, but one boy which was asleep. So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn’t come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy—and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he reckoned. He said he could size their style. So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village. The bills said:","That night, it was our turn to perform, but only about twelve people came to watch, just enough to cover the expenses. While watching, they couldn't stop laughing, which made the duke furious. Everyone left before the performance was over, leaving only a boy who was sleeping like a log. So the duke said that the people of Arkansas were too stupid to understand Shakespeare. He said they only liked cheap plays. Thinking he had grasped the taste of the locals, the next morning, he somehow got a piece of paper and some black ink and scribbled a few advertisements to post everywhere. The advertisement read like this:",13.475,12.393,"That night, we put on our own show, about twelve people came; we barely covered the expenses. Because they kept laughing, the duke went crazy; in fact, everyone left before the plays were even over, only one child stayed, and he had fallen asleep. Upon this, the duke said that these Arkansas blockheads didn't understand Shakespeare or anything; what they wanted was cheap comedy – they might even come for something worse than cheap comedy. He said he would play by their rules. The next morning, he got black paint and large wrapping papers, prepared new posters, and we put them up all over town. The poster said:",14.393,13.225,"Well, that night our show was on, but there were only twelve people, just enough to cover the expenses.

1077,"Well, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was jam full of men in no time. When the place couldn’t hold no more, the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech, and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it; and at last when he’d got everybody’s expectations up high enough, he rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over, ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow. And—but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.","All day long, the duke and the king worked hard preparing, setting up the stage, hanging the curtains, climbing up to fix the lights... That night, the theater was packed with people coming to watch. When it became too crowded, the duke stopped checking tickets and went around to the back of the stage, coming out in front of the curtain to give a speech. He praised the tragedy endlessly and said that this was a terrifying play like no other, making everyone eager to watch it. Then he rolled up the curtain. A minute later, the king crawled out, not a stitch of clothing on him. All over his body were streaks painted in various colors, looking as dazzling as a rainbow, giving him a fierce yet comical appearance. The audience burst into laughter. After the king had jumped to the back of the stage, the audience applauded loudly, calling for the king to perform again, and then once more. Just seeing the ridiculous stripes that the foolish king had painted on himself would make even a cow laugh.",6.703,5.874,"The duke and the king worked all day to set up a stage, hung a curtain, and placed candles on the floor as footlights; that night, the courtroom was suddenly filled with men. When the room could no longer accommodate anyone else, the duke stopped selling tickets, went around to the back, and came out on stage, standing in front of the curtain to give a small speech: He praised the tragedy, said it was the most breathtaking play to date; he talked a lot about the tragedy and the great Edmund Kean who would play the lead role; finally, after raising everyone's expectations to the highest level, he opened the curtain, and suddenly the king came out on all fours, naked, hopping around the stage; he was painted from head to toe, and with colorful stripes on him, he looked as magnificent as a rainbow. Also... never mind the other things he was wearing, it was absolutely crazy, but at the same time, terribly funny. People were almost dying of laughter; after the king finished hopping and jumping, he left the stage, a round of applause erupted from the crowd, and they kept clapping and cheering until the king came back; then they made him do it a third time.

And... but the rest of his attire doesn't matter; it was sheer madness, though very amusing. The audience almost died laughing, and when the king finished doing somersaults and disappeared behind the stage, they started shouting and clapping, stomping and laughing until he came back and repeated it, and then they still made him repeat it again.

And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain. My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. He was a blossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning. And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. ‘Fetch up Nell Gwynn,’ he says. They fetch her up. Next morning, ‘Chop off her head!’ And they chop it off. ‘Fetch up Jane Shore,’ he says; and up she comes, Next morning, ‘Chop off her head’—and they chop it off. ‘Ring up Fair Rosamun.’ Fair Rosamun answers the bell. Next morning, ‘Chop off her head.’ And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book—which was a good name and stated the case. You don’t know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I’ve struck in history. Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does he go at it—give notice?—give the country a show? No. All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. That was his style—he never give anybody a chance. He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Ask him to show up? No—drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. S’pose people left money laying around where he was—what did he do? He collared it. S’pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn’t set down there and see that he done it—what did he do? He always done the other thing. S’pose he opened his mouth—what then? If he didn’t shut it up powerful quick he’d lose a lie every time. That’s the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we’d a had him along ’stead of our kings he’d a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done. I don’t say that ourn is lambs, because they ain’t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain’t nothing to that old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they’re a mighty ornery lot. It’s the way they’re raised.”","- If you read books, you will see everything. For example, King Henry the Eighth was no better than the manager of a monastery. Then there was Charles the Second, Louis the Fourteenth, Louis the Fifteenth, then James the Second... etc. King Henry the Eighth would marry a new wife every day, and then the next morning, he would have her beheaded. He did this as casually as calling someone to bring up a plate of eggs. He would say: “Bring Nell Gwynne here!”. They brought her to him. Then the next day, he ordered: “Behead her!”. And so she was beheaded. And he made each woman tell him a story every night. Then he compiled those stories into the book “One Thousand and One Nights”. You may not know about those kings, but I know them very well. And the king who is with us is one of the cleanest kings in history. As for that Henry, he even suspected his own father, the Duke of Wellington. He drowned his father in a water tank like drowning a cat. If anyone left money near where he was sitting, he would take it all. He couldn't close his mouth without lying to someone about something. That’s the kind of scoundrel King Henry was. He didn't need to put on a show but blatantly forced people to give him money.",6.033,5.88,"""If you had read what was written about them, you would understand.

You should see Henry the Eighth in his youth. The man was out of his mind. He married a new woman every day and beheaded her in the morning. He did this as indifferently as ordering eggs for breakfast. 'Bring Nell Gwynn,' he would say. They would bring her. In the morning, he would say 'Behead her!' and they would behead the girl.

That was his style...He gave no one a chance. He even suspected his own father, the Duke of Wellington. So what did he do? Did he ask him for an explanation? No, he stuffed him into a barrel and drowned him like a kitten. Let's say people left money lying around in public, do you know what he would do? He would take it without hesitation. Let's say you made a contract with him for a job; you paid him and didn't watch how he did the job...Guess what he would do! The exact opposite of what he was told. Let's say he opened his mouth...What do you think would happen then? If he didn't shut his mouth quickly, he would tell a lie every time. Henry was such a pest, and if he were with us instead of our kings, he would swindle the townspeople much worse than ours. I'm not claiming that ours are innocent lambs, because the truth is, they aren't. But compared to that old goat Henry, they are nothing.

It all stems from their upbringing.""",15.06,14.837,"—You only have to read what they have done to find out. Look at Henry VIII; our guy is a Sunday school superintendent compared to him. And look at Charles II and Louis XIV, and Louis XV and James II and Edward II and Richard III and forty more; besides all those Saxon heptarchies that were around in ancient times causing trouble. But you should have seen that Henry VIII when he was in form. He was a gem. He married a new woman every day and chopped off her head the next morning. And he cared as much as if he were ordering a pair of eggs. “Bring Nell Gwynn,” he would say. They would bring her. The next morning: “Off with her head!” And off it went. “Bring Jane Shore,” he would say, and there she came. The next morning: “Off with her head.” And off it went. “Bring the fair Rosamund,” and the fair Rosamund would answer the call. The next morning: “Off with her head.” And he made each of them tell him a story every night until he gathered a thousand and one stories, and then he put them all in a book and called it the Book of Judgment, which is a good title, and it explains everything. You don’t know kings, Jim, but I do; this rogue of ours is one of the most decent I’ve come across in history. Well, Henry gets the idea that he wants to mess with this country. And, what does he do... does he give any warning? Does he tell the country? No. Suddenly he goes and throws all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard and invents a declaration of independence and dares them to try something. That’s how he did things. He never gave anyone a chance. He suspected something about his father, who was the Duke of Wellington. And, what does he do? Does he tell him to show up? No: he drowns him in a barrel of malmsey, like he was a cat. Imagine someone left money where he was; what did he do? He kept it. Imagine he had a contract to do something and you paid him and didn’t sit there to watch him do it; what did he do? Always the opposite. Imagine he opened his mouth; what happened? If he didn’t close it immediately, he would spit out a lie a minute. That’s how much of a rascal Henry was, and if he had been with us instead of our kings, he would have swindled that people much more than ours did. I’m not saying ours are lambs, because they’re not and that would be a lie, but they are nothing compared to that old bastard.

And I believed that Jim worried about his loved ones just as much as white people worried about their own families. That might sound unnatural, but I thought it was probably true.

He was thinking about his wife and children far away; he was feeling down and homesick because he had never been away from home before; and, if you ask me, he was as attached to his family as white folks are to theirs. At first, it didn't seem natural, but I guess it was quite natural. Often, during the nights when he thought I was asleep, he would moan and continue his lament: “Poor little Elizabeth!

1117,"Next day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow tow-head out in the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn’t take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when we left him all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn’t look much like he was a runaway nigger, you know. So the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all day, and he’d cipher out some way to get around it.","Near the next day, we anchored the raft under a willow tree, with villages on both sides of the river. The duke and the king started discussing their plan of action in this town again. Jim told the duke not to go for too long, just a few hours, because lying all day in the tent and being tied up like that made him very tired. Whenever we went away, we tied Jim up so that if anyone suddenly came by and saw him tied up, they would think he had been captured. The duke also agreed that lying tied up all day was indeed very hard, so he would think of a better way.",10.942,10.156,"Before dark the next day, we docked at a small island covered with poplars in the middle of the river; there was a town on each bank of the river, and the duke and the king began to plan what they would do in the towns. Meanwhile, Jim chimed in and said he hoped their business wouldn't take more than a few hours, because lying tied up inside the shelter was both very difficult and tiring. When we left the raft, we had to tie him up, because if someone saw him free, we could never convince anyone that he wasn't a captured runaway black man. The duke also admitted that keeping him tied up all day was really hard and said he would look for another solution.",18.865,18.252,"THE NEXT DAY, towards the evening, we moored at a small island of willows in the middle, where there was a town on each side of the river, and the duke and the king started making plans to work in those towns. Jim spoke with the duke and said that he hoped it wouldn't take more than a few hours, because it was very hard for him to have to stay in the wigwam all day, tied up with ropes. You see, when we left him, we had to tie him up, because if someone found him alone and untied, it would seem like he was a runaway black man, you know. So the duke said that indeed it was very hard to stay tied up all day and that he was going to think of some way to solve it.",37.897,37.475
1118,"He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He dressed Jim up in King Lear’s outfit—it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint and painted Jim’s face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man that’s been drownded nine days. Blamed if he warn’t the horriblest looking outrage I ever see. Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:","The Duke was indeed an intelligent person. He came up with a plan: to dress Jim in King Lear's clothes, put a white horsehair wig on him; then he used a brush to paint Jim's face, hands, ears, and neck a bluish-gray color, making him look like someone who had been drowned for nine days. It was horrifying, never had anything looked so disgusting. Then the Duke took a piece of wood and wrote on it:",10.968,9.399,"Our duke was an extraordinarily clever man, and he soon found a way. He dressed Jim in a King Lear costume – this costume consisted of a long robe made from curtain fabric, a wig made of white horsehair, and sideburns; then he took the theater paints and painted Jim's face, hands, ears, and neck a dull blue color; in this state, Jim looked like someone who had drowned nine days ago. Honestly, I had never seen such a horrifying sight. The duke also prepared a sign from a piece of wood and wrote on it:",10.671,9.145,"The said duke was very clever, and soon an idea occurred to him. He dressed Jim in the costume of King Lear: a long calico curtain robe and a white horsehair wig, with its beard, and then took out the theater makeup and painted his face and hands, ears, and neck all in a dull and continuous blue, like a man who had been drowned for nine days. Hang me if it wasn't the most horrible sight one could imagine. Then the duke wrote on a blackboard a sign that said:",17.583,16.239

1120,"And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he wouldn’t wait for him to howl. Why, he didn’t only look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.","Then he hung that piece of wood on a tree branch, a few yards away from the tent. Jim was very pleased because it was better than being tied up every day, lying there trembling at every sound. The duke told Jim to rest assured, and if anyone wandered around, he should step out of the tent, pretend to be a madman, and howl like a wild animal, so people would be scared and run away immediately. That sounds good. But that's for anyone else; as for Jim, just seeing him would be enough to scare people without him having to howl. These two rascals intended to put on a show like the one they did the other day to make some extra money.",10.18,8.935,"He nailed the sign to a stick and planted the stick a meter or two in front of the shelter. Jim was pleased. He said it was better to look like this than to lie tied up for several years a day and tremble at every sound he heard. The Duke told him to act very freely and comfortably, and if someone came there, all he had to do was get out of the shelter and do some crazy things, howl like a wild animal once or twice. Most likely, they would immediately flee and leave him alone. This idea seemed quite reasonable, but if you think about the average person, they probably wouldn't stay there long enough to wait for him to howl. Because Jim not only looked like he was dead, he had a much more frightening appearance.",22.381,21.747,"And he nailed the sign to a post and placed the post four or five feet in front of the wigwam. Jim was very happy. He said it was much better than being tied up for years and years every day and trembling every time he heard something. The duke told him to do whatever he pleased and that if anyone came snooping around, he should jump out of the wigwam and make a bit of a fuss and let out a howl or two like a wild animal, and he figured they would leave and let him be. Which was a pretty good idea; but the truth is that a normal man wouldn't wait for him to start howling. But it not only looked like he had died, but something much worse still!",25.703,25.098
1121,"These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn’t be safe, because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time. They couldn’t hit no project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he’d lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn’t put up something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop over to t’other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence to lead him the profitable way—meaning the devil, I reckon. We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his’n on, and he told me to put mine on. I done it, of course. The king’s duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy. I never knowed how clothes could change a body before. Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he’d take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you’d say he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus himself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready. There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point, about three mile above the town—been there a couple of hours, taking on freight. Says the king:","But then they thought it would be dangerous, and perhaps the news about the previous show had already spread down here. They couldn't come up with any other tricks, so the duke said he would lie down and think for another hour or two to see if he could come up with something. The king said if there was no new plan, he would leave his fate to the will of God. At the last resting place, we all bought new clothes. The king's clothes were jet black, making him look quite dignified. Never had I seen clothes change a person so much. Previously, he looked shabby and disheveled, but now when he took off his white hat, bowed, and smiled, he looked so solemn it seemed he could have been a Jewish rabbi. Jim cleaned the boat, and I prepared the oars. There was a steamboat docked to unload goods on the shore about three miles above the town. The king said:",6.3,5.548,"Our swindlers tried the Curcuna trick again, because there was a lot of money in it, but they didn't find it safe enough; perhaps the news had already reached here from the upper town. They couldn't come up with a plan that was perfectly suitable for here; finally, the duke said he would lie down for a couple of hours and try to come up with something that would fit this Arkansas town exactly. The king decided to take a short trip to the town across the way. He didn't have any plan, but he believed that the Creator would lead him to a profitable business... By the Creator, he probably meant the devil. At our last stop, we all got some clothes from a store; the king put on his new clothes and told me to put on mine too. Of course, I did what he said immediately. The king, dressed entirely in black, had become a very dignified man. I could never have guessed that clothes could change a person so much. Previously, it was obvious from a thousand meters away that he was a lowlife, but now, when he took off his new white hat, bowed slightly, and smiled, he looked so important, kind-hearted, and pious that you might think he had just stepped off Noah's Ark or was old Leviticus himself. Jim prepared the canoe, and I adjusted the oars. There was a large steamboat anchored about three miles up the town – it had been loading cargo there for a few hours. “If we look at my outfit,” said the king, “it's probably best that I came from a big place like St. Louis or Cincinnati.",16.642,16.275,"Those scoundrels wanted to try the Sin Par again because it brought in a lot of money, but they figured it wasn't worth it, as the news might have already spread. They couldn't come up with any project that seemed perfect, so in the end, the duke said he was giving up and would think about it for an hour or two to see if he could organize something in the town of Arkansas, and the king said he would go to the other town without any plan, but would trust Providence to give him some lucrative idea, meaning, I guess, that he was referring to the theater. We had all bought clothes at the store at the last stop, and now the king put on his and told me to put on mine. Of course, I did. The king's clothes were all black and had a very elegant and starched look. Until then, I had never understood how clothes could change a person. Before, he had the air of the old scoundrel he really was, but now, when he took off his new beaver hat and bowed and smiled, he looked so elegant and pious that one would think he had just stepped out of Noah's Ark and could have written Leviticus himself. Jim cleaned the canoe and prepared the paddle for me. A steamboat had docked on the shore beyond the cape, about three miles up from the town, and had been there for a couple of hours, loading material. And the king goes and says:",19.555,19.138

1123,"I didn’t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride. I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water. Pretty soon we come to a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a couple of big carpet-bags by him.","When it comes to getting to ride a boat, I don't need to be asked twice.

Next to him were two large bags.",8.098,6.258,"I had no intention of disobeying this order; I grabbed the oar and we moved towards the steamer.

I says to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds? No—that won’t do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would make it warm for me. Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane? No—I dasn’t do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they’ve got the money, and they’d slide right out and get away with it. If she was to fetch in help I’d get mixed up in the business before it was done with, I judge. No; there ain’t no good way but one. I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won’t suspicion that I done it. They’ve got a good thing here, and they ain’t a-going to leave till they’ve played this family and this town for all they’re worth, so I’ll find a chance time enough. I’ll steal it and hide it; and by-and-by, when I’m away down the river, I’ll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it’s hid. But I better hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn’t let up as much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here yet.","I walked outside, thinking aimlessly, then went to sleep. Waking up, lying alone, I thought about that matter again. I asked myself if I should go to that doctor’s house to expose this deceit? That’s impossible. He would reveal who the accuser is, and the king and the duke might beat me to death. Or should I go and talk privately to Miss Mary Jane? That wouldn’t work either. What if she becomes suspicious and they find out, they would take the money and run away. There’s only one best way: I will steal that money, and steal it in such a way that they won’t suspect me. They are making a good profit, as long as they haven’t taken everything, they won’t leave. So I still have enough time to plan this. I will steal the money bag and hide it. Then I will leave, and write Miss Mary Jane a letter, telling her where I hid the money. If I can hide it tonight, I should do it immediately; because that doctor hasn’t given up and will continue to investigate, and they might get scared and run away, who knows.",9.263,8.579,"Then I said I was going to bed and left the kitchen, but I wasn't really going to bed, to be honest. When I was alone, I thought everything over thoroughly. I wondered to myself if I should secretly go to that doctor and report our fraudsters. No – that wouldn't work. He could say where he learned it from, and then the king and the duke would make my life miserable. Should I secretly go and tell Mary Jane? No – I couldn't do that either. They would understand everything the moment they looked at the girl's face; they would take the money and run away immediately. Even if the poor girl asked someone for help, I would get involved in one way or another. No, there was only one way that could work. I had to steal the money, and I had to do it in such a way that they would never suspect me. They had found a good opportunity here and had no intention of leaving without robbing both this family and the town, so I had enough time to wait for a chance. I would steal the money, hide it somewhere; then after going a bit down the river, I would write a letter to Mary Jane telling her where the money was hidden. But maybe the best thing was to get the money tonight if I could; because the doctor might not stay as calm as he seemed and could scare our guys into running away.",14.157,13.651,"So I took off; to sleep, I said, without specifying the moment. When I was left alone, I started thinking things over. I asked myself: ""Am I going to see that doctor, in secret, and betray these scoundrels? No, that wouldn't turn out well. He could say who told him and then the king and the duke would take care of me. Should I go and tell Mary Jane in secret? No... I don't dare. She would surely reveal it with some gesture; they already have the money and would take off with it. If I went looking for help, I would surely find myself caught up in the matter. No, there's only one way. I have to steal that money however I can and in a way that they don't suspect me. They've found a good vein here and they're not going to leave until they've squeezed everything they can out of this family and this town, so I have enough time to find a solution. I'm going to steal it and hide it and then, when I'm downriver, I'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it's hidden. But I'd better get it out tonight if I can, because maybe the doctor hasn't given up as he said and he might still scare them and drive them away.""",20.321,19.927
1295,"So, thinks I, I’ll go and search them rooms. Upstairs the hall was dark, but I found the duke’s room, and started to paw around it with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn’t be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn’t do nothing without a candle, and I dasn’t light one, of course. So I judged I’d got to do the other thing—lay for them and eavesdrop. About that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn’t where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane’s frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.","Thinking so, I groped my way to their room. The hallway upstairs was pitch dark, but I still found the duke's room. I reached out and felt around, but then I suddenly remembered that it seemed the king didn't let anyone but the old man keep that money. I groped my way to the old man's room and felt around. It was too dark, there wasn't a single candle, and even if there was, I wouldn't dare light it. I had to lie here and listen to see what would happen. At that moment, I heard their footsteps approaching, so I crawled under the bed, but thinking that spot wasn't safe, I felt worried and then touched Mary Jane's clothes curtain, so I slipped right into the curtain and hid among the clothes, standing there very quietly.",7.14,5.694,"Then I thought, the best thing to do is to go and search their rooms.

However, after a while, I realized I couldn't see anything without light, and besides, lighting a candle here wasn't a smart idea. The best thing was to resort to the other way, wait for them, and listen to their conversations. At that moment, I heard footsteps coming from downstairs and made a move to get under the bed; I was just about to get in, but the bed wasn't where I expected it to be, instead, I grabbed the curtain covering Mary Jane's clothes, immediately jumped behind the curtain, and took refuge among the nightgowns, then didn't move at all.",15.029,14.334,"“So —I thought— I’m going to search their rooms.” Although the hallway upstairs was dark, I found the duke’s room and started rummaging with my hands, but I remembered that just as the king was, he wouldn’t let anyone but himself handle the money, so I went to his room and started rummaging. But I saw that I couldn’t do anything without a candle and, naturally, I didn’t dare to light one. So I thought of doing the other thing: staying put and listening to what they said. Almost at that moment I heard them coming up and decided to hide under the bed; I went towards it, but it wasn’t where I thought, I touched the curtain behind which Mary Jane’s dresses were, so I jumped behind it, snuggled among the dresses, and stayed there very quietly.",22.445,21.854

I said to myself: ""If it could stay where it is, very well; because when we get to the river, a hundred or two hundred miles away, I could write to Mary Jane and she could dig it up and take it out, but that's not what's going to happen; what's going to happen is that they'll find the money when they go to close the lid. Then the king will get it again and won't give anyone else a chance to steal it."" Naturally, I wanted to go down and take it out of there, but I didn't dare try. Every minute dawn was approaching and very soon some of the people from the wake would start moving and maybe catch me with six thousand dollars in my hands when no one had entrusted me with the money. ""Damn the need for me to get involved in something like this,"" I said to myself.",24.183,23.752

I see the coffin lid was the way it was before, but I dasn’t go to look in under it, with folks around.","By noon, the funeral director arrived with another person. They carried the coffin to the middle of the house, placed it on two chairs, then arranged all the other chairs in rows, even borrowing more chairs from neighboring houses to fill both the dining room and the living room.

There warn’t no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses—because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church.","The two swindlers and the girls sat in the front row of seats right by the coffin.

For half an hour, people slowly passed by in a line, each taking a minute to look at the dead man's face. Some shed a few tears. Everything was extremely quiet and serious; only the girls and women were wiping their eyes with handkerchiefs and standing with their heads bowed. Occasionally, they would sob. Nothing could be heard except for the sound of feet dragging on the ground and the sniffles – because people tend to sniffle more at funerals compared to other places outside the church.",8.298,6.553,"Then people and authorities began to arrive, and the girls took seats in the front row, next to the head of the coffin, and for half an hour people filed past, each taking a moment to look at the face of the deceased, and some shed a tear, all very quietly and solemnly, and the girls and the authorities were the only ones who brought handkerchiefs to their eyes, kept their heads down, and whimpered a little.

1322,"When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn’t no more smile to him than there is to a ham.","When everyone had arrived, the funeral director stepped out, wearing black gloves, with a very calm demeanor. He made final preparations, arranging for everyone to be seated somewhere. He didn't say anything; directing one person here, urging another there, clearing pathways from one place to another, all done with nods and hand signals. Then he stood close to the wall. He was truly a gentle, graceful person like no other. It seemed he never smiled.",7.612,6.406,"When all the chairs were filled, the quartermaster, with his black gloves and soft, soothing demeanor, made a round to make final adjustments, arranging people and objects neatly and comfortably, all the while behaving as quietly as a cat.

1323,"They had borrowed a melodeum—a sick one; and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait—you couldn’t hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and nobody didn’t seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say, “Don’t you worry—just depend on me.” Then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people’s heads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker’s back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people’s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “He had a rat!” Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don’t cost nothing, and it’s just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. There warn’t no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was.","They had already borrowed an old accordion. When everyone was ready, a young woman sat down and began to play music, which sounded so mournful it could break your heart. Everyone sang along to the tune. Then Father Hobson solemnly, slowly began to speak. Just as the priest was about to start speaking, a terrible noise suddenly echoed from downstairs. It was the barking of a dog. The priest had to stand by the coffin waiting until the dog stopped barking, otherwise no one would hear what he was saying. But the undertaker raised his hand to signal to the priest as if to say, ""Don't worry, I've got this."" He bent down and walked along the wall, yet his shoulders still stood out above everyone else. The dog's barking grew louder and louder. He passed through two rooms and then turned downstairs. Two seconds later, I heard a loud bang, the dog howled a few more times, and then it fell silent. Only then did the priest solemnly begin the sermon. A few minutes later, the undertaker walked back along the wall, his head and shoulders bobbing past several walls in the room, then he stood up straight, covered his mouth with his hand, stretched his neck over everyone's heads towards the priest, and whispered in a slightly sharp tone: ""It caught a rat,"" then bent down and walked back to his original spot. Everyone seemed very pleased, as they had been curious to know what was happening. Such a small matter wasn't worth knowing, but everyone paid great attention to it. In this town, the undertaker was the most well-known person.",5.691,5.037,"A borrowed organ had been brought in – it was a bit out of tune; once everything was ready, a young woman sat down and started playing the organ; it was making quite a bit of creaking and groaning, everyone was joining in the music and singing the hymn. Probably the only person who was comfortable at that moment was Peter. Then Reverend Hobson stood up and began to speak slowly and solemnly; just then, a tremendous barking was heard from the basement; it was a single dog, but it was making a terrible noise, and it just wouldn't stop; the reverend had to stand there by the coffin and wait...One couldn't even hear their own thoughts. It was truly a very inappropriate situation, and no one seemed to know what to do. Soon they saw the long-legged undertaker make a sign to the reverend, meaning ""Don't worry, I'll handle it right away. "" Then the undertaker began to slide along the wall, only his shoulders visible over the heads of the people. As he slid along, the noise and commotion increased, becoming more nerve-wracking; finally, he crossed from one end of the room to the other and disappeared at the basement door. A few seconds later, we heard a ""thud!"" sound, the dog howled in surprise once or twice, then the noise completely stopped, and the reverend continued his eulogy from where he had left off. A minute or two later, the undertaker's back and shoulders began to slide along the wall again; he slid around three sides of the room, rose a bit, covered his mouth with his hand, stretched his neck towards the reverend over the heads of the people, and whispered loudly: ""Caught a rat!"" He then lowered himself and slid back to his place along the wall. People seemed very relieved, naturally wanting to know what had happened. Such a small kindness costs nothing, and it is precisely these little things that make a person valued and loved. There was probably no one in town as beloved as this undertaker.",15.556,15.239,"They had borrowed a harmonium that was in pretty bad shape; when everything was ready, a young woman sat at it and started to play, but it only produced squeaks and wheezes, and everyone started to sing. Peter was the only one who seemed to enjoy himself, as it appeared to me. Then it was Reverend Hobson's turn, who began to speak slowly and solemnly, and immediately the most horrible noise imaginable was heard from the basement: it was just a dog, but it was making a fearful racket and wouldn't stop; the priest had to stand there beside the coffin and wait: nothing else could be heard. It was truly terrible, and it seemed that no one knew what to do. But then they saw that the tall undertaker was signaling to the priest as if to say, ""Don't worry; I'm here."" Then he bent down and started to slide along the wall; only his shoulders could be seen above the heads of the people. So he kept sliding, with that racket growing more and more horrible, and finally, after he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappeared into the basement. Then, after about two seconds, we heard a thud and the dog ended with one or two of the strangest barks, and then everyone fell silent and the priest resumed his solemn talk from where he had left off. After a minute or two, the back and shoulders of the undertaker reappeared, sliding along the wall again, and he continued sliding around three sides of the room; then he stood up, cupped his hands around his mouth, and, stretching his neck towards the priest, said in a sort of hoarse whisper, over the heads of the people: ""It had a rat!"" Then he slid back along the wall to return to his place. It was clear that this was very satisfactory to the people, because naturally they wanted to know what it was about. These little things cost nothing and are what earn a man admiration and respect. There was no one more popular in the whole town than that undertaker.",21.161,20.896
1324,"Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screw-driver. I was in a sweat then, and watched him pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. So there I was! I didn’t know whether the money was in there or not. So, says I, s’pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?—now how do I know whether to write to Mary Jane or not? S’pose she dug him up and didn’t find nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get hunted up and jailed; I’d better lay low and keep dark, and not write at all; the thing’s awful mixed now; trying to better it, I’ve worsened it a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I’d just let it alone, dad fetch the whole business!","The pastor's sermon was good but too long. Then, after that, the king came out and babbled for a while. When everything was done, the funeral director approached the coffin with a wrench to tighten the screws. At that moment, I was very nervous, my eyes fixed on the funeral director. But he just slowly and gently lowered the lid, then tightened the screws very firmly. That's it! I wondered what if someone deceitful had already taken the money bundle out? Should I write a letter to Mary Jane? What if I write it and she digs up the grave and finds nothing, what would she think of me? I might even end up in jail. It's better not to write anything at all. Everything in my head was now all mixed up. The more I thought about it, the more complicated it seemed, so I decided to just let it be.",10.553,9.92,"The funeral ceremony went very well, but it was still long and boring. Finally, the king also approached the coffin and offered a bunch of his usual nonsense, and when he was done, the undertaker approached the coffin with his screwdriver. That's when I got anxious and started watching him closely. But he didn't dawdle at all; he just closed the lid very slowly and tightened the screws well. Look at this situation! I didn't know if the money was in the coffin. What if someone took the bag without anyone noticing, I thought...How would I know whether or not to write to Mary Jane now? Let's say she dug up the grave and found nothing...What would she think about me? Damn, I could get caught and thrown in jail; the best thing was to keep quiet and not draw too much attention, not to write any letters; things had gotten really messed up; I had made things worse while trying to fix them, I wished I had never gotten involved, I was truly a thousand times regretful!",11.592,10.845,"Well, the funeral sermon turned out very well, but horribly long and tiring; then the king got up and spouted some of his usual nonsense, and finally the affair ended and the undertaker approached the coffin with his screwdriver. I started sweating and watched him very closely. But he didn't see anything, he just slid the lid, smooth as if it were greased, and screwed it down tight. That's how we were! I didn't know if the money was in there or not. Then I said to myself: ""What if someone has secretly taken the bag? How do I know whether to write to Mary Jane or not? And if he digs it up and finds nothing, what will he think of me? Darn it,"" I said to myself, ""they might as well look for me and lock me up: I'd better keep my mouth shut and not write anything; now everything is a mess and by trying to improve it I've made it a hundred times worse than before; I wish I had left everything alone.

And he said of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too—tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready.

Hearing that, everyone was happy for the girls who would have relatives to rely on. The girls were also delighted to hear him say that. The girls urged him to sell the house and land quickly.

Of course, he and William would take the girls home with them; this made everyone happy because the girls would be taken care of, they would be with their relatives; the girls were also happy about this – they were very delighted because they could start a new chapter in their lives and forget their previous troubles; they told him to sell the properties as quickly as possible, they would be ready. The poor things were so joyful and happy that it broke my heart to see them being deceived and lulled with lies, but I couldn't think of a safe way to intervene and change everything.",20.363,19.847,"The king was seeing a lot of people that afternoon, reassuring everyone, very friendly, and he made them understand that in England his parishioners would be worried about him, so he had to hurry and immediately resolve the inheritance issue before leaving.

And he said that naturally William and he would take the girls home with them, which also pleased everyone a lot, because then the girls would be well protected and among their own relatives, and it also pleased the girls; they liked it so much that they practically forgot they had any problems in the world and told him to sell everything whenever he wanted, that they were ready.

1328,"So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls’ joy got the first jolt. A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their mother down the river to Orleans. I thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. The girls said they hadn’t ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town. I can’t ever get it out of my memory, the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other’s necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn’t a stood it all, but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn’t knowed the sale warn’t no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two.","The next day, after the funeral was over, the girls' joys encountered their first obstacle.

The two sons went up to Memphis, while the mother went down to Orleans. The mistresses and they hugged each other, crying with infinite sorrow. The girls said they never expected to see the family separated and to have to sell them off like this. They hugged each other and cried continuously, making me want to immediately expose the scoundrels so that the black people could stay with their mistresses.",9.493,8.783,"The first blow to the girls' joy came the very next day after the funeral, around noon; a few slave traders arrived, and the king sold the blacks at a reasonable price with a three-day note; two of the boys were sent upriver to Memphis, while their mother was sent downriver to Orleans. I thought the hearts of the poor girls and their blacks would break from grief; they cried and were so distressed while saying goodbye that I couldn't bear to watch anymore. The girls said they never even considered the possibility that the family would be separated or sold out of town. I can't seem to forget that scene, the image of the poor, miserable girls and the blacks hugging each other and crying won't leave my mind; if I didn't know that the sale was unjust and that the blacks would return in a week or two, I probably wouldn't have been able to stand it and would have blown the whistle on our gang.",18.947,18.367,"So the day after the funeral, around noon, the girls got their first surprise. A pair of slave traders appeared, and the king sold the black people to them at a reasonable price, with three-day promissory notes, according to what they said, and they took them away: the two sons upriver to Memphis, and their mother downriver to Orleans. I thought those poor girls and the black people were going to have their hearts broken with grief; they cried together and were so sad that it almost made me sick to see it. The girls said they had never dreamed of seeing that family separated or sold far from town. I will never be able to erase from my memory the vision of those poor girls and the black people so sad, hugging and crying; I think I wouldn't have been able to bear it and would have burst and betrayed our gang if I hadn't known that the sale was invalid and that the black people would be back home within a week or two.",25.858,25.381

In a moment when he was cornered, a person who stood up and told the truth would probably have taken great risks; though I had no experience in this matter, so I wasn't absolutely sure, but that's what I thought. Still, it was clear that I was in a situation where telling the truth was better, even safer, than lying.

But I didn’t see no joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any. I reckoned they’d turn pale. But no, nary a pale did they turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that’s googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world. Oh, he done it admirable. Lots of the principal people gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side. That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death. Pretty soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced like an Englishman—not the king’s way, though the king’s was pretty good for an imitation. I can’t give the old gent’s words, nor I can’t imitate him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:","They approached an old man who looked very polite along with a younger man, who also looked quite mature, with a bandage on his right arm. It seemed like this matter was not a joke. Perhaps the king and the duke were also feeling uneasy. I'm sure they would be scared pale. But no, they didn't show any signs of it. The duke still calmly wandered around there, looking satisfied. And the king looked up and down, appearing hesitant and worried; it seemed that it pained him to think that there could be such deceitful swindlers in the world. Many people stood around the king to support him. A moment later, the dignified old man began to speak.

I thought both of them would turn pale as a sheet. But no, they didn't turn pale at all. The duke didn't let on that he understood what was happening, he continued to wander around happily and making a ""uuu-uuu"" sound like a milk churn spraying cream everywhere; the king, on the other hand, looked at the scene with a pained and sorrowful expression, as if deeply wounded by the existence of such frauds and scoundrels in the world. Ah, it was truly an admirable performance. Most of the people in the town gathered around the king, trying to show their support for him. The elderly gentleman came in, utterly dumbfounded. Soon enough, he started to speak, and indeed, he spoke just like an Englishman, very different from the king's speech, although the king's speech was quite good for an imitation. I can't describe how the old man spoke, nor can I imitate it; but turning to the crowd, he said something along these lines:",17.802,17.364,"THEY BROUGHT AN elderly gentleman of very good appearance and another younger one, also of good appearance, with his right arm in a sling.

The duke did not let on that he suspected what was happening, but continued making ""goo-goo"" sounds to the people, happy and content, like a pitcher pouring out milk, and as for the king, he just looked sadly at the newcomers, as if his stomach hurt just thinking that there could be people in the world with so little shame. Ah, he did it admirably. Many of the town's characters went to the king to show him they were on his side. The old gentleman who had just arrived seemed dead with embarrassment. He immediately began to speak and I saw right away that they had an accent just like an Englishman's, not like the king's, although the king did very well with imitations.

You had your eyes on the money I earned from Curcuna and other jobs, you were after taking it all!”",8.818,7.653,"—If you deny it again, I'll drown you. It's very well that you stay there sitting and crying like a child. It's what you deserve after what you've done. In my life, I've never seen even an ostrich swallow everything, and I trusted you all the time, as if you were my own father. You should be ashamed of yourself for staying there and hearing how they blamed a bunch of poor black people, without saying a word for them. I feel ridiculous remembering that I was such an idiot to believe that stupidity. Damn you, now I understand why you were so willing to fix the deficit: you wanted to keep the money that I had taken from the ""unparalleled"" and with one thing and another, keep everything.",13.544,12.499

1596,"So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort, and before long the duke tackled his bottle; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got, the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other’s arms. They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn’t get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.","So the king crawled into the tent, grabbed a bottle of wine, and took a swig. Then the duke also grabbed another bottle. About half an hour later, the two scoundrels were friendly with each other again as usual, hugging each other to sleep, snoring loudly. Both of them calmed down, but I noticed that the king wasn't quite at ease yet about not being able to deny hiding the bundle of money. That made me very pleased. We waited until they were snoring loudly, then we sat down and talked to each other, and I recounted the entire story to Jim.",11.208,9.734,"And don't ever talk to me about making up for anything ever again in your life!” The king quietly took the bottle of liquor and went into the shelter; soon after, the duke also started drinking from his own bottle; about half an hour later, they were on good terms again, even their bonds had strengthened and become more affectionate; they fell asleep in each other's arms and started snoring. Both of them seemed to be in high spirits, but the king didn't get drunk enough to deny hiding the money bag again. This made me feel more at ease and happy. When they started snoring, Jim and I, of course, talked for a long time, and I told him everything.",8.439,6.68,"So the king went back to the wigwam and sought company in his bottle, and shortly after the duke started on his, and after about half an hour they were friends again, and the more friendly they got, the more affectionate they became, until they ended up snoring, embraced with each other. The two became very talkative, but I saw that the king wasn't so far gone as to forget that he shouldn't repeat that he wasn't the one who had hidden the bag with the money. That made me feel calm and satisfied. Naturally, when they started snoring, we talked for a long time and I told Jim everything.",20.384,19.491

1598,"We dasn’t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down the river. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and dismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they begun to work the villages again.","For many days after that, we didn't dare stop in any town, but kept going straight ahead. We headed south, where the climate was warm and it was also quite far from home. The trees were dense, with vines hanging from large branches, looking like long gray nets. It was the first time I saw those trees, and it seemed to make the forest even more solemn and sorrowful. By this point, the two swindlers thought the danger was over, so they went into the villages to scavenge again.",10.952,9.364,"We did not stop in the towns for days again, we went down the river without stopping. We had now moved well south, the weather had warmed up, and we were far from home. We had started to see trees covered with Spanish moss, the moss hanging from the branches like long gray beards. I was seeing this moss for the first time, it had given the forest a very solemn and gloomy atmosphere. Our swindlers, thinking they were now far enough from danger, started doing business in the towns again.",10.531,8.415,"FOR DAYS AND DAYS we did not dare to stop in any other town, but continued down the river. We had already reached the South, where it was hot and we were very far from home. We began to find trees full of black moss, which hung from the branches like large gray beards. It was the first time I had seen them, and it gave the forest a solemn and sad appearance. The scoundrels figured they were out of danger and started working in the towns again.",21.489,20.469
1599,"First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn’t make enough for them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started a dancing-school; but they didn’t know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town. Another time they tried to go at yellocution; but they didn’t yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. They tackled missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn’t seem to have no luck. So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.","At first, they talked about alcohol addiction, but they couldn't even make enough money to buy alcohol for themselves to drink. When they reached another village, they opened a dance class, but they only danced like kangaroos, so the public just joined in and chased them away immediately. Another time, they tried to give a speech, but after just a few sentences, the audience stood up and cursed them out, then kicked them out. They also tried preaching, hypnosis, healing, and fortune-telling, each a little bit, but it seemed like all these attempts were unlucky. In the end, they were so bored that they lay on the raft for half a day without saying a word, looking very sad and disappointed.",5.674,4.484,"First, they organized a meeting against alcohol, but they didn't even get enough money to get drunk. They established a dance school in another town; but they knew less about dancing than kangaroos; so the moment they started jumping around awkwardly, the townspeople intervened and chased them out of town. Then they started a public speaking course, but since they couldn't speak very well, the audience cursed and chased them away. They tried missionary work, spiritualism, medicine, and fortune-telling; they did everything a little bit, but it seemed their luck had run out. Finally, they were left penniless, lying on a raft slowly drifting down the river, spending half the day thinking without speaking, looking terribly unhappy and hopeless.",8.349,7.251,"First, they gave a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough to get the two of them drunk. Then, in another town, they opened a dance school, but they danced worse than a kangaroo, so at the first pirouette the audience turned on them and expelled them from the town. Another time they tried to give elocution lessons, but they didn't ""elocute"" much, because the audience got up and started cursing them and made them leave. They tried being missionaries, hypnotists, doctors, fortune-tellers, and a bit of everything, but it seemed they had no luck. So, finally, they were practically out of money and did nothing but lie on the raft as it floated downstream, thinking and thinking, without saying a word all day, very sad and desperate.",20.681,20.073
1600,"And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time. Jim and me got uneasy. We didn’t like the look of it. We judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We turned it over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody’s house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an agreement that we wouldn’t have nothing in the world to do with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. (“House to rob, you mean,” says I to myself; “and when you get through robbing it you’ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft—and you’ll have to take it out in wondering.”) And he said if he warn’t back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come along.","In the end, they huddled together and discussed something for two or three hours, looking very secretive. Jim and I were worried, surely they were plotting something nefarious again. After thinking for a while, we guessed that they were planning to break into a house or a shop, or perhaps they were about to counterfeit money. So we got really scared and agreed that we would definitely not get involved in their actions, and if possible, we would run away immediately. One early morning, we hid the raft in a safe place, two miles away from a shabby village named Pikesville. The Duke went ashore, instructing us to hide and wait for him to go to town to see if there was any gossip about the Royal Nonesuch performance. He said that if he didn't return by noon, the Duke and I would follow him.",7.843,7.455,"After a while, things started to change; every day, they would huddle together in the shelter for two or three hours, whispering secretly. Jim and I were on edge. Their intentions didn't seem very good. We thought they were making a more diabolical plan than ever. After talking amongst ourselves many times, we decided that they were either going to rob someone's house or shop, or maybe even print counterfeit money. We were both scared of this, and we swore that we would never get involved in such crimes, even if it killed us; at the first opportunity, we would get rid of them and immediately escape, leaving them behind. In the morning, we hid our raft in a safe place about two miles down from a rundown town called Pikesville; the king went ashore and told us to hide until he scouted the town to see if there was any news of the Royal Nonesuch here. (""That means until you find a house to rob,"" I muttered; ""then you'll come back here after robbing the house, and when you don't see anyone, you'll wonder what happened to me, Jim, and the raft... wonder all you want."") The king also said that if he didn't return by noon, the duke and I should understand that everything was fine and go into town.",10.862,10.232,"Finally, they started to change and began talking in the wigwam in a low and confidential tone for two or three hours straight. Jim and I got nervous. We didn't like it. We thought they were planning something worse than before. We talked about it many times and finally decided that they were going to rob someone's house or store, or that they were planning to counterfeit money, or something similar. Then we got really scared and decided that we wouldn't have anything to do with it, and that if the slightest opportunity arose, we would sneak away and abandon them. Well, one early morning we hid the raft in a good, safe spot, about two miles below a village called Pikesville, and the king went ashore and told us all to stay hidden while he went to town to see if anyone had found out about ""The Royal Nonesuch"" (""a house to rob, that's what you mean,"" I said to myself, ""and when you're done robbing it, you're going to come back and wonder what happened to me and Jim and the raft, and you can wait for us sitting down""). And he said that if he didn't come back by noon, the duke and I would know that everything was fine and we should meet up with him.",19.895,19.515
1601,"So we stayed where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we couldn’t seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing. Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday come and no king; we could have a change, anyway—and maybe a chance for the change on top of it. So me and the duke went up to the village, and hunted around there for the king, and by-and-by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all his might, and so tight he couldn’t walk, and couldn’t do nothing to them. The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again. I got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:","The duke seemed restless and irritable. He scolded us over the smallest things. Surely something is about to happen. I was very glad that by noon the king had not returned. So, the duke and I went ashore and into the village to find the king. A while later, we saw him behind a fishing boat, being pushed into a cramped house, and being taunted by a gang of ruffians... He was cursing loudly and threatening those people. When the duke arrived and saw this, he said that it was just a crazy old man. The king scolded the duke back. Taking advantage of their fierce argument, I slipped away, running like the wind down the riverside road. I ran to the hidden raft, out of breath, but feeling very happy inside. I called out:",4.188,3.31,"Thus, we continued to wait where we were. The duke was wandering around restlessly and kept making faces. He was scolding us for everything, as if he thought we couldn't do anything right; he found fault in even the smallest things. We had no doubt that something was going on. By noon, when the king didn't come, I was very happy; at least there would be a change – maybe we could find an opportunity to make the real change we had in mind. So, we went to town with the duke and started looking for the king. After a while, we found him in the back room of a filthy tavern, dead drunk and in trouble with a few idle men; he was cursing at the top of his lungs and threatening them, but he was so drunk that he couldn't even get up and do anything to them. The duke also taunted him, calling him an old fool, and the king retorted; suddenly, they started fighting! I immediately ran outside and started running as fast as I could, skipping along the river path like a deer – because we had found the chance we were looking for, and I was determined to do what was necessary so they would never see me and Jim again. I reached the raft's location, out of breath but filled with joy, and called out:",19.637,19.241,"So we stayed where we were. The duke was nervous, sweaty, and in a terrible mood. He scolded us for everything and nothing we did seemed right to him; he found everything wrong. Of course, they were preparing something. I was very glad when noon came and the king hadn't returned; now things were going to change, and maybe an opportunity would present itself. So the duke and I went to town and started looking for the king; after a while, we found him in the back room of a seedy tavern, half-drunk, with a bunch of drunks who were provoking him for fun while he cursed and threatened them with all his might, so drunk that he couldn't walk or do anything to them. The duke was mocking him for being an old fool and the king responded, so as soon as I saw things heating up, I took off at full speed and ran down the river road like a deer, because I had seen our opportunity and decided that they could wait forever before seeing Jim and me again. I arrived breathless but very happy and shouted:",19.323,18.934

1603,"But there warn’t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim was gone! I set up a shout—and then another—and then another one; and run this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn’t no use—old Jim was gone. Then I set down and cried; I couldn’t help it. But I couldn’t set still long. Pretty soon I went out on the road, trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and asked him if he’d seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:","But there was no answer, and no one came out of the tent. Jim was gone! I called out loudly once, then again - and again; ran in all directions into the forest, howling, shouting, but it was useless - Jim was lost. I sat down and sobbed uncontrollably.

He replied:",13.298,12.144,"But there was no answer, and no one came out of the shelter. Jim was not there! I called out in case he could hear… I called again, and then again; I ran frantically back and forth in the forest, but it was no use – our Jim had disappeared.

After a while, I set off thinking about what I could do, and on the way, I came across a boy and asked him if he had seen a strange-looking black man dressed like this and that.",16.33,15.089,"But no one answered me nor came out of the wigwam. Jim had disappeared! I shouted once, then again and again, and started running through the forest up and down, shouting and yelling, but it was all for nothing: Jim had disappeared.

After a while, I went back to the path trying to think about what I should do, and I met a boy who was walking by and asked him if he had seen a strange black man dressed in such and such a way, and he goes and says:",19.108,18.16

But I soon give up that notion for two things: she’d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her, and so she’d sell him straight down the river again; and if she didn’t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they’d make Jim feel it all the time, and so he’d feel ornery and disgraced. And then think of me! It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I’d be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame. That’s just the way: a person does a low-down thing, and then he don’t want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide it, it ain’t no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about this, the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman’s nigger that hadn’t ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there’s One that’s always on the lookout, and ain’t a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared. Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn’t so much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, “There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you’d a done it they’d a learnt you there that people that acts as I’d been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.”","They were willing to play such a trick on Jim for just forty dollars and make him a slave again; being a slave near his home would be a thousand times better than in a strange place. So, I decided to write a letter to Tom Sawyer to tell him to inform Miss Watson where Jim was. But after thinking it over carefully, I abandoned that idea immediately. For two reasons: she would surely be disgusted with the ungrateful black man who left her, and she would sell him right away. And if she didn't do that, then Jim would always feel miserable and despicable. What to do now? Then there was the rumor that Huck Finn had helped a black man escape. If I met anyone in town, would I have to kneel down and shamefully lick their shoes? That's life: whoever does something wicked doesn't want to face the consequences of it. The more I thought about it, the more my conscience gnawed at me, and the more I felt despicable and lowly. Finally, I felt as if the hand of God had just slapped me in the face, telling me that God was still watching all my sinful deeds. I had stolen a black slave from a poor woman who had never done anything to harm me. I felt my guilt and was terribly afraid. I tried to console myself by thinking that I was born wicked, so it wasn't entirely my fault. But inside me, something still said: There's that seminary, you have to go there to learn, and if you do, they will teach you that those who do what you did to that black man will be burned to death.",10.525,10.219,"When I thought that if Jim was going to remain a slave where his family found him, it would be a thousand times better for him to be a slave in his own home, I decided it was best to write a letter to Tom Sawyer and ask him to tell Miss Watson where Jim was. But a little later, I changed my mind, for two reasons: Miss Watson would be very angry and hate him for the lowliness and treachery of abandoning her, so she would sell him down the river again; even if she didn't sell him, everyone naturally hates a treacherous black man and they would constantly make Jim feel this, so he would feel base and dishonored. And what about me? Everyone would hear that Huck Finn helped a black man gain freedom; I would have to bow my head and lick their boots in shame whenever I saw anyone from that town. That's how it always is: Someone does something despicable, and then doesn't want to face the consequences. As long as he can hide his fault, he assumes he hasn't done anything shameful. I had fallen into exactly such a predicament. The more I thought about what I had done, the more my conscience troubled me, and I felt increasingly base and despicable. Finally, I decided it was clear that God's blow had suddenly struck my face; it reminded me that my sins had been seen from above from the beginning, that God had witnessed me stealing the black man of a poor old woman who had never harmed me, and that He would not allow such vile sins to continue; I was so scared that I nearly lost my mind. Yet I did my best to find excuses for the mischief I had done; I said that I had been raised as a sinner, so it wasn't my fault; but still, a voice inside me said: ""There was the church's Sunday school, you could have gone there; if you had gone, they would have taught you the right thing, they would have told you that those who treat blacks the way you do will burn in hell forever.""",15.714,15.444,"Once I told myself that it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a slave at home, where his family was, if he had to be a slave, so it would be better to write a letter to Tom Sawyer to tell Miss Watson where he was. But I immediately gave up the idea for two reasons: she would be indignant and angry at his bad faith and ingratitude for escaping from her, so she would sell him down the river again, and if not, everyone naturally despises an ungrateful black man and would remind Jim of it all the time, so that he would feel miserable and dishonored. And, what would they think of me! Everyone would find out that Huck Finn had helped a black man gain his freedom, and if I ever saw anyone from town again, it would have to be to bow down and lick their boots out of shame. That's how things are: someone does something wrong and then doesn't want to face the consequences. They think that as long as they can hide, they won't have to feel ashamed. And that was my situation. The more I thought about it, the more my conscience gnawed at me, and the more wicked, low, and miserable I felt. And finally, when I suddenly realized that it was the hand of Providence slapping me in the face and telling me that my wickedness was always known up in heaven, because I had stolen a black man from a poor old woman who had never done anything wrong to me, and now it was showing me that there is always Someone who sees everything and does not allow such wickedness beyond a certain point, I almost fell to the ground from the fear it gave me. Well, I did everything I could to make things easier for myself by telling myself that I had been raised poorly, so it wasn't all my fault, but inside me, there was something that kept repeating: ""There was Sunday school and you could have gone; and if you had gone, they would have taught you that people who do the things you have done for that black man are destined for eternal fire.""",24.205,23.982
1617,"It made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I couldn’t try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. So I kneeled down. But the words wouldn’t come. Why wouldn’t they? It warn’t no use to try and hide it from Him. Nor from me, neither. I knowed very well why they wouldn’t come. It was because my heart warn’t right; it was because I warn’t square; it was because I was playing double. I was letting on to give up sin, but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. I was trying to make my mouth say I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write to that nigger’s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can’t pray a lie—I found that out.","I shuddered in fear, and I thought I must pray to become an honest person. I knelt down. But I couldn't think of any words. Why is that? Perhaps it's because one cannot lie to God or oneself. I knew why I couldn't find the words for a prayer, simply because I wasn't being straightforward or sincere. I intended to abandon my sins, but my conscience was still burdened with them... God knows everything, so don't pray for deceitful things. I understood that.",2.541,1.772,"I shivered from head to toe. I decided to pray, maybe I could stop being a sinful child and try to be better. I knelt down. But the words just wouldn't come to my mind. Why wouldn't they come? It was impossible to hide from God what a servant knew. I couldn't hide it from myself either. I knew very well why the words wouldn't come to my mind. Because I wasn't praying from the heart, because I wasn't being honest, because I was being hypocritical. I wanted to say that I would stop sinning, but something inside me insisted on one of the greatest sins. I was trying to open my mouth to say that I would do the right thing, clean up the mess I had made, and write to the owner of the black man to inform him of his whereabouts; but deep down I knew it was a lie – God knew it too. You can't pray falsely – this is what I learned.",17.331,16.654,"That made me tremble. And I decided to start praying and see if I could stop being a bad boy and become better. So I knelt down. But the words wouldn't come out. Why not? It was no use trying to hide it from Him. Nor from myself either. I knew very well why they wouldn't come out of me. It was because my soul was not clean; it was because I had not repented; it was because I was playing both sides. I acted as if I were going to renounce sin, but inside I was still determined on the worst of all. I tried to force my mouth to say that I was going to do what was right and correct and write to the owner of that black man to tell her where he was; but deep down I knew it was a lie, and so did He. You can't pray lies, as I understood then.",29.738,29.279

And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn’t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I’d see him standing my watch on top of his’n, ’stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he’s got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.","I felt relieved as if I had just shed all my sins. And I thought now I could pray. But I didn't pray immediately; instead, I put the piece of paper down and sat thinking. Everything had gone well just when I was most desperate. I thought again about the journey with Jim along this river. Jim was always by my side, day and night, under the moon as well as in the storm. We talked, laughed, and sang on the raft drifting along the water. I couldn't find a single thing that made me hate Jim; on the contrary. Jim stood guard for me, and instead of waking me up, he let me sleep; Jim was happy and joyful when he saw me return safely; and Jim always called me by a dear name, indulged me, and would do anything for me. Then I remembered when I saved Jim and told the others that there was someone with smallpox on the raft, and Jim told me I was his best friend in the world.

The more I thought, the more I thought. Then I started thinking about our journey down the river; the nights, the days, sometimes in the moonlight, sometimes in the storm, the moments I spent with Jim came to mind; we had traveled down the river for so long, talked, sung songs, laughed, and had fun. But for some reason, I had no memory that would harden my heart against him; on the contrary, I remembered things that softened it. I remembered how he took my watch after his own, how he couldn't bring himself to wake me up, how happy he was when I returned from the fog, how delighted he was when we met in the swamp where there was a blood feud; many similar things came to mind; he always called me the apple of his eye, patted my head, did everything he could think of for my comfort, always treated me well; lastly, I remembered the night I saved him by telling the men there were flowers on the raft, how grateful he was, how he said I was the best friend he had in this world, even his only friend now; as I thought about these things, I looked around and saw the paper.",14.316,13.934,"I felt good and clean of sin for the first time in my life and understood that now I could pray.

1625,"Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed below where I judged was Phelps’s place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.","I thought about the action plan. After much deliberation, I decided to choose the plan that I found most suitable. I pushed the raft towards an island with many trees down the river, waited until it got dark, then hid the child in a place and returned to the tent. I slept there all night, waking up before dawn. I had a light meal, put on my clothes, and stepped into the boat to row to the shore. I docked the boat at a spot I guessed was the Phelps' house, hid the bundle of clothes at the edge of the forest, then let water flood the boat, put stones in it to sink it so that I could find it later if needed.",4.787,3.832,"I started making plans to rescue Jim and mulled over a lot of ideas in my mind; finally, I settled on one plan. I set my sights on a densely wooded island down the river, and as soon as it got dark, I emerged from my hiding place with my raft and headed for the island. I hid the raft on the island and lay down to sleep. I slept soundly through the night, woke up before dawn, had breakfast, put on the new clothes I had bought from the store, bundled up the others, got into the canoe, and went ashore. I made sure to land somewhere near Phelps' farm, hid my bundle in the woods, filled the canoe with water, put a few stones in it, and sank it at a spot where I could find it later, about a quarter mile down from a sawmill on a small creek that flowed into the river.",18.699,18.137,"Then I started thinking about how to get it and turned it over and over in my mind until I found a plan that suited me.

I slept all night and got up before dawn, had breakfast, put on the clothes from the store and the rest in a bundle, and took the canoe to go ashore. I arrived where I thought the Phelps' house should be and hid the bundle in the woods; then I filled the canoe with water and stones and sank it where I could find it again whenever I wanted, about a quarter of a mile down from a small steam mill on the shore.",27.716,27.295

But I didn’t mind, because I didn’t want to see nobody just yet—I only wanted to get the lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch—three-night performance—like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk.

We didn't have a dog, so we had to chase it all over the field until it got tired. We didn't catch it until dusk; then we took it to the other side and I headed towards the raft. When I arrived and saw that it had disappeared, I said to myself: ""They've gotten into trouble and had to leave, and they've taken my black man, who is the only black man I have in the world, and now I'm in a strange country and I have nothing of my own, I have nothing left at all nor any way to make a living,"" so I sat down to cry.

Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn’t cool it a bit, neither, the way I’ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times. There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn’t no use, they didn’t happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid to try to work up to it. But at supper, at night, one of the little boys says:","The table was set with all sorts of dishes, enough for seven servants to finish, and every dish was hot. Uncle Silas cared a lot about the food and never let it get cold. Throughout that entire afternoon, Tom and I had to be constantly on guard while talking about various things.

Uncle Silas said a rather long prayer before the meal, but it was worth it; and the food didn't get cold at all, otherwise, I had witnessed many times before how the food got cold because of prayers.

Tom and I also slept in the same room upstairs and shared a bed. Using the excuse of being too tired, we asked to go to bed immediately after eating.

Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn’t ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world. It was a dreadful thing to see. Human beings can be awful cruel to one another.","On the way, Tom told me all about how everyone thought I had been killed, then my father disappeared and didn't come back, and how there was a commotion when Jim ran away. As for me, I told him about the two scoundrels performing in the play ""The Royal Nonesuch,"" and about the journey on the wooden raft from then until now. Around half-past eight, we had reached the middle of the town when we suddenly saw a crowd of people carrying torches, banging pots and pans, and blowing horns. We quickly jumped to the side of the road to let them pass. As they went by, we saw they were leading the king and the duke, who were trapped in an iron bar, their bodies covered in tar and feathers, no longer looking human. Seeing that scene, I felt moved and sorry for those two wretched scoundrels. How can people be so disgustingly cruel to one another?",12.068,11.536,"Tom told me how I was thought to have been murdered, how my father disappeared shortly after and never returned, and the commotion that ensued when Jim escaped; I, in turn, told Tom everything about the Royal Nonesuch con men and our raft journey as much as time allowed; when we reached the town and got to the middle of it, we saw an angry mob coming; they had torches, and they were coming with terrifying shouts and screams, some banging pans, others blowing horns; we immediately threw ourselves aside to let them pass; as the crowd passed by, I saw that the king and the duke were each mounted on a pole – or rather, I realized they were the king and the duke, but they were covered in tar and feathers, they no longer resembled any human beings in this world – they looked more like a pair of gigantic soldier pincushions. I was devastated when I saw them. I felt sorry for these pitiful wretched scoundrels, and I felt that I could never be hard-hearted towards them again. Their condition was truly hair-raising. How cruel people can be to one another.",12.515,11.905,"We went out through the window and climbed down the lightning rod to go to town, as I didn't think anyone was going to say a word to the king and the duke, so if I didn't run to warn them, they were surely going to get into a big mess. On the way, Tom told me that everyone had believed the story about my murder, and that father had disappeared immediately and hadn't returned, and the commotion that ensued when Jim escaped. I told Tom the whole story of our scoundrels from ""The Peerless Royalty,"" and everything I had time to tell him about our raft journey. When we reached the town, towards the center (it must have been around eight-thirty), a bunch of people appeared running with torches, shouting and howling, banging pots and blowing horns; we stepped aside to let them pass, and I saw that they were carrying the king and the duke mounted on a rail. That is, I knew they were the king and the duke, although they had been smeared with tar and feathers and didn't look like beings from this world, but rather a kind of monstrous feather dusters. Well, I regretted seeing them and felt sorry for those poor rascals, as if I couldn't hold anything against them anymore. It was horrible to watch. Human beings can be terribly cruel to one another.",14.771,14.283

1779,"So we poked along back home, and I warn’t feeling so brash as I was before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow—though I hadn’t done nothing. But that’s always the way; it don’t make no difference whether you do right or wrong, a person’s conscience ain’t got no sense, and just goes for him anyway. If I had a yaller dog that didn’t know no more than a person’s conscience does I would pison him. It takes up more room than all the rest of a person’s insides, and yet ain’t no good, nohow. Tom Sawyer he says the same.","We returned home, and we were no longer as eager as when we left. I felt somewhat to blame even though I had nothing to do with this incident. Whether one does right or wrong, if a person doesn't realize it, it still gnaws at them just the same. Tom Sawyer said the same thing.",5.447,4.335,"We returned home, and now I felt neither cheerful like at the beginning, but base, vile, and guilty – even though I had done nothing. But isn't it always like this; whether you do right or wrong changes nothing, the conscience has no logic, it aches incessantly in any case. If I had a dog as foolish as my conscience, I would poison it immediately. This wretched thing takes up more space inside a person than anything else and serves no purpose. Tom Sawyer thought the same thing.",15.444,14.514,"So we went back home, and I no longer felt as proud as before, but rather shrunk and ashamed and as if I were to blame, even though I hadn't done anything. But that's what always happens; it doesn't matter whether one does things right or wrong, because the conscience has no common sense and it always gets on top of you no matter what happens. If I had a yellow dog that wasn't smarter than people's conscience, I would poison it. It takes up more space than everything else, and yet, I don't know why, it's good for nothing.

Then, the night you’re ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip off your chain, and there you are. Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the moat—because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know—and there’s your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever it is.

That's it. Then you just have to place the rope ladder into the loophole, climb out, and slide down into a moat.

No, the greatest experts in this field cut the leg of the bed, but leave it in place and swallow the sawdust so it can't be found; they smear mud and grease on the cut so that even the most vigilant guards won't realize it's been cut, thinking the bed leg is completely intact. But on the night you're ready, you give the bed leg a kick, it splits in two; you remove your chain, and that's it. Then all you have to do is tie the rope ladder to the barred windows, climb down, and fall into the ditch and break your leg – because the rope ladder is five or six meters too short – and right in front of you, you'll find your horses and loyal servants, who will grab you, put you on a saddle, and you'll head off to your homeland, Languedoc, Navarre, or wherever it is.

It ain’t no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it’s his right; and so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with. He said if we warn’t prisoners it would be a very different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he warn’t a prisoner.

He said that the two of us were representing the imprisoned; and for the imprisoned, any way to get them supplies was acceptable, and no one would blame them for it. For a prisoner, taking what they need to escape is not a crime, it's their right, Tom said. So if we were representing the imprisoned, we had every right to steal anything on their behalf, at least anything that could be used to escape from prison. He also said that if we weren't prisoners, then it would be a different story, and if someone who wasn't a prisoner stole, they would just be a very bad person. Therefore, we thought we could steal anything we could get our hands on. Yet, one day, I stole a watermelon from the black man's garden to eat, and he scolded me harshly, then he gave the black people a dime without saying what it was for. Tom said that we should only steal things we needed. I said that I needed a watermelon. He said we didn't need a watermelon to escape from prison.

We crept in under Jim’s bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away, and clearing out without losing any time.

We stood over Jim for a while; he looked quite lively and healthy; we woke him up slowly. He was so happy to see us that he almost cried; he called us ""my dear"" and said all the affectionate words he could think of; he asked us to find a chisel to cut the shackle on his leg, and then we would escape without wasting any time.

Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that’s always getting into bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.","In the morning, we went to the woodpile and chopped the brass candlestick into several pieces, then Tim put them into his pocket along with some spoons.

When Jim bit into the bread, it felt like his teeth were going to break. Jim didn't complain, he just said that it was a common grit that often got mixed into the bread.

Tom himself said so. Jim didn't say what it was about, but he pretended it was a little stone or one of those things that always get into the bread, you know; but from then on, he never took a bite of anything without first stabbing it with a fork three or four times.",25.286,24.722

After thinking for a while, he told me what to do now. We went to wait at the place where the spoon basket was until Aunt Saly arrived. Tom counted the spoons and set one aside, then slipped one into his sleeve. Then Tom said:",6.948,5.396,"Tom was very worried about what we would do with the spoon, but we had to take it.

2005,"So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time. Well, she was in a tearing way—just a-trembling all over, she was so mad. But she counted and counted till she got that addled she’d start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they come out right, and three times they come out wrong. Then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west; and she said cle’r out and let her have some peace, and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she’d skin us. So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along with her shingle nail, before noon. We was very well satisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took, because he said now she couldn’t ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life; and wouldn’t believe she’d counted them right if she did; and said that after she’d about counted her head off for the next three days he judged she’d give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more.","I counted again, and after finishing, I still only saw nine like before. That made her so angry she was about to go crazy. But she kept counting over and over, counting inside the basket and then outside the basket, sometimes it was enough, sometimes it was missing. Too frustrated, she grabbed the spoon basket and threw it into the corner of the house, hitting the cat lying there, and then yelled at us to get out so she could have some peace. So we took the spoon and put it into her kitchen apron pocket while she was shouting at us to leave. By near noon, Jim had received both the spoon and the nail. We found the whole thing very amusing. He said that after she counted like that for three more days, she would give up, and if anyone asked her to count again, she might even kill them.",4.726,3.808,"Upon this, I took one of them, and when she counted, there were still nine spoons. Aunt Sally was now completely out of her mind... She was trembling and had gone mad. But she counted again, and again, until she got so dizzy that she started counting wrong. If the count was correct three times, it was wrong three times. Upon this, she couldn't take it anymore, grabbed the basket and threw it, managing to hit the cat; she immediately disappeared and asked us to leave her alone for a while, saying that if we bothered her until dinner, she would skin us alive. Thus, we had secured that single spoon; while she was giving us the marching orders, I slipped the spoon into the pocket of her apron; thus, Jim was able to get both the spoon and the nail before noon. Because of this, we were very pleased with ourselves, and Tom said we had been rewarded for our trouble twice over, because even if they took her life, his aunt would never count those spoons again. No matter how many times she counted, she wouldn't believe she had counted correctly. Later, he said that his aunt couldn't pull herself together for the next three days, and if anyone asked her to count again, she would be ready to commit murder.",9.077,8.355,"So I swiped one and only nine came out, just like the last time. She got extremely nervous and started trembling all over because she was so angry. But she kept counting and counting until she got so confused that she even counted the basket as if it were a spoon, so three times she got the count right and three times she got it wrong. Then she grabbed the basket, threw it to the other side of the room, kicked the cat, and said we should leave her alone and that if we bothered her again, she would skin us alive. So we kept the missing spoon and left it in the pocket of her apron while she ordered us to leave, and Jim got it along with the nail before noon. We were very happy with all that, and Tom said it was worth twice the trouble it had caused us, because now she wouldn't be able to count the spoons twice without getting confused even if her life depended on it; and even if she counted them right, she wouldn't believe it, and he said that when her head got tired of counting, she would give up and threaten to kill anyone who asked her to count them again.",15.437,14.838
2006,"So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she didn’t know how many sheets she had any more, and she didn’t care, and warn’t a-going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it, and wouldn’t count them again not to save her life; she druther die first.","That night, we again hung the bed sheet over the wire as usual and stole another one from the closet. Then we left it, then took it away, repeatedly for several days, until she no longer knew how many sheets there were and didn't bother to count them anymore.",5.796,4.319,"Upon this, that night we hung the sheet back on the clothesline and stole a sheet from Aunt Sally's closet; for a few days, we kept putting it back and stealing it again; finally, she lost count of how many sheets she had and said she didn't care, wouldn't wear out her soul over it, and would rather die than count the sheets again.",23.159,22.031,"So that night we put the sheet back on the clothesline and stole one from the closet, and we kept putting it in and taking it out for a couple of days until she no longer knew how many sheets she had and didn't even care because she wasn't going to let it ruin her life or count them again even if it cost her life; she would rather die first.",26.82,25.754
2007,"So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn’t no consequence, it would blow over by-and-by.","Now we were at ease. At ease about the shirt, the sheet, and the candles, thanks to the story of the little girl, the mouse, and the mixed-up counting, but nothing was mentioned about the brass candlestick.",15.657,13.293,"Thanks to the calf, the mice, and the counting confusion, our problems with shirts, sheets, spoons, and candles were resolved; as for the candlestick, it didn't cause much of a fuss and would eventually be forgotten over time.",10.839,8.056,"So now everything was in order regarding the shirt and the sheet, the spoon and the candles, with the help of the veal; the rats and the accounts that didn't add up, and as for the candelabrum, it didn't matter, in time they would forget about it.",29.023,27.466
2008,"But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with the smoke; because, you see, we didn’t want nothing but a crust, and we couldn’t prop it up right, and she would always cave in. But of course we thought of the right way at last—which was to cook the ladder, too, in the pie. So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with. We let on it took nine months to make it.","But surely it would come out eventually. But making the cake was really a whole project. We encountered one difficulty after another before we could finish that cake. We took it into the forest, cooked it there, and were very pleased when it was done. But it wasn't something that could be done in a single day. We had to use three bowls full of dough, got burns all over our bodies, and our eyes stung. Finally, we figured out that we had to stuff the entire rope ladder into the cake first. The next night, we crawled over to Jim's place, tore the bed sheet into small strips and twisted them together, and by dawn, we had made a very nice rope that could support the weight of a person. By late morning, we went out into the forest, but we couldn't fit it into the cake.",8.92,8.113,"But making börek was a troublesome task, it seemed like we would never get rid of the trouble of baking that börek. We set up our arrangement somewhere deep in the forest and started baking the börek; in the end, we managed to bake it, and it turned out quite well, but it took more than a day; we had to use three pans full of flour, and while working on it, we burned ourselves in many places and our eyes were scorched by the smoke; because what we really needed was the outside of the börek and we couldn't get it right, every time the top would collapse inward. But in the end, we managed to get it right, that is, we finally figured out to bake the ladder inside the börek. For this, we went to Jim's place the second night, tore the sheet into small strips and tied them together, and by the time we had made a very nice rope long enough to hang a man, it was still far from morning. But we pretended that preparing the rope took nine months.",10.578,9.754,"But the cake gave us a lot of work; it only caused us problems. We prepared it in the forest and cooked it there, and finally, we had it done and very satisfactory; but it took us more than a day and we had to use three basins full of flour before finishing it, and we got burned all over and the smoke got into our eyes; because the thing is, we only wanted to get a crust and we couldn't get it to hold well, because it always collapsed. But, naturally, we finally came up with something that would work, which was to cook the ladder with the cake as well. So that night we went to see Jim, tore the sheet into strips and twisted them all together, and before dawn, we had a great rope that would be enough to hang someone. We pretended it had taken us nine months to braid it.",15.272,14.547
2009,"And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn’t go into the pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope enough for forty pies if we’d a wanted them, and plenty left over for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. We could a had a whole dinner.","By late morning, we went out into the forest, but we couldn't fit it into the cake. A rope made from an entire bed sheet would require forty cakes to hold it all, and there would still be leftovers to put in soup and sauces.",4.616,2.594,"We took the rope and went to the forest before noon, but we couldn't fit it into the pastry.

This rope would be enough for a large dinner.",9.057,6.828,"In the morning we took her to the forest, but she wouldn't fit into the pie.

2010,"But we didn’t need it. All we needed was just enough for the pie, and so we throwed the rest away. We didn’t cook none of the pies in the wash-pan—afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they warn’t, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first pies, because we didn’t know how, but she come up smiling on the last one. We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope ladder wouldn’t cramp him down to business I don’t know nothing what I’m talking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time, too.","But we didn't need that. All that was necessary was to stuff enough into the cake, and we discarded the rest. We didn't cook anything in the bowl, for fear that the tin would melt. But Uncle Silas had a copper warming pan that we treasured, as it was an heirloom with a wooden handle, sent from England. He had hidden it in the attic along with a lot of jars, bottles, and other valuable items. Actually, it is not highly valued, but because it is an antique, it is considered important. We took it out to the forest, the first cake we cooked got burnt, but the next one turned out fine. We took it out, cleaned it, rubbed it with flour, placed it on the charcoal stove, then added some scraps of paper, put a wet lump of dough, covered it, and put glowing charcoal on the lid. Then we stood more than a meter away, holding a long, cool handle, and fifteen minutes later, we had a very beautiful-looking cake. But anyone who eats that cake will suffer from a stomachache and be bedridden.",5.444,4.395,"But we didn't need that much. We only needed enough rope to fit into the pie, so we threw the rest away. Fearing that the metal would melt, we didn't make the pie in the pan we found; instead, we used Uncle Silas's beautiful brass bed warmer. He valued this warmer greatly because this long-handled bed warmer, belonging to his ancestors, had come over with William the Conqueror on the Mayflower or one of the first ships, and it was stored in the attic along with a lot of old pots and other valuable things; their value, of course, came not from their monetary worth but from being heirlooms; so we took this bed warmer and went to the woods, but we failed with the first pies because we didn't quite know how to do it, but on the last try, it rose beautifully. To cook it properly, we first spread the dough on the bottom of the warmer, placed it on the coals, and then put the rope ladder on top of the dough. After spreading another layer of dough on top and closing the lid, we placed pieces of coal on top; thanks to the long handle, we comfortably held the pan about a meter and a half away without being affected by the heat, and after fifteen minutes, we had an appetizing pie. But anyone who tried to eat the pie would need a few boxes of toothpicks. Because if swallowing the rope ladder inside the pie isn't hard, then I don't know what I'm talking about. Also, the person eating it would be writhing in stomach pain.",11.428,10.89,"But we didn't need that much. The only thing we needed was enough for the cake, so we threw the rest away. We didn't bake any of the cakes in the basin, because we feared the welded part would melt, but Uncle Silas had a wonderful copper heater that he valued greatly, because it had belonged to one of his ancestors, and it had a long wooden handle that had come from England with William the Conqueror on the Mayflower or one of those pilgrim ships and was hidden in the attic, with a bunch of old pots and valuable things, not because they were worth anything, which they weren't, but because they were like relics, you know, and we secretly took it out and brought it to the woods, but it failed us on the first cakes because we didn't know how to use it well, although it worked great on the last one. We put dough around all the edges, filled it with a rope of rags and then covered it all with dough and closed the lid, and on top we put some embers and stepped back five feet, with the long handle, so calm and comfortable, and after fifteen minutes we got a cake that was a pleasure to see. But whoever ate it would have to take a couple of barrels of toothpicks, because if that rope ladder didn't clog all their teeth, then I don't know what I'm talking about, and on top of that, they would have a stomach ache for the rest of their life.",22.851,22.494

And it would fall into the food dish, onto our backs, or onto our necks. Each one looked beautiful, but it was different for Aunt Saly. She was terribly disgusted by snakes. Every time a snake fell, she would scream and run away. I've never seen a woman so afraid of snakes. It took about a week for all the snakes to leave the house. Aunt Saly was still scared. It's really strange, but Tom said that all women are like that.",3.292,3.106,"We had a magnificent collection of spiders, insects, frogs, caterpillars, and similar things; we even thought of finding a beehive, but we couldn't manage that. The bee family was fully at home. We didn't give up immediately, we lingered there as long as we could, either they would get tired and leave, or we would. In the end, we gave up. We applied andiz powder to the places they stung us, we felt a bit relieved, but for a while, we couldn't sit comfortably on our bottoms. Then we went snake hunting, caught a few dozen small snakes, put them in a sack, and then hid the sack in our room; by then, it was dinner time, we had worked hard all day and were starving. But when we returned, we couldn't find a single snake in the room – we had left the sack's mouth loose, and the snakes had found a way out. It didn't really matter, though, because they were still somewhere in the house. We thought we could catch some of them again. For a while, there was never a shortage of snakes in the house. From time to time, you could see them falling from the roof beams and other places; they generally fell onto your plate or slid down your neck, meaning they mostly appeared in the places you least wanted them to. They were very beautiful and striped snakes, even if a million of them came, they wouldn't harm you; but it didn't matter to Aunt Sally, she was disgusted by snakes of any kind, she couldn't stand them at all; if one of them fell on her, she would drop whatever she was doing and dash outside. I had never seen a woman like her. Moreover, her screams could reach the heavens. The poor woman couldn't even hold the snakes with tongs. When she opened her bed and found a snake inside, she would throw herself outside and scream so loudly that you would think the house was on fire. Aunt Sally disturbed the peace of the big man so much that he got to the point where he wished snakes had never been created. Even a week after the last snake was thrown out of the house, Aunt Sally still hadn't recovered; she didn't even seem like she would recover; if you touched her neck with a feather while she was sitting and thinking about something, she would jump three meters into the air. It was a very strange thing. But Tom said all women were like that. For some reason, they were created that way.",13.845,13.56,"We managed to get a splendid variety of spiders, beetles, frogs, and caterpillars, among other things, and we almost took a wasp nest, but we didn't succeed. The family was at home. We didn't give up immediately, but endured as much as we could, because we tried to tire them out or let them tire us out, which is what happened in the end. Then we went to put some ointment on the stings and almost got better, although we couldn't sit comfortably. Then we went out to look for snakes and caught a couple of dozen water snakes and house snakes and put them in a sack in our room, which brought us to dinner time after a whole day of work; were we hungry? No, of course not! When we returned, there wasn't a single damn snake left; we hadn't tied the sack well and somehow they had found their way out and left. But it didn't matter much, because they had to be somewhere in the house. So we thought we would find them again. No, for many days snakes were not scarce in that house. You could see them hanging from the beams and other times tucked away somewhere, and they generally fell onto someone's plate or crawled down their neck, almost always where it wasn't pleasant. Well, they were all very pretty with their stripes and all, and even if there were a million of them, they wouldn't have harmed anyone, but Aunt Sally didn't care about that; she was disgusted by snakes, no matter what kind they were, and she couldn't stand them in any way, and every time one fell on her, no matter what she was doing, she would stop and run away. I've never seen a woman like that; you could hear her screams all the way to Jericho. She couldn't even grab one with tongs. If she turned around and found one in the bed, she would run and start screaming as if the house was on fire. It annoyed the old man so much that he said he almost wished snakes had never been created. But man, even after there hadn't been a single one in the house for a week, Aunt Sally still hadn't recovered; she was still so scared that when she was sitting thinking about something, if you touched her on the neck with a feather, she would jump out of her shoes. It was very curious. But Tom said all women were the same. He said that for some reason or another they were made that way.",22.421,22.222
2082,"We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she allowed these lickings warn’t nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them. I didn’t mind the lickings, because they didn’t amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot. But we got them laid in, and all the other things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim’s was when they’d all swarm out for music and go for him. Jim didn’t like the spiders, and the spiders didn’t like Jim; and so they’d lay for him, and make it mighty warm for him. And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn’t no room in bed for him, skasely; and when there was, a body couldn’t sleep, it was so lively, and it was always lively, he said, because they never all slept at one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one gang under him, in his way, and t’other gang having a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn’t ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.","Every time a snake crawled past her place, we would get a beating. I wasn't afraid of the beatings because they didn't hurt at all. I just dreaded having to catch more snakes. I've never seen a room as lively as Jim's when all those creatures crawled out to listen to the music and gathered around Jim. Jim couldn't even blink in peace; when the snakes slept, the mice would come out, and when the mice went back in, the snakes would come out to stand guard, so there was always a group at his feet and another at his head. When Jim tried to find another place to lie down, the spiders would crawl over. He said if he got out this time, he would never want to be a prisoner again, even if they paid him.",7.175,6.803,"Whenever Aunt Sally saw a snake, we would get a beating; moreover, she said that if we filled the house with snakes again, the beatings would be nothing compared to what she would do. I didn't mind the beatings much because they hardly hurt, but catching another sack of snakes was no easy task. Still, we caught more snakes and completed the others. There was no place as lively as Jim's cabin anymore; all the animals would flock to Jim to listen to music. Jim couldn't warm up to the spiders, and the spiders couldn't warm up to him. They attacked him at every opportunity and made his life miserable. Additionally, Jim complained that there was no place for him to sleep between the mice, snakes, and millstones; even if he managed to squeeze in and lie down, he couldn't sleep because there was constant movement in the bed; since the creatures didn't all sleep at the same time, they took turns using the bed, so while the snakes slept, the mice would be running around; when the mice slept, the snakes would take over. One gang was always under Jim while the other was holding a circus on top of him, and if he tried to find another place to sleep, the spiders would attack him while he walked. He said that if he ever got out, he would never be a prisoner again, even if they paid him.",13.654,13.168,"He would give us a beating every time he encountered one of the snakes, and he said that was nothing compared to what he would do to us if we filled the house with them again. The beatings didn't bother me, because they were really nothing, but I did care about how difficult it was for us to find another bunch. But we got them, along with the other critters, and in your life, you have never seen a cabin as lively as Jim's when they all came out to hear the music and approached him. Jim didn't like spiders and the spiders didn't like Jim; so they would wait and then make his life impossible. And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the mill wheel, he hardly had any room left on the cot, and in what little space he had, he couldn't sleep, because it never stopped, and it never stopped because they never all slept at the same time, but took turns, so when the snakes slept, the rats were on guard, and when the rats went to bed, it was the snakes' turn to be on guard, so he always had a bunch of critters underneath him and another bunch making a circus on top, and if he got up to find a new spot, the spiders would pounce on him during the change. He said that if he ever escaped, he would never be a prisoner again, not even if they paid him a salary.",24.961,24.624
2083,"Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape. The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust, and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache.

2084,"But as I was saying, we’d got all the work done now, at last; and we was all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim. The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger, but hadn’t got no answer, because there warn’t no such plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn’t no time to lose. So Tom said, now for the nonnamous letters.","After finishing that, we had such severe stomachaches that we thought we were going to die. Uncle Silas had written several letters to the plantation down in Orleans to inform them to send someone to take the black man back, but there was no reply, because there was no such plantation down there. Finally, he said he would post a notice about Jim in the St. Louis and Orleans newspapers. When he mentioned St. Louis, it made me shiver all over. At that moment, Tom decided to write an anonymous letter.",12.965,11.907,"But as I said, we had finally finished all the work, and we were all exhausted, but Jim was almost pickled by now. The old man wrote letters several times to the plantation south of Orleans, asking them to come and get their runaway Negro, but received no reply, because there was no such plantation; he then said he would place an ad for Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans newspapers; when he mentioned the St. Louis newspapers, my hair stood on end, we had no time to lose.

But we got under all right, and out through the hole, swift but soft—Jim first, me next, and Tom last, which was according to Tom’s orders. Now we was in the lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside. So we crept to the door, and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn’t make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out first, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down, not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim over it; but Tom’s britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out:","They stepped in, but in the darkness, they couldn't see us.

He nudged Jim with his elbow to signal him to crawl forward. He went last. He then pressed his ear against the crack to listen, still hearing footsteps rustling outside. After that, he nudged us, and we crawled stealthily, holding our breath, without making a sound, and continued towards the fence like the Indians.

This time he put his ear to the crack and listened, listened, listened, but there were always people walking outside; finally, he gave us the signal and we quietly slipped out, not even breathing, moving stealthily towards the fences. We moved in a single file and reached the fence, Jim and I climbed over it, but Tom's pants got caught on a splinter at the top of the fence at the last moment, and we heard someone approaching; then Tom forced the pants and the splinter snapped with a crack; as he started following us, we heard someone shout:",16.525,16.043,"So they came in, but in the darkness they couldn't see us and almost all of them stepped on us while we tried to get under the bed.

2146,"So here they come, full tilt. We could hear them because they wore boots and yelled, but we didn’t wear no boots and didn’t yell. We was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind them. They’d had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn’t scare off the robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn’t nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, but didn’t make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out. And when we stepped onto the raft I says:","They rushed in. We could hear them clearly because they wore boots and shouted, while we neither wore boots nor shouted.

The dogs came running, barking loudly as if there were a million of them. We stood still, waiting for the dogs to reach us. They were all domestic dogs, so when they saw us, they wagged their tails happily and then ran ahead following the people who were rummaging and shouting. Then we turned back up towards the river, whistling casually behind them; we walked near the workshop and then turned into the bushes where my boat was tied. We all jumped into the boat and rowed to the middle of the river, trying not to make too much noise. So we rowed away, gently and comfortably, heading towards the island where I had hidden the raft. We could still hear people shouting and dogs barking along the riverbank. It wasn't until we had gone far that those sounds gradually faded and disappeared completely. Once on the raft, I said:",10.491,9.938,"They were all coming after us at once. We could hear them because they had boots on and were shouting, but we didn't have boots, and we weren't shouting.

They had silenced the dogs so they wouldn't scare off the robbers, but now someone had let them loose, and here they were coming, barking madly, but they were our dogs; so we waited for them to catch up to us, and when they saw us, all their excitement died down; after a few murmurs, they continued barking and running towards the shouting ahead; we started running after them and almost reached the mill, at one point diving into the bushes and getting to where my canoe was tied, we got into the canoe and started paddling towards the middle of the river with all our might, but we were definitely not making more noise than necessary.

But the others said, don’t do it, it wouldn’t answer at all; he ain’t our nigger, and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. So that cooled them down a little, because the people that’s always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain’t done just right is always the very ones that ain’t the most anxious to pay for him when they’ve got their satisfaction out of him.","I followed the group to see what they would do with Jim while the doctor and Uncle Silas followed Tom into the house. The people seemed angry, some wanted to hang Jim immediately as an example for other black people, but others said they shouldn't do that because he wasn't a local black person, and what if his owner came to claim compensation. Hearing that, they calmed down a bit. They cursed Jim terribly.",8.29,7.867,"I followed the men to see what they would do to Jim; the old doctor and Uncle Silas also went into the house after Tom. The men were very aggressive and some wanted to hang Jim, so that he would be an example to the other negroes living there, and they wouldn't try to escape like Jim, causing a lot of trouble, terrifying a whole family for days and nights. But others didn't want to hang him; it wasn't a solution, after all, he wasn't our negro and his owner could come and demand money for the negro. Upon this, the men calmed down a bit, because those who are most eager to hang negroes who want to do something wrong are always the least willing to pay the money after dealing with him.",20.091,19.474,"I followed the men to find out what they were going to do with Jim, and the old doctor and Uncle Silas followed Tom to the house.

But the others said, ""No, that can't be done; that black man isn't ours, and surely the owner will show up and make us pay for him.""

2224,"“Don’t be no rougher on him than you’re obleeged to, because he ain’t a bad nigger. When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn’t cut the bullet out without some help, and he warn’t in no condition for me to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little worse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn’t let me come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he’d kill me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn’t do anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have help somehow; and the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he’ll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well. Of course I judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I was! and there I had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night. It was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I’d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn’t, because the nigger might get away, and then I’d be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he’d been worked main hard lately. I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars—and kind treatment, too. I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home—better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I was, with both of ’m on my hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start. He ain’t no bad nigger, gentlemen; that’s what I think about him.”","- Everyone, don't treat him so badly, because he is not a bad black man. When I came to find that boy, I had no one to help me to extract the bullet. And I couldn't leave the boy there, as he was getting more critical by the minute. He went crazy, absolutely refused to let me come near, and told me that if I drew chalk on the raft, he would kill me. I felt there was nothing I could do with him. Suddenly, at that moment, this black man crawled out from somewhere and said he would lend a hand. Of course, I immediately thought he was the runaway black man. So I had to stay there for a whole day and night. It was really a tight spot! At home, I had some patients waiting, I wanted to run back to check on them, but I couldn't, because I was also afraid that if the black man ran away, I would be blamed; and at that time, there were no boats passing by to call for help. So I had to wait until this morning. And I have never seen a black man more skillful and loyal than him; he even sacrificed his freedom to do that. He was also very tired. I could clearly see that he must have been working a lot recently. A black man like that is worth a thousand dollars, and deserves to be treated better. Then I saw some people coming by boat, luckily the black man was sitting on the plank, head down on his knees, fast asleep. I signaled the boat to come closer, they jumped up and held the black man tightly and tied him up, so it wasn't too difficult for us. As for the boy, he also fell asleep. We moved the oars to the raft, rowed gently, then docked and tied the raft. From start to finish, this black man did not show any sign of wanting to move or say a word. He is not a bad black man, that's what I think.",7.328,6.952,"“Do not treat him badly for no reason, because he is not a bad negro. When I found the child, I realized I couldn't remove the bullet without help, but the child was in such bad shape that he couldn't be left alone to find help; his condition was gradually worsening, and after a considerable amount of time, he lost consciousness and wouldn't let me approach him anymore, saying he would kill me if I chalked the raft, he babbled such nonsense for a long time that I thought I couldn't be of any help to him; so, I said I needed to find help somehow; as soon as I said this, that negro suddenly appeared and said he would help, and indeed, he helped very well. Of course, I realized he was a runaway negro, but what could I do? Moreover, I had to wait there all day and night. I thought I was in trouble! I had a few patients with colds, I wanted to go back to town to see them too, but I couldn't go, then the negro would escape and I would be blamed; besides, no boats were passing by nearby. I stayed on the raft until dawn this morning, and I must say I have never seen a negro take such good care of a patient, so faithfully, he risked his freedom to help me, moreover, he could barely lift his arm, it was clear he had been worked very hard recently. I was very pleased with the negro's behavior; such a negro is worth a thousand dollars, gentlemen… He also deserves to be treated well. He found everything I needed, and made the child as comfortable as if he were at home… Maybe even more comfortable, since it was very quiet around; but I was in a bad state, both of them were on my mind; I had to wait there until this morning; then a boat approached and by chance, the negro was sitting at the helm with his head between his knees, sleeping; I signaled to the people on the boat to approach quietly, before the negro knew what was happening, they grabbed him tightly and tied his hands and feet, there was no trouble at all. The child was also sleeping, we tied the raft to the boat and quietly pulled it to a safe place; meanwhile, the negro didn't make any fuss from the beginning, he didn't even say a word. He is not a bad negro, gentlemen; that is my opinion.”",10.186,9.801,"—Do not treat him worse than necessary, because he is not a bad black man. When I arrived where I found the boy, I saw that I couldn't remove the bullet without some help and that he wasn't in a condition to be left alone while I went to get it, and he kept getting worse and worse, and after a while, he lost his mind and wouldn't let me get close; he said that if I marked the raft with chalk, he would kill me and all sorts of absurd things. When I saw that I couldn't do anything for him, I said to myself: ""I need someone to help me,"" and just then that black man appeared out of nowhere and said he would help me, and he really did help me. Of course, I thought he must be a runaway black man, but that's how things were, and I had to stay there all the rest of the day and all night. I assure you it has been difficult! I had a couple of patients with fevers and naturally, I would have liked to go to town to see them, but I didn't dare because the black man could escape and then it would be my fault; however, not a single skiff came close enough for me to call. So I had to stay there until dawn this morning, and I have never seen a black man who knew better how to take care of a sick person or was more faithful, even though he had to put his freedom at risk, and on top of that, he was exhausted and it was clear that he had had a lot to do recently. That's why I liked that black man; and I assure you, gentlemen, that a black man like that is worth a thousand dollars and should be treated well. I didn't have everything I needed and the boy was recovering just as if he were at home, and maybe better because it was very quiet, but there I was with both of them in my hands, and I had to stay there until dawn; then some men appeared in a skiff, and luckily the black man was sitting next to the mattress with his head resting on his knees, sleeping like a log; so I signaled to them silently, and they approached, grabbed him, and tied him up without him realizing what was happening, and we haven't had any problems. Since the boy was also half asleep, we wrapped the oars with some cloths, hooked up the raft, and towed it silently, and the black man didn't make any fuss or say a word from the beginning.

I hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they didn’t think of it, and I reckoned it warn’t best for me to mix in, but I judged I’d get the doctor’s yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I’d got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me—explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger.","Then they went out, locked Jim in there, and locked the door.

2283,"The first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time of the evasion?—what it was he’d planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before? And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style, and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would we. But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.","As soon as I got a chance to meet Tom alone, I immediately asked him what he thought during the escape? How would he plan if the escape was successful and how would he restore freedom to Jim? He said that if we managed to rescue Jim safely, we would let him sit on a raft drifting downstream, and together we would venture all the way to the river's mouth. At that point, we would tell him that he was free, then put him on a steamboat home, reward him, gather all the black folks around to dance and escort him into town with a proper parade, complete with drums and trumpets; he would become a hero, and so would the two of us. But I think we've almost done just that already.",11.114,10.328,"When I first caught Tom alone, I asked him what idea he had in mind during the escape. What he was thinking of doing if the escape went smoothly and we managed to free a slave who was already free. Upon this, he told me the plan that had been in his mind from the beginning: If we could save Jim, we would go down the river on the raft together, have many adventures until we reached the mouth of the river, then we would tell Jim he was free, give him a comfortable journey home on a steamboat, give him money for the time he lost, inform all the blacks in the village beforehand, and they would take Jim to the village with a band and a torchlight procession; thus Jim would be a hero, and so would we. But the point where things had come now was just as good.",21.271,20.733,"THE FIRST TIME I could see Tom alone, I asked him what he had thought about during the escape, what he planned to do if the escape went well and he managed to free the black man who was already free before. He replied that what he had planned from the beginning, if we managed to get Jim out and keep him safe, was to continue with him down the river on the raft and have lots of adventures there, and then tell him he was free and take him back home on a fine steamboat, and pay him for all the time he had lost and write ahead so that all the black people would come to greet him and take him dancing into town with a torchlight procession and a band. Then he would be a hero and so would we. But I figured things were fine just the way they were.",32.278,31.851
2284,"We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom, they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. And we had him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good, and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:","We helped Jim get free from the chains. When Aunt Polly, Uncle Silas, and Aunt Sally learned how Jim had helped the doctor take care of Tom, they were very moved, praised him endlessly, gave Jim all the food he liked, let him rest, and didn't make him do anything at all. Tom gave Jim forty dollars for being a very patient prisoner and playing that role very well.
