3,"He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.","My father said. My father didn't say much more, but because there was always a subtle way of communicating between us, I understood that his words contained much deeper meanings.",11.02,8.104,"He hadn't said anything else, but since we understood each other without much talking, I realized he wanted to convey much more.",6.958,3.592,"That was all, but within our reserve, we have always understood each other in an uncommon way, and I understood that his words meant much more.",22.757,19.786

This habit allowed me to meet many peculiar individuals, but it also condemned me to a considerable number of annoying people.",5.099,1.84,"Consequently, I tend to reserve my judgments, a habit that has allowed me to discover very curious characters and has also made me the victim of quite a few incorrigible bores.",32.565,30.185
5,"The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men.","The characteristic I just mentioned, if manifested in an ordinary person, would quickly attract abnormal minds to them. Therefore, when I was still studying at university, I was often unfairly labeled as a political merchant, because I knew many sad, private, and secret stories of people, even the stories of libertine men I didn't know. It's not that I went out of my way to seek out the private matters of others.",5.206,3.575,"Those who think differently immediately recognize this trait in a normal person and quickly become attached to it.

However, I often did this unintentionally.",9.945,7.666,"The anomalous mind detects and quickly takes advantage of that quality when it perceives it in an ordinary person, and it so happened that at university I was unjustly accused of being an intriguer, for being aware of the secret sorrows of some inaccessible and difficult individuals.",18.091,16.065
6,"Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.","I often had to pretend to sleep, pretend to be busy, or act indifferent and unfriendly when I noticed clear signs that a private matter was about to be revealed. In fact, the confessions of young men, or at least the words they used to express themselves, were often just borrowed ideas and phrases from others that they had edited and trimmed, making their thoughts no longer coherent or clear.",13.553,12.286,"The moment I sensed someone was about to confide in me, depending on the situation, I would either pretend to be asleep, act as if I were very busy, or dismiss them with a joke. Because these intimate revelations of young people, or at least the expressions they use to tell them, are usually either borrowed from here and there or are suppressed emotions.",15.418,13.971,"Most of the confidences I did not seek: many times I have pretended to sleep, or to be absorbed in my own concerns, or I have shown a hostile frivolity at the first unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was looming on the horizon; because the intimate revelations of the young, or at least the terms in which they make them, are generally plagiarized and suffer from obvious omissions.",32.768,31.808

8,"I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.","I was always afraid that if I forgot to do so, I would miss out on many things, just like the things my father proudly pointed out and I also proudly repeated, which is that the basic awareness of polite conduct is not always equally distributed to everyone at birth.",7.298,5.002,"I still fear forgetting this saying of my father's, which he uttered wisely and I wisely agreed with: some fundamental subtleties are unjustly distributed in the world.",5.54,2.844,"I still believe that I would lose something if I forgot that, as my father suggested with a certain snobbery, and as I now repeat with a certain snobbery, the most basic sense of decency is unequally distributed at birth.",19.589,16.808

10,"Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on.","Human conduct can be built on solid rock or on a swampy foundation, but at some point, I no longer care what it was built on.",10.243,5.92,"There may be a hard rock or a swamp beneath human behaviors, but after a certain point, I can't say that I care much.",28.264,25.131,"I don't care, once a certain point is surpassed, whether the behavior is founded on stone or on swampy ground.",12.357,8.42

With a heightened sensitivity that could perceive the future, he was like a complex machine capable of recording earthquakes from thousands of miles away.",9.98,7.433,"If a series of successful gestures is a sign of personality, Gatsby had something magnificent, an exaggerated sensitivity to life's promises.

14,"This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.","This sensitivity of his had nothing to do with the weak, sentimental sensitivity respected under the term ""creative temperament.""
