2,"From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion.","From the corner of the Persian camel saddlebag-patterned divan on which he habitually lay smoking countless cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could only faintly see the honey-sweet and honey-colored blossoms of a laburnum tree whose trembling branches seemed to struggle under the weight of such a blazing beauty; and occasionally, the strange shadows of birds in flight would flicker across the long tussore silk curtains drawn before the wide window, evoking a sensation somewhat akin to a fleeting Japanese impression, and making him think of the green-faced, yellow-fanged artists in Tokyo, who, through the medium of an inherently static art, had attempted to convey a sense of swiftness and movement.",26.687,26.048,"Lord Henry Wotton, who was lying in the corner of the divan adorned with Iranian saddlebags, smoking countless cigarettes as was his habit, could make out the honey-colored, honey-sweet flowers of the yellow wisteria tree from where he was. The tree's trembling branches seemed to struggle under the burden of such flame-like beauty. Occasionally, the shadows of birds, like dreams, would fall upon the long, silken curtains stretched in front of the large window.

Latin language. 2 Circus, an arena that predates the Colosseum in Rome. Dorian often read and reread this strange chapter and the two chapters immediately following it, in which, like on some strange tapestries or finely crafted enamel paintings, were depicted the beautiful and majestic forms of those whom Corruption and Blood and Ennui had driven mad or grotesque: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who killed his wife and painted her lips with bright red poison so that her lover could suck death from the deadly thing he kissed; Pietro Barbi, a Venetian, known as Pope Paul II, who sought to claim the title of Formosus out of arrogance, and whose crown, worth two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the cost of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used dogs to hunt living people, and whose assassinated corpse was covered with roses by the harlot who loved him; The Borgias on white horses, with Incest and Fratricide riding beside them, Perotto's blood-stained cloak; Pietro Riario, the Cardinal young Archbishop of Florence, son and subordinate of Sixtus IV, whose beauty was matched only by his depravity, and who hosted Leonora of Aragon in a red and white silk tent, filled with goddesses and centaurs, and gilded a boy so that he could serve at banquets as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy could only be cured by death, who loved red blood as others love red wine — rumored to be the Devil's son, and who deceived his father in a dice game by wagering his soul; Giambattista Cibo, who took the name Innocent to mock, and in whose sluggish veins the blood of three boys was transfused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, lover of Isotta, lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned in Rome as an enemy of God and mankind, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, poisoned Ginevra d'Este with an emerald cup, and in honor of a shameful passion built a pagan temple to worship Jesus; Charles VI, who was so madly in love with his sister-in-law that a leper warned him of the madness coming upon him, and who, when his brain was diseased and strange, could only be soothed by Saracen cards depicting Love and Death and Madness; and, dressed neatly in leather doublet, wearing a jeweled cap with curls like holly leaves, Grifonetto Baglioni, who killed Astorre with his bride and Simonetto with his page, whose beauty was so great that when he lay dead in the golden square of Perugia, even those who hated him could not help but weep, and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him. 1 Cesare Borgia. 2 boys are 10 years old.

On these pages, the terrifying and beautiful images of famous individuals, driven mad and monstrous by evil passions, violence, and weariness, were depicted as if shown in a strange wall tapestry or an enameled decoration: the Duke of Milan, Filippo, who killed his wife and then painted the lips of her corpse with a red poison so that her lover would receive death from the dead; II. Paul, also known as Formosus due to his pride, a Venetian named Pietro Barbi who obtained his crown, valued at two thousand florins, in exchange for a dreadful sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who hunted humans with hounds, and whose corpse, after being killed, was covered with roses by a prostitute who had loved him; Borgia on his white horse, with Brother's Blood beside him, and Peretto's bloodstain on his cloak; the one whose beauty matched his immorality, who decorated his tent made of white and red silk with water nymphs and centaurs to welcome Leonora of Aragon, and in this feast, dipped a boy in gold to serve as a prize or a substitute for Hylas, VI. Sixtus's son and favorite, the young Archbishop of Florence, Cardinal Pietro Riario; Ezzelin, who could only escape his melancholy by watching death scenes, who was as addicted to red blood as others were to red wine, rumored to be the devil's son and to have used loaded dice while gambling with his father for his soul; Giambattista Cibo, mockingly called ""Innocent,"" who had the blood of three young men injected into his numbed veins by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, lover of Isotta and Lord of Rimini, who strangled Polyssena with a handkerchief and poisoned Ginevra d'Esté with a cup of emerald, who, for a shameful passion, founded a church for idol worship, considered an enemy of both man and God in Rome, and whose images were burned; VI. Charles, who was warned by a leper that he was about to go mad due to his insane love for his brother's wife, and when his mind became diseased and deranged, found solace only in Arabian playing cards illustrated with images of love, death, and madness; Grifonetto Baglioni, who killed Astorre and his wife, Simonetto and his servant, and whose beauty, as he lay dying in the yellow square of Perugia, moved even those who hated him to tears, and who was finally blessed by Atalanta, who had cursed him, with his ornate vest and jeweled cap, and his hair in hyacinth curls.",23.692,23.488,"Dorian read that fantastic chapter over and over again, and the two following ones, which presented, as certain unique tapestries or certain strangely crafted enamels do, the thrilling and splendid forms of those whom Vice and Blood and Boredom turned into monsters or madmen: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who murdered his wife and painted her lips with a scarlet poison so that her lover would sip the destruction of the dead creature he caressed; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known by the name of Paul II[10], who, in his vanity, wanted to claim the title of Fermosus, and whose y tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the price of an abominable sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used bloodhounds to hunt men, and whose body, when murdered, was covered with roses by a courtesan who had loved him; the Borgia on his white steed, and the Fratricide riding beside him, with the cloak stained by Perotto's blood; Pietro Riario, the young cardinal archbishop of Florence, son and favorite of Sixtus IV, whose beauty was only matched by his debauchery, who received Eleanor of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and who covered a young boy with gold leaf to play the role, for the occasion, of Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelino, whose melancholy was only cured by the spectacle of death and who had a passion for blood, as other men have for red wine; son of the Evil One, it was said, who had cheated his infernal father when gambling his soul with dice; Giambattista Cibo, who, mockingly, took the name of Innocent, and into whose lethargic veins a Jewish doctor injected the blood of three youths; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of Isotta and lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned in Rome as an enemy of God and men, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, gave Ginevra poison in an emerald cup, and, wishing to honor a shameful passion, built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles VI, so terribly in love with his brother's wife that a leper warned him of the madness that was approaching and who, when his brain became ill and he began to rave, could only be calmed with Saracen cards, illustrated with images of Love, Death, and Madness; and, with his elegant doublet, jeweled cap, and curls like acanthus leaves, Grifonetto Baglioni, who killed Astorre along with his betrothed, and Simonetto with his page, whose charm was such that, while he lay dying in the yellow square of Perugia, those who had hated him were moved to tears, and whom Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed.",46.273,46.161
