He who was a bandit under the cover of night appeared as an honorable merchant of the city in the light of day, and if ever recognized by the genuine merchant to whom he presented himself as a ""captain,"" he would coolly fire a shot that sent him to a better world and then make a swift escape. The mail coach was attacked by seven bandits, of whom three were killed by the guard, who in turn were killed by the remaining four ""due to running out of ammunition"": subsequently, the coach was thoroughly and calmly robbed. The very high and mighty Lord Mayor of London was kidnapped and forced to live for some time in Turnham Green by a daring bandit, who had the honor of robbing such an illustrious figure right under the noses of his numerous escort and equally numerous servants. In the prisons of London, prisoners fought fierce battles with their jailers, whom the majesty of the law rewarded with musket shots. In the very halls of the court, skillful hands relieved the highest lords of the diamond crosses that adorned their necks.
