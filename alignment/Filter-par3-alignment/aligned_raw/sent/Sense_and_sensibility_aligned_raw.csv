G",17.973,15.719,"The continuous care that Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood showed him, which stemmed not so much from self-interest but from good-heartedness, provided him with every comfort that his age could enjoy; the children's cheerfulness also added a special joy to his life.",8.795,6.113,"The constant attention that Mr. Henry Dashwood and his wife paid to his wishes, born not of mere interest but of the goodness of their hearts, made his life comfortable in all that, due to his age, could suit him; and the joy of the children added new delights to his existence.",20.771,18.729

11,"To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that property, could be but small.","Therefore, inheriting the Norland estate was not as crucial for him as it was for his half-sisters; for they only inherited a small portion from their father.",14.093,11.707,"Therefore, the ownership of the Norland estate was not as crucial to him as it was to his sisters; because aside from the share they might receive from their father's inheritance of that estate, the girls would not have much of a dowry.",19.839,17.635,"For him, then, the inheritance of the Norland estate was not truly as important as it was for his sisters; for they, regardless of what might come to them if their father inherited that property, were of a fortune that can only be considered meager.",20.677,18.548

14,"He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;—but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest.","He was neither biased nor ungrateful, withholding the portion of the estate that the grandchild deserved; but he left the grandchild to inherit through provisions that reduced the inheritance value by half.",10.425,7.202,He had not been so unjust or ungrateful as to leave his property to anyone other than his nephew; -but he had left the property to his nephew under such conditions that half of its value was lost.,14.923,11.458,"In his last will, he was neither so unjust nor so ungrateful as to deprive his nephew of the lands, but he left them under such terms that they destroyed half the value of the legacy.",32.014,29.816
15,"mr Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son;—but to his son, and his son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods.","Mr. Henry Daswood had wished for more for his wife and three daughters and less for himself or his son. This son, along with his four-year-old child, inherited in such a way that he no longer had any authority to provide for those dearest to him—those who needed provision the most through portions of the estate or through the sale of valuable timber on his land.",14.092,12.629,"Mr. Dashwood had wanted the inheritance more for his wife and daughters than for himself or his son: -but the inheritance was mortgaged to his son and his son's four-year-old son, moreover, without leaving him the possibility to take care of those closest to him and most in need of income by renting out the land or selling its valuable forests.",17.77,16.751,"Mr. Dashwood had desired these properties more for the well-being of his wife and daughters than for himself and his son; however, the inheritance was assigned to his son, and to his son's son, a four-year-old child, in such a way that it deprived him of any possibility to care for those dearest to him and who most needed support, whether through an eventual mortgage on the properties or the sale of their valuable forests.",30.14,29.211
16,"The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received from his niece and her daughters.","Everything was allocated to that child, who had won the affection of his grandfather through visits to his parents in Norland, affections that were nothing unusual for a two or three-year-old child: innocent speech, a lively temperament wanting to have his own way, many amusing antics and much noise, as if overshadowing all the value of the care and attention that the old man had received for many years from his granddaughter and her three daughters.",12.617,11.307,"Everything was given to the possession of this child who, during his rare visits to Norland with his father and mother, had won his uncle's affection to such an extent that it diminished the value of all the affection he had received for years from his nephew and daughters, with his captivating qualities unusual in two or three-year-old children, his half-spoken words, his desire to do as he pleased, his cunning tricks, and his noise and clamor.",15.921,14.814,"Necessary provisions had been made to ensure that everything would benefit this child, who, during his occasional visits to Norland with his father and mother, had won his uncle's affection with those charming traits that are not uncommon in children of two or three years old: imperfect pronunciation, the unwavering desire to always have his way, countless pranks and tricks, and lots of noise, charms that ultimately ended up outweighing the value of all the attentions that the gentleman had received for years from his niece and her daughters.",28.728,27.97
17,"He meant not to be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a–piece.","However, the old man was not mean-spirited, and to show his affection for the three girls, he left 1000 pounds to each of them.",35.555,33.237,"However, he did not want to be heartless and, as a sign of the affection he felt for the three girls, he left them one thousand pounds each.",38.204,35.91,"It was not his intention, however, to lack kindness, and as a sign of his affection for the three girls, he left a thousand pounds to each of them.",40.789,38.79
18,"mr Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement.","Mr. Daswood was initially deeply disappointed but appeared cheerful and confident: he had reason to hope to live many more years, and if he lived frugally, he could build up a considerable amount from the extensive and profitable land, which almost immediately had the potential to improve the situation.",11.63,8.962,"Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was severe at first; but his temperament was cheerful and optimistic; he could naturally expect to live many more years, and by living frugally, he could set aside a considerable amount from the produce income of an already extensive estate that was almost immediately ready to be operated.",20.305,17.801,"At first, Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was profound; but he was of a cheerful and trusting temperament; he could reasonably expect to live many years and, by living frugally, save a considerable sum from the income of an already sizable estate, and one capable of almost immediate increase.",26.072,24.045
19,"But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his only one twelvemonth.","But because it was created too late, the estate lasted only 12 months.",9.008,3.367,"But the fortune, which was quite delayed in arriving, became his income for only one year.",29.739,24.942,"But the fortune, which had taken so long to arrive, was his for only a year.",38.003,34.115

Colonel Brandon's polite, measured questions never disturbed Miss Dashwood. He had more than earned the privilege of being a confidant about her sister's sorrow with his friendly efforts to alleviate the grief; they always conversed in confidence. The main reward he received for the painful burden of explaining past troubles and present shames was Marianne's pitying glances as she occasionally watched him and (though not often) her affectionate voice when she had to speak to him or forced herself to do so. These convinced Colonel Brandon that his efforts had increased her goodwill towards him; they gave Elinor hope that this goodwill would grow even more after her; but unaware of all this, Mrs. Jennings, who thought the Colonel continued with his usual seriousness and could not be persuaded to propose or appoint himself to propose, started saying two days later that they would marry in November instead of mid-summer, and a week later that they would not marry at all. The harmony between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed to declare that all the honor of the mulberry tree, the canal, and the yew grove would be transferred to her; Mrs. Jennings had completely removed Mr. Ferrars from her agenda for some time. In early February, fifteen days after receiving Willoughby's letter, Elinor informed her sister of his marriage, fulfilling a painful duty. She had made an effort to ensure that Marianne heard the news from her immediately after the ceremony, rather than discovering it in the newspapers she eagerly examined every morning. Marianne received the news with a determined maturity; she said nothing about it and did not cry at first; but shortly after, tears flowed and she spent the whole day in a state no less agonizing than when she first heard she should expect the event. As soon as the Willoughbys got married, they left the city; Elinor, now that there was no danger of encountering either of them, began to think that she could gradually persuade her sister, who had not left the house since the first blow had struck, to go out again as she used to. At that time, the two Miss Steele cousins came to their home in the Bartlett Buildings in Holborn, reintroduced themselves to their more fashionable relatives in Conduit and Berkeley streets, and were received with great kindness by them. Only Elinor was upset to see them. Their presence always caused her pain, and she struggled to respond maturely to Lucy's devastating joy at still finding her in the city. ""I would have been very upset if I hadn't found you here,"" he kept saying, placing a strong emphasis on that word. ""But I always knew I would find you. I was almost certain you wouldn't leave London for a while, although you told me in Barton that you wouldn't stay for more than a month. But at that time, I thought you would probably change your mind when the time came. It would have been a terrible shame if you had left before your brother and sister-in-law arrived. I'm sure you're not in a hurry to leave now either. I'm extremely glad you didn't keep your word."" Elinor understood him very well and had to use all her willpower to appear as if she did not. ""Oh, my dear,"" said Mrs. Jennings, ""how was your journey."""" ""It's not like a private car, of course,"" replied Miss Steele, with quick cheerfulness; ""we came all the way by stagecoach, and a very sweet young man accompanied us. Dr. Davies was coming to the city, so we boarded the stagecoach with him; he was very kind and paid ten or twelve shillings more than us."" ""Oh my!"" cried Mrs. Jennings; ""how delightful indeed! By the way, the doctor is single, just so you know."" ""Here you go,"" said Miss Steele, pretending to be offended, ""everyone laughs at me like this about the doctor, why, I don't understand. My cousins say I've stolen his heart, but I can honestly say I can't think about him for two minutes straight. 'My God, your young man is coming, Nancy,' said my cousin the other day, having seen him coming towards the house from afar. 'My young man, indeed!' I said - 'I have no idea who she meant. The doctor is nothing to me.'"" ""Come on, come on, it's always said like that at first - but it doesn't work - I think the doctor is fine, I mean."" ""Seriously, no!"" replied his cousin, pretending to be sincere, ""and I beg you to object if you hear it being talked about."" Mrs. Jennings immediately assured her that she would not object, and Miss Steele was very happy. ""When they come to the city, you will surely go and stay with your brother and sister-in-law, Miss Dashwood,"" said Lucy, resuming her attack after a pause filled with hostile insinuations. ""No, I don't think we will stay."" ""Oh yes, I think you will stay."" Elinor did not want to please him by objecting further. ""How nice of Mrs. Dashwood to allow both of you to stay for such a long time!"""" ""A long time, is it!"" Mrs. Jennings interrupted. ""Their outings have just begun!"" Lucy was thus silenced. ""We were sorry not to see your sister, Miss Dashwood,"" said Miss Steele. ""I was sorry she wasn't well."" Marianne had left the room when they arrived. ""You are very kind. My sister will be equally disappointed to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has been suffering from nervous headaches lately and cannot handle crowds or conversation."" ""Ah my beautiful, what a pity! But Lucy and I are old friends! - I think she can see us; we won't say a word, I mean."" Elinor politely declined the offer. Her sister might be lying down or in her dressing gown, so she couldn't join them. ""Hey, if this is the issue,"" shouted Miss Steele, ""let's go out and see it."" Elinor began to find such insensitivity unbearable; but Lucy's stern warning spared her the trouble of reprimanding her. Although Lucy's reaction, as was often the case, did not add grace to a sister's behavior, it was useful in correcting the behavior of the other sister. Although she protested a little, Marianne yielded to her sister's insistence and agreed to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings for half an hour one morning. However, she set the condition that she would not go on any house visits and would do no more than accompany them to Gray's shop on Sackville Street, where Elinor was negotiating to exchange some of their mother's old-fashioned jewelry. When they were standing at the door, Mrs. Jennings remembered that there was a lady she needed to visit at the other end of the street; since she had no business at Gray's, it was decided that she would make her visit while the young girls took care of their errands, and then she would join them afterwards. When they climbed the stairs and entered, the Miss Dashwoods found the place so crowded that there was no one available to attend to their orders; they had to wait. The only thing to do was to sit at the end of the counter that seemed to be moving the fastest; there was only one gentleman standing there; Elinor hoped to awaken his courtesy for a quicker shopping experience. But the gentleman's sharp eye and refined taste outweighed his courtesy. He was ordering a toothpick box for himself and, after examining and discussing all the toothpick boxes in the shop for a quarter of an hour, and until the size, shape, and decorations of the box were finally determined by his own creative imagination, he cast several very sharp glances at the two ladies. he had no time to show any interest other than wheat; although adorned with the latest fashion clothes, his gaze seemed to imprint a strong, natural, unadulterated triviality of character and face into Elinor's memory. Marianne did not have to feel annoying emotions such as contempt and anger in the face of their brazen scrutiny of her appearance and the arrogance with which they pointed out the various flaws of the various toothpick boxes presented for her inspection, because her mind was not there; she was able to shut herself off into her thoughts and ignore what was happening around her in Mr. Gray's shop just as she did in her own bedroom. Finally, the matter was decided. Ivory, gold, and pearl, all were chosen; the gentleman, who also indicated the last day he could continue without his toothpick box, put on his gloves with unhurried care, bestowed another look at the Miss Dashwoods that seemed more like a demand than admiration, and departed with an air of happy genuine affectation and false indifference. Elinor wasted no time in discussing her work and was just finishing up when another gentleman appeared beside her. Elinor turned her eyes towards his face and, somewhat surprised, saw that it was her brother. The excitement and joy they felt from the encounter were just enough to create an acceptable scene in Mr. Gray's shop. John Dashwood did not seem at all upset to see his sisters again; his sisters, on the other hand, were reasonably pleased with the encounter; his questions about their mother's health were respectful and considerate. Elinor learned that she and Fanny had been in the city for two days. ""I really wanted to stop by yesterday,"" he said, ""but it was impossible, because we had to take Harry to Exeter Exchange to see the wild animals: and the rest of the day Mrs We spent it at Ferrars'. Harry was very pleased. This morning, as soon as I had a free hour, I was definitely going to call you, but when one first arrives in the city, there are so many things to do. I came here to get a seal made for Fanny. But tomorrow, I will surely be able to stop by Berkeley Street and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings. As far as I understand, she is quite a wealthy woman. There are also the Middletons, you must introduce me to them as well. As the relatives of my stepmother, it will make me happy to pay my respects to them. From what I understand, they are excellent neighbors to you in the village."" ""Truly delicious. Their attention to our comfort, their friendship in every detail, is more than I can express."" ""I am very glad to hear that, believe me; I am truly very glad. But it should be so; because very wealthy people, you can naturally expect every kindness and comfort from them that can make your situation more pleasant. So, you have settled comfortably into your little cottage and you lack nothing! Edward gave us a very nice description of that place; he said it was the most complete example of its kind ever; and it seems you love it very much. Hearing this made us very happy, rest assured."" Elinor felt a little embarrassed by her brother; she was not at all sorry to be relieved from the necessity of replying to him when Mrs. Jennings's servant came to say that his mistress was waiting for them at the door. Mr. Dashwood accompanied them downstairs, was introduced to Mrs. Jennings at the door of his carriage, and, repeating his hope of calling on them the next day, took his leave. The visit happened as mentioned. Since their aunts couldn't come, they sent their apologies; ""but she was so busy with her mother that she really had no time to go anywhere."" However, Mrs. Jennings immediately told her that she was not at all fond of such ceremonies, that they were all cousins or something of that sort, the first cunning dog! Moreover, during their last meeting, she had offered her one of Folly's puppies! Now everything was over!"" Mrs. Palmer was equally angry in her own way. ""She was determined to end the acquaintance immediately, and was even very lucky never to have met him. With all her heart, she wished that Combe Magna was not so close to Cleveland; but it didn't matter because it was already too far to visit; she hated him so much that she was determined never to mention his name again, and she would tell everyone she saw the same, calling him such a worthless man."" Mrs. Palmer's remaining compassion manifested itself in gathering details about the approaching wedding with all her might and relaying them to Elinor. Soon, she was able to tell which coachman was making the new carriage, which painter was working on Mr. Willoughby's portrait, and in which shop Miss Grey's dresses could be seen. Lady Middleton's calm and polite indifference to the matter was a relief to Elinor, as she often felt overwhelmed by the noisy politeness of the others. It was a great comfort to be sure that at least one person in her circle of friends was not excited; knowing that there was someone she could face without them being curious about the details or worried about her sister's health was a great comfort. Every quality is occasionally elevated beyond its true value by momentary circumstances; sometimes, overwhelmed by officious condolences, Elinor too was forced to think that courtesy was more essential for peace than cordiality. Lady Middleton expressed her opinion on the matter once a day, or if the topic came up frequently, twice a day by saying, ""Truly shocking!"" and through these gentle but unchanging words, she not only managed to look at the Miss Dashwoods with an indifferent eye at first, but immediately after, succeeded in looking without remembering a single word of the matter; thus, having supported the pride of her own gender and condemned the faults of the other gender in a definitive manner, she felt free to engage with her acquaintances' matters, and even (despite Sir John's decision) decided to leave her card with Mrs. Willoughby as soon as she got married, since she would be a graceful and wealthy woman.",1.199,1.142,"Lady Middleton expressed her opinion on the matter once or twice a day, if the topic came up frequently, saying: ""What a terrible thing, indeed!"" and through this continuous yet gentle release, she was not only able to visit the Miss Dashwoods from the beginning without the slightest emotion, but very soon without even remembering a word of the whole matter; and having thus defended the dignity of her own sex and decidedly censured what was wrong in the other, she felt free to protect the interests of her group, so she decided (although somewhat against Sir John's opinion) that, as Mrs. Willoughby would be an elegant and wealthy woman at the same time, she would leave her card as soon as she was married.",26.863,26.314
