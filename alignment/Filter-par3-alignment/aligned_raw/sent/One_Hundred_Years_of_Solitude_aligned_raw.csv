daughter's hands were not made for mundane tasks but for playing the harpsichord, yet the foolish husband dragged her out with those instructions but exiled her to a hellish place where it was unbearably hot, and before she finished her purification rites, he packed his suitcase and the harpsichord and went to live with a wretched woman, who people said just by looking at her buttocks, yes, just by watching her sway her young mare's hips, one could tell she was a completely different kind of woman - a lady, - whether in a mansion or a stable, at the table or in bed, always a national lady, who revered God and was His slave and obeyed Him, and who could not be compared, of course, to tightrope dancers and wandering women who offered themselves to others, of course, who offered themselves to all men, like French-style prostitutes, or even worse, imagine that, because even French-style prostitutes had the decency to light a red lamp at the door to welcome guests, at least that, those women lacked no vice, imagine that, and they could not be compared to her, the only and cherished daughter of Doña RenataArgote and Don Fernando del Carpio, first of all because he was a saint, a sheep among great sheep, a gentleman awarded the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, belonging to the class of people who received the divine privilege from God that their bodies would remain intact in the grave with smooth skin like a young girl in love and eyes bright and green as emeralds.",16.388,16.246,"No one even asked out of courtesy why she was so pale and wan, or why there were dark circles around her eyes when she got up in the morning. What more could be expected from this family who always saw her as a nuisance, a fool, and whispered behind her back? They mocked her, called her a church mouse, a prude, a know-it-all, a fraud. God forgive her sins, even Amaranta had said she was someone who stirred up her own mess, God forbid, she had uttered those words. Fernanda, because she had the fear of God in her heart, endured all this, but when that scoundrel Jose Arcadio Segundo said that the family had been doomed ever since this constipated woman, this conceited highlander, set foot in their house, she couldn't take it anymore. God help us, what kind of words were these, she had said that she was a girl born from the seed of the highlanders sent by the government to kill workers, and she had said these words to her, to herself, who was the godchild of the Duke of Alba. She was the daughter of such a noble family that the wives of the presidents were terrified when they heard of her lineage. They were going to insult a lady like her, a lady who carried noble blood in her veins, who had the right to line up eleven names in a row when signing her name, and who was the only one in this town full of ruffians who didn't lose her composure when she saw sixteen pieces of silver cutlery together! Her husband, that filthy womanizer, would make fun of her, saying that so many forks and knives would be of no use to people, and that at most, centipedes would use them, and he would have a good laugh! There was no one else who knew, with eyes closed, when and from which side and with which glass white wine should be served, and when and from which side and with which glass red wine should be served. That peasant who thought white wine should be drunk during the day and red wine at night -may God forgive his sins- was he like Amaranta? Who else in the whole coastal region had pissed in a golden chamber pot? Yet, -may God forgive his sins- Colonel Aureliano Buendia, with his Masonic head, had confronted him, mocking him by asking where he got that right, or if he shat basil instead of shit -yes, with those exact words. Upon this, Renata, his own daughter, who had secretly seen the chamber pot in his room, said that even if the pot was solid gold and had a crest on it, what was inside was the same old shit, and the worst kind because it was the shit of constipated highlanders. Think about it, if a man's own daughter spoke like that, what could be expected from the other members of the family? But no matter what, it was her right to expect her husband to be a bit more considerate, a bit more respectful. After all, by God's command, he was her husband, her spouse, the man who legally claimed her property. He had come to her father's house to take her, so he should have willingly taken on this responsibility. In her father's house, she lacked nothing; she had everything she could eat in front of her, and what she didn't eat was behind her. She never had to lift a finger; her godfather had only sent a letter in a sealed envelope with his signet ring pressed into the wax, asking that his dear goddaughter's delicate hands not be injured by any work other than playing the piano. To kill time, she would weave funeral wreaths. However, that lunatic who was to be her husband had brought her from her home by making countless promises and assurances, bringing her to this hellish place where one could hardly breathe from the heat. Before she could even complete her fast, her husband had packed his trunk, taken his accordion, and gone to the arms of a despicable woman. According to what people said, to understand what kind of woman she was, it was enough to look at her from behind and see how she swayed her hips like a wild mare. That woman was a... she was something else entirely, the complete opposite of herself. Whether in a palace or a pigsty, she never lost her ladylike demeanor, remaining a lady both at the table and in bed. She was well-bred, knew what the fear of God was, and submitted to God's laws—everything that she herself was not. Of course, her husband couldn't perform the acrobatics and reckless antics he did with the other woman with her. The other woman, like French courtesans, was ready for anything. She was even worse than them. At least they had the decency to hang a red lantern on their doors. This was the behavior that Dona Renata Argote and Don Fernando del Carpio deemed worthy of their one and only beloved daughter. Yet her father was such a respectable man. He was a devout Christian, a knight who had received the holy tomb insignia. Those who received this insignia, by the grace of God, would lie in their graves uncorrupted, their cheeks as fresh as a bride's, and their eyes as clear as emeralds.",15.518,15.378,"Aureliano Segundo didn't become aware of the nagging until the next day, after breakfast, when he felt overwhelmed by a buzzing that was then more fluid and louder than the sound of the rain, and it was Fernanda, pacing around the house, lamenting that she had been educated like a queen only to end up as a servant in a house of lunatics, with a lazy, idolatrous, libertine husband who lay on his back waiting for bread to rain from the sky, while she broke her back trying to keep afloat a home propped up with pins, where there was so much to do, so much to endure and correct from dawn until bedtime, that she reached the bed with her eyes full of glass dust, and yet no one had ever said good morning, Fernanda, how did you sleep, Fernanda, nor had they asked her, even out of courtesy, why she was so pale or why she woke up with those violet circles under her eyes, even though she didn't expect, of course, that such words would come from the rest of a family that had always seen her as a nuisance, like the rag used to lower the pot, like a painted puppet on the wall, and who always gossiped about her in the corners, calling her sanctimonious, calling her a Pharisee, calling her a lizard, and even Amaranta, rest in peace, had said out loud that she was one of those who confused the rectum with the temples, blessed be God, what words, and she had endured everything with resignation for the Holy Father's intentions, but she couldn't take it anymore when the wicked José Arcadio Segundo said that the family's downfall had been opening the doors to a cachaca, imagine, a bossy cachaca, good heavens, a cachaca daughter of bad saliva, of the same ilk as the cachacos the government sent to kill workers, can you believe it, and he was referring to none other than her, the goddaughter of the Duke of Alba, a lady of such lineage that she made the wives of presidents' stomachs churn, a noblewoman of such blood that she had the right to sign with eleven peninsular surnames, and who was the only mortal in that town of bastards who didn't feel flustered in front of sixteen place settings, only for her adulterous husband to laugh and say that so many spoons and forks, and so many knives and little spoons were not a Christian thing, but a centipede's, and the only one who could determine with her eyes closed when to serve white wine, and from which side and in which glass, and when to serve red wine, and from which side and in which glass, unlike the rustic Amaranta, rest in peace, who thought white wine was served during the day and red wine at night, and the only one on the entire coast who could boast of never having relieved herself except in golden chamber pots, only for Colonel Aureliano Buendía, rest in peace, to have the audacity to ask with his bad Masonic bile where she had earned that privilege, if it was that she didn't shit crap, but astromelias, imagine, with those words, and for Renata, her own daughter, who had indiscreetly seen her major waters in the bedroom, to reply that indeed the chamber pot was very golden and very heraldic, but what it contained was pure crap, physical crap, and worse than others because it was cachaca crap, imagine, her own daughter, so she had never had illusions about the rest of the family, but she still had the right to expect a bit more consideration from her husband, since for better or worse he was her sacramental spouse, her author, her legitimate wrongdoer, who had taken upon himself by his own free and sovereign will the grave responsibility of taking her from her paternal home, where she never lacked or suffered for anything, where she wove funeral palms for entertainment, since her godfather had sent a letter with his signature and the seal of his ring imprinted in wax, just to say that his goddaughter's hands were not made for worldly tasks, except to play the clavichord, and yet her foolish husband had taken her from her home with all the warnings and admonitions and had brought her to that hellish cauldron where one couldn't breathe from the heat, and before she finished putting away her Pentecost diets, he had already left with his wandering trunks and his rogue accordion to indulge in adultery with an unfortunate woman whose buttocks alone, well, it was said, whose swaying buttocks alone were enough to guess that she was one, that she was one, the complete opposite of her, who was a lady in the palace or the pigsty, at the table or in bed, a lady by birth, God-fearing, obedient to His laws and submissive to His designs, and with whom, of course, he couldn't do the acrobatics and vagrancies he did with the other, who of course was up for anything, like French madams, and worse still, thinking about it, because at least they had the honesty to put a red light at the door, such filth, imagine, no more was needed, with the only and beloved daughter of Doña Renata Argote and Don Fernando del Carpio, and especially of him, of course, a holy man, a great Christian, Knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, one of those who receive directly from God the privilege of remaining intact in the tomb, with skin as smooth as bridal satin and eyes as alive

Since ancient times, one thousand six hundred and three types of cockroaches had withstood humanity's relentless and merciless pursuit, a pursuit as persistent as humanity's own self-destructive tendencies. Along with the instinct to procreate, humans also had an instinct to kill cockroaches. If cockroaches had survived humanity's wrath, it was because they hid in the dark, where they were safe, as humans have an innate fear of darkness. Conversely, cockroaches feared the midday sun, so the only effective method to exterminate them in medieval times, now, and forever, was sunlight.",9.799,9.19,"The old bookseller, knowing Aureliano's interest in old books, mischievously drew him into the discussion with a fatherly cunning. Aureliano immediately began to recount what he knew on the subject. He explained that the cockroach is the oldest species of winged insect on earth, that even in the Old Testament there is mention of these insects being crushed by sandals, but that these creatures are very resilient and that all the killing methods tried, from tomatoes mixed with borax to sugary flour, have failed, that there are exactly one thousand six hundred and three different species of these animals that have resisted the oldest and most relentless war humans have waged against all kinds of living creatures since the world began, that if the primary fundamental instinct of humans is the urge to reproduce, the second should be considered the urge to kill cockroaches, that cockroaches save themselves by hiding in dark places, taking advantage of the human natural fear of darkness, but in doing so, they have also become unable to withstand the midday sun, and that since the Middle Ages, the most effective way to kill cockroaches, per omnia secula seculorum, has been sunlight, he rattled off in one breath.",13.963,13.42,"The old bookseller, knowing Aureliano's fondness for books that only Bede the Venerable had read, urged him with a certain paternal malice to join the controversy, and he didn't even take a breath to explain that cockroaches, the oldest winged insect on earth, had already been the favorite victim of sandal strikes in the Old Testament, but as a species, they were definitively refractory to any method of extermination, from tomato slices with borax to flour with sugar, as their one thousand six hundred and three varieties had resisted the most remote, tenacious, and ruthless persecution that man had unleashed since his origins against any living being, including man himself, to the extent that just as the human race was attributed an instinct for reproduction, it should be attributed another more defined and pressing one, which was the instinct to kill cockroaches, and that if they had managed to escape human ferocity, it was because they had taken refuge in the darkness, where they became invulnerable due to man's congenital fear of the dark, but in turn became susceptible to the splendor of midday, so that already in the Middle Ages, currently, and for centuries to come, the only effective method to kill cockroaches was solar dazzling.",37.047,36.77

While they sang and laughed heartily at their own games, Aureliano became more pensive, for his passion was inherently quiet and cold. However, both reached the heights of the art of play, to the point that when they were exhausted from their indulgences, they found even more delightful mischief during their rest. They dedicated their energy to idolizing their own bodies, discovering that the moments of rest after pleasure had untapped potentials, which were far more enjoyable than the possibilities of carnal desires. While he applied egg whites to Amaranta Ursula's firm breasts to massage them, or coconut oil to her toned thighs and soft belly to caress her, she treated Aureliano's strong body like a doll to play with, using lipstick to draw clown eyes on him, eyebrow pencil to give him a Turkish mustache, adorning him with an organza tie, and crowning him with a hat made of silver paper. One night, they smeared peach jam all over each other from head to toe and licked it off like dogs. Then, like a pair of madmen, they made love in the hallway and were awakened by flesh-eating ants about to devour them. During the pauses in their orgies, Amaranta Ursula wrote replies to Gaston. She felt he was too busy and distant, to the point that his return seemed impossible to her. In one of the earlier letters he sent, he mentioned that his friends had indeed sent the airplane, but a shipping company in Brussels mistakenly sent it to Tanganyika, and at that port, it would be forwarded to the community of Macondo. This mistake caused so much trouble that just retrieving the airplane would take two years. Thus, Amaranta Ursula did not have to worry about her husband's sudden return. As for Aureliano, he had no other connection to the outside world except for the letters from the wise old Catalonian and news about Gabriel through Mercedes, the quiet pharmacist. Those were his real connections. To stay in Paris, Gabriel had returned his round-trip ticket for spending money and then lived by selling old newspapers and bottles that the maids pulled out from the dreary Dolphin Hotel. At that time, Aureliano could imagine him always wearing a thick turtleneck sweater, which he only took off when the Montparnasse terraces were filled with springtime lovers, and in a room reeking of boiling cauliflower, where Rocamato had starved to death, he had to sleep during the day and write at night to stave off hunger. However, the news about Gabriel became increasingly vague, and the letters from the wise old man grew more sparse and dull, to the point that Aureliano began to think of them as Amaranta Ursula thought of her husband, and thus they both floated in an empty world where love was the only reality, both mundane and eternal.",2.845,2.646,"However, as the news from Gabriel became increasingly vague and the letters from the wise Catalonian began to take on a melancholic and disorganized tone, Aureliano started to see them as distant memories, much like how Amaranta Ursula thought of her husband.
