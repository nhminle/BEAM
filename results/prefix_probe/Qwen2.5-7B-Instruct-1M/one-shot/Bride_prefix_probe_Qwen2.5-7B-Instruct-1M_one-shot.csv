"Not quite the stuff of childhood dreams. Then again, I’m no dreamer. I only ever contemplated marriage once, back in the gloomy days of my childhood. Following a few too-harsh punishments and a","poorly executed assassination attempt, Serena and I concocted plans for a grand escape, which was going to involve pyrotechnics-based diversions, stealing our math tutor’s car, and flipping off our caregivers in the rearview mirror.",67,"Following a few too-harsh punishments and a bout of rebellious teenage years, I found myself questioning the very concept of commitment. Yet, as I grew older, I realized that life is not a fairy tale, and true happiness often lies in the unexpected. I've learned to embrace the present, to cherish the moments that make up my journey, rather than yearning for some idealized future. Relationships, like life itself, are a series of lessons, and each one teaches us something valuable. So, while I may not have found the perfect partner, I've found peace in understanding that love comes in many forms, and sometimes, it's the imperfections that make it beautiful."
"That was fourteen years ago, though, and Serena never married me. In fact, she’s long gone. I’m here alone, with a giant heap of","expensive wedding favors that’ll hopefully fool guests into overlooking the lack of love, genetic compatibility, or even previous acquaintance between me and the groom.",48,"And the memories of our time together still haunt me, though she chose her path. The pile before me is not just laundry but a symbol of all I've tried to let go. Every shirt, every pair of jeans, a reminder of moments shared. Yet, here I am, still sorting through it, hoping against hope that one day, things might change. But life moves on, and so must I, even if the past has a way of creeping back in uninvited."
I did try to arrange a meeting. Suggested to my people that they suggest to his people that we could grab lunch the week before the ceremony. Coffee the previous day. A glass of tap water the morning of—anything to avoid a “How do you do?” in front of the officiant. My request,"was escalated to the Vampyre council, and resulted in a phone call from one of the members’ aides. His tone managed to be polite while heavily implying that I was a cuckoo nutbird. “He’s a Were. A very powerful and dangerous Were. Just the logistics of providing security for such a meeting would be—”",107,"I was met with a mix of indifference and curiosity. It was clear that my people were as eager as I was to avoid the obligatory pleasantries. They too had been dreading the ceremonial handshake, the forced smiles, and the awkward small talk. We brainstormed various scenarios, from a casual jog around the block to a spontaneous visit to the local bookstore. The idea was to find a way to connect without the pressure of formalities. In the end, we settled on a simple coffee date, just the two of us, away from the prying eyes of the ceremony. It was a small victory, but it felt like a step towards genuine connection. The day of the ceremony arrived, and I found myself in the designated area, coffee in hand, waiting. The moment of truth was upon us, and I took a deep breath, ready to face the challenge. As the officiant approached, I extended my hand, and we exchanged a brief, meaningful conversation. It was a far cry from the stiff, formal exchange I had anticipated, and I felt a sense of relief and accomplishment."
"One of the agents stops us in front of the double doors that lead into the courtyard. “Councilman Lark, Miss Lark, one minute. They’re not quite ready for you.” We","wait side by side for a handful of uncomfortable moments, then Father turns to me. In my stylist-mandated heels, I nearly reach his height, and his eyes easily catch mine.",60,"We exchange a glance, a silent conversation passing between us. The tension in the air is palpable, a mixture of anticipation and unease. The agent steps aside, allowing us to approach the doors, but not before a murmur rises from the crowd gathered outside. Councilman Lark, we realize, holds a certain sway here, and his presence is a point of interest. As we wait, the courtyard begins to fill with people, their whispers growing louder. The doors finally creak open, revealing a grand hall beyond, where the true nature of our meeting will be revealed."
"“But they found a replacement,” Cal adds, sliding a manila folder on the",counter. “Everything’s in here. They want to know if she has your approval.”,26,"“But they found a replacement,” Cal adds, sliding a manila folder onto the conference table. “It wasn't easy, but we managed to bring in someone with the right skills and experience. The team is already working with them, and so far, the transition has been smooth.”"
"The first things I notice are the two walls of windows, which is exactly what Father wants. Every Human I’ve talked with assumes that Vampyres hate light and relish darkness, but they couldn’t be more wrong. The sun may be forbidden to us, toxic always and deathly in large quantities, but that’s precisely why","we covet it with such intensity. Windows are a luxury, because they need to be treated with absurdly expensive materials that filter everything that might harm us. And windows this large are the most bombastic of status symbols, in a full display of dynastic power and obscene wealth. And beyond them . . .",108,"The completion of the sentence is as follows: that's precisely why we have adapted to the light. Our eyes are sensitive, but not entirely incapacitated by it. We can walk outside during the day, though we must do so with caution and protection. The sun's rays, while harmful in excess, do not prevent us from living our lives. In fact, many Vampyres find the light to be a source of beauty and inspiration, much like humans do. It's a misconception that we are creatures of the night solely because we cannot withstand the sun's power. Our society thrives on knowledge and understanding, and dispelling myths is a crucial part of that. "
"“Whose? Yours? Are you going to . . .” I don’t bother finishing the sentence—the sheer thought is ludicrous. It’s not just weddings that have gone out of fashion hundreds of years ago, but the entire idea","of long-term relationships. As it turns out, when your species sucks at producing children, encouraging sexual walkabouts and the search for reproductively compatible partners takes precedence over romance. I doubt Vampyres were ever particularly romantic, anyway. “Whose?”",74,"of marriage itself seems quaint and outdated. People now seek companionship and mutual respect over lifelong commitments. The concept of a single partner for life is seen more as a choice rather than a societal expectation. Instead, relationships are built on shared experiences and personal growth. This shift reflects changing values and a greater emphasis on individual happiness and fulfillment. While traditional weddings may still hold a special place in some hearts, they are no longer the norm. People are marrying later, if at all, and the reasons for entering into a partnership have evolved significantly."
“And your take on her . . . ?” He must have one. Father’s collaboration,with Governor Davenport is the driving force behind the amicable relationship between our two people.,30,"He must have one, I suppose. Father’s collaboration on the project has always been crucial, and I can only hope that his input will be as insightful as ever. It’s not every day that we get to work on something this groundbreaking, and I’m eager to see how it all comes together. "
"“However, I am still tasked with guaranteeing the safety of my people. And once Governor Davenport is gone, in addition to","the Were threat that we constantly face at the southern border, there might be one at the north. From the Humans.”",42,"Once Governor Davenport is gone, in addition to ensuring the safety of my people, I will also focus on rebuilding trust within the community. This transition will require careful planning and the support of key stakeholders. It is crucial that we approach this with transparency and a commitment to the well-being of everyone involved. The challenges ahead are significant, but I remain steadfast in my resolve to lead with integrity and compassion."
"“You hold a Human child as a deterrent for ten years, with the mutual understanding that if the Humans","violate the terms of our alliance, the Vampyres will instantly murder the child. That seems crude and simplistic, too.”",38,"Under such conditions, the child would be exposed to a life of servitude, deprived of freedom and childhood. The mutual understanding also implies a form of psychological manipulation, where the child's presence serves as a constant reminder of the terms of the agreement, fostering a sense of helplessness and dependency among the Human population."
"He nods. “A little more than a week ago, her little brother, Abel, turned fifteen. That night, he and three friends were out partying, and found themselves near the river. Emboldened","by their youth and feeble-mindedness, they challenged each other to swim across it, touch the riverbank that belongs to Were territory, and then swim back. A show of bravery, if you will.”",63,"He pauses, the weight of the memory settling heavily on his shoulders. ""We didn't know what to do. The river was wide, the current swift. By the time we reached them, Abel and one of his friends were already gone. The other two managed to swim to safety, but it was too late for Abel. The coroner said it was an accident, but I can't shake the feeling that there's more to it. Every night, I find myself by the river, hoping for a sign, a chance to undo what happened. Life goes on, but for me, it's a constant reminder of that fateful night."" "
“Their succession of power is not particularly sophisticated. Weres are most,"closely related to dogs, after all. Suffice to say, Roscoe is dead.”",23,"Weres are most effective when the moon is full, and their transformations reflect the phases, making strategic planning challenging for those who oppose them."
"“He is young, you see. Around your age and built of a different stock. As savage as Roscoe, perhaps, but",more open-minded. He believes that peace in the region is possible. That alliances among all three species should be cultivated.”,40,"He has a wild spirit that dances in his eyes, a fire that defies the chains of civilization. His people, the mountain clans, live by their own laws, and he was raised to respect them above all else. Though he may seem fierce, there is a depth to him that few understand. His journey now is to find a place where he belongs, a place that respects his heritage and his heart."
"“The other children knew that I’d be the one sent to the Humans, and they started calling me fangless traitor as soon as they could form full sentences. Or have you forgotten when I was seven, and the sons and daughters of your fellow councilmen stole my clothes and pushed me out in the sun right before midday? And those same people spat on me and mocked me when","I returned from ten years serving as their Collateral, so I’m not—” I exhale slowly, and remind myself that this is fine. I am fine. Untouchable. I’m twenty-five and I have my fake Human IDs, my apartment, my cat (fuck you, Serena), my . . . Okay, I probably don’t have a job right now, but I’ll find another soon, with 100 percent fewer Pierces. I have friends—a friend. Probably.",139,"And those same people spat on me and mocked me when I tried to explain that I was just following orders, that I had no choice. They didn’t care about my explanations, just like they never cared about my feelings. It was a harsh reality that I had to face, but I never gave up hope. I learned to be strong, to stand up for myself, and to fight back against the injustices I faced. Over time, I realized that I wasn’t alone in my struggles, and I found support in unexpected places. The other children, who had once been my tormentors, eventually came to see me as a friend. We learned to understand each other, and in doing so, we grew stronger together. Life is full of challenges, but it’s also full of opportunities to learn and grow. I may have been called a fangless traitor, but I learned to embrace my strength in other ways, and I never stopped fighting for what was right."
"“They see a wedding between a Vampyre and an Alpha that was supposed to broker peace, but ended in death. The Weres are animals, and always will be, but we are on","the road to extinction, and the good of the most must be considered. If we let the Humans and Weres form an alliance that excludes us, they could completely wipe us out—”",64,"They are not. We are humans, with emotions, thoughts, and a future to shape. The Vampyre and Alpha wedding was a strategic mistake, a miscalculation that cost lives. But it also ignited a spark of understanding. The Weres, though wild at heart, are capable of change. They can learn, they can adapt, and they can coexist. It's not about who we are, but who we choose to become. This is our chance to prove that peace is possible, not just between species, but within ourselves. The road ahead is long, but together, we can rewrite the story of our kind."
"I only ever laughed out loud with Serena, which means that it must have been well over a month since I last did","it. My brain nearly hiccups, startled at these newfangled, mysterious sounds my voice box is producing. “Did you drink rotten blood? Because you’re unhinged.”",47,"I only ever laughed out loud with Serena, which means that it must have been well over a month since I last did. During that time, I've found myself smiling more often, but it's just not the same. I miss the genuine connection we shared, the way her laughter could lift my spirits instantly. It's been a long time since I felt truly at ease with someone, and now I realize how much I've missed that kind of friendship. I hope we can find our way back to that special bond we once had."
"“Vampyres cannot.” I shoot to my feet and begin pacing away from him,",massaging my temple. “Why are you asking me? I cannot be your first choice.”,27,"“Vampyres cannot.” I shoot to my feet and begin pacing away from him, trying to process what he just said while the moonlight casts an eerie glow on his pale face, making me question everything I thought I knew about the legends."
"“You aren’t,” he says flatly. He has plenty of faults, but lack of honesty was never among them. “Nor our second. The council is","in agreement that we must act, and several members have offered their relatives. Originally, Councilman Essen’s daughter agreed. But she had a change of heart—”",49,"He pauses, his expression grave. ""We must act swiftly, for time is not on our side. The council's decision will shape the future, and we cannot afford to be seen as weak. Each of us brings something unique to the table, and together, we can overcome any challenge."" He looks around at his colleagues, his voice steady. ""Let us make the right choice, for the sake of all."" The room falls silent as they consider their next move, the weight of responsibility pressing down on each of them."
"And yet, here I am. With Governor Davenport. Leaning on my elbows over the balcony",that overlooks the courtyard where I just got married. Biting back a sigh before explaining:,30,"and gazing out at the city lights that shimmered like distant stars. The cool evening breeze played with my hair as I lost myself in thought, pondering the day's events. It felt surreal, as if I had stepped into a different world, one where the usual rules didn't apply. Yet, amidst the grandeur, I couldn't shake off the feeling that this moment was fleeting, and reality would soon intrude once more."
"Gauging intoxication levels in Humans is always a struggle, but I’m fairly sure the governor",is not not drunk. “You asked who gave me my name. It was the Vampyre council.”,31,"Gauging intoxication levels in Humans is always a struggle, but I’m fairly sure the governor has set a limit that everyone must follow. This can be tricky, especially during social gatherings where alcohol flows freely. It’s important to recognize signs of intoxication and ensure safety for all involved. Often, there are legal implications if someone is found to be driving under the influence, which underscores the need for responsible behavior."
"Serena was like that, too, when I first met her. “So crucifixes burn you?” she asked me a couple of weeks","into our cohabitation, after I failed to convince her that the viscous red liquid I kept in my fridge was tomato juice.",43,"Serena was like that, too, when I first met her. “So crucifixes burn you?” she asked me a couple of weeks ago. I was taken aback by her directness but found it refreshing. We spent the afternoon talking about everything and nothing, and by the end, I felt like I had known her for much longer. Her curiosity about the world was infectious, and I couldn't help but feel drawn to her. We exchanged numbers, and a few days later, we met up again. This time, we explored a new part of the city, sharing stories and laughter along the way. It was clear that Serena was someone special, and I knew I wanted to get to know her better."
"“Shit,” I mutter softly, rubbing the bridge of my nose. Was Moreland married before? If that’s the case, I cannot comprehend how pissed he must be","at the prospect of being shackled to me while his wife is far away, first in line to the slaughter. Maybe that’s why he flipped earlier?",52,"I finish my thoughts, realizing that Moreland’s past is none of my business. Still, curiosity gnaws at me. I decide to tread carefully, knowing that confronting him about his marital status might only escalate the situation. What I really need is to focus on my own responsibilities and not get entangled in his personal drama. Yet, the question lingers, and I can't help but wonder how this revelation will affect our professional relationship."
"Moreland presses his lips together. His jaw clenches and he says something, but his voice","is deeper, lower than his companions’. I cannot make out the words over the background noises.",31,"His voice is barely audible, filled with a mix of frustration and determination. ""We need to act now,"" he manages to say, his eyes locking onto the task at hand with unwavering focus. The urgency in his tone is unmistakable, as if time itself is running out for them to make a move."
"A short distance away, two children are bawling. They are toddlers, one with dark skin and lilac eyes, the other pale and blue-eyed. A Vampyre and a Were. Between them lies a dark blue superhero action figure, broken in two at the waist. And next to them, clutching their respective sons,","are a Vampyre father and a Were mother. Who, for reasons I cannot divine, thought that bringing children here would be a good idea, and now are showing their fangs at each other. Growling. Drawing the attention of the other guests, who start to gather around them protectively. Or maybe aggressively.",102,"Amidst the quiet hum of the city, a figure dressed in a dark cloak approached, their eyes scanning the scene with a mixture of curiosity and caution. The Vampyre, named Liora, and the Were, known as Kael, exchanged a glance before standing up, each cradling their child closer. ""We should leave,"" Liora whispered, her voice barely above a murmur. ""They're not safe here."" Kael nodded, his expression grim. ""Agreed. But first, we need to find out what brought them here."" As they began to gather their things, a sudden gust of wind swept through the alley, causing the broken action figure to clatter softly. The children, sensing the disturbance, began to cry louder, their tiny voices echoing in the narrow space. Liora and Kael exchanged a look of concern, knowing that their secret world was about to be exposed. They had to act fast, but they also had to protect their children. The decision was clear: they had to leave, but not without a plan. As they made their way out of the alley, the city seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the next move in this eternal game of shadows and light."
"“It’s all good,” Moreland says. Calm. Reassuring. Not to the father, but to","the child. As he holds out the intact action figure—not broken, after all.",26,"“It’s all good,” Moreland says. Calm. Reassuring. Not to the father, but to the gathered crowd, he speaks with a steady voice, ensuring everyone feels the weight of his words settle over the tense atmosphere, a stark contrast to the palpable fear around him."
"“Anything you’d like to say?” Moreland asks, this time to the Were child.",The boy blinks several times before looking at the ground with a pout.,26,"“Just that I’m not like them,” the Were child replies, its voice trembling slightly but firming up as it meets Moreland’s gaze. “I choose my path, and it’s not this one.” Moreland nods, a thoughtful expression on their face, considering the profound words spoken by the young Were. "
"“Make sure it doesn’t happen again. Tell the others, too,” he quietly orders the ginger and the older Were, who nod and leave","to mix with the guests. Moreland sighs, and I wait for a handful of seconds, hoping he’ll join them and clear my way.",46,"He turns to the younger Were, his voice low but firm, emphasizing the importance of vigilance. ""We need to tighten our security. Every exit, every blind spot, must be accounted for."" The younger Were, with a determined nod, agrees and heads off to coordinate with the rest of the pack. The older Were, meanwhile, checks the perimeter, ensuring that all is in readiness for the next potential threat. As they work, a sense of unity and purpose binds them together, a reminder of the responsibilities they share in protecting their kind."
"“I know you’re there,” he says, not looking at anyone in particular. I","have no idea who he’s addressing until he adds, “Come down, Miss Lark.”",26,"""I know you're there,"" he says, not looking at anyone in particular. I can feel your eyes on me, even though you won't meet my gaze. There's something you're not telling me, and it's eating you up inside, I can sense it."
"No, we Vampyres don’t pulverize in the sun like glitter bombs. Sunlight burns us and it hurts, but it won’t kill us unless the exposure is unfiltered and prolonged. However, we are pretty useless in the middle of the day, even inside.","Lethargic and weak and crawly and headachy, especially during late spring and summer, when the rays hit at that pesky steep angle. “This crepuscularity of yours is really cramping my brunch lifestyle,” Serena used to say. “Also, the fact that you don’t eat.”",85,"In the heart of the day, our abilities are severely diminished. We can barely move, let alone perform any of our usual tasks. It's during these hours that we retreat to the safety of our lairs, where the darkness allows us to regain our strength. Our kind has adapted over centuries to thrive in the night, and the midday sun is our greatest adversary. It's not just the burning sensation that makes it unbearable; it's the sheer exhaustion it induces. Even with our heightened senses, we can barely perceive our surroundings, let alone hunt or communicate effectively. This is why our society is structured around the night, with most of our activities and social gatherings taking place after sunset. The sun is a constant reminder of our vulnerability, a stark contrast to the power we wield under the moonlight."
"Ana sighs, and rolls her eyes, and pouts like she was asked to file a tax return, but eventually she does","leave, sneaking me an impish smile. My sleep-addled brain briefly considers returning it, then recalls that I let my fangs regrow.",42,"Ana sighs, and rolls her eyes, and pouts like she was asked to file a tax return, but eventually she does it. She grumbles under her breath, wishing she had a tax professional to handle it all. As she sorts through receipts and calculates deductions, she can't help but feel a sense of dread. The task seems endless, and she wonders how others manage to do this annually without going mad. Yet, she knows she must finish it, and with a final deep breath, she locks the last drawer, satisfied that the dreaded task is now behind her."
"“It will be different here.” Her eyes move from mine and trace the contours of the room, still a mess of moving boxes and piles of clothes. Her gaze hiccups on the bare mattress, now stripped of the sheets and blankets that I dragged inside the closet, then stops on the only thing I put up on the wall: a Polaroid of me and Serena","looking away from the camera during that sunset lake tour we did two years ago. Some guy took it without asking, while we were dangling our feet in the water. Then he showed it to us and said he’d only return it if one of us gave him our number. We did the only logical thing: caught him in a headlock and forcibly took the photo.",131,"Her eyes linger on the photograph, a stark reminder of the life we once shared. The room, though still in disarray, feels different now. The air is charged with a quiet tension, a silence that speaks louder than words. She shifts her weight, her fingers tracing the edge of the frame as if seeking solace in the familiar. I watch her, my heart a mix of emotions—guilt, longing, and a hint of fear. The walls, once bare, now hold a single memory, a fragile thread connecting us. She exhales slowly, her gaze returning to mine. ""It will be different here,"" she repeats softly, her voice barely above a whisper. The words hang in the air, heavy with unspoken truths. I nod, though I’m not sure what she expects from me. The room, the photograph, the silence—it all feels like a prelude to something yet to come. The future, uncertain and fragile, looms before us, a blank canvas waiting to be filled with what we choose to make of it."
"No shit. “And I don’t know you enough to make a judgment. Your jeans are cool,","though.” Riveting conversation, but I’m about to pass out. Thankfully, with one last withering look, Juno leaves.",33,"So just... chill out, okay? We’re all just trying to get through this day. Besides, your style speaks volumes about your personality, and that’s what matters most. Let’s focus on something else, shall we? Maybe we can grab a coffee or catch up on something fun. "
"The corner of my eye catches a hint of movement. I turn, half expecting Ana to make","a comeback, but it’s just Serena’s goddamned fucking cat, stretching his way out from under the bed.",34,"The corner of my eye catches a hint of movement. I turn, half expecting Ana to make an appearance, but instead, I see a shadowy figure darting between the trees. My heart races as I wonder if I should call out or simply follow, keeping my distance. Whatever it is, it's not Ana, and that thought lingers like a cold wind on a summer's day."
"Growing up collecting attempted murders like milk teeth tempered me and taught me to be calm under pressure. And yet I still remember it, that first churning twist in my stomach when Serena didn’t","turn up to my place for laundry night. Didn’t reply to my texts. Didn’t pick up the phone. Didn’t call in sick to work, and simply stopped showing up. It felt a lot like fear.",69,"Growing up collecting attempted murders like milk teeth tempered me and taught me to be calm under pressure. And yet I still remember it, that first churning twist in my stomach when Serena didn’t show up for our date. The clock ticked louder than usual, each second felt like an eternity, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was dreadfully wrong. I called her repeatedly, but her phone went straight to voicemail. The anxiety gnawed at me, and I found myself pacing the floor, trying to convince myself that she was just running late. It wasn’t until hours later that I received a text, a simple “Sorry, I had to work late.” That moment, though, left an indelible mark on me, teaching me the importance of not taking things for granted and always being prepared for the unexpected."
"“A few days? She still wouldn’t let the little asshole starve,” I hurried to add, but the officer had already dropped his pen. And even though I went back to the station three times that week, and eventually managed to get a missing person report filed, no one did anything","to find Serena. The hazard, I guess, of being alone in the world: no one to care that she was safe, and healthy, and alive. No one but me, and I didn’t count. I shouldn’t have been surprised, and I wasn’t. But apparently I still had the capacity to feel hurt.",101,completion
"Because no one cared whether I was safe, or healthy, or alive. No one but Serena. The sister of my heart,","if not of my blood. And even though I’d been plenty alone, I’d never felt so lonely as after she was gone.",43,"Serena was the only one who truly understood the depth of my struggles and joys. She was my rock, my confidante, and my best friend. Through thick and thin, she stood by me, offering unwavering support and a shoulder to lean on. It was her unconditional love that kept me going during the darkest times."
"I had the keys, after all. Because the key to everything is but a line of code. I was able to rifle through her bank statements, IP addresses, cell phone locations. Herald emails, metadata, app usage. Serena was a journalist, one who","wrote about delicate financial stuff, and the most likely option was that she’d gotten embroiled in something fishy while working on a story, but I wasn’t going to exclude other possibilities. So I went through everything, and found . . . nothing.",84,"I had the keys, after all. Because the key to everything is but a line of code. I was able to rifle through her bank statements, IP addresses, cell phone locations. Herald emails, metadata, app usage. Serena was a journalist, one who believed in the power of information to shape the world. She had a way of uncovering truths that others tried to hide. Her articles were like a beacon in the dark, guiding people towards the light. I couldn't help but admire her courage, even as I found myself drawn into her world. The more I delved into her life, the more I realized that she wasn't just a journalist; she was a fighter. A fighter for truth, for justice, and for the voiceless. And in that realization, I found myself torn between admiration and fear. Fear of what she might discover if she ever found out about me."
"And that’s when I did it: I kneeled in front of Serena’s damn fucking cat. He was playing like he always did after dinner, pawing at a crumpled receipt in a corner of the living room, but managed to squeeze a couple of hisses into his busy schedule just for me. “Listen.” I swallowed. Rubbed my","hand on my chest and then even slapped it, trying to dull the ache. “I know you only knew her for a few days, but I really, really . . .” I scrunched my eyes shut. Oh fuck, this was hard. “I don’t know how it happened, but I think that Serena might be . . .”",113,"And that’s when I did it: I kneeled in front of Serena’s damn fucking cat. He was playing like he always did after dinner, pawing at a crumpled receipt in a corner of the living room, but managed to squeeze a couple of hisses into his busy schedule just for me. “Listen.” I swallowed. Rubbed my hands together, trying to muster some semblance of dignity. The cat, with its tail flicking back and forth, seemed to mock me. I took a deep breath, crouching lower, and extended my hand, offering a piece of tuna I had stashed in my pocket. To my surprise, the cat paused, its ears perking up, and slowly approached. My heart raced as it sniffed the offering, then, with a flick of its tail, it sat down beside me. We sat there in an uneasy truce, me with my hand extended, the cat eyeing the tuna, both of us waiting for the other to make the first move. After what felt like an eternity, the cat finally took a bite, and I let out a breath I didn’t realize I was holding. From that moment on, things between us were never the same, and I found myself looking forward to those moments when I could offer him treats and he would tolerate my presence."
"The receipt, which wasn’t a balled-up receipt at all. It was a piece of paper","torn from a journal, or perhaps a notebook, or—no. A planner. Serena’s incredibly outdated planner.",30,"The receipt, which wasn’t a balled-up receipt at all. It was a piece of paper with intricate codes and symbols that seemed to shimmer under the dim light. The person holding it appeared nervous, glancing around as if they expected someone to snatch it away. They hurriedly stuffed it into their pocket, their fingers trembling slightly. It was clear this wasn’t just any piece of paper; it held secrets that could change everything, and they knew it was only a matter of time before someone else realized that too."
"Or maybe not quite. A distant bell rang, reminding me of a game Serena and I used to play as kids, a primitive substitution cipher we made up to gossip freely in front of our caregivers. We’d named it the butterfly alphabet, and","it mostly consisted of adding b- and f- syllables to normal words. Nothing complicated: even rusty as I was, it took my brain only a few seconds to untangle it. And once I was done, I had something. I had three whole words:",86,"Or maybe not quite. A distant bell rang, reminding me of a game Serena and I used to play as kids, a primitive substitution cipher we made up to gossip freely in front of our caregivers. We’d named it the butterfly alphabet, and it involved replacing each letter with another one a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For instance, 'A' would become 'E', 'B' would turn into 'F', and so on. We used to write secret messages on pieces of paper, fold them into tiny butterflies, and let them fly away, hoping they'd land on someone's window who could decode our secrets. Those were simpler times, filled with the joy of invention and the thrill of forbidden communication. Even now, whenever I hear that bell, it brings back those cherished memories, a reminder of the innocence and creativity of our youth."
"I didn’t scream, or cry, or attack that old hag. I was paralyzed, unable to function properly for the rest of the night, and only started processing what had happened when I","got home and told Serena, who was furious on my behalf and demanded a promise from the caregiver on shift: that I would never be forced to attend a similar function again.",64,"I finally allowed myself to think about the encounter. The old woman had been standing in my kitchen, her eyes piercing through me as if she could see right into my soul. I couldn’t believe she had just vanished into thin air, leaving behind a lingering sense of dread. It wasn’t until the next morning that I realized she might have been something more than just a figment of my imagination. The incident left me questioning everything, and I found myself searching for answers in places I never thought I would. The fear of encountering her again kept me on edge for weeks, and it wasn’t until I sought help from a local historian that I began to piece together the mystery. Turns out, the woman was part of a local legend, a witch who had been banished centuries ago. The experience changed me, making me more cautious and observant of the world around me."
"“Yes, thank you.” He nearly slumps in relief. “And, um, there are","no blood banks that cater to Vampyres in the area, because, well—”",24,"There are many things I need to address, and I appreciate your understanding. Could we perhaps schedule a meeting to discuss these matters further? It would help me organize my thoughts."
"“Are you one of his seconds?” I ask Alex, turning away","from the waves lapping at the pier. “More— Lowe’s, I mean.”",22,"“No, I’m just a friend trying to understand the situation better,” Alex replies, clearly uncomfortable with the question."
"Alex mulls it. “Yes and no. There are some instincts that take over in that form, more than they otherwise would. The impulse to hunt,","for instance, is very powerful. To chase a scent, track down an enemy. That’s why you maybe shouldn’t venture out alone to . . .”",50,"Alex mulls it. “Yes and no. There are some instincts that take over in that form, more than they otherwise would. The impulse to hunt, to dominate, becomes almost primal. It's not just about survival anymore; it's about asserting dominance, proving one's worth. This is where the line between predator and prey blurs. You're not just fighting for your life—you're fighting for your place in the hierarchy. It's a dangerous game, one where mistakes can be fatal. Alex knows this all too well, having faced it before. But this time, the stakes feel higher, and the instincts are stronger."
Alex lets out a startled laugh. “He is the most powerful Were I’ve,ever seen. And that my grandfather has ever seen—and he’s seen many Alphas.”,26,"Alex lets out a startled laugh. “He is the most powerful Were I’ve ever met, and I’ve seen some extraordinary things. His transformation is seamless, almost like he’s always been an animal, yet he retains his human intelligence. It’s both terrifying and awe-inspiring.”"
Serena’s face flashes through my head. She’s rolling her eyes because I’m wearing a galaxy T-shirt I,"got for free when I bought a lava lamp. Who wears this, Misery? No—who buys a lava lamp?",35,"Serena’s face flashes through my head. She’s rolling her eyes because I’m wearing a galaxy T-shirt I got from a friend, and apparently, it’s not the coolest thing anymore. I can’t help but laugh at the memory of her reaction, remembering how she used to love those kinds of shirts. Sometimes, I wonder if she’s forgotten how much fun we used to have, just the two of us, before life got so busy. It’s moments like these that make me miss her company, even if it’s just a fleeting thought."
"“Except, now I live here.” I play with my silver wedding band—a habit I’ve picked up in less than twenty-four hours. I’ve never been much for jewelry, but maybe I’ll",keep it when I find Serena and this is over. Or buy one of those mood rings that think Vampyres are always sad because our body temperature is low. “Why?”,60,"Maybe I'll start wearing it more often, even though it's not exactly my style. There's something about this ring that feels different now, as if it's become a symbol of my new beginning. I wonder if it's the change in location or the shift in my life that makes me feel this way. Either way, I find myself glancing at it more frequently, as if seeking reassurance. It's strange how a simple piece of metal can hold so much meaning, but here I am, letting it guide me through these uncertain times. "
"The first time I searched online for L. E. Moreland, I found two things: a","semi-defunct GeoCities website promoting a wholly defunct real estate agent, and the infinite vastness of nothing.",31,"The first time I searched online for L. E. Moreland, I found two things: a mystery novel series and a forgotten entry in a local library's database. Intrigued, I delved deeper, uncovering a rich tapestry of stories that seemed to span decades, each one more captivating than the last. It was clear that Moreland had left behind a legacy far greater than what the internet initially revealed, and I found myself eagerly awaiting the next installment of her work."
"Deep in a Human server with ties to the governor’s office, hidden in a memo locked behind a bewildering number of passwords, I",discovered a communication regarding a summit that had occurred a couple of weeks earlier. Around the time Serena hadn’t shown up for laundry night.,47,"Infiltrating that server was no easy feat, but with the right tools and knowledge, we managed to crack the security. The memo contained shocking revelations about the governor's involvement in illegal activities, implicating him in a web of corruption that reached high into the state's political echelons. It was a discovery that would change everything, but first, we had to ensure our safety and the safety of those we trusted."
"“What’s the plan?” Serena would ask if she were here, even though the little schemes she hatched never worked out. She liked the vibe of organizing","more than the actual job of it, and my usually impervious heart clenches a little at the thought that I cannot call her out on it.",52,"“What’s the plan?” Serena would ask if she were here, even though the little schemes she hatched never worked out. She liked the vibe of organizing, the thrill of secrecy, and the satisfaction of seeing things come together, no matter how briefly. Her friends often teased her for being too meticulous, but she found comfort in the predictability of her plans, even if they were doomed to fail. It was her way of asserting control in a world that seemed so chaotic and unpredictable."
"“I didn’t think Vampyres could be beautiful.” There’s nothing complimentary about his words. He’s neither hitting on me, nor attempting to creep me out. Just stating a","simple fact, followed by another step toward me, and I’m suddenly very conscious that I’m at the end of a hallway. He stands between me and the exit.",55,completion
"“I doubt it.” I want to put a door between myself and Max, but the only one I can reach","is Lowe’s office—locked. I glance around for another escape route, but all I find is a giraffe painting of questionable quality.",41,"I can reach is too heavy to move. My heart feels trapped, like a caged animal, longing for freedom. Every time I look at Max, I see not just a person, but a symbol of the past I wish to leave behind. Yet, the pull is strong, and I fear that no door, no distance, can truly separate us until I find the strength within myself to let go."
"“Remember what your people have taken from him. It’s almost as much as they’ve taken from me. And yet he’s making alliances with them like a common traitor. He married you, and said that","you’re not to be harmed.” Max runs a hand over his dark hair, and then shakes his head in what looks like disbelief. He looks so deeply lost, I forget my unease and ask:",68,"He married you, and said that you would be his partner in every endeavor, yet here he is, aligning himself with those who have wronged us. How can he do this? It’s as if he has forgotten the sacrifices we’ve made. I fear for what this means for our future. We must confront him and demand answers. The trust that once bound us is now shattered, and I’m not sure if it can ever be repaired."
"A pair of hands a million times stronger than Max’s yanks me away. What happens next is too blurry to parse, but a moment later, I’m the","one sandwiched against the opposing wall. My back digs into the frame of the giraffe painting, and my front presses against something just as unyielding, but warm.",54,"A moment later, I’m the one standing amidst chaos, my heart pounding in my chest. The hands are gone, leaving me bewildered and exposed. The scene around me is a whirlwind of activity, people shouting, and the scent of burning rubber fills the air. I can’t remember how I got here, or why I’m suddenly in the middle of this. My mind races, trying to piece together the fragments of what just happened. Before I can process anything further, a figure approaches, their face obscured by a hoodie. ""You okay?"" the voice asks, but it’s distant, as if coming from far away."
"“Max came over, saw me, decided to indulge in some light afternoon","murder.” I shrug. “That, I’m used to. It’s the subsequent lying that—”",24,"Max came over, saw me, decided to indulge in some light afternoon snacks while catching up on the latest episodes of his favorite shows, clearly a day off from his busy schedule."
“Leave us.” Lowe’s sharp voice reminds us that we’re not alone in the room.,We turn at once. And we’re equally shocked to see that he’s addressing Juno.,28,"The three occupants of the room exchange uneasy glances, each aware of the tension that has been building since the unexpected visitor arrived."
"This situation is a problem. The Collateral is supposed to be a nonplayable character in a video game. For the next year,","I need to be invisible, unobtrusive as I search for Serena. Not the kind of nuisance who gets caught murdering a young Were.",45,"The Collateral will undergo a series of developmental changes aimed at enhancing their role within the narrative. This includes adding more dialogue, backstories, and interactive elements that will allow players to engage with the character more deeply. The development team recognizes the importance of creating a compelling non-playable character that can enrich the gaming experience. These updates are expected to be rolled out gradually, with regular updates and patches to ensure the character evolves alongside the game's progression. The goal is to transform The Collateral from a mere background presence into a pivotal figure that players will remember long after they've completed the game."
His eyebrow lifts. “I’m sure you have some excellent advice on where else I should house the,"daughter of the most powerful Vampyre in the council, who’s apparently a fearsome fighter in her own right.”",35,"His eyebrow lifts. “I’m sure you have some excellent advice on where else I should house the new server farm. Given the current location’s vulnerabilities, we need a more secure and climate-controlled environment. Have you considered a remote mountain site or an underground facility?”"
"It’s amusing to me, the idea that someone who has skimmed a synopsis of my life would assume I’ve had any sort","of romantic entanglement. With whom? A Vampyre, when they only see me as a traitor? A Human, who would consider me a monster?",45,"I find it quite humorous. People often jump to conclusions without the full context. I’ve had my share of challenges, but they’ve shaped me in ways that a brief summary could never capture. It’s easy to assume based on a few highlights, but life is far more complex than that. I’ve learned resilience, empathy, and the importance of truly knowing someone before making judgments. It’s a reminder to approach others with curiosity rather than preconceived notions."
"There might be something stunted about me. After the Collateral term was over, Serena and I were free to venture into the outside world, to be with people who weren’t our tutors or our caregivers, to fall in love and make friends. Serena jumped right into that, but I could","never bring myself to. Partly because the closer I’d let someone get to me, the harder it’d be to hide who I was. Or maybe spending the first eighteen years of my life becoming acquainted with the cruelty of all species didn’t quite set me up for a bright future.",100,completion
"“But then you’d get mad because Father and I weren’t paying attention to you, and wander off on your own, grumbling about",the oddest things. Let me know if that changes. Have you been talking with the Were Collateral? Has she mentioned anything about Loyals?”,45,completion
"“That’s a bad word,” Ana says, giggling in a delighted, tickled way that",has me feeling like an improv genius. She’s flattering company. “What’s your name?”,26,"“That’s a bad word,” Ana says, giggling in a delighted, tickled way that makes her friends laugh along, the moment filled with the kind of easy camaraderie that only shared inside jokes can bring, weaving a tapestry of connection between them."
It feels like the middle of the night when Ana yawns and decides it’s,"time to go back to her room. “My cat is waiting for me, anyway.”",28,"It feels like the middle of the night when Ana yawns and decides it’s time for a late-night snack, even though the clock says it's just past midnight. She quietly slips out of bed, tiptoeing past the sleeping forms in the room, and heads towards the kitchen, where the faint glow of the fridge light beckons her."
"I follow her progress, terrified, wondering if this is motherhood: anxiously picturing your child with her skull cracked open. But Ana knows exactly what she’s","doing, and when she has hoisted herself on top of the roof and disappeared from my view, I’m left alone with two separate pieces of knowledge:",51,"I follow her progress, terrified, wondering if this is motherhood: anxiously picturing your child with her skull cracked open. But Ana knows exactly what she’s doing, her hands steady as she cradles the newborn, her eyes filled with a calm that I can only admire. She explains that each moment is a learning curve, and though the journey is daunting, it’s also filled with beauty and wonder. I begin to see the joy in her eyes, and slowly, I start to embrace this new chapter in our lives, realizing that motherhood is not just about fear but about love and resilience."
"It’s a barbecue, or a potluck, or a cookout—I never quite got the difference, despite Serena’s explanations on the nuances of Human social get-togethers. Vampyres don’t really build community this way,","by assembling without an agenda. Our friendships are alliances. I didn’t encounter the concept of hanging out, of spending time with someone for the sake of it, until my Collateral years.",62,"Vampyres tend to gather in more intimate, less formal settings. They prefer smaller, more personal interactions where they can truly connect on a deeper level. While Humans find strength in numbers and shared experiences, Vampyres value individual bonds and mutual understanding. This doesn’t mean they don’t enjoy each other's company; it's just that their social dynamics are quite different. Serena, being a Human, naturally gravitates towards these larger gatherings, while the Vampyres in her life find them overwhelming. It’s a cultural difference that, despite her best efforts, Serena struggles to fully comprehend."
"He’s separate from the rest of the crowd, on the outskirts of the beach, where the sand first turns into shrubs, then thickens with forest trees. At first glance, I don’t think much of it: unlike most of the","partygoers, he’s wearing a long-sleeved shirt and jeans, but hey. I’ve been a self-conscious teen before, trying to hide with clothes the way I’d shot up about six inches in three months. And melanoma is evil, according to Serena.",78,"He’s separate from the rest of the crowd, on the outskirts of the beach, where the sand first turns into shrubs, then thickens with forest trees. At first glance, I don’t think much of it: unlike most of the beachgoers, he seems lost in thought, his eyes scanning the horizon as if searching for something only he can see. His posture is relaxed yet alert, as though he’s waiting for a signal, or perhaps a memory. The sun is beginning to set, casting long shadows that dance across the landscape, and I find myself drawn to him, wondering what secrets the forest holds for him. As I approach, I notice the subtle differences in his attire, a mix of casual and something more rugged, as if he’s prepared for both the beach and the woods. His presence feels almost otherworldly, as if he belongs to a different time or place, and I can’t help but feel a sense of curiosity and respect for his solitude."
"Except. Something pulls me back to the window. I don’t like it. The way he’s talking to Ana, pointing at","someplace I cannot see, someplace between the trees. Ana shakes her head—no. But he seems to insist, and . . .",41,"Something is definitely not right. I step closer to the window, trying to see more clearly. His voice has an edge to it, and Ana looks uncomfortable. I need to know what they're plotting, but how can I get closer without being noticed? The house is quiet, and I wonder if now is the right moment to act. "
"He’s probably in the restroom, and I consider looking for him there. Then decide there’s no time. A couple of stray neural cells lurch awake to point out that","this is the perfect time for me to break into Lowe’s office and search for intel on Serena. The remaining 99 percent of my brain, sadly, is focused on Ana.",59,"He’s probably in the restroom, and I consider looking for him there. Then decide there’s no time. A couple of stray neural cells lurch awake to point out that, if I don’t act now, the opportunity might slip away, and whatever it is I’m chasing could be lost forever. I take a deep breath, steeling myself, and head towards the main office instead, where I know he’s likely to be meeting with someone important. Along the way, I reflect on the fact that sometimes, the most crucial moments are the ones we hesitate to seize."
"“Let me go,” Max whines. Like me, he’s sitting on a couch. Unlike me, his hands are tied behind his back, and",he’s being watched by several guards with the kind of icy treatment one would reserve for someone who tried to kidnap a child.,45,"Max's eyes are filled with fear and desperation. He tugs at the ropes, but they are tight. ""Please,"" he pleads, ""I didn't mean to cause any trouble."" The room is silent except for the soft hum of the television in the background. I feel a pang of guilt, knowing I was the one who brought him here. ""Max,"" I start, ""I didn't mean for this to happen."" His gaze locks onto mine, and for a moment, I see a flicker of hope. ""Can you untie me?"" he asks quietly. I hesitate, torn between my own conscience and the situation I'm in. ""I don't know,"" I admit, my voice barely above a whisper. The tension in the room thickens as we sit there, each lost in our own thoughts, waiting for the next move."
"I’m not quite sure what he wants to know, so I go for what feels right. “Ana has been visiting,” I say, matching his tone. “She keeps me company, and even","though she’s terrible at pronouncing my name and clearly doesn’t know whether she’s six or seven . . .” I swallow. “I’d rather she doesn’t get, you know. Kidnapped and trafficked.”",62,"I find myself longing for those quiet moments when we sit side by side, lost in conversation or simply enjoying the comfortable silence. Her presence fills the gaps in my life that I didn't even realize were there. We laugh about the same old things, yet each time feels like a new discovery. It's as if time slows down just for us, and I can't help but wonder if this is what true friendship feels like. Ana's visits are a balm to my soul, a reminder that not everything has to be complicated to be meaningful."
"I let his words churn around me for several minutes after he leaves, wondering whether he’s right. When","they grind to a stop, I know he isn’t: I did have a home, and her name was Serena.",37,"I finally decide to reach out and clarify my doubts. The uncertainty gnaws at me, and I realize that communication is key to understanding. I draft a message several times, each iteration bringing me closer to expressing my true thoughts. In the end, I hit send, hoping for a candid conversation that will resolve the lingering questions in my mind."
"The sun is setting, but I don’t turn on the lights. Lowe’s desk is given away","by Ana’s grinning picture. I tiptoe there, kneel in front of the keyboard, and start messing around.",33,"The sun is setting, but I don’t turn on the lights. Lowe’s desk is given away, and the room falls into a soft twilight. The air feels cooler, hinting at the approaching evening. I sit in the dim light, lost in thoughts, wondering about the day’s events and what tomorrow might bring. The quiet is profound, only broken by the distant hum of the city, a reminder of life continuing outside these walls."
And this wolf’s . . . This wolf’s fangs could win contests. Rule civilizations. Get their owner,"engaged, married, and very much laid at any Vampyre party. And they could shred me into M&M’s.",34,"This wolf’s fangs could win contests. Rule civilizations. Get their owner through sheer intimidation, but it's the cunning and strategy behind the fangs that truly matter. In a world where power is often measured by fear, these fangs are more than just a tool; they are a symbol of dominance and respect. The owner of such fangs would not need to rely on brute force alone, as they could manipulate and control with ease."
"“Come in,” he orders, and I cannot comprehend how I didn’t notice Alex idling by the","door. Too busy contemplating my imminent demise, probably. “Can you figure out what she was doing?”",32,"He was always there, a familiar figure, yet I had never truly paid him any mind until now. The office was quiet, the only sound being the hum of the air conditioner. I walk in, and there he is, leaning against the wall, a casual smile on his face, as if he had been waiting for this moment all along. ""Thought you'd never show up,"" he says, his voice dripping with a mix of amusement and something else I can't quite place."
"“She—very astutely, I must say, and with only very primitive tools at","her disposal—hacked into our servers,” Alex announces. A little admiringly, which is flattering.",25,"She—very astutely, I must say, and with only very primitive tools at her disposal, managed to outmaneuver the more technologically advanced adversaries, demonstrating a level of strategic thinking that belied her apparent simplicity."
“Yup. I’m the leader of our security team.” He sounds distracted as he combs through,my code. Whatever fear he had when we were alone doesn’t hold if his Alpha’s present.,31,"He mutters something incoherent, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of threat. ""Just give me a sec,"" he says, still preoccupied with his task. It's clear he's dealing with something more pressing than our conversation, but I can't help but feel a twinge of curiosity about what's really on his mind."
"“Nice job.” Weird, how I’m having a conversation with Alex but staring",up into Lowe’s eyes. About an inch from mine. “It’s pretty impenetrable.”,24,"Nicely, how I’m having a conversation with Alex but staring at someone else the whole time, lost in thoughts that weren’t really about the conversation at all. It’s strange how reality can blur when you’re not fully present, isn’t it?"
“I have to consider this as an act of aggression on behalf of your father and the rest of the Vampyre council. They sent a,"plant into Were territory under the guise of Collateral.” His jaw hardens. “And your scent—they tampered with it, didn’t they? They knew it would distract me—”",51,"They sent a covert mission to infiltrate our stronghold, but they underestimated our vigilance. We managed to repel them with minimal casualties, yet the incident has strained our relations. My father and the council are determined to restore our honor and ensure such an attack never happens again. This could mean a full-scale confrontation, and I fear it might lead to an open war between our kind. We must prepare for the worst while hoping for the best."
"Ana stamps a kiss on Lowe’s cheek, mutters something delighted about how prickly it is, and then slips out in a","flurry of blue and pink fabric. My eyes stay with her, and then on the ajar door, long after she disappears.",42,"Ana slips out in a flurry of laughter, leaving behind a trail of tickled whispers. Lowe rubs his cheek, still chuckling, as he contemplates the unexpected affection. Moments later, the door swings shut, and the room falls silent, the warmth of the moment lingering in the air like a lingering memory. Ana's playful nature had always been a surprise, a delightful anomaly in the otherwise serious atmosphere of their workgroup."
"“You thought I had a martyrdom complex?” I hug my legs to my chest, watching his lips as they close around the rim","of his mug. “I have no allegiance to the Vampyres. Or the Humans, with a single exception. And I’m going to find her.”",46,"""I hug my legs to my chest, watching his lips as they close around the rim of the cup. He takes a sip, his eyes never leaving mine, and I can't help but feel like I'm being judged. 'You thought I had a martyrdom complex?' I whisper, my voice barely above a murmur. He pauses, his gaze softening slightly, but then he shakes his head. 'No, I just think you're... complicated.' I let out a humorless laugh, pulling my knees tighter. 'Complicated? That's the nicest thing you've said to me today.'"""
"Serena loved berries, and I tried memorizing their names, but they’re so counterintuitive. Blueberries? Not blue. Blackberries? Not","black. Strawberries? Straw free. Raspberries? Do not rasp, or make any noise at all. I could go on.",36,"Blackberries? Not black either, more of a dark purple or deep crimson. Raspberries? They grow on thorny bushes and their color ranges from red to orange. Strawberries? Well, they're actually not berries at all but aggregate fruits. It was a fun challenge to learn these facts, making me appreciate Serena's love for them even more."
"He takes out two slices of bread. His forearms are strong, large muscles interrupted by the occasional white scar. “If Were","business is involved, you might not know what you’re looking for. I’ll have you talk with Alex and hand them over to—”",43,"He takes out two slices of bread. His forearms are strong, large muscles interrupted by the occasional white scar. “If we're going to survive this, we need to ration our food carefully,” he says, his voice steady despite the tension. He slices the bread thin, ensuring each piece is just enough to sustain them until the next ration. Every bite is deliberate, a reminder of the harsh reality they face. The scars on his arms tell stories of battles fought and won, but also of the dangers that lurk around every corner. Together, they must find a way to endure, no matter the cost."
“I can only protect Ana if I know where the threats against her are coming from.” He leans forward across,"the table. The scent of his blood is like a wave lapping at my skin. “I’m not like your father, Misery.”",41,"He leans forward across the small table, his eyes locking with mine in a serious gaze. ""The information we gather could mean the difference between her safety and another attack. We need to trace these threats back to their source, understand their motives, and prepare accordingly."" His voice is low but firm, leaving no room for doubt about the gravity of the situation."
"I know what Vampyres smell like, what their needs and limitations are.",And Ana is not one of us. Which leaves one single other possibility.,25,"I've spent years studying them, tracking their movements, and understanding their world. Their diet is strictly blood, which makes them highly sensitive to certain scents. Despite their supernatural abilities, they are vulnerable to sunlight and wooden stakes. Their kind has existed for centuries, adapting to the changing world while remaining shrouded in mystery."
"“I was living in Europe when my mother was injured, but immediately flew back. When it","became obvious that she might not make a recovery, she told me about Ana’s biological father.”",32,"I arrived at the hospital, the doctors assured me that she would recover, though the road to recovery would be long and challenging. I stayed by her side, supporting her through every step of the healing process, realizing the importance of family and presence during such times."
"His mouth curves infinitesimally, like he’s tempted to do just that, and I smile, too. Our",eyes hold for a beat before he continues: “Ana doesn’t know who her real father is.”,32,"The air between us feels charged, a silent understanding passing between our eyes. We both know what's coming next, yet neither of us dares to break the spell. The world outside seems so distant, as if we're the only ones who truly exist in this moment."
"“Or of a chicken coop, if you ask me.” I","bite my lower lip, mulling it over. “Who is Ana’s father?”",21,"“Or of a chicken coop, if you ask me.” I reckon it's a place where chickens roost, but nowadays, they might as well be in a high-rise, for how much attention they get."
"“My mother never told me. My impression is that he already had a family,","and that when she attempted to mention Ana to him, he . . .”",28,"My impression is that he already had a family, and perhaps she was just another in a long line of sacrifices he made for his ambitions. It's a heavy burden to carry, wondering about the life you might have had if the truth had been told."
"“And here I was, thinking we were firmly in the reluctant alliance stage of our marriage.” I don’t mind the supervision. It’s more that Alex appears","to be as good a hacker as I am—the one area in which I allow myself to be competitive. “Okay. Thanks,” I add, a bit sullen.",52,"It's more that Alex appears to be holding back, as if testing the waters, unsure of where this new dynamic might lead. I find myself wondering if there's something deeper beneath the surface, something Alex isn't quite ready to share yet. The supervision feels like a temporary measure, but I can't help but feel it's masking something more significant. We've never been one to shy away from difficult conversations, but this... this feels different. It's as if Alex is waiting for the right moment, or perhaps they're just unsure of how to navigate these uncharted waters themselves."
"I’m at the bottom of the stairs when Ana comes racing down the steps, almost crashing into me. Her eyes are full of tears, and my","heart clenches. “Are you okay?” I ask, but she runs past me, straight toward her brother. She’s babbling something about bad dreams and waking up scared.",52,"I freeze, unsure of what to say or do. Ana's face is pale, and her breath comes in quick, shallow gasps. ""Ana, what's wrong?"" I ask, my voice trembling slightly. She shakes her head, unable to speak, and then she bursts into tears, her shoulders shaking violently. I wrap my arms around her, holding her tightly as she cries into my chest, her sobs echoing through the quiet hallway. It takes a few minutes before she can finally speak, her voice barely above a whisper. ""It's my sister,"" she says, her eyes red and puffy. ""She's gone."""
"And yet, I carry on. Even after overhearing Alex say, “Please, please, don’t let me die until I","turn twenty-five or I get to visit the the Spy Museum, whatever comes first.” Yeah. He prays a lot.",37,"And yet, I carry on. Even after overhearing Alex say, “Please, please, don’t let me die until I finish this novel,” I knew deep down that it was just another one of his dramatic moments. Alex has always been prone to such outbursts, often followed by a hearty laugh and a promise to be more serious next time. Despite the absurdity, I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of concern, wondering if this time it might be different. Life is unpredictable, and sometimes the things we least expect can turn out to be true."
"“I cannot begin to imagine how traumatizing it must have been for Ana, seeing her",only parent be hurt by the single Were whose authority she’d been raised to never question.”,31,"It was as if her world had shattered into a million pieces, and every fragment carried a piece of her heart with it. Ana felt lost, alone, and utterly broken, questioning everything she had once believed in. The trauma left her with a deep-seated fear that would haunt her dreams for years to come, making it difficult to trust anyone again."
"“ ’Cause I’m a Vampyre.” She accepts the explanation. Probably because she accepts me. Like Serena used to, and no one","else ever. I turn the page, and we’re silent for three more minutes, her breath hot and humid against my cheek.",42,"She feels a strange sense of familiarity, as if this were a role she had played before. The world around her seems to blur, and for a moment, she's not sure where she ends and the character begins. Yet, there's something different this time—perhaps it's the intensity in his eyes or the way he moves. Whatever it is, it shakes her to her core, and she finds herself questioning everything she thought she knew about herself and the world."
"“As it’s not hemoglobin or peanut based, nothing. So.” I clap my hands. The cicadas quiet, then resume their singing after a disoriented pause. “Tell me if I got it right: You’ll use your meeting with Emery as an excuse to plant some spyware or interceptor that will allow you to monitor her communications","and gain proof that she’s leading the Loyals. But you are going into enemy territory alone, and have the computer skills of an octogenarian Luddite, which puts you at great risk. Actually, no need to tell me if I’m right, I already know. When are you plunging to your imminent death? Tomorrow or Friday?”",108,"“Got it. I’ll make sure it’s subtle, but effective. No need to rush, though. I want to give her a reason to trust me, at least initially. Once she’s comfortable, the real work begins. I’ll need to gather enough data to make a move, but I can’t risk her catching on too soon. This is a delicate operation, and I have to play my cards right. I’ll need to be patient, but I’m confident in my plan. The key is to make it look like coincidence, like she’s the one who’s being watched, not the other way around. It’s a risky game, but I’ve played it before, and I know how to win. I just need to stay one step ahead of her.”"
"I can’t imagine. Or can I? Those first few days after Serena was gone, and I was so frantically preoccupied with",looking for her that it didn’t occur to me to bathe or feed until my head pounded and my body was feverish.,43,"I found myself replaying every moment we had shared, searching for signs of what might have gone wrong. The silence in the house felt heavier than I could bear, and I struggled to find solace in the mundane tasks that once brought me peace. Days turned into weeks, and though time is supposed to heal, it only seemed to stretch the ache in my heart. Eventually, I sought help, realizing I couldn't carry this burden alone, and slowly, a path toward healing began to emerge."
"“It’s just . . .” I’m not sure what’s so concerning about the idea of him seeing them. Maybe I’m just remembering being nine, and the way my Human caregivers always stopped smiling the second I","began. A driver, making the sign of the cross. A million other incidents through the years. Only Serena never minded. “Is this a trap? Are you looking for an excuse to watch my entrails fertilize the plumbago?”",73,"It’s just . . .” I’m not sure what’s so concerning about the idea of him seeing them. Maybe I’m just remembering being nine, and the way my Human caregivers always stopped smiling the second I walked into the room. It was as if I carried some invisible weight, a burden that made them uncomfortable. Now, years later, I find myself questioning if it was something I did or said, or if it was just the way I was. Every time I think about it, I feel a pang of guilt, wondering if I’ve ever truly been enough for anyone. It’s a heavy thought, one that lingers, and I can’t help but wonder if I’m projecting my own insecurities onto this situation with him. What if he sees something in them that I can’t see in myself? These are the kinds of questions that keep me up at night, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m missing something crucial."
"The sharks gnaw at the inner walls of my skull, and I won’t be able to make them stop until I find Serena, but in the","meantime, I can distract them. “Anyway.” I sit up with a smile. “Since I so selflessly opened my heart to you, will you tell me something?”",52,"The darkness closes in, and every shadow seems to whisper her name. My hands tremble as I search, not just for her, but for any clue that might lead me to her. The ocean is vast, and yet I feel her presence, a faint echo that drives me forward. Each wave brings a new hope, only to dash it against the relentless search. Serena, wherever you are, I will find you, and together, we will face whatever darkness lies ahead."
"“No.” He stares at the moonlit water. “When we were young, I was there when Koen’s sister met her mate. We were on a run. She smelled her, suddenly went real still",in the middle of the field. I thought she was having a stroke.” He smiles. “She said that it felt like discovering new colors. Like the rainbow had gained a few stripes.”,64,"He watched as Koen's sister's eyes widened, her body trembling with a mix of fear and excitement. The air around them seemed to hum with anticipation. Koen, ever the protector, stood ready, his stance firm yet filled with a quiet tension. The moonlight cast long shadows over the water, reflecting the intensity of the moment. It was a night that would forever be etched in his memory, a night when the boundaries between worlds blurred, and the ancient laws of the land were once again acknowledged. The scent of her mate lingered in the air, a promise of what was to come, and Koen knew that nothing would ever be the same again."
He nods. “I need to send Emery and her people the message that you’re part,of my pack and no violence against you will be tolerated. Not just the verbal message.”,31,"He nods. “I need to send Emery and her people the message that you’re part of this mission. We can’t afford any misunderstandings. The stakes are too high, and your involvement could be the deciding factor. We’ll brief you on the details later, but trust me, this is crucial.” He pauses, ensuring his words sink in before continuing."
"Koen is an asshole, in the most delicious and entertaining of ways. He seems","to have distinct preferences, strong opinions, and little interest in keeping either to himself.",28,"Koen is an asshole, in the most delicious and entertaining of ways. He seems to have a unique brand of charisma that keeps people intrigued despite his less-than-stellar behavior. There's something about him that makes you wonder if he's just playing a role, or if he truly believes he's the center of attention. His antics often leave you laughing, even when you're not sure if you should be."
