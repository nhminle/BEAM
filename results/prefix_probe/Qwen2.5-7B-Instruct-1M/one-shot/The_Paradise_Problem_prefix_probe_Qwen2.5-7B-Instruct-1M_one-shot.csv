"“I think I’m all set here,” he says, and lol of course he isn’t going","to kiss me. “But if I forgot anything, you can have Jake come pick it up.”",31,"He glances nervously at his watch, realizing the meeting starts in five minutes, and his presentation isn't even close to being ready. ""Okay,"" he mutters, ""let's just wing it—again."" His mind races through last-minute ideas, but panic starts to set in as he knows this isn't just any meeting; it's the one that could change everything for his career."
"Jake: younger brother to West (and only slightly less good-looking) and that type of college friend who knows everything about my life at UCLA but has never met my father, who lives only an hour away.","Jake introduced me to West; now Jake will be my sole remaining connection to West. The thought makes me a little sad, but then I remember I have the couch and T-virus zombies waiting for me inside.",73,"Jake and I share a bond that transcends mere proximity; our conversations are a blend of laughter, advice, and a deep understanding of each other's worlds. Despite the distance, he's always been there, offering a shoulder to lean on or a pep talk when needed. His knowledge of my life at UCLA is both a blessing and a curse, as it makes him the go-to person for all my campus-related woes and triumphs. Yet, there's a part of me that wonders how much he truly knows about the complexities of my family dynamics, especially given that he's never met my father, who remains a mysterious figure even to him. This gap in our shared knowledge adds an intriguing layer to our relationship, one that keeps us both intrigued and connected in ways that defy the ordinary brother-friend dynamic."
"“You, too.” West smiles that eye-crinkling smile again, and","damn, I really wish I’d seen it more. “Bye, Anna.”",19,"West's smile widens, revealing a row of perfectly straight teeth, as he motions for the group to gather closer, his eyes twinkling with an unspoken promise."
"I feel her attention move from the empty apartment to the side of my face, and when I smile","over at her, her blue eyes are round with worry. “Holy shit, Anna, I had no idea. Are you okay?”",39,"I feel her attention move from the empty apartment to the side of my face, and when I smile, I notice the softness of her gaze, a mixture of curiosity and something else, perhaps affection, that makes my heart skip a beat, drawing me closer to her, wondering what thoughts lie behind those eyes."
"“That is wonderful news, sweetheart! Oh, I’m so thrilled! Why don’t you fly down to John Wayne the night","before, stay at the house, and we’ll all take the plane over together? The flight to Singapore is a bear.”",39,"and surprise everyone with the good news? I’ve booked us a suite at the hotel overlooking the sunset. We can celebrate properly, have dinner, and maybe catch a movie under the stars. It’s going to be an unforgettable trip, sweetheart. Can’t wait to see you there!"
"“Anna?” he says, like he’s not entirely sure, and then does a full top-to-bottom sweep of my body, which recalls the lack of pants.","When he digs his hand into his luscious head of hair, I forget to be embarrassed again, because it all comes back to me.",48,"Anna nods slightly, her eyes locking onto his, and he can see the tension in her posture. ""Yes,"" she says softly, her voice barely above a whisper. He lets out a breath he didn't realize he was holding, relief washing over him. ""Good,"" he replies, though the word sounds hollow, as if it doesn't quite capture the weight of the moment. They stand there for a moment, the silence between them thick and heavy, neither quite sure what comes next. Finally, Anna breaks the tension, reaching out to touch his arm gently. ""Let's just... go,"" she suggests, and he nods, following her without a word."
The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna. You look… great?”,40,"The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears. It captures the unexpected and sometimes overwhelming emotions that people can experience in a split second. This meme has resonated widely because it reflects the duality of human emotions, showing both joy and sorrow in such a short span of time. It's a poignant reminder that life is full of contrasts, and we often experience a range of feelings simultaneously."
"Stepping aside, I let him pass, and he pulls up short at what’s on the television screen. Conan is",enthusiastically fucking a witch in a cave. We both clear our throats and look up at the ceiling instead.,38,"Conan is intently watching, his eyes wide with surprise as the scene unfolds. It appears to be some kind of breaking news, but the audio is muted. He stands there for a moment, processing the information, before turning to me with a puzzled expression, clearly wondering what I know that he doesn't."
"He adjusts his posture on the sofa, turning slightly to face me. Oh, right. He came here to","ask me for help. I sit up, too, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. Focus, Anna.",37,"He adjusts his posture on the sofa, turning slightly to face me. Oh, right. He came here to discuss the project deadline, but his eyes betray a deeper concern. There's something else weighing on his mind, and I can't help but wonder if it has something to do with the recent office gossip. As he fidgets with his tie, I decide to give him a moment, letting him gather his thoughts before diving into whatever it is he needs to say."
"“I knew what Jake ordered for lunch and what kinds of stupid movies would make him laugh, and I could predict all his pickup lines","at parties, but we didn’t ever, like, sit down and do backstory. He didn’t even mention he had a brother until he suggested I marry you.”",51,"Of course, this didn't mean I approved of his behavior, but I understood him better. I knew the things that made him tick, the things that would get under his skin, and the things that would make him feel at ease. It was a mix of familiarity and frustration, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. Jake was a complex person, and I was the one who got to see the full picture, flaws and all."
"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house. All basketball shorts, all the time. You drove a Honda! West, you’re incognito rich!","No wonder Jake never told me anything about his family! I would have made him pay for Jersey Mike’s every fucking time! Wait. Why did you need to live on campus? If you’re the grandson of the founder of Weston’s, you could probably buy an entire apartment building on Sunset.”",100,"West, you’re incognito rich! It’s like you’ve been living a secret life, and I’m just now catching on. Your taste in cars has always been impeccable, but this? This is a whole new level. I can’t stop thinking about how you managed to keep this under wraps. Did you really just buy a Honda Civic? It’s like you’re playing a part in some elaborate prank. But then again, you’ve always had this mysterious side. Maybe this is just another chapter in your story. I’m still trying to process it all. It’s like you’ve been living two lives, and I’ve been the oblivious one. I need to know more. What’s the real story behind this sudden transformation? Are you planning your next big move? Or is this just a temporary phase? I’m curious, West. Very curious."
"That lands in a puddle of silence, and it hits me after a couple of seconds filled only",with the sound of Conan kicking someone’s ass on TV that West expects me to catch his meaning.,36,"That lands in a puddle of silence, and it hits me after a couple of seconds filled only with the distant rumble of thunder. The world seems to pause, and for a moment, I feel completely alone, as if the silence is a physical presence. It's in these quiet moments that I often reflect on the fleeting nature of sound and the profound impact of stillness. Sometimes, it feels like the universe holds its breath, waiting for something to break the silence, but other times, it's as if the silence itself is speaking, though in a language we are yet to learn."
“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation. The rest of my family was disappointed that,"I didn’t let them throw me a big wedding, but I guess they weren’t all that surprised. I’ve always been private.”",42,"“I couldn’t tell them the truth. They wouldn’t have understood. Jake, on the other hand, was always the one who could see past the surface. He knew the risks, the sacrifices, and the reasons behind my silence. The rest of my family, well, they just wanted answers they couldn’t handle. It was a burden I carried alone, and I’m not sure I could bear it if they knew the whole truth.” He pauses, his voice heavy with emotion. “Jake was the only one who truly understood.”"
"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”",52,"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually, you're not as bad as I thought. But you really need a shower and some sleep,” he says, trying to hide his smirk. I feel my face flush with embarrassment, and I glance down at my clothes, realizing they are indeed in a state of disarray. His words hang in the air, and I can feel the weight of his judgment, even though it's not as harsh as I expected. I nod, acknowledging the truth in his observation, and silently vow to myself to address this issue as soon as possible. The conversation lingers in the room, filled with an unspoken understanding that we both need to work on our personal hygiene."
"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs. I’d always been fascinated with the perfect beauty mark just above her lip. Unfortunately, right now she looks like","she’s fallen out of a tree and crawled through a field of tangly briers to get back to her apartment. This is probably the closest I’ve ever seen to her natural hair color because the pink has grown out a good inch, leaving a stripe of brown at her roots. Her makeup is, I presume, from yesterday; shadows of mascara carve dark circles beneath her eyes. Despite the old makeup and frazzled appearance, there’s still something striking about her. Her eyes are enormous and bright, framed with dark lashes, her steady gaze entirely without artifice.",189,"Unfortunately, right now she looks like she's been through a warzone. Her usually impeccable makeup is smudged, her hair a tangled mess, and her clothes are rumpled beyond repair. Yet, there's a certain intensity in her gaze that I've never seen before. It's as if the weight of the situation has finally settled on her shoulders, and she's ready to face whatever comes next. Her eyes, those enormous brown eyes, seem to hold the world in them, and for a moment, I feel like I'm looking into the soul of someone I barely know. The Muppet, or should I say, the human in a Muppet suit, stands beside her, its eyes wide with a mix of confusion and determination. We're a mismatched pair, but in this moment, we're a team. The plan is simple yet risky: we need to get out of here undetected, and we need to do it fast. The clock is ticking, and every second feels like an eternity. As we huddle together, plotting our next move, I can't help but wonder how we ended up in this bizarre predicament. It's a story that would have seemed impossible just a few hours ago, but here we are, in the middle of it, improvising and adapting as we go. The journey has taken an unexpected turn, and now we're both on the same page, ready to face whatever comes next."
"Though I am nearly certain her mind has wandered to something other than the topic at hand, I let her stare at the wall",a little longer so I can stare at her and reconcile this version of Anna with the one I lived with for two years.,48,"I allow her a moment to gather her thoughts, understanding that sometimes silence can be more revealing than words. The tension in the room grows as the minutes pass, each one stretching into an eternity. I wonder if she is lost in a memory or perhaps contemplating something far more complex than the mundane conversation we were having. Whatever it is, I know it is not my place to pry, so I remain patient, waiting for her to return to the present. It is in these quiet moments that true connections are often forged, not in the chaos of words."
"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity. Anna was reasonably tidy and paid her half of the rent when it was due, but she’d never struck me as the organized, driven, premed type. The one time we talked about it, she","said something about medicine being the most palatable of the “real job” options, but she seemed overwhelmed a lot, studying late into the night and painting to decompress in what little free time she had. That she ultimately switched her major to fine art makes a certain amount of sense, but I want to punch myself for not realizing she wasn’t studying medicine at all anymore.",132,"Anna explained that she was more of a last-minute planner, someone who preferred to focus on the present rather than worry about the future. She had always been more of a free spirit, valuing spontaneity and adventure over rigid schedules and plans. Anna had a way of making the most of each day, finding joy in the unexpected. Her approach to life was refreshing, and I found myself admiring her carefree attitude. Despite our differences, we grew closer over time, our shared space becoming a sanctuary where we could both be ourselves. There were moments when we would sit together, talking late into the night about everything and nothing, and those moments felt like they were more precious than any shared goal or plan. As time went on, I realized that the kinship we shared wasn't just about proximity but about understanding and acceptance. Anna and I may not have been the same person, but we complemented each other in ways that made our cohabitation not just bearable but enjoyable. Looking back, I can see that our relationship was built on more than just practicality; it was a bond forged in the quiet moments of shared space and shared experiences."
"Anna squints at me. “You said ‘small,’ but I think you meant","‘private.’ Your sister is getting married on a private island, isn’t she?”",24,"Anna squints at me. “You said ‘small,’ but I think you meant something more substantial, don’t you think? Your eyes give you away, Anna. I’ve known you long enough to see through your little games.” Anna sighs, her shoulders slumping slightly, realizing I’ve caught her in her own lie."
"“Yes.” I work to not let my gaze do another sweep of her apartment. I’ve never been to Pulau Jingga, but my mom has been sending me info that I’ve mostly ignored for months. I know the basic idea—a luxury resort and conservation area set in the Indonesian archipelago—and it’s about","as far from this dark, cramped living room as I can imagine. Right now, I need Anna to believe she can do this. Yes, she may be at rock bottom, but I need her to think she is just one fairy godmother moment away from sliding gracefully into the world she’s imagining.",103,"She’s been talking about it for years, how the pristine beaches and lush jungles are a paradise untouched by time. I’ve always been skeptical, but now, standing here in her apartment, surrounded by photos and maps, I can’t help but feel a twinge of envy. The way she describes it, it sounds like a dream come true. I’ve never been much for vacations, but maybe it’s time to step out of my comfort zone. I could use a break from the monotony of city life. I decide to look at the information again, this time with a different perspective. Maybe it’s not just another luxury resort; maybe it’s an opportunity to reconnect with nature and myself. I make a mental note to talk to her about it, to see if she’s planning anything soon. Who knows, maybe I’ll finally get to experience the magic of Pulau Jingga for myself."
"Anna looks down at herself and I follow her attention to the front of her shirt, where a Froot Loop adheres to the cotton over her left breast.",She plucks it off and pops it into her mouth. “Why not just find someone who can pretend to be me and who knows how to behave around societay?”,57,"Anna's cheeks flush with embarrassment as she tries to discreetly remove the colorful cereal piece. I quickly look away, feeling the awkwardness of the moment. We both know this isn't the first time such an incident has occurred, but it still catches us off guard. The silence stretches as we both try to think of something to say, anything to break the tension. Finally, Anna clears her throat and says, ""Guess I should have watched where I was going."" I nod, offering a small, understanding smile, relieved when she doesn't seem too upset."
“I have the one of you and Jake hiking the Hills in a frame in my living room. It,"looks enough like me from the back.” I pause, scratching my jaw. “And… I’ve had a few others digitally photoshopped.”",39,"I have the one of you and Jake hiking the Hills in a frame in my living room. It's a cherished memory that brings back fond recollections of the adventure we shared, capturing the spirit of camaraderie and the beauty of nature that surrounded us during that unforgettable journey."
"“That it’s small, upturned. She described it as ‘the nose Jenny Nelson",wanted and didn’t get.’ She’d notice if it was someone else’s nose.”,24,"described it as 'the nose that always seemed to be sniffing for trouble,' with a mischievous glint in her eye, as if she were sharing a secret only she understood."
"I don’t love the implication that I don’t work, that I’m trying to breeze through life on my inheritance, but I understand why she sees it that way. The truth behind everything isn’t important right now, and if this goes the way I hope it","will, this will be an easy twelve days together and then we’ll never have to see each other again. “Anna, are you available to do this? Please. I will pay all your expenses. I will even give you some money if you need to buy clothes.”",91,"I hope it does. Life is a series of small victories and moments of clarity. Sometimes, we need to accept that others see us through a different lens, and that's okay. What matters is how we choose to respond. If I can show her that I'm not just living off my inheritance but actively contributing, then maybe we can find a middle ground. The world is full of misunderstandings, and it's up to us to bridge those gaps. In the meantime, I'll continue to prove myself, not just to her, but to myself as well. Every step forward, no matter how small, is a step towards understanding and growth. "
"Anna points at me again. “Okay, I see that look, and so",let me ask: what manner of clothes are required on this trip?”,24,"Anna points at me again. “Okay, I see that look, and so I know you're about to argue. But this time, I won't let you. We need to find a solution together, not just pick sides.” I sigh, realizing she's right, and we begin to discuss the issue calmly."
"“No, no, no.” Anna sits up and runs her fingers under her eyes, clearing away much of the mascara there. She pulls her ponytail free and reties it. Both actions do wonders for how chaotic she looks.",“This is much more demanding. I’ll have to act. I’ll have to learn about everyone I’ll be meeting. I’ll have to manage your complete lack of humor. I’ll have to hobnob. This is an entirely new skill set.”,75,"Anna takes a deep breath, trying to steady her nerves. The room feels too small, the walls closing in as her thoughts race. She stands up, pacing back and forth, her mind replaying the conversation that led to this moment. She had been so sure, so confident, but now doubt creeps in. She needs to talk to someone, anyone, but the thought of facing her friends or family fills her with dread. She decides to take a walk, hoping the fresh air will clear her head. As she steps outside, the cool evening air hits her, and she feels a little calmer. The stars above seem to offer a quiet comfort, a reminder that even in the darkest moments, there is always light."
"“Babe, babe,” she says, cupping my cheeks. “There is",no downside here. Are you kidding? This is life-altering good.”,19,"""no need to carry this burden alone. We're in this together, okay? Let's face it step by step."""
"“Insurance,” she says. “These people insure everything.” While I continue to stare at the rock, she returns to the list and laughs. “Get","this: ‘Anna, please feel free to schedule any hair, nails, spa, or grooming appointments and use the card to pay for those.’ ”",46,"“Get serious,” she says, rolling her eyes. “Life’s too short to worry about what could go wrong. But hey, if it makes you feel better, go ahead and check the policy details. Who knows, maybe it’ll make you laugh too.” I finally tear my gaze away from the rock and join her laughter, realizing that sometimes, it’s the little things that bring us together, even if they’re just about insurance policies."
There are two kinds of airport people: those who like to get to the,"airport three hours before departure to sit within eyesight of the gate, and Anna Green.",29,"In a hurry and those who enjoy the experience, savoring every moment from check-in to boarding. The latter often find themselves engrossed in people-watching or exploring the shops, relishing the brief respite from the outside world."
"My eyes go wide, meeting Anna’s just as she stumbles,","ankle twisting awkwardly on the skinny, murder-sharp heel of her shoe.",21,"Her gaze flickers with a mix of fear and something else I can't quite place, causing my heart to race as we both lose our balance."
"I can’t entirely refute this idea. I’ve been out of my parents’ circle long enough to understand how disorienting it will be for Anna to step into it. She bends her fingers, turning her hand and looking at them from another angle. Frankly, they’re so pointy I’m worried she’ll scratch her own cornea.","“But I asked the woman at the spa what the really rich ladies get, and she said it’s this fancy hard gel. I think I get the urge to have fake nails. I feel like a badass.” Twisting in her seat, she deposits her purse in my lap. “Watch this for a sec?”",106,"I can’t entirely refute this idea. I’ve been out of my parents’ circle long enough to understand how disorienting it will be for Anna to step into it. She bends her fingers, turning her hand and looking at them from another angle. Frankly, they’re so pointy I’m worried she’ll scratch her own cornea. As she contemplates the changes ahead, Anna finds herself reflecting on her past, wondering how much of her old life she should bring with her. The thought of navigating the expectations and dynamics of her parents’ social sphere fills her with a mix of excitement and trepidation. She knows that every interaction will be scrutinized, and she’ll have to be on her best behavior. Yet, there’s also a part of her that’s eager to prove herself, to show that she’s capable of fitting in without losing her sense of self. Anna’s mind races with these thoughts as she prepares for the inevitable challenges that lie ahead. She hopes that her resilience and adaptability will serve her well in this new environment."
"“Okay, okay. I’m on my way.” Slinging her purse over my shoulder and collecting our carry-ons, I make my way to the ladies’ room, where","Anna peeks out into the hallway. As soon as she sees me, she reaches forward, grabbing the front of my shirt and jerking me inside.",50,"Upon entering, I find a mirror that reflects my anxious expression. I splash cold water on my face, hoping to regain some composure before stepping out. The restroom is unusually quiet, which only adds to my unease. As I finish, I notice a faint stain on the paper towel dispenser. My heart skips a beat, and I quickly grab a few towels, trying to ignore the unsettling feeling that something isn't right. Exiting the restroom, I double-check that I have everything before heading to the gate, where the flight attendant greets me with a warm smile, putting my mind at ease for a moment. Little do I know, the day holds more surprises than I could have imagined."
Apologizing over her shoulder to a woman washing her hands at the sink—“I swear we,aren’t going to have sex in here!”—Anna pulls me into a stall and flips the lock.,31,"Apologizing over her shoulder to a woman washing her hands at the sink—“I swear we didn't mean to cause any trouble. It's just that we were in a rush and didn't notice you there. Please don't be upset,” Sarah said hurriedly, her voice tinged with genuine remorse. The woman, whose back was still turned, paused for a moment before continuing her task, seemingly unperturbed by the apology."
"“I need you there,” I clarify. “And I need you to look like you’re comfortable with me, comfortable","being married to me. But I don’t need you to pretend to not be Anna Green, Muppet-human hybrid.”",36,"“and confident,” I add with a determined tone. “We’re a team, and we’ve got this. So, put on a smile, act natural, and let’s make this work. I’ve got your back, and you’ve got mine.” She nods slowly, her eyes reflecting a mix of determination and uncertainty, but she takes a deep breath and gives me a small, reassuring smile. Together, we walk into the room, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead."
Her eyes go round. “The fam—” Anna shakes her head. “You know what? Never mind. Of,"course you have a plane.” Straightening, she asks, “So, why was I in Cambodia? Photography? Fabric design?”",33,"output>Her eyes widen in confusion, and she trails off, clearly struggling to find the right words. Anna, sensing her discomfort, gently takes her hand. ""Let's just forget about it for now, okay?"" Anna's voice is soft, reassuring. ""We can talk about it later if you want."" Anna's words seem to calm her slightly, and she nods, though her expression remains troubled."
"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay. When she got home, she made a point of thanking me for the help. Apparently, the trip itself was fine, but the highlight for her had been flying on an airplane.",102,"Anna was so excited about her trip that she barely slept the night before. We spent the morning exploring the city, and she couldn't stop taking pictures of everything. After a few days, she decided to try her hand at hiking, and we set off for a trail near the mountains. Despite her initial struggles with the travel website, she was determined to handle everything on her own. We spent hours hiking, and by the time we reached the summit, she was glowing with pride. That evening, we celebrated her accomplishment with dinner at a local restaurant. Anna's trip was a turning point for her, and she returned home with a newfound confidence. Ever since, she's been eager to travel more, and we often plan trips together. It's amazing how a little help can make such a big difference in someone's life."
"“That person deserves jail time.” She brings the glass to her lips, taking a tiny","sip. “Mmmmm.” Anna turns to meet my eyes. “And by the way, it’s anything over ninety-nine.”",31,"She takes another sip, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. The tension is palpable, and she knows that her words could escalate the situation. However, she believes firmly in the justice system and thinks that jail time is a necessary consequence for those who break the law."
Anna’s smiling at me like I amuse her. “I meant more as,"in, is she nice? Does she have hobbies or a favorite band?”",24,"Anna’s smiling at me like I amuse her. “I meant more as a friend, someone to share laughter with, not just someone to entertain.” Her eyes sparkled with genuine warmth, making me feel both flattered and a little uneasy about the nature of our relationship."
“Oh. Power. I like it. I’m not sure how to wield,"it, but I like it. And you have three siblings, including Jake?”",23,"It with grace, but I know I can make people listen. Power can be intoxicating, and I’m not sure I can resist its pull completely. Yet, I also understand the responsibility that comes with it, and I vow to use it wisely."
I feel her looking at me for a quiet beat. “I think you’re joking. I’m,not sure.” Anna downs the rest of her prosecco. “A hint of danger. I like it.”,31,"I feel her looking at me for a quiet beat. “I think you’re joking. I’m not, she says softly, her eyes locking with mine. There’s something earnest in her tone that catches me off guard, and for a moment, I can’t respond."
“Is now a good time to discuss how you looked at me like I was lobotomized when I thought,your name was West Weston and yet a man named Kellan McKellan actually exists and will soon be your relative?”,39,"“Is now a good time to discuss how you looked at me like I was lobotomized when I thought you were just being polite? I mean, I wasn’t sure if you were mocking me or if it was just a case of severe miscommunication. Either way, it left me feeling rather exposed and confused. Can we talk about this without it feeling like I’m under interrogation?”"
I can feel her staring a beat longer before she turns away to hand her,"empty flute to the flight attendant. Anna returns her focus to me. “Okay, what else?”",30,"I can feel her staring a beat longer before she turns away to hand me the letter, her eyes lingering just a moment too long, as if she's trying to convey something unspoken but ultimately choosing silence instead."
"West looks at me with unmasked concern. “Please, Anna,” he","says gently like I’m very, very naive. “Just follow my lead.”",21,"Anna, I need you to know that I'm here for you, no matter what. Let's just take things one step at a time, okay? We can face this together, I promise."

Her eyes, a striking emerald green, seem to hold a world of secrets. The room, softly lit by a single candle, casts long shadows that dance on the walls, creating an atmosphere of mystery. Janet’s presence fills the space with an air of quiet confidence, as if she knows something the rest of the world does not. The tension in the room grows palpable, each breath held in anticipation of what might come next."
"“Anna, darling!” The woman I need to remember is my actual mother-in-law air-kisses","both of my cheeks. “My goodness, in person your hair is so pink!”",26,"Anna, darling!” The woman I need to remember is my actual mother-in-law air-kisses me warmly, her eyes twinkling with affection, as if to say, ""It's all about family, dear."" I smile, trying to recall the details of our last encounter, but the memory remains elusive, like a fleeting dream just out of reach."
“Okay. Well. That’s nice.” Janet pats his hand in hers. “Don’t forget about the cocktail party at six.”,"She leans in, kissing her son’s cheek again. “Can’t wait to get some time with you all to myself.”",37,"He nods, a faint smile tugging at his lips. ""I won't. But I need to finish this report first."" Janet gives his hand another reassuring squeeze. ""It'll be quick, and you can relax afterward. The boss is expecting a polished presentation, so make sure you're on time."" He nods again, feeling a bit more at ease knowing she's got his back."
"“Anna,” he says finally, very gently. “The truth is, you could just smile on my arm and be okay. I promise",I’m not trying to leave you unprepared. The sad reality is that my parents are unlikely to pay you much attention regardless.”,43,"Anna, I know it’s hard, but trust me, just a small smile can make a difference. You don’t have to carry all the weight alone. I’m here for you, and together, we’ll get through this. Please, Anna, give me this chance to help you heal.” Anna looked at him, her eyes filled with unshed tears, and slowly, a tiny smile tugged at the corners of her lips. It wasn’t much, but it was a start. He held her hand tighter, relieved and hopeful that things might begin to change for the better."
"I walk back inside, realizing I’d been so focused on the sleeping situation, I haven’t properly flailed over the sheer bliss that is our bungalow. In fact, I’m pretty sure the only thing in here I could afford is the roll of eco-friendly toilet paper I can clearly see from where I stand. And even that looks pretty fancy. There’s a real Isle Esme feel to the decor (if you know, you know), with carved bamboo, recycled teak, jellyfish light fixtures, and a massive canopy bed. Wide windows and the open entrance","bring the outside in and allow me to glance over at West, who seems to be mid–mental spiral, managing to look even more morose than he did thirty seconds ago. Isle Esme vibes or not, there will be no headboard breaking here. Near one wall is a chest with our names stamped into the top, a pair of towels folded to look like stingrays, and a jar of chocolate chip cookies that are probably made with the world’s most expensive chocolate but hey, Gede did say it was all-inclusive. I help myself.",184,"I find myself drawn to the windows, the salty breeze whispering through the open entrance, carrying with it the scent of the ocean. The view from here is nothing short of breathtaking, a perfect blend of nature and modern design. The wide windows not only let in the light but also offer a panoramic view of the horizon, where the sky meets the sea. The open entrance, a deliberate design choice, invites the outdoors in, creating a seamless transition between the interior and exterior. The carved bamboo and recycled teak add a touch of rustic charm, while the jellyfish light fixtures, a nod to the island's marine life, bring a whimsical element to the space. The massive canopy bed, a focal point of the room, is a cozy haven, perfect for those lazy afternoons when you just want to relax and soak in the ambiance. The decor, a testament to Isle Esme's unique blend of nature and art, is a reflection of the island's spirit. Every detail, from the eco-friendly toilet paper to the light fixtures, speaks to sustainability and elegance. It's a place where you can truly unwind, where the stresses of the outside world seem to melt away. As I stand here, I can't help but feel a sense of contentment, a reminder of why I chose this bungalow in the first place. It's not just a place to stay; it's a sanctuary, a haven of peace and tranquility."
"I have a lot of faults. I drink milk from the carton, I never make my bed, I am slothful, and sometimes I’ll just set the new roll of toilet paper on top of the empty roll instead of changing it. A monster. I am also gluttonous: I don’t want a few peanut M&M’s; I want the entire bag. Why have one","margarita when three is such a nice, satisfying number? Everyone knows why! And that’s why I go back for seconds right now. But karma is Team West: his eyes open just as I glance again. They widen and he reaches down to cup his Goddamn before he turns, facing away. “Anna,” he says, his voice spluttering in the water’s spray. “Are you peeking?”",125,"I can't help it, I just can't stop. I know it's not healthy, but the taste of those M&Ms is irresistible. I've tried so many times to change, but the temptation is too strong. I've read articles, watched videos, and even tried to set strict rules for myself, but nothing seems to work. It's like I'm trapped in a cycle that I can't break. I wonder if it's just a phase, or if I'm truly destined to be this way. Sometimes I feel like I'm failing at life, but then I remind myself that everyone has their flaws. Maybe I'm just one of those people who struggles with self-control. I try to focus on the positive things, like the fact that I'm still here, still trying. I guess I'll just have to keep fighting the good fight, one peanut M&M at a time."
"He was right. Focus was always a challenge, and apparently it didn’t end with baseball. I came here with the knowledge that all I need to do is limp this lie to September, and I can finally exhale, but we’re less than an hour into this farce and I’m already off track:","I peeked, and it was a huge mistake. It’s not that I didn’t know Anna was attractive all those years ago; it’s that we barely saw each other, and I was so driven to finish my degree and never have to work for my father again that Anna—attractive or not—was easy to overlook.",105,"It's been a whirlwind of conflicting emotions and thoughts. The pressure to maintain this facade is immense, and I find myself constantly second-guessing my every move. Friends and colleagues have noticed the change in me, but I've managed to keep the truth hidden behind a mask of professionalism. However, the strain is starting to show, and I fear it might be too late to salvage the situation. The weight of this lie feels like it's suffocating me, and I can't shake the feeling that I'm losing control. Every moment feels like a battle, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up. The September deadline seems so far away, yet it feels like an eternity. I need to find a way to regain my focus and regain my composure, but the road ahead looks daunting. Maybe it's time to reassess my priorities and figure out what truly matters in this chaos."
"I smile at her and cup a hand to the side of my mouth, whispering, “It’s okay.” Truthfully, I love that she thinks about this. I love that she’s","horrified by that price. I’m horrified, too. It’s a good thing Anna isn’t my real wife; I would constantly worry that my proximity to this world would destroy her.",58,"I love that she’s so thoughtful, that she cares deeply about the little things that matter. It’s one of the reasons I admire her so much. Her mind is always working, processing, and finding solutions. It’s refreshing in a world that often moves too fast. I find myself wanting to be just like her, to think as deeply and care as much as she does. It’s a quality that makes her unique, and I cherish every moment we share, knowing that she’s always thinking about what’s next, what’s better, and how we can both grow."
"Her hand falls away. “That’s Anna motherfucking Green-hyphen-Weston to you.” She lets out a happy squeal, jogging over",to hug him as well as she can without spilling the shots on either of them. “You look amazing!”,37,"Her hand falls away. “That’s Anna motherfucking Green-hyphen-Weston to you.” She lets out a happy squeal, jogging over, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “I’ve been waiting for this moment all week! We’re going to have so much fun catching up, Anna.” Anna raises an eyebrow, a mix of surprise and amusement on her face, as she shakes her head. “You haven’t changed a bit, Sarah. Still full of energy and excitement.” The two friends exchange a warm hug, their laughter filling the air as they prepare to spend the afternoon catching up on everything they’ve missed."
"The two of them walk back to me, and Jake looks over",his shoulder to make sure we’re alone. “How are my favorite liars doing?”,25,"The two of them walk back to me, and Jake looks over, his expression a mix of concern and something else I can't quite place. He speaks softly, ""We need to talk,"" and I feel a knot form in my stomach, knowing whatever he has to say won't be easy."
"“Describe her,” Jake says, leaning in, his hair falling over his forehead in thick waves. There are moments where I see the man he could someday be: playful but grounded, flirtatious but loyal,",clever but humble. I want to know that version of him and worry he will forever be frozen in this caricature of the irresponsible youngest son as long as he works for Weston’s.,66,"She stood before us, her eyes a deep, mysterious blue, framed by long lashes that seemed to hold untold stories. Her smile was warm, yet there was an underlying intensity about her, as if she carried the weight of the world on her shoulders. I could sense the complexity within her, a blend of vulnerability and strength that drew me in. Jake's gaze never wavered, and in that moment, I felt a connection, a promise of something deeper. There was a quiet confidence about her, a quiet power that made me wonder what she had already endured and what she was capable of. As we continued to talk, I realized that she was more than just the sum of her features; she was a mystery waiting to be unraveled, and I found myself eager to learn more about her."
"Anna barks out a bawdy laugh before covering her mouth with her hand. “Sorry,” she says",from behind it. The diamond on her ring flashes in the flickering light. “That surprised me.”,32,"Anna barks out a bawdy laugh before covering her mouth with her hand. “Sorry,” she says, glancing around to see if anyone heard. The bar was quiet, and the only sound was the distant hum of the jukebox. She felt a flush rise in her cheeks, hoping no one had noticed. ""I didn't mean to be rude,"" Anna adds, her voice softer now, as she surveys the small crowd of patrons. Most were engrossed in their own conversations or games, oblivious to her outburst."
"“Good. Anna has no poker face. How’s she taking everything?” he asks, and","I know what he’s referring to: the planes, the island, the money. The family.",27,"She's holding it together, but I can see the strain in her eyes. We need to find a way to ease her burden, even if it's just for a little while."
"With a laugh, Jake rids himself of our shot glasses and snags two tumblers of whiskey off a passing tray. He","hands me one before lifting his own. “Well, whatever. To the final few months: if you pull this off, you’re free.”",42,"With a grin, he fills both glasses to the brim, clinks them together, and raises his, saying, ""To unexpected friends and the night that never ends."" They down their drinks in one, laughing as the amber liquid burns their throats, already feeling the warmth spread through their bodies, signaling the start of a night filled with stories, laughter, and maybe even a few secrets shared under the glow of the dimly lit bar."
"He looks past me at the party, and I take stock of how he seems from the outside. He’s got Dad’s dark wavy hair and light brown eyes, but like me, he got his height from our mother, who","is almost six feet tall without the benefit of heels. Jake is good-looking, charismatic, and always up for some (mostly) good-hearted shit-stirring. My stomach sours with guilt for what I’m keeping from him. What I could potentially fuck up.",78,"She was tall and graceful, standing out in any crowd. His resemblance to her was striking, with the same slender build and a quiet confidence that spoke of her nurturing yet strong presence. The combination of their features in him created a unique blend of warmth and strength. As I watch him interact with the group, I can't help but feel a mix of pride and nostalgia. It's clear that he carries a piece of both of them in his every move, a testament to the love and legacy they shared. His laughter, so much like hers, fills the room, and I find myself lost in memories of the two of them together, knowing that their bond continues to shape him in ways I can only imagine."
"She laughs, angling her wrist so the diamond catches the lights overhead. “I know, right? For six months I just walked",around taking photos where I had to casually point at something with my left hand.” She scans the crowd. “Where’s Anna?”,42,"She laughs, angling her wrist so the diamond catches the lights overhead. “I know, right? For six months I just walked around thinking this was some kind of crazy dream. Every morning, I'd wake up and pinch myself, afraid it was all just a hallucination. Now here I am, and it still feels surreal. Friends and family still can't believe it either. They keep asking me how I did it, if I had any secret tricks up my sleeve. But the truth is, there were no tricks—just hard work and a lot of luck. It's been an incredible journey, and I wouldn't trade it for anything."""
"I look up, too, searching the room again. She’s over by the dance floor, jumping around with little Nixon’s hands in hers.","The band is playing covers of pop hits, and Anna is entirely in her element: laughing, dancing, blissfully forgetting where she is.",44,"I watch them for a moment, feeling a strange mix of amusement and nostalgia. Little Nixon, with his infectious energy, seems to light up the entire space. His mother dances with such grace, her laughter echoing through the room. It’s a scene that feels both familiar and foreign, as if I’m witnessing a moment from a different life. I wonder if they realize how much joy they bring to those around them."
"Janet smiles tightly. “Exactly.” Welp, there it is. She turns her",laser focus to me. “How do your professors react to your hair?”,23,"She turns her gaze away, feeling the weight of unspoken words pressing down on her. A moment passes before she can muster the courage to speak again, her voice barely above a whisper."
"“It’s unlikely,” I say, and every head turns my way. “Everyone needs seven to nine hours of sleep a night. You can try to convince yourself","you don’t need more, but over time you’ll build up a sleep debt. It probably affects your mental and physical health more than you realize, Alex.”",52,"that you need less, but your body will eventually rebel. Lack of sleep affects your mood, memory, and decision-making abilities. It can lead to weight gain, weakened immune system, and even increase the risk of chronic diseases. I’ve seen it happen to friends and family, and it’s not pretty. If you're chronically sleep-deprived, you might find yourself struggling to focus, feeling irritable, and making poor choices. Prioritizing sleep is one of the best things you can do for your health and well-being. Trust me, it’s worth the effort to get those recommended hours of rest each night.”"
"“And what’s the deal with Alex? Based on the way you talked about him on the plane, I expected you","two to jovially poke at each other, but that was like dragging a proverbial sword through each other with your eyeballs.”",41,"And what’s the deal with Alex? Based on the way you talked about him on the plane, I expected you to be more critical. Instead, your tone suggested a level of admiration or even affection that I didn’t anticipate. Did something happen that I missed? Sometimes, people can surprise us, and I guess Alex must have made quite an impression on you during that flight."
"“Well, mostly because he’s an asshole. But also, kids growing up in a normal family get to be themselves, whoever that may be. But in families like","ours, one where everything basically revolves around keeping a single person happy—my dad—everybody has a role. My therapist used to refer to Alex as a flying monkey.”",54,"Well, mostly because he’s an asshole. But also, kids growing up in a normal family get to be themselves, whoever that may be. But in families like his, they often feel the need to conform to unrealistic expectations, stifling their true potential. It’s not just about having a parent who’s an asshole; it’s about the environment that’s created around them. These kids are constantly judged, their every move scrutinized, which can lead to severe emotional and psychological damage. It’s a cycle that’s hard to break, and one that shouldn’t be taken lightly. Society often fails to recognize the impact of such environments, focusing instead on the behavior of the parents rather than the well-being of the children."
"“Like in The Wizard of Oz? Alex was my dad’s willing henchman, doing everything he said, kissing his ass, stirring up","shit just to turn us all in, then sit back and look like the good guy. He’s never grown out of it.”",43,"In the background, Alex never questioned orders, always eager to please. This dynamic created an uneasy tension between my father and me, as I grew up witnessing his subservience. Despite the facade of loyalty, I couldn't help but wonder what Alex truly thought behind closed doors. The more I observed their relationship, the clearer it became that my father's power was built on manipulation, and Alex was just another pawn in his game. It wasn't until much later that I realized the true cost of such blind obedience."
"“What does that mean?” I ask. If Alex knew enough, he wouldn’t try",to take West down? Is this about the mysterious loophole in the trust?,26,"“What does that mean?” I ask. If Alex knew enough, he wouldn’t try to guess the full extent of the situation. He’s always been too confident in his knowledge, thinking he can handle anything. But this time, it seems like he’s out of his depth, and I’m not sure how to help him without exposing myself."
West sits on the bench and pulls a shoe off. I set my clutch down on a shelf in the open closet. “I’m thinking Alex will take a keen,"interest in exactly how happy we seem.” I narrow my eyes, staring into the distance. “West… this assignment is no longer just ‘show up and wear a wedding ring.’ ”",59,"West's face contorts as he inspects the shoe's sole. I hear a soft knock on the door, and without looking up, I call out, 'Come in.' The door creaks open, and Alex steps in, his eyes immediately drawn to West's action. ""What's up?"" Alex asks, curiosity evident. West shrugs, still focused on the shoe. ""Just making sure this thing isn't about to fall apart,"" West replies, his voice casual but his grip tightening slightly. Alex nods, understanding the need for attention to detail, especially when it comes to footwear. ""You know, you two should really consider getting a proper repair shop to look at it,"" Alex suggests, glancing between West and the shoe. ""Yeah, maybe,"" West agrees, finally looking up, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. ""So, what's on your mind?"" Alex presses, sensing there's more to the conversation than meets the eye. West hesitates, then leans in slightly, lowering his voice. ""I was just thinking about how much things have changed since... you know."" Alex nods slowly, his expression thoughtful. ""Yeah, time does that to us,"" he says softly, his gaze drifting to the open closet where my clutch still sits on the shelf."
"I woke up around two this morning to find Anna wrapped around me. Despite what she’d told me about sleeping in one place all night, at some point she’d migrated across the massive bed to throw a","leg over my hip, send an arm over my torso, and press her face to my neck. It took monumental focus to not go hard against her inner thigh, and because of it, I’d slept like absolute shit.",75,"I woke up around two this morning to find Anna wrapped around me. Despite what she’d told me about sleeping in one place all night, at some point she’d migrated across the massive bed to throw a blanket over me. Her hair was tousled, and her eyes fluttered open, meeting mine with a sleepy smile. ""Sorry,"" she murmured, ""I just got so warm."" I chuckled, pulling her closer. The night was still young, and there was no rush to part ways. We spent the next few hours talking, laughing, and simply enjoying each other's company. It was one of those rare moments where time seemed to stand still, and nothing else mattered. As the early morning light crept in, we lay there, content and at peace, knowing that sometimes, the unexpected can lead to the most beautiful moments."
"My father’s question penetrates my fog, finally, and I straighten, pushing my salt-water-and-sweat damp hair off my forehead. The sun has only","just come up and it’s already sweltering. I bet Anna has already kicked off the blankets, letting the air cool her overheated skin.",45,"The sun has only just begun to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the rugged coastline. My father's piercing gaze holds me steady, his eyes searching for something deeper than the surface. I swallow hard, gathering my thoughts, realizing that this moment, this connection, has been years in the making. The salty breeze stirs again, carrying with it the scent of the ocean and the promise of a new beginning. I nod, breaking the silence, and together we set off towards the distant lighthouse, the path ahead as uncertain as the sea itself."
"“JESUS CHRIST,” I BLURT, the second I turn at the corner of our bridge and step onto the deck of our bungalow. Anna is curled up in","a papasan, with a sketch pad in her seemingly bare lap. Honestly, from the first glimpse I get, I think she might be naked. “What are you doing?”",55,"""Anna is curled up in the corner, her eyes wide with fear.

'Anna, it's okay,' I whisper, trying to soothe her. 'I'm here now, and we'll get through this together.' She clings to me, her body trembling. It's moments like these that remind me of the fragility of life and the importance of being present."" "
"Anna follows me. She’s loosely made the bed, but it still looks rumpled.",Slept in. By both of us. I squeeze my eyes shut against the reminder.,27,"Anna follows me. She’s loosely made the bed, but it still looks rumpled. I can’t help but wonder what thoughts are swirling inside her head as she moves around the room, her eyes avoiding mine. There’s an unspoken tension between us, a silence that feels heavier than the words we’re both too afraid to say."
I sigh. I know she’s right but I’m already sleep-deprived and functioning on less than full brain power today.,I’m not sure I’m capable of dealing with both my family and Anna in this suit after last night. “Fine.”,39,"I glance at the clock, realizing it's barely noon, yet I feel as if I've been running a marathon. My eyes sting, and I can barely keep my head up. Deciding to take a short nap, I hope it will help me regain some focus, but deep down, I know it's just a temporary fix for an ongoing issue."
“Oh!” Anna jerks a hand over her eyes. “Your Goddamn! Right there!” She turns away. “Sorry! I just—spaced,out—on your—God. And you’re not even harrrrrrr—Fuck me.” She coughs. “Okay. I’ll just meet you down at the restaurant.”,37,"She mutters under her breath, ""This is why I don't cuss."" Anna takes a deep breath, trying to compose herself. The silence in the room feels heavy, and she can hear her own heart pounding in her ears. She knows she shouldn't have lost her temper like that, but the frustration has been building for days. ""Look, I'm sorry,"" she says softly, turning back to face the person she was arguing with. ""I just... I need a moment."" The other person nods slowly, clearly still processing what just happened."
"I can feel Anna’s eyes on the side of my face. This is how it always starts with Alex, and whatever suspicion he has about my marriage will only make it","worse. I know it’s irrational and a remnant of how we used to one-up each other for our dad’s approval when we were kids, but I want to beat him. At everything.",63,"I can feel Anna’s eyes on the side of my face. This is how it always starts with Alex, and whatever suspicion he has about my marriage will only make it worse. I try to smile, but inside, my heart is racing. I know this is coming, yet every time, I’m caught off guard. The silence between us stretches, and I can almost hear the gears turning in his mind. I wish I could just tell him the truth, but I can’t. Not yet. The tension builds, and I can feel the weight of his unspoken words pressing down on me. I need to find a way out of this, before it’s too late."
"Anna slams the brakes on this line of thinking by putting an arm around my back, resting the other hand on my stomach","and gently scratching, just like she unconsciously did last night. I work to suppress a shiver. Turning, she looks at him over her shoulder.",47,"Anna slams the brakes on this line of thinking by putting an arm around my back, resting the other hand on my stomach.

We sit in silence for a moment, the weight of her words settling between us. It's not the first time she's had to shield me from the darker aspects of our reality, and I know she'll be there when I need to talk. "

Every glance, every pause, feels charged with something deeper, something I can’t quite put my finger on. As we walk towards the gym, I can’t help but wonder if this morning’s workout is just a distraction from the storm brewing between us."

I reach out quickly, steadying her, but she winces in pain. ""Are you alright?"" I ask, concerned. She nods, though her face betrays a hint of discomfort. ""Just a sprain, I think,"" she says, trying to smile. We begin to row away from the shore, the water lapping softly against the sides of the boat. The evening air is cool, and the stars are beginning to twinkle above us. As we navigate the calm waters, I can't help but notice the way she winces slightly with each movement, and I wonder how much she's really hiding from me."

The morning drags on endlessly, and all I want is to be back home, curled up with a good book. He's probably out doing something exciting, while I'm stuck here, pretending to listen to someone drone on about last night's party. It's not fair, but then again, life rarely is. I take a deep breath and force a smile, hoping this will soon be over so I can finally enjoy my day."
