There’re fourteen of us, and the thirteen that aren’t me are all nodding enthusiastically.",53,completion
"The truth, though, is quite the opposite. I hated school at first sight—with the direct consequence that school hated the sullen, listless child that I was right back. In the first grade, I refused to learn how to write my name, even though Hannah is only three letters repeated twice. In junior high, I set a school record for the highest number of consecutive detention days—what happens when","you decide to take a stand and not do homework for any of your classes because they are too boring, too difficult, too useless, or all of the above. Until the end of my sophomore year, I couldn’t wait to graduate and leave all of school behind: the books, the teachers, the grades, the cliques. Everything. I didn’t really have a plan for after, except for leaving now behind.",137,"The completion of my journey in junior high was a testament to my rebellious spirit. I set a school record for the highest number of consecutive detention days, a record that still stands today. What happens when you refuse to conform? You find yourself in a constant battle with authority. I remember the countless afternoons spent in the principal's office, not for misbehaving, but for simply existing. My teachers saw me as a lost cause, a child who would never amount to anything. But somewhere deep within, I knew there was more to me than the sullen, listless child they saw. High school brought a new chapter, one where I began to find my voice. I joined clubs, started writing, and slowly, I began to see the world through a different lens. It wasn't easy, and there were still days when I questioned everything, but I learned to embrace my uniqueness. By the time I graduated, I had transformed from a reluctant student to a confident individual, ready to take on the world. This journey taught me that it's not about conforming to others' expectations, but about finding your own path, no matter how unconventional it may seem."
"“It’s like space is your whole personality,” the girl I casually hooked up with during most of my sophomore year of undergrad told me. It was after I explained that no, thank you, I wasn’t interested in going out for coffee to meet her friends because of a lecture on","Kalpana Chawla I was planning to attend. “Do you have any other interests?” she asked. I threw her a quick “Nope,” waved good-bye, and wasn’t too surprised when, the following week, she didn’t reply to my offer to meet up. After all, I clearly couldn’t give her what she wanted.",100,"It was after I explained that no, thank you, I wasn’t interested in going out for coffee to meet her friends because of a lecture on astrophysics that evening. She nodded, her eyes reflecting a mix of disappointment and curiosity. ""I get it,"" she said, her voice softening. ""Space is more than just a place; it's a state of mind. It's where you find yourself, where you lose yourself, and where you discover the universe within you."" I smiled, feeling a bit awkward but also intrigued by her perspective. ""I guess I just need to find my own way,"" I replied. ""Maybe we can still talk about it sometime, without the coffee,"" she suggested with a playful grin. I nodded, feeling a strange sense of connection, even though our paths were about to diverge. That conversation stayed with me, reminding me that sometimes, the most profound connections happen in the most unexpected moments."
"“Yeah, I’m not sure.” She shrugs and continues to make her way through a Tupperware of broccoli, an apple, and approximately two fucktons of Cheez-Its. “I don’t really know much about him. His parents divorced, then people in my family had arguments and stopped talking to each other. There was a lot of","prime Floyd dysfunction happening, so I haven’t actually spoken to him in years. But I heard from one of my other cousins that he was working on that thing that landed on Mars back when we were in high school. It was called something like . . . Contingency, or Carpentry, or Crudity—”",106,"She sighs, her eyes drifting to the half-empty Tupperware, the contents a stark contrast to the conversation they've just had. ""It's just... everything feels so... I don't know. Like, I can't even remember the last time we had a real conversation. It's like we're both just going through the motions."" She pauses, her voice trailing off as she picks up an unopened Cheez-It, staring at it as if it holds the answer to all her questions. ""Maybe it's time to stop pretending everything's okay. Maybe it's time to just... let go."" She takes a deep breath, the weight of her words settling heavily in the air. ""I mean, I care about him, but... I don't know if I can keep doing this. It's exhausting, you know? It's like I'm always trying to figure out what's wrong, but I never seem to get it right."" She shakes her head, her eyes filling with unshed tears. ""I just want things to be simple again, you know? But I guess that's not how life works, is it?"""
"“I think so. Do the dates add up? Maybe it was some kind of summer internship? But honestly, it might just be Floyd family lore. I have an aunt who insists that we’re related to","the Finnish royals, and according to Wikipedia there are no Finnish royals. So.” She shrugs and pops another handful of Cheez-Its in her mouth. “Would you like me to ask around, though? For the assignment?”",70,"My aunt, Margaret, claims our ancestors settled in Floyd territory centuries ago. She’s always been quite passionate about genealogy, and her research has led her to uncover some fascinating connections. While I remain skeptical, her enthusiasm is infectious. It’s not impossible that there’s some truth to it, especially given how widespread family stories can be. Still, without concrete evidence, it’s hard to say for certain. Maybe one day, with more digging, we’ll find the proof she’s always been so sure of. Until then, it remains just another intriguing chapter in our family history."
"“By the way, I sent you my cousin-or-something’s contact info a while ago,” Mara tells me one night. We’re at the",cheapest grad bar we’ve been able to find. She’s on her second Midori sour of the night. “Did you get it?”,42,"Mara continues, ""You never mentioned if you were interested in connecting. Should I follow up?""

"He frowns, as if momentarily blanking on Mara’s name. “Ah, yes.” He nods. Only once. “Apparently,” he adds, which makes me laugh. He waits for me to take a seat","across from him before folding back in his chair. I notice that he doesn’t hold out his hand, nor does he smile. Interesting. “Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.”",61,"He waits for me to take a seat, his eyes lingering on mine for a moment longer than necessary.

I smile, feeling a mix of nostalgia and curiosity. ""It has been, hasn't it?"" I reply, my voice equally gentle. ""I've been meaning to catch up, but life has a way of getting in the way, doesn't it?"" He nods, a small crease forming between his brows. ""Indeed, it does. But I'm glad you're here now. There's much we need to discuss."" As I settle into the chair, I can't help but wonder what secrets lie hidden beneath his calm exterior."
"“Officially: unclear. But I’m fairly sure my brother made CDs of it. Sent them to local TV stations and whatnot.” He gestures vaguely, and his forearm is dusted with freckles and pale-red hair. I want to grab his wrist, hold it in front","of my eyes, study it at my leisure.

His eyes, a deep shade of blue, seem to hold a story I can't quite grasp. I find myself lost in their depths, wondering about the CDs and the mystery behind them. Could they have been a form of protest? Or perhaps something more personal, a way to express feelings that couldn't be spoken aloud? The room is quiet, save for the faint hum of the refrigerator in the background. We sit there, the weight of the unsaid hanging between us, until finally, he breaks the silence. ""You know, it's not every day you meet someone who's as curious about my brother as you are."" I nod, lost for words, as the conversation shifts to safer topics, but the CDs linger in the air, a puzzle waiting to be solved."
"The section is in C++. Which happens to be the very first language I taught myself back in high school, when every single Google search for “Skills + Necessary + NASA” led to the sad result of “Programming.” Python came after. Then SQL. Then HAL/S. For each language, I started out convinced that chewing on","glass would surely be preferable. Then, at some point along the way, I began thinking in terms of functions, variables, conditional loops. A little after that, reading code became a bit like inspecting the label on the back of the conditioner bottle while showering: not particularly fun, but overall easy. I do have some talents, apparently.",111,"The completion of each language felt like a new frontier, a challenge that pushed me to think differently. C++ was about mastering pointers and memory management, a world where every line of code had to be precise and efficient. Python, on the other hand, was a breath of fresh air, with its simplicity and readability. It allowed me to focus on the logic rather than the syntax. SQL was a bit more abstract, dealing with data retrieval and manipulation in a relational database. HAL/S, used in early space missions, was a fascinating glimpse into the past, a language that required a deep understanding of hardware and system architecture. Each language taught me something new, and while I may have started out convinced that one language was the answer to all my problems, I soon realized that versatility and adaptability were key. The journey of learning programming languages is ongoing, and I continue to explore new languages and frameworks, always eager to expand my horizons and tackle new challenges."
"My heart rate picks up. Warmth twists in my lower stomach. I lean forward with a smile, feeling like I’m finally in my element. This, this, is what I know best. Depending on how busy I am with school, or work, or binge-watching K-dramas,","I do this about once a week. Which amounts to quite a bit of practice. “Maybe I could come to your place?” I say, finding the sweet spot between comically suggestive and Let’s get together to play Cards Against Humanity. “And you could show me?”",89,"Depending on how busy I am with school, or work, or binge-watching K-dramas, I might find myself daydreaming about the next opportunity to immerse myself in this feeling. It's a rare moment of pure joy, where everything else fades away. I lose track of time, and the world around me becomes a blur. It's not just about the physical sensation; it's the connection, the understanding, the shared experience that makes it so special. Whether it's a conversation, a shared laugh, or a moment of deep listening, these are the moments that remind me why I do what I do. And when I'm back in the real world, I carry that warmth with me, knowing that no matter how busy or chaotic things get, there's always a place for this kind of connection."
"It sends me right over the edge. Into something that’s nothing like my usual, run-of-the-mill orgasm. Those tend to start like small fractures and then slowly, gradually deepen into something lovely and relaxing. Those are fun, good fun, but this . . . This pleasure is sudden and violent. It splinters into me like a wonderful, terrible explosion, new and frightening and fantastic,","and it goes on and on, as though every heart-stopping, delicious second of it is being squeezed out of me.

I can feel the waves of euphoria crashing over me, each one more powerful than the last. My heart races, my mind spins, and for a moment, I lose all sense of time and place. It’s as if the universe has shifted, and I’m the only one left standing. This is not just pleasure; it’s a revelation, a transformation. I’ve never felt so alive, so connected to something greater than myself. It’s a reminder of the raw, untamed power that exists within us all, waiting to be unleashed. And though it’s terrifying, it’s also exhilarating. I want more, but I’m not sure I’m ready for what comes next."
"The last words I hear from him are, “It was really good to meet you, Hannah.” I think I should say it back, but there’s an unfamiliar weight in my chest, and I can’t quite bring myself to do it. So I","make do with a small smile and a halfhearted wave. I stuff my hands in my pockets while my body is still thrumming with what I left behind, and wander slowly back to the Caltech campus, thinking about red hair and missed opportunities.",85,"So I simply nod, a small gesture that feels inadequate to convey anything meaningful. The silence between us stretches, heavy and unyielding, as if time itself has paused. I want to fill it with words, anything to break the tension, but the right ones elude me. His eyes, warm and inviting just moments ago, now seem distant, as if he’s already walking away in his mind. I force a smile, hoping it looks genuine, but inside, I’m questioning everything—our connection, my feelings, and whether I’ve misread the entire situation. The moment feels irrevocably altered, and I’m left wondering if I’ve missed my chance to say what needed to be said."
"The following day, when Mara asks me about my meeting with her cousin-or-something, I say only “Uneventful,” and I don’t even know why. I don’t like lying, and I like lying to someone","who’s rapidly becoming a friend even less, but I can’t make myself say any more than that.

I wonder if she’s noticed my unease, or if she’s simply curious. Either way, I feel a strange mix of relief and guilt. Relief that I don’t have to explain, guilt for not being honest. I know I should tell her the truth, but the thought of it terrifies me. What if she doesn’t believe me? What if she thinks I’m hiding something? These thoughts whirl in my mind as I prepare for our next encounter, unsure of how to navigate this new, uncomfortable dynamic between us."
"“Avalanche danger is set at the highest level, and it’s not safe for anyone to come out to get me,” I add, speaking right into the satphone’s mic. Repeating what Dr. Merel, my team leader, told me a few hours ago, during my last communication with AMASE, NASA’s home base here in Norway. It was right before he","reminded me that I’d been the one to choose this. That I’d known what the risks of my mission were, and I still decided to undertake it. That the path to space exploration is full of pain and self-sacrifice. That it was my fault for falling in an icy hole in the ground and spraining my fucking ankle.",116,"It was right before he disconnected the call, leaving me in a state of unease. The silence that followed was deafening, and I found myself staring at the satphone, wondering if I had made the right decision in staying behind. The avalanche danger was real, and yet, there was a part of me that felt compelled to continue my research, to push the boundaries of what was known about the Arctic environment. Dr. Merel had warned me about the risks, but the allure of discovering something groundbreaking was hard to resist. I knew I had to prioritize safety, but the thought of what might be out there, waiting to be uncovered, lingered in the back of my mind. As I sat there, the cold wind biting at my face, I made a silent promise to myself: if I survived this, I would come back, and this time, I would do it safely."
“Yeah. Kind of. It devolved into a . . .”,"Into what? Us almost fucking on NASA property? You wish, Hannah.",21,"It devolved into a heated debate that neither side seemed willing to let go, each clinging to their own version of events as if it were the only truth."

"It is. AMASE is the shit, and the selection process to take part in an expedition was brutal, to the point that I’m not quite sure how I made it in. Probably sheer luck: Dr. Merel, one of the expedition leaders, was looking","for someone with experience in gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Which I happen to have, due to some side projects my Ph.D. advisor foisted upon me. At the time, I aggressively bitched and moaned my way through them. In hindsight, I feel a bit guilty.",86,"Dr. Merel, one of the expedition leaders, was looking for someone with a unique skill set, and I had managed to impress them with my background in astrogeology. The journey was going to take us to the farthest reaches of the solar system, where no human had ever set foot. The challenges were immense, from navigating through asteroid belts to dealing with the harsh conditions of space. Despite the risks, I felt an overwhelming sense of excitement and purpose. This expedition wasn't just about exploration; it was about pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and endurance. Every day brought new challenges, but also new discoveries. The camaraderie among the crew was unbreakable, and we supported each other through every obstacle. When we finally reached our destination, the sight was indescribable. It was a moment of pure triumph, a testament to the power of human ambition and determination."

Karl's eyes widen, and he leans forward, his curiosity piqued. ""Is everything alright?"" he presses, his tone now tinged with concern. I hesitate, unsure of how much to share, but the weight of the day presses down on me, making it harder to keep my thoughts to myself. Finally, I decide to confide in him, knowing that sometimes, unburdening oneself can be a relief."

"As we all know, in early 2010, the rover Spirit became stuck in a sand trap, was unable to reorient its solar panels toward the sun, and froze to death as a consequence of its lack of power. Something very similar happened eight years later to Opportunity, which went into hibernation when a maelstrom blocked sunlight and prevented it from recharging its","batteries. Obviously, the risk of losing control of rovers because of extreme weather events is high. To address this, Dr. Arroyo has designed a promising internal system that is less likely to fail in the case of unpredictable meteorological situations. She proposes to build a model and test its efficacy on the next expedition at the Arctic Mars Analog in Svalbard (AMASE)—",124,"As the dust storm intensified, Opportunity's batteries drained rapidly, leaving the rover in a state of hibernation for nearly two months. During this time, engineers at NASA worked tirelessly to devise a plan to free the rover. When the storm finally subsided, Opportunity emerged from its slumber, much to the delight of the scientific community. However, the ordeal had taken its toll on the aging rover. Its mobility had been severely compromised, and it was clear that Opportunity's days of exploring the Martian surface were numbered. Despite this, the rover continued to send valuable data back to Earth, providing scientists with unprecedented insights into the Red Planet's geology and climate. In June 2018, Opportunity's signal was lost, and attempts to reestablish contact were unsuccessful. The rover had exceeded all expectations, operating far beyond its designed lifespan. Its legacy would live on, inspiring future missions to Mars and serving as a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance in the face of adversity."
"Dr. Arroyo’s project is a brilliant addition to NASA’s current roster, and it should be approved for further","study. Dr. Arroyo’s vitae is impressive, and she has accumulated enough experience to carry out the proposed work—",36,"development. The interdisciplinary approach Dr. Arroyo has taken integrates advanced robotics with astrobiology, offering unprecedented insights into extraterrestrial life forms.

He believes that every moment spent not working is a moment wasted, and his office is always filled with the sound of his keyboard clicking away. I've seen him stay up all night crunching numbers, and he expects the same dedication from his team. While some might find his approach intimidating, I admire his focus. He pushes us to excel, and his relentless pursuit of excellence has inspired many of us to strive harder.

His presence will certainly bring a new perspective to our research, and I'm eager to see what insights he'll contribute. We've always worked well together, and I have no doubt that this collaboration will yield some groundbreaking results."
"The problems start when he looks up and notices me. He stops exactly two steps below, which should put him at a disadvantage but, depressingly, unfairly, tragically, doesn’t.

He opens his mouth to speak, but I cut him off. ""No, don't. Just don't. I need time to think. Alone."" I turn and walk away, leaving him standing there, his eyes following me as I disappear into the night."
"I cling to him. He lets me sob for long moments we cannot afford, pressing me against him with no air between us, until I can feel his heartbeat through the thick layers","of our clothes. Then he mumbles “Fucking Merel” with barely restrained fury, and I think that it would be so easy to blame things on Merel, but the truth is, it’s all my fault.",67,"I cling to him. He lets me sob for long moments we cannot afford, pressing me against him with no air between us, until I can feel his heartbeat through the thick layers of his shirt. His warmth is a lifeline in the cold, a promise that I am not alone in this storm. Each beat is a reminder that he is here, steady and strong, even when the world around us crumbles. We stay like that for what feels like an eternity, the silence between us filled only by the rhythm of his heart and the soft sobs that still escape me. Time loses its meaning in those moments, and I find a strange comfort in the vulnerability we share. It is a fragile bond, but one that holds us together in ways words ever could."
"“Who is M— Oh. Yeah. For the most part. Mom isn’t very fond of the Floyd side of the family. Though I’m sure he’s the black sheep by their standards, too.","I wasn’t really allowed to spend time with him, so . . .” He shakes his head, as if to change the topic. “Here. It’s not much, but you should eat.”",62,"“Who is M— Oh. Yeah. For the most part. Mom isn’t very fond of the Floyd side of the family. Though I’m sure he’s the black sheep by their standards, too. It’s a complicated relationship, filled with misunderstandings and old grudges. They’ve never really gotten along, and it’s hard to say who’s at fault. But I guess that’s what happens when families have their own set of rules and expectations. Despite the tension, there’s still a bond there, and I try to bridge the gap whenever I can. It’s not easy, but it’s important to me.”"
"“No, no, shh.” His arms tighten around me, and I realize that I am, in","fact, crying. “You are not an asshole, Hannah. And you are the opposite of incompetent.”",30,"output>His arms tighten around me, and I realize that I am, in this moment, not alone. The weight of the world seems to lift just a little, as if by his embrace, all the fears and uncertainties that had been gnawing at me find a temporary respite. I lean into him, feeling the warmth of his body, a comforting presence that grounds me in the present. It's a small moment, but it feels like a lifeline in a world that often feels overwhelming."
"“Because of the intrinsic danger of a project like yours. For the past few months, I tried to get this project stopped in about ten different ways. Personal meetings, emails, appeals—I","tried it all. And even the people who agreed with me that it was too dangerous would not step in to prevent it. So no, you’re not the asshole, Hannah. They are.”",63,"Finally, I even resorted to anonymous tips and public petitions, but each time, the response was the same: the project was deemed too important to halt. Despite the mounting evidence of risk, the decision-makers remained resolute. I realized that only a public outcry could sway them, so I organized a series of protests and awareness campaigns. The media began to take notice, and slowly, the public pressure started to build. It was a long and arduous process, but in the end, the project was put on hold. The lessons learned from this experience have shaped my approach to advocacy and activism."
"“Oh.” I swallow. “Merel was supposed to come for backup. But he wasn’t feeling well. I offered to wait for him, but he said we’d be losing valuable days of data and that I should just go","alone, and I . . .” I squeeze my fingers around the material of Ian’s shirt. “I went. And then, when I called in for help, he told me that the weather was turning, and . . .”",75,"“Alright,” I say, though my heart sinks. “I understand. But what if something goes wrong? What if he needs me?” I ask, my voice trembling slightly. “We can’t just leave him like this. What if he’s in a worse condition than he let on?” I argue, feeling a mix of frustration and worry. “Look, I’ll go, but I’m not leaving without a plan. We need to check in on him regularly and make sure he’s okay. If he’s really that sick, we can’t afford to lose any more time. But I’m not walking away without knowing he’s safe,” I insist, trying to sound more confident than I feel. “Alright, fine,” he concedes, clearly not happy with the arrangement. “But if anything happens, you’re on your own.” I nod, grabbing my gear and heading out, hoping against hope that this decision is the right one."
"He shrugs. “I figured you might want to talk through your near-death experience with someone, so",I decided to tell Mara what happened. I did not expect her to come in person.”,32,"He shrugs. “I figured you might want to talk through your near-death experience with someone, so I made myself available. Sometimes, sharing such moments helps put things into perspective.” He pauses, reflecting on the gravity of the situation. “It’s not every day you come face to face with mortality, and it’s important to process it.”"
"“I was going to. Once I felt less whiny. And—whatever.” I roll my eyes. Wow,",I’m mature. “How did you go from not remembering Mara’s name to having her number?”,30,"Wow, life is just one big rollercoaster, isn't it? Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever find my groove. Every day feels like a new challenge, and I'm not sure if I'm cut out for this constant struggle. But then again, maybe that's what keeps me going. Who knows, maybe one day I'll look back and laugh at all the drama. Until then, I'll just keep pushing forward, one step at a time."
"“Well, still.” She shrugs. “I promise I don’t have anything against",you personally. I’m just not generally a fan of the Floyd family.”,23,"“Well, still.” She shrugs. “I promise I don’t have anything against people choosing their own paths, but sometimes it’s not that simple.” She pauses, reflecting on past experiences that shaped her views. “We all have our reasons, and maybe understanding them is the first step towards true acceptance.”"
"“Yes,” Mara agrees. “Are you going to break my blood relative’s heart?","Don’t get me wrong, I’d still side with you. Hos before bros.”",24,"“I can’t do that, not without a fight. But know this, if you push me too far, I won’t hesitate to defend what’s mine,” Mara’s voice hardens, leaving no room for ambiguity."
"“I guess we’ll see. I’m not sure he would want to date,” I say, staring at Sadie’s Froot Loops. The ensuing silence drags on so long,",I’m forced to look up. She and Mara are staring at me like I just announced that I’m quitting my job to take up macramé full-time. “What?”,53,"The tension in the room becomes almost unbearable. Sadie finally breaks the silence, her voice barely above a whisper, asking if everything is alright. I nod, though inside I'm anything but sure. The conversation lingers on the surface, but I can feel the unspoken questions hanging between us like a thick fog. It's clear that this moment has shifted something between us, though I'm not sure what exactly. All I know is that the Froot Loops in front of me now seem more like a symbol of the distance that's growing between us than a meal."
"“Considering that he saved your life, contacted Great-Aunt Delphina, and put up two dudes he’s never seen",before so their girlfriends could hang out with you . . . I think maybe he does.”,34,"before even knowing their names, it's clear that he's a man of extraordinary character and integrity. This spontaneous act of kindness and generosity has not only strengthened your family bonds but also left a lasting impression on those around him. It's moments like these that remind us of the true meaning of heroism and the profound impact one person can have on another's life."
"“Actually, they fixed the elevator. And this new cast is easy to walk on. So, no need. But you . . .” You can","do this, Hannah. Come on. You just survived polar bears thanks to this guy. You can say the words. “You could come up anyway.”",48,"You can see the concern etched on your face, and I know you're worried about something. Maybe it's the stairs, or perhaps you're just not feeling up to the challenge. Whatever it is, I'm here to support you. Let's take things one step at a time, and if you need a break, we'll take it together. Your safety and comfort are my top priorities."
"“Right.” He sighs and bites into his lower lip. “Hannah, if that changes. If you ever find yourself able to believe that someone could care about you that much. And","if you wanted to actually . . . have dinner with that someone.” He lets out a laugh. “Well . . . Please, consider me. You know where to find me.”",61,"“I’ll be here, waiting,” she whispers, her voice trembling with unshed tears. “No matter how long it takes, I won’t give up on you. You deserve to be loved, Hannah. You deserve to feel cherished and valued. If you ever find that person, remember, I’ll always be the one who believed in you first.” He nods slowly, his eyes glistening with unspoken emotions. “Alright,” he finally says, “let’s go home.” As they walk side by side, the weight of their shared silence hangs heavily between them, a testament to the journey they still have to undertake together."
“Hannah.” He gives me a skeptical look. “You have two friends who,dropped everything to be with you. And I assume sex wasn’t involved.”,24,"""Hannah."" He gives me a skeptical look. ""You have two friends who claim they saw you at the café, but I know you were with me the whole time. How can I trust what you're telling me?"" I sigh, realizing I might have to explain my day in more detail than I'd hoped."
"“Hannah.” He unbuckles his seat belt and angles himself toward me, so that I have no choice but to look him in the eyes. He looks earnest and nearly offended. “I have thought about what happened in my office every day for the past five years. You offered to go down on me, and I just . . . embarrassed myself, and it should be the most mortifying memory I have, but for some reason it’s turned into the axis every fantasy of mine spins around, and”—he reaches up to pinch the bridge of his nose—“I want to fuck you.","Obviously. Always have. I just don’t want to fuck you once. I want to do it a lot. For a long time. I want you to come to me for sex, but also want you to come to me when you need help with your taxes and moving your furniture. I want fucking to be only one of the million things I do for you, and I want to be—” He stops. Seems to collect himself and straightens, as if to give me space. To give us space. “I’m sorry. I don’t want to crowd you. You can . . .”",201,"Embarrassment and shame are strange bedfellows, aren't they? I can't help but feel a mix of pity and something else—curiosity, maybe? I've replayed that moment in my mind countless times, trying to understand why it has such a hold on him. It's not just the physical act that haunts him; it's the vulnerability, the rawness of it all. He's always been so composed, so together, that this moment of weakness must feel like a betrayal of everything he stands for. "
"He laughs, low and beautiful and a little rueful. And after looking at me like no","one else ever has before, what he says is, “Yes, Hannah. It is a yes on dinner.”",33,"He laughs, low and beautiful and a little rueful. And after looking at me like no one ever had, his eyes held a secret, a quiet sorrow that seemed to echo through the room, as if the laughter was just a mask for something far more profound and unspoken."
"“Um, I could make us a . . .” I scratch my head, studying the contents of my open fridge. Okay, so it’s full. The problem is, it’s full exclusively of stuff that needs to be cooked, chopped, baked, prepared. Stuff that’s healthy and doesn’t taste","particularly good. I am now 93 percent sure that Mara was the one who went shopping, because no one else would dare to impose broccoli on me. “How does one even . . . I could boil the broccoli, I guess? In a pot? With water?”",92,"truthfully amazing. I sigh, closing the fridge door. ""You know what? Let's just order in. Maybe some pizza or sushi—something that doesn't require me to break a sweat in the kitchen."" I grab my phone and start scrolling through delivery apps. ""Ah, perfect timing, I see a special on margherita pizza tonight. It's a deal I can't refuse."" I place the order, feeling a wave of relief. Cooking has never been my forte, and tonight, I'm all about convenience. As I wait for the food to arrive, I decide to clean up the kitchen a bit, at least the visible mess. It's not like I'll be cooking anything anytime soon, so why not? The timer on the oven beeps, and I realize it's been there for hours. I had planned to bake a loaf of bread, but now, it seems like a distant memory. Life is full of these moments—plans that get sidetracked by the simplest things. And that's okay. Sometimes, it's the unexpected that brings us the most joy."
“Hannah.” His forehead touches mine. He laughs against my mouth. “Dinner is . . . it’s symbolic. A,"metaphor. If you tell me that you’re willing to see where things go, I believe you, and we can—”",37,"It's a celebration of our bond, a reminder that no matter what life throws at us, we face it together. His laughter warms my lips, and I can't help but smile. Dinner is more than just food; it's a shared experience that strengthens our connection. Every bite, every sip, is a testament to the love we share. "
"He is hot and huge. Closing his eyes, arching his neck before looking at me again with a half-warning, half-pleading expression. He finds me sitting","on his knees, his cock spasming in my grip as I lean over. “Hannah,” he says, even deeper than usual. “What are you . . .”",51,"He finds me sitting quietly, my heart pounding in my chest. The intensity of his presence makes the air around us seem almost electric. His eyes, dark and intense, hold a mixture of emotions that I can barely decipher. I shift uncomfortably, unsure of what to say or do. The silence between us feels heavy, like it's stretching out, waiting for someone to break it. Finally, he speaks, his voice low and gravelly, filled with a mix of frustration and something else I can't quite place. ""What are you doing here?"" His words are sharp, cutting through the tension that has built between us."
“Or maybe it’s the Vastitas Borealis.” He’s barely intelligible. Doing those little thrusts that are designed more to open me up than to,"fuck me properly, and yet we’re both this close to orgasm. It’s a little scary. “The oceans that used to fill it, Hannah.”",46,"He mumbles something incoherent, his breath hot against my skin. ""Don't know, maybe,"" he stutters, his voice cracking. The coldness of the room seems to seep into my bones, making the warmth between us feel fragile. Every movement feels like a gamble, a risk we're both willing to take in the dark, unspoken understanding that this could be our last chance."
