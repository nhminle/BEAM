"“I’m Adela,” she said. She had an eye patch and blond",hair the same color and texture as hay. “I’m the Vice Secretary.”,23,"She introduced herself with a smile, her free hand resting on the hilt of a small dagger sheathed at her waist, a relic from her days as a pirate."
“The Wellness team think their adjustment will be negatively impacted if they’re,"held on the wards any longer,” said Adela, dry as a filing system.",25,The Wellness team think their adjustment will be negatively impacted if they’re not given the resources and support they need to succeed.

"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.",103,"Graham found himself grappling with the overwhelming sense of disorientation that came with returning to the nineteenth century. The world around him seemed to move at a different pace, and the people he encountered were strangers in a way he couldn’t quite comprehend. He missed the simplicity of the twenty-first century, where technology and communication had made the world feel smaller. Yet, he also felt a deep sense of responsibility to help those who had been left behind, to ensure that their experiences were not forgotten. The other expats, though few in number, had formed a tight-knit community, and Graham knew that he had to find a way to bridge the gap between their worlds. As he walked through the streets of London, he couldn’t help but wonder what the future held for them all. Would they ever find a way to return home, or would they be forever stranded in this unfamiliar time? The questions weighed heavily on his mind, and he knew that the answers would not come easily."
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties. As it was, he was thirty-seven years old and had not experienced crinolines, A Tale of Two Cities, or the enfranchisement of the working classes.",53,"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into the early 20th century. The neighborhood had changed much since then, with newer developments surrounding the modest structure. Despite its age, the house retained much of its original charm, though the paint was peeling and the windows needed replacing. The garden, once a source of pride for its previous occupants, was now overgrown, a testament to the passage of time and the lack of care it had received. Yet, despite its imperfections, the house stood as a quiet sentinel, a relic of a bygone era, waiting for its next chapter."
“Mm. Beside your elbow is a white box with a handle. It’s a refrigerator—a,"fridge, we call it. Could you open the door and take out the milk, please?”",29,"It's a small portable one used for keeping drinks cold while you're on the go. Make sure not to overfill it; otherwise, it might not close properly. It's quite handy for picnics or tailgating at sports events."
"Gore was already fully dressed and sitting on the edge of the bath, smoking. The bottom of the bath",had a low-tide mark of cigarette ash and soap scum. Two cigarettes were crushed out in the soap dish.,38,"Gore was already fully dressed and sitting on the edge of the bath, smoking. The bottom of the bath was chipped, and water dripped quietly onto the tiles. He took a long drag on his cigarette, lost in thought, not noticing the small leak until the floor began to flood. With a sigh, he stood up, shaking his head at the inconvenience, and reached for a towel to dry off before addressing the mess."
"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale. A vile smell was seeping up from the floor.",39,"On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The house seemed to hum with the sound of his relentless pacing, each cigarette adding to the growing cloud of smoke. Despite the chaos, a sense of impending change was palpable, as if the very fabric of their routine was about to unravel. The repair crew arrived, but their efforts only seemed to delay the inevitable, leaving everyone wondering what forces were at play, pulling the threads of their lives so tightly."
"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant. Men in their right minds are","not usually overcome with a mania for pulling the plumbing apart. I suggested he might like to wash his hands at the sink downstairs, and I could, perhaps, call a plumber, and we could, potentially, take a constitutional walk on the nearby heath.",85,"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant. Men in their right minds are wary of change, and the transition from sail to steam was a radical shift. Gore, however, was a seasoned sailor who had seen the world in a way few others could. His knowledge of the sea was unparalleled, and he could navigate by the stars with ease. Yet, as the world moved forward, he found himself in a position where he had to adapt. The challenges of the new era were daunting, but Gore remained steadfast, believing that the old ways had their place. He was a man of his time, but also a man ahead of his time, always seeking to understand the world around him. In the end, Gore’s legacy was one of adaptability and respect for the past, even as the future beckoned with its promises and perils."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry. By the end of the first week he was visibly going bonkers with no one but me to talk to.",79,"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and he also had a deep passion for literature, often spending hours reading and writing poetry. His home was a veritable library, filled with rare editions and manuscripts that he had collected over the years. Gore’s friends spoke of him with admiration, noting his sharp wit and ability to engage in deep conversations on a wide range of topics. It was clear that he had lived a life rich in experiences and intellectual pursuits, leaving a lasting impression on all who knew him."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea. He told me stories as if he were trying to catch himself in amber. Just like my mother, though I didn’t tell him that.",105,"Gore's eyes would scan the bustling streets with a sense of disconnection, as if he were observing a foreign land. His thoughts often wandered to the simpler times when life was less complex, and the world moved at a slower pace. He would reminisce about the days when the air was cleaner, and the horizon was filled with the promise of a new dawn. Despite the technological advancements, Gore found himself longing for the past, where the essence of humanity was more tangible. He would sometimes wonder if the modern world had lost its soul in the pursuit of progress. His reflections were not mere nostalgia but a deep-seated yearning for a balance that seemed to have been lost. In his mind, he saw the world as a ship sailing through uncharted waters, and he was the lone passenger who had brought the map of the past with him. This map, however, was not enough to guide him through the present, and he found himself adrift, searching for a sense of belonging in a world that seemed to have forgotten its roots."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake. Another person’s unguardedness in that moment can be very useful, interpersonally, as long as you don’t soften. There is language I could use about this if I were the melodramatic type: behind enemy lines, for example, or double agent. My sister might use these terms, or she might call me a fraud.",119,"Icy silence filled the room as the truth dawned on him. His eyes widened in disbelief, and for a moment, I thought he might collapse. ""You've been lying to me?"" he whispered, his voice barely audible. I nodded, unable to speak. ""All this time, I thought I knew you,"" he said, his voice trembling. ""I trusted you."" The weight of his disappointment pressed down on me, and I felt the need to explain, to justify my actions. ""I didn't want to hurt you,"" I began, my voice cracking. ""I was scared, okay? I didn't know how to handle it."" His expression softened slightly, but the hurt was still there. ""You could have told me,"" he said softly. ""We could have worked through this together."" I sighed, feeling the exhaustion of the moment. ""I know. I'm sorry."" The silence stretched on, and I could feel the tension in the air. It was clear that things would never be the same between us. As he walked out of the room, I felt a pang of regret. I had lost a friend, and I wasn't sure if I could ever regain his trust. The weight of my actions settled heavily on my shoulders, and I knew I had to find a way to make things right, even if it was too late."
Gore lifts his hand. He’s left a smear on the table the color of tamarind flesh.,"There is a sour, steady pain in his palm that he briefly misunderstands as a taste.",32,"Gore pauses, his eyes scanning the room as if seeking an answer. The silence stretches, thick and heavy, until finally, he speaks, his voice low and deliberate. ""This is not what it seems,"" he says, his tone leaving no room for argument. The others exchange uneasy glances, unsure of how to respond to such an enigmatic statement."
"Gore considers the weight of the sack he’d carried, which had felt so meaningful. “Three partridges,”","he says, “and a boatswain gull too far off to hit. Nothing else. Not even tracks.”",32,"Gore realized with a start that the weight was not just from the birds but from the burden of the day. He had been walking through a forest, his mind occupied with thoughts of survival and the hunt. The sun was beginning to set, casting long shadows that danced around him. He felt a pang of homesickness, wondering if his family was worrying about him. The sack, now lighter, seemed to hold a different kind of weight, one that was more emotional than physical."

Trust me, and let’s make this happen.” Stanley’s eyes lock with his colleague’s, hoping to convey the gravity of the situation. The room falls silent as everyone processes his words, the weight of the task ahead becoming more apparent with each passing second."

Days later, the ship encountered another storm, this one more violent than the first, and they all knew it was only a matter of time before they too would face the same fate."
"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats. I was expecting he’d","go through a group therapy session, but Gore was in a sunny mood, so he must have been envisaging something closer to a salon.",47,"I was expecting he’d be greeted with a warm handshake and perhaps a shared story over coffee, but instead, the atmosphere was tense. Gore entered the room, his demeanor serious, and the conversation that followed was filled with guarded remarks and veiled references to recent events.

"“Complex,” said Adela. “Thanks for your input. Given their histories, mental trauma is to be anticipated.

"“We can’t risk the temporal repercussions,” said Adela. “They are supposed to be dead. As long as they’re here, it’s functionally as if they are dead in","their own time.

We need a plan, a way to ensure their continued absence without raising suspicion. It’s a challenge, but we’ve faced worse. We’ll find a solution, one that preserves our world’s stability and keeps the truth hidden from prying eyes."
"We’d arrived in the central lobby. Gore was standing in a shaft of sunlight, staring up",at the steel-and-glass ceiling. He looked dazzled into boyishness by the half sky of the building’s skull.,33,"We’d arrived in the central lobby. Gore was standing in a shaft of sunlight, staring up at the towering atrium ceiling, his expression a mix of contemplation and something else, perhaps fear or anticipation. The grandeur of the space seemed to amplify the tension in the air, as if the building itself held secrets waiting to be uncovered. We approached cautiously, unsure of what we might find next in this mysterious place."
"We went for lunch at a small bistro near the Ministry. Gore came from an era of service à la française, private dining rooms and putting everything into jelly. When I began to","explain, in tones of motherly patience, how twenty-first-century restaurants operated, he said, “I’ve eaten kangaroo on the uninhabited shores of the Albert River. I understand how a knife and fork work. Please sit down.”",67,"We began to question the rigid traditions of the past. The bistro, with its cozy ambiance and open kitchen, felt like a stark contrast to the formal dining experiences Gore had grown up with. As we sipped our coffee, I found myself reflecting on how much the world had changed, yet some old habits die hard. The chef, a young woman with a passion for innovation, was eager to share her vision for modern French cuisine. It was clear that despite the era's constraints, there was still room for creativity and progress. Over the course of the meal, we discussed the evolution of culinary arts and the importance of adapting to new trends while respecting the classics. The conversation flowed effortlessly, and by the time we finished, I felt a renewed appreciation for the fusion of old and new in every dish we had enjoyed."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house. I am looking forward to seeing what visions of sin this era has concocted for the humble tavern.”,53,"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to be fixed, but I wasn’t sure if he was just being polite. Over the next few weeks, I found out that he had his own agenda, and our friendship was more about mutual benefit than genuine connection. Despite that, I couldn’t help but admire his resourcefulness and the way he navigated complex situations. It was a lesson in survival, and I learned to be more cautious about who I trusted.”"
"Back at the house I was still struggling to think of as “home,” Gore shyly asked me if I would also “come for a drink.” He had done well, at lunch, to hide his deep embarrassment over my payment",of the bill (with a Ministry expense card); he was adjusting with gold-star alacrity in recognizing that it wouldn’t be a reputation-detonating act for a respectable woman to be seen in a public house in the company of bachelors.,78,"Back at the house, I was still struggling to think of as ""home,"" Gore shyly asked me if I would also ""come for a drink."" He had done well, at lunch, to hide his deep embarrassment over my payment. The atmosphere was tense, and I could feel the weight of unspoken words hanging between us. After a moment of hesitation, I accepted, hoping it would ease the awkwardness. As we sat down, the silence was palpable, but eventually, conversation flowed, albeit slowly. We talked about the weather, the news, and anything but the elephant in the room. It wasn't until much later that I realized how much courage it must have taken for Gore to extend that invitation. The drink turned out to be a small step towards bridging the gap between us, and I left feeling a bit more at ease, though the journey home felt longer than ever."
"I coughed at my half-pint. Ralph, a snide and etiolated former field agent, was my",least favorite bridge. He had somehow managed to get assigned the only young woman expat.,30,"I took a sip, the bitter taste lingering on my tongue as I glanced at Ralph. His smirk only deepened, reminding me of the countless missions where we barely escaped alive. ""Still think you're the man for the job?"" he taunted. I set the pint down, steeling myself for the inevitable reminder of my failures. ""Maybe,"" I replied, ""but you're not exactly a beacon of confidence yourself."" Ralph shrugged, his eyes glinting with a mix of amusement and malice. ""We both know who's been called back, don't we?"" His words hung in the air, a stark reminder of the shadow that had loomed over our careers."
“No. Apparently it was very awkward when Ralph came in here for a lunchtime gallon of merlot and spotted him. He’s part of Defence’s tracking,team. You know they don’t much like the fact that the Ministry is a separate institution. They thought the time-door ought to fall under their remit.”,51,"It turned out to be a colleague named Mark, who was visiting from another branch. Ralph was caught off guard, as he hadn't expected anyone to be in the office during lunch. The situation was made more awkward when Mark mentioned a recent project they were both involved in, which Ralph had forgotten all about. Ralph quickly tried to salvage the moment by offering Mark a glass of the merlot, which seemed to lighten the mood somewhat. From that day on, Ralph made sure to keep a closer eye on his schedule to avoid such embarrassing situations."

It was just a slip of the tongue, a term he used without thinking, unaware of its weight. I explained the impact such words can have, and he listened, though I could see he wasn't fully convinced. It's a conversation we need to have more often, about the power of language and its ability to either connect or divide us."
I choked. “Uh. We don’t use that word anymore. We just say,"‘Black.’ As an adjective. You would say, ‘She is a Black woman.’ ”",25,"I choked. “Uh. We don’t use that word anymore. We just say ‘person’ or ‘individual’ to be respectful. It’s important to choose our words carefully these days.” She nodded, clearly understanding the shift in language and culture."
"Graham used other words too, not wrong, exactly, but not right, like “your people,” or “your culture.” When I said, in a wincingly tight voice, that we had the same people and culture, he replied, mildly, “But I don’t think that we do.” Then came the image searches about Cambodia, on food and dress","and customs. I had to do those for him, in the early days, because he still didn’t know how, and the English-language internet was not on my side. Exotic, friendly, conservative, resilient. The way he couched his questions, too, was imperfect. I had to correct “ancestor” for “grandparent,” “sacred” for “polite,” “tribal leaders” for “farmers.”",109,"Graham’s words hung in the air like a heavy fog, each one a question mark, a challenge to everything I believed about identity and belonging. I had always thought that “people” and “culture” were terms that united us, not divided us, but Graham’s perspective was different. He seemed to see something I had never considered—something that made me question the very fabric of my own beliefs. The image searches about Cambodia were jarring, showing a world so far removed from my own that it felt like a different planet. The food, the dress, the way people interacted with each other—it was all so alien, yet so familiar. It made me realize that “people” and “culture” were not just about shared history or traditions, but about the way we see the world, the values we hold dear, and the stories we tell ourselves. In that moment, I understood that Graham was not wrong, but perhaps I had been too narrow in my definition of what it meant to be part of a community. The conversation left me with more questions than answers, but it also opened my eyes to the richness of diversity that exists within us all."
"He smiled, dimples curving. “I think, as we are ‘housemates,’","and also, I hope, friends, that you should call me Graham.”",21,"He smiled, dimples curving. “I think, as we are ‘housemates,’ we should respect each other’s space and boundaries. It’s important to maintain a harmonious living environment, after all.” He paused, his eyes twinkling with genuine warmth. ""What do you think?"""

They had a conversation about the upcoming military maneuvers and how they might affect the town.

"This old wound, formerly healed, he’d received in Australia with Captain Stokes. A gun had exploded in his hands. They were rowing up a river in the captain’s gig, charting its","course. The cockatoos they’d spotted on the opposite bank were so dense as to be cloudlike, billowing from tree to tree. He’d taken up his fowling piece and sighted along the barrel.",63,"This old wound, formerly healed, he’d received in Australia with Captain Stokes. A gun had exploded in his hands. They were rowing up a river in the captain’s gig, charting its twists and turns. The sky above was a canvas of vibrant hues as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the water. The gig’s oars dipped rhythmically, breaking the surface tension with each stroke. Despite the danger, the camaraderie among the crew was unshaken, a testament to the bonds forged in adversity. The river, once a path of exploration, now held stories of valor and survival, whispered by the wind through the trees that lined its banks."
"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC. I thought it was a form of juvenilia, drawn in","his earliest years as a modern man, something to remind him of on a significant anniversary of his arrival here; and not, as it would turn out to be, a red letter from another era.",70,"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC. I thought it was a form of juvenilia, drawn in a moment of whimsy, perhaps to be discarded. However, as time passed, I found myself returning to it, intrigued by its simplicity and the potential it seemed to hold. The lines were rough, the proportions off, but there was something about it that spoke to me. It wasn’t until months later that I realized the significance of the drawing, a realization that came not from its technical merit but from the questions it raised about innovation and the value of unorthodox ideas. I began to see it less as a joke and more as a challenge, a reminder that sometimes the most groundbreaking ideas start as something absurd or overlooked."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and",went for a run. He would sometimes wake me up with a juicy smoker’s wheeze on his return to the house. He started giving me custody of his cigarettes and enforced a predinner smoking ban.,70,"By the time the sun peeked over the horizon, he'd already started his routine, which included a brisk walk around the block and a cup of coffee from the local café. His days were filled with a mix of chores and small-town errands, but it was the evenings that truly belonged to him. Graham loved to sit on the porch, watching the world go by, his mind wandering through the quiet moments. It was during these times that he felt most at peace, as if the weight of the world had lifted just a little. The summer stretched out before him, filled with the kind of simple joys that made life feel rich and full. He found himself growing more content with each passing day, the rhythms of the era becoming second nature, as if he'd always belonged here."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.",65,"I was prickly and defensive about the changes, the rapid pace of technology, and the loss of traditional values. Graham's disdain seemed to highlight the very things I feared were being abandoned. We would argue over the merits of modern conveniences versus the simplicity of the past, and I often found myself clinging to memories of a time that felt more authentic. Despite his skepticism, I couldn't help but admire his deep connection to the history he cherished, even if it sometimes clashed with my pragmatic outlook. Our debates were passionate, yet they never seemed to bridge the gap between our perspectives. It was a constant dance of respect and disagreement, each of us learning from the other's viewpoint, though neither of us could fully see the world through the other's eyes."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly. I once found him the sole occupant of the fifth-floor smoking area (a pigeon-shit-encrusted balcony), methodically shredding a filter of a finished cigarette. I watched him for a while, interested in the way that only his fingers moved. Most people ripple with surplus motion unless they are concentrating, but Graham only ever moved the parts of him that he wanted to move.",137,"Their anxiety was palpable, and the researchers had to intervene, offering breaks and reassurances. Despite these adjustments, the expats' discomfort persisted, leading to a reevaluation of the testing protocol. New settings were sought, and eventually, a quiet park was chosen, where the expats felt more at ease. Here, the tests were conducted with less resistance, though the results were still mixed. Some participants showed clear empathy responses, while others remained distant, their reactions unpredictable. The researchers hypothesized that the expats' cultural backgrounds significantly influenced their emotional responses, complicating the study's objectives. As the weeks passed, the team refined their approach, aiming to better understand the nuances of cross-cultural empathy. The challenges were numerous, but the insights gained were invaluable, offering a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in fostering empathy across diverse groups."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm. They began to resist the exams psychologically, spoiling our hard-won data. It was agreed that we’d delay introducing them to Hiroshima, Auschwitz, and the Twin Towers. Control promised to provide a timeline for the revelations, but it hadn’t materialized.",105,"After Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had been unusually quiet, finally spoke up, they revealed that the test had stirred up painful memories for them as well. Sixteen-forty-five, a former soldier himself, described the images as a cruel reminder of the horrors he had witnessed. Graham, who had been a medic, spoke of the emotional toll it took on those who had to tend to the wounded. The group decided to halt the empathy exams, recognizing the need for more sensitive approaches. They sought advice from historians and psychologists to better understand the impact of such tests. It became clear that the exams needed to be more respectful of the participants' experiences, especially those who had lived through such tumultuous times. The discussions led to a new set of guidelines that aimed to honor the past without causing unnecessary distress. This shift in approach was met with relief, and the group felt more confident in their ability to conduct meaningful research while being mindful of the ethical implications."
"Adela was always present at the honesty exams, often intervening in them. I got the impression that she was listening to offstage prompts that only she could","hear, being the only one among us who was aware she was on a stage, and was trying to chivvy us along the right course of action.",54,"hear. Her eyes would dart around the room, and she'd whisper quick responses that seemed to anticipate the questions. It was as if she had a secret script, one that no one else could access. Yet, despite her apparent advantage, Adela never sought special treatment. Instead, she encouraged her peers, offering quiet advice and sometimes even sharing her own notes. This behavior puzzled many, but it earned her the respect of those who witnessed her dedication and fairness."
"Adela smiled with about a third of her mouth. Her face had changed again. She looked pinched and hungry,",and hauntingly as if her skin was held in place by a bulldog clip at the back of her skull.,39,"Her eyes, once bright and full of life, now held a distant, hollow gaze. The transformation was stark, as if the vibrant woman Adela had been had been replaced by someone else entirely. Her cheeks had sunk in, and her usually lively posture was replaced by a hunched, weary stance. It was clear that whatever had caused this drastic change was having a profound impact on her, and those around her could only speculate on the trials she was facing."
"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder. Bridges tended not to eat at the Ministry canteen with administrative staff and the operators on the Wellness team—the office-based employees—and the decorous hostility with which the paper pushers met me was adorable. When I got to the","kitchen itself, the first thing I saw was Graham leaning down to light a cigarette on the gas ring, his curls dangerously close to the hob. We’d had to disable smoke detectors in every Ministry room that Graham used. If he couldn’t have a cigarette, he’d throw whatever experiment he was strapped into.",106,"I arrived at the grand dining hall, where the air was thick with the scent of freshly baked bread and the clinking of fine china. The room was adorned with portraits of past ministers, their stern gazes watching over the proceedings. I made my way to the table reserved for the higher-ups, where a few familiar faces greeted me with a nod. The chicken bag was a welcome sight amidst the formal attire and polished silverware. As I unpacked the meal, I noticed a small, unassuming figure in the corner, engrossed in a book. Curiosity piqued, I approached and introduced myself. It turned out that the person was a new intern, fresh from university, and had been assigned to the Wellness team. We spent the next hour discussing everything from mental health initiatives to the peculiarities of office politics. The evening wasn't just about the food; it was about connections and understanding, something I hadn't expected in such a rigid environment."
"She put a glass down in front of me—ice, water, an oily suggestion of cordial, and,","sure enough, some fussy edible garnishes. I blinked at it and then at Margaret, who smiled.",32,"She put a glass down in front of me—ice, water, an oily suggestion of cordial, and, as I reached for it, she smiled faintly, her eyes lingering on the half-empty bottle behind me, as if waiting for the right moment to refill it."
"Graham said, “Hm!” and pulled hard on his cigarette. He wandered off with the expansive air of a man who might pick up some parsley, not because",he has been told to but because that might be a jolly thing to do en route to his next footloose and fancy-free destination. I watched him go.,55,"Graham said, “Hm!” and pulled hard on his cigarette. He wandered off with the expansive air of a man who might pick up some parsley, not because he needed it but because he felt like strolling through the garden. The evening was cool, and the scent of blooming roses filled the air, making the night feel almost too perfect. As he sauntered along, his mind drifted to thoughts of the day's events, wondering if the parsley would ever find its way into a dish or if it would simply wither away. The world seemed to slow down, and for a moment, Graham felt disconnected from the urgency of life, lost in the simple pleasure of the moment."
"“No,” said Margaret. She shrugged at my expression. “An’ I forsake this duty,” she said, “we’ll sicken. Forty-seven",thinks tobacco is an herb. But womenfolk were cordoned at the stove for centuries. The men mun take lessons.”,37,"She paused, her eyes searching mine for understanding. ""Forty-seven years I've served this community, and I won't let my own doubts weaken what I believe is right. We thrive because of this work, and I can't abandon it for fear or convenience."" I nodded slowly, realizing the depth of her commitment and the weight of her sacrifice."
The Brigadier drifted closer. He did look hungry. He looked like I did as a student when I ate nothing but buttered,toast and apples. He turned the white of used candlewax when Margaret opened the oven to better squint at her roast potatoes.,44,"The Brigadier drifted closer. He did look hungry. He looked like I did as a student when I ate nothing but buttered toast for days. His eyes were sunken, and his cheeks hollow, a stark contrast to the robust figure I remembered from our last encounter. I wondered if he had been neglecting his meals or if this was just a temporary state. Either way, it was clear he needed something substantial soon, or else the hunger might consume him entirely. I considered offering him some of my own food, but I wasn't sure if he would accept it or if it would be appropriate given the circumstances. The silence between us stretched on, filled only by the distant sounds of the camp and the occasional rustle of the wind through the trees."
"“ ’Tis all the same to me, sir,” said Margaret, “though I fear",this cod will grow legs and walk afore my ‘colleague’ returns with my parsley.”,27,"“’Tis all the same to me, sir,” said Margaret, “though I fear it may reflect poorly on my reputation. Yet, I stand by my decision, for integrity is paramount, and I cannot let petty concerns cloud my judgment.”"
"Because we lived in a government-owned residence, there were also restrictions on how","long we could have the air-conditioning on. Graham picked at this, irritating and irritated.",27,"Because we lived in a government-owned residence, there were also restrictions on how we could decorate the space or entertain guests. These rules, though sometimes restrictive, aimed to ensure a uniform appearance across all government housing, fostering a sense of community and equality among residents."
"Movement was anathema. I slept, mostly, naked and poaching in my sweat. The water ration forced Graham to switch finally to thirty-second showers. I didn’t see him for the whole of the heat wave.",We left our bedroom doors open with the intention of letting the air circulate—though the air hung like an executed corpse—and said lackluster things about making a salad to each other from our separate cells.,69,"Movement was anathema. I slept, mostly, naked and poaching in my sweat. The water ration forced Graham to switch finally to thirty-second showers. I didn’t see him for the whole of the heat wave. The days stretched endlessly, each one blending into the next, and the relentless sun beat down, unrelenting. I found solace in the coolness of the nights, when the air was thick with the scent of damp earth and the distant hum of crickets. Though isolated, I found a strange comfort in the monotony, a quiet acceptance of the heat's grip. As the weeks wore on, I began to notice subtle changes in the landscape, the grass turning a sickly yellow, the trees losing their leaves prematurely. Yet, despite the harsh conditions, there was a quiet resilience in nature, a testament to its enduring strength."
"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest. She always arrived first, and we’d find her sitting at the top of",a long table like a mannequin awaiting the gift of demonic possession. But this time I arrived a quarter of an hour early and she wasn’t there.,53,"She'd already set up the cards and the timer, ensuring everything was perfect for the upcoming game. Her meticulous nature was legendary among her colleagues, who often marveled at her ability to focus on such tasks in a place where silence was paramount. Despite the secrecy, word of her prowess spread, and soon, she found herself leading not just bridge meetings but also strategy sessions for high-stakes negotiations. Adela thrived in the solitude, finding her true strength in the quiet confines of the soundproof room."
Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold,"water. She looked unwell, but God alone knows how her plastic surgeon thought she was supposed to look.",36,"Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold water for what felt like an eternity, her mind wandering to thoughts of rebellion and the quiet defiance she felt towards the strict rules imposed on their community, a small smile tugging at the corner of her lips as she reveled in the moment of defiance, unaware of the eyes watching her from the shadows."
"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery. She didn’t enjoy the prestige, as the Secretary did, and she seemed bizarrely overworked for the proxy boss of a project in its pilot stage.",56,"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it, remains a mystery. Her sudden rise in the organization puzzled many, and whispers of her connections and influence spread like wildfire. Despite the skepticism, she managed to maintain her position, leaving everyone wondering about the true nature of her success. Some believed it was due to her exceptional skills, while others thought it was more about who she knew than what she knew. One thing was certain: Adela had a knack for making people talk, and her time with us was never dull."
"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him. I frowned, and he frowned, and we were frowning into our tea.",64,"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had been living off the grid for years, his world a patchwork of wild landscapes and quiet solitude. His eyes, when he finally met mine, held a depth I had never seen in anyone before, a mix of resilience and longing. It was as if he had found his own version of peace, but it was a peace that came with a heavy price. I could sense the stories untold, the struggles unseen, and the quiet strength that defined him. That moment, standing there with him, I realized that sometimes, the most profound connections are forged in the spaces between words."
"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it. He was a severe disciplinarian, it’s true. Held grudges. But he was a very lonely person. Romantic, too, which made his loneliness worse.”",53,"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the only one. There’s a certain... resilience in his demeanor, a quiet strength that belies the label. He’s been through too much, seen too much, to fit into such a simple categorization. It’s not about being grim; it’s about surviving and moving forward, one step at a time. And that’s something I admire deeply, even if I can’t fully understand it.”"
"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running. Given how much of our working day the data collection took, we all assumed that the time-travel project was running to the stated purpose. Every day I had to record his heart rate, his blood pressure, his temperature; every day a written record of what he wore, what he ate, how much","exercise he took; every week checking progress against the imaginary benchmarks set by Control, use of phone, use of transport, use of media and the assessment of how harmful or useful each medium was; all the time the corrective tests for vocabulary and habit; novelistic observations on his character and temperament. It seemed that the job continued. I suppose if you switch on your lights and boil your kettle with energy provided by a nuclear power station, you don’t spend much time reflecting on the fact that the atom had originally been split to kill cities.",192,"I continued to monitor his vital signs meticulously, ensuring that no detail was overlooked. The meticulous documentation was a necessity, given the gravity of the experiment. We were on the brink of something unprecedented, and the stakes were immeasurably high. The team was divided into shifts, each member contributing to the vast amount of data that was being collected. The core reports were filled with graphs, charts, and notes, all meticulously analyzed for any anomalies or patterns. Despite the relentless pressure, there was a palpable sense of excitement and anticipation. The bridges, as they were called, were the heart of the operation, constantly processing and analyzing the data. The experiments were running smoothly, and the results were beginning to show promise. The time-travel project was not just a theoretical exercise; it was a tangible reality, and we were all part of it. The days blurred into nights, and the nights into days, as we all became part of a singular, focused mission. The memory of those ""vital"" files in the bin, unopened, was a distant echo, a reminder of the past. As the project progressed, we all knew that we were on the cusp of something extraordinary, something that could change the course of human history. The tension was palpable, and the stakes were immeasurably high. Every moment was a test, every decision a gamble. And yet, we pressed on, driven by a shared sense of purpose and a collective belief in the potential of the project. The future was uncertain, but the present was filled with a sense of awe and wonder, as we all stood on the brink of something truly remarkable."
"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on","a wet and putrid night, to shoot a fox, and pulled out one of his own rotting teeth (he showed it to me afterward; it was the color of a tombstone, caped with gelatinous red)—was this Victorian, or was this “irregularities”?",81,"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on a blanket that smelled faintly of pine and earth. The sun had begun its descent, casting long shadows that danced across his still form. I approached cautiously, unsure of what to expect. His eyes were closed, but I noticed a slight twitch in his fingers, a sign of life perhaps, or something else entirely. I knelt beside him, my heart pounding in my chest. After what felt like an eternity, he finally stirred, his eyes opening slowly. ""What are you doing here?"" he asked, his voice hoarse. I hesitated, searching for the right words. ""I was worried,"" I replied, my voice barely above a whisper. Graham nodded, a strange smile playing on his lips. ""I see,"" he said, his gaze distant. ""Sometimes, one must lie still to truly understand the world."" I sat there, lost in thought, as Graham’s enigmatic words lingered in the air, waiting for me to unravel their meaning."
"So I was anxious about Graham’s disdain for the twenty-first century, because never mind that I felt rejected by it, I was worried that the universe would feel the atemporal sting of his contempt and take","him away. My England wasn’t like this, he’d told me—but this was the natural evolution of his England. I was the natural evolution. I was his lens if he would only raise me and look with me.",73,"So I was anxious about Graham’s disdain for the twenty-first century, because never mind that I felt rejected by it, I was worried that the universe would feel the atemporal sting of his contempt and take it out on us. His resistance to modernity seemed to echo through the cosmos, as if the very fabric of time itself was unraveling at his touch. I feared that his rejection of the present would resonate across the ages, perhaps even influencing the very stars in their courses. It was a chilling thought, one that kept me up at night, wondering if we were all doomed to suffer the consequences of his stubbornness. Yet, despite my concerns, I couldn’t help but admire his courage in standing against the tide of progress, even if it meant facing the wrath of the universe itself."
"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test. The Ministry gave no indication of what format","the test would take, or what manner of questions would be asked, or tasks set. I thought this was unfair, and suggested as much to him.",52,"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test. The Ministry gave no indication of what format the exam would take, leaving us both in a state of anxious anticipation. We spent hours poring over old papers and reviewing key concepts, hoping to cover as much ground as possible. Despite our efforts, there was always that lingering fear of the unexpected. As the day of the test approached, the office became a fortress of study, filled with stacks of notes and textbooks. In the end, our preparation paid off, and we emerged from the office with a sense of relief and accomplishment, ready to face whatever challenges the test might bring."
"There was an embarrassed silence, then: “Shame!” yelled Margaret","from the audience. “Fie! Rhubarb, rhubarb! And diverse other curses!”",19,"There was an embarrassed silence, then: “Shame!” yelled Margaret, her voice trembling with anger as she glared at the group, clearly seeking an apology that never came."
"The person I was referring to was lurking at the far edge of the auditorium, with hair the color of wet earth under moonlight and a pinched, unhappy expression. I don’t think Salese could have looked more disapproving if we’d all started","sucking at one another’s fleshly parts and chanting “Hail, Satan!” The Brigadier was standing beside Salese.

I don’t think Salese could have looked more disapproving if we’d all started reciting poetry in unison. The air was thick with the tension of unspoken words, and the hum of the fluorescent lights above seemed to mock the silence. I could feel the weight of her gaze, a silent reproach that made the back of my neck prickle. It was as if the entire room had become a stage, and we were all actors in a play we didn’t understand. The minutes ticked by, each one stretching into an eternity, until finally, the lights dimmed, and the person slipped away into the shadows, leaving behind only the faintest echo of their presence."
"“I’m afraid I’ve only ever met the Secretary,” said the Brigadier.",“But I would very much like to meet Vice Secretary Adela.”,22,"“It’s a shame, I was hoping to discuss the upcoming military exercises with him,” replied the Brigadier, shaking his head in disappointment as he leaned back in his chair, lost in thought about the missed opportunity."
"I went home and, on arrival, checked my emails. As with a driving",test—or the lieutenants’ exam—the acclimatization exam results were delivered immediately. Graham had passed.,26,"I found several updates from work and a few personal messages. It was a busy day, but I managed to respond to all of them before settling down for the evening. The quiet of my living room felt welcoming after the hustle of the day."
"I cycled up to the nice grocery store to buy a bottle of champagne, pausing on the way home for a soft-serve ice cream. I sat on the bench to lick the ripple into a mound and think about the","Brigadier. A man of bivouac experience, I felt; there was something disturbingly makeshift about both him and Salese, as if they’d been dropped behind enemy lines and were mimicking familiarity while waiting for the right moment to cut a throat.",80,"I sat on the bench to lick the ripple into a mound and think about the evening ahead. The soft-serve ice cream melted slowly in my mouth, its creamy sweetness a perfect contrast to the fizz of the champagne I planned to open later. As I sat there, I couldn't help but imagine the faces of my friends when they saw the bottle. We always had such a good time together, and this seemed like the perfect occasion to celebrate. I wondered if they would be as excited as I was about the evening. The gentle breeze made the trees sway, and I felt a sense of calm wash over me. Life was good, and I was looking forward to sharing this moment with my loved ones."
"“Apparently I can pass as an eccentric. I suggested that somewhere like Scotland, Arthur and I might","simply pass as Englishmen. One of the panel was a Scotsman, and I think he liked that.”",34,"might go for a quiet retreat. It's a place where we could both blend in, away from prying eyes. We could explore ancient ruins, enjoy the brisk air, and perhaps even find a cozy inn. Scotland has always held a certain charm for me, and I believe it would be the perfect setting for a spontaneous adventure. Arthur seemed intrigued by the idea, and we decided to look into it further."
"When I brought the glass up—stoppering the rest of the bottle for dinner—I could hear Graham singing “I love to steal awhile away,” occasionally muffled by his drags on a cigarette. Water plashed against the tub.","He dropped to humming and presumably soaping. I slid quietly to the floor and leaned my head against the wall. I wasn’t going to see a Ministry therapist. I knew I should, and I knew I wouldn’t.",73,"As the evening wore on, Graham's voice grew softer, blending with the sound of the water. I could see the steam rising from the tub, creating a cozy, intimate atmosphere. The song seemed to fit the mood perfectly, and I found myself humming along, lost in thought. The night was quiet, save for the occasional murmur of Graham's voice and the gentle splashing of water. It was one of those rare moments when time seemed to stand still, and all that mattered was the present. I realized how much I had missed these quiet, undisturbed evenings, and I was grateful for the simple pleasures they brought."
"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century. On ships there were cooks and officers’ stewards; at home, on the few occasions he was at home, there were women. Nevertheless, he had taken to cooking in a way he had failed to take to","television or texting or the use of deodorants (“I bathe every day,” he’d said to me with hurt dignity). Tonight, he hummed with a busyness that hardly shielded nervousness. He burned the onions and automatically reached for his cigarettes. I took them away—I didn’t want ashy Bolognese—and he accused me of “nanny-stating” him, a turn of phrase I found very alarming because I certainly hadn’t taught it to him. Where was he picking this stuff up?",152,"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century.

Nevertheless, he had taken to cooking in a way he had failed to take to anything else. It was as if the simplicity of the task, the necessity of it, had freed him from the constraints of his past. He found himself experimenting with flavors, textures, and ingredients he had never considered before. The act of cooking became a form of therapy, a way to channel his thoughts and emotions. He started with the basics—boiling water, frying eggs—but soon he was trying new recipes, learning about different cuisines, and even teaching himself to bake. Cooking gave him a sense of purpose, a way to connect with the world around him. It was a small but significant step in his journey of rediscovery, a way to find joy in the mundane and to appreciate the simple pleasures of life. As he stood in his kitchen, surrounded by pots and pans, he realized that cooking was not just about feeding the body, but also about nourishing the soul."

She looked like a disco diva stepping out of the 70s, her vibrant outfit catching everyone's eye at the dimly lit club, where the pulsating music and flashing lights seemed to enhance her already striking appearance."
"Arthur was happy and flushed. He was one of those unusual extroverts who have all the attributes of an introvert, save that they like being around other people. He had a gift for gentleness too, one of the rarest virtues in","any gender and especially in the kind of man Arthur was supposed to be. I eased some biography out of him: half-decent public school; classics at Oxford, where he’d had a lot of fun and failed his exams; retraining as a doctor.",83,"Arthur's many facets. His quiet demeanor often masked a deep well of empathy and understanding. People gravitated towards him not just because of his charm, but because they felt safe and understood when they were around him. This unique blend of introverted sensitivity and extroverted sociability made him a rare and cherished friend. His gift for gentleness extended beyond just words; it was in the way he listened, the way he touched, and the way he simply existed in a room. Arthur's presence was a balm to those who felt lost, and his happiness was infectious, spreading warmth and joy wherever he went. Despite his many gifts, Arthur remained humble, always seeking to learn and grow, and his life was a testament to the power of kindness and connection."

I saw his hand shiver momentarily on his glass, and then he set it down with a clatter, his eyes avoiding mine as if the weight of my gaze was unbearable. I knew then that whatever news he was about to share would be difficult, perhaps even devastating."
"Margaret, incidentally, listened to the men talk about their careers with a suffused urgency that only I noticed. In her own era, she’d slept in the room next to the one where she had been born.","She thought Scotland was far-flung and semi-barbaric. When we came round to talking about my time working as a translator in Cambodia, I felt her attention all over me. I may have talked slightly too much.",72,"Margaret found herself yearning for a time when the world was simpler, yet she knew that such nostalgia was misplaced. Her experiences had taught her that every era has its own set of challenges and triumphs. As she listened, she couldn't help but reflect on how much she had changed since her birthplace no longer felt like home. The men's discussions about promotions and projects reminded her of her own struggles to find her place in a rapidly changing world. Despite the differences, there was a shared humanity that connected them all, a reminder that no matter the era, the pursuit of purpose remains constant."
"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag. I was shortly handing my grinder and papers to Graham (who was far more adept at rolling).,52,"truth, might have been the endless discussions about progress. It was one of those nights filled with strong opinions and casual conversations. We argued over technology, social media, and even the environment, but weed seemed to be the common ground. People shared stories, laughed, and debated the merits of legalizing it. In the end, it wasn't about winning the argument but about bonding over shared experiences. Those moments, though fleeting, left a lasting impression on me, reminding me of the importance of connection and open dialogue."
"Meeting Margaret made me vivid and receptive. Sentences weighed more. I kept a half-conscious catalog of where the men were looking. I’ve seen people deal with this in different ways. By “this,” I mean power. I mean magnetism. I try to absorb it. Within twenty minutes Margaret","and I were planning a girls-take-Soho night out, which necessitated me explaining the history of Soho, the concept of clubbing, the genre of R & B, the club night R & She, and dancing.

It was as if she could read my thoughts, or perhaps she simply knew me better than I knew myself. I had always been drawn to those who seemed to possess an innate ability to command attention, but Margaret was different. She didn't need to shout or command; she was simply present, and the room seemed to revolve around her. I found myself studying her every move, trying to understand what made her so captivating. It wasn't just her beauty or her intelligence, though both were undeniable. It was something deeper, something that made her presence feel like a gift. Within those twenty minutes, I realized that power and magnetism weren't just about control, but about connection. Margaret had a way of making everyone around her feel seen, valued, and understood. And in that moment, I knew I wanted to learn from her, to absorb her strength and grace, and to become a better version of myself."
"“Such matters are between myself and God,” he said gravely. “Oh, stop frowning, Sixty-five.","Arthur, will you please lead her in a polka, if you can still stand.”",28,"He sighed deeply, his eyes reflecting the weight of his solitude. ""Sixty-five,"" he continued softly, ""sometimes, what we fear most is the silence between us."" There was a pause, filled only by the distant sound of rain tapping against the window, before he spoke again, his voice barely above a whisper, ""Yet, it is in that silence that we find our truest selves."" The room remained quiet, save for the occasional drip from the leaky faucet, as if the world outside had paused to listen to his words."

Instead, people enjoy the pre-recorded melodies that capture the essence of their favorite artists. These music boxes have become a symbol of nostalgia and a way to preserve the art of music for future generations. Despite the convenience, many still yearn for the raw energy of a live performance, which cannot be fully replicated in a mechanical device."
"Arthur, by contrast, danced beautifully. He dipped me, and I bent like","a reed. He spun me, and I was, with such satisfaction, spun.",24,"Arthur, by contrast, danced beautifully. He dipped me, and I bent like a willow in the wind, laughing with delight as the music swirled around us, lost in the rhythm and the moment, feeling the eyes of the crowd upon us without caring, just enjoying the pure joy of movement and connection."
"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket. My bedside table sprouted two water glasses and a mug. Dust crouched on the skirting boards and in the seams of","my chest of drawers. When a woman is as impossibly attractive as Margaret, the mediocrity shed by a woman like me bustles around her like a horde of pigeons. Or so I thought, at that time. Truthfully, I’d been foxed by how beautiful she was. I felt a complicated anguish when I saw her little besocked toes treadling the carpet.",119,"As the dust settled, it was clear that the room had been neglected for some time. The air smelled faintly of mildew, and the faint sound of dripping water suggested a leak somewhere. I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt for not having noticed these signs sooner. The room was a stark reminder of the chaos that could accumulate when responsibilities were overlooked. I made a mental note to address the leak immediately and to clean the wardrobe. As I continued my inventory, I found a half-eaten sandwich under the bed, a crumpled newspaper from last week, and a pair of mismatched socks that seemed to have been hiding for years. The more I uncovered, the more I realized that this was not just a matter of untidiness but a reflection of the broader neglect that had been creeping into my life. It was a small room, but it held a world of untapped potential, and I knew that with a little effort, it could be transformed into a space that reflected the person I wanted to be."
Margaret appeared unaware of any of these concerns. She didn’t even glance at herself,in the mirror. She gave me an interested grin as I pulled out my lipsticks.,29,"Margaret appeared unaware of any of these concerns. She didn’t even glance at herself in the mirror, lost in thoughts of the meeting she had later. Her mind raced with the possibilities and challenges that awaited her, completely oblivious to her disheveled appearance."
"I’d stopped wearing it—I was, at the time, thinking of the way my face might be received by a Victorian who didn’t approve of cosmetics—but I demonstrated the coverage of my sole foundation. Margaret","was amazed by the smoothness of its application and the faithfulness of its shade. She drew an arrow with it on her cheek. On her fair skin, it looked like clay. We started giggling.",68,"I found myself in a peculiar situation where I had to explain the concept of foundation to someone who had never seen it before. Margaret was intrigued, her eyes wide with curiosity as I carefully applied the product, showing her how it could even out skin tone and hide blemishes. It was a strange experience, sharing something so common to me with someone who viewed it through the lens of historical disapproval. Yet, in that moment, it wasn't about judgment or past societal norms; it was about connection and understanding. We spent hours discussing beauty, culture, and the evolution of personal expression, realizing that while eras may differ, the quest for self-acceptance remains timeless."
"The door grumbled shut and I fell back into a doze. Margaret was snoring lightly, like a puppy being squeezed. The door reopened, and I","surfaced to vague consciousness. I felt a wave of cool air, and then a gentle warmth. He had spread a blanket over the pair of us.",51,"The door grumbled shut and I fell back into a doze. Margaret was snoring lightly, like a puppy being squeezed. The door reopened, and I found myself staring at the unfamiliar face of a stranger. My heart raced as I tried to recall if I had ever seen this person before. The stranger gave me a reassuring smile, but it did little to calm my nerves. Slowly, they stepped inside, and I could feel the tension in the air, wondering what their intentions were. As they approached the bed, I mustered up the courage to speak, my voice trembling slightly. ""Who are you, and what are you doing here?"" The stranger paused, their eyes locking with mine, before responding in a calm yet mysterious tone, ""I am here to offer you a choice, one that could change everything."" "
"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century. I was therefore unsurprised when, about half an hour after their plane landed, I got a call from Arthur’s phone.",55,"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven years he'd been stationed abroad. Each time, it was to check the weather, fearing a sudden downpour that might disrupt their outdoor activities. The phones were a constant reminder of the world they had left behind, yet they also served as lifelines to their families. Despite the surveillance, Graham found solace in the occasional call home, hearing the voices of loved ones that seemed so distant. He often wondered how long this arrangement would last, and if one day, he too would be free from the Ministry's watchful eye."
"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece,","but then again, so did Pimlico. I hadn’t seen him since the men had got back from Scotland and I asked him whether he enjoyed his trip.",53,"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece, as if he had stepped out of a photograph from the early 20th century. His face was set in a determined expression, though his eyes betrayed a hint of uncertainty. The world around him seemed to move in slow motion, the people and cars passing by as if in a dream. Arthur’s mind raced, trying to make sense of the strange sensation that had overtaken him, a feeling of being watched, though no one was there. He quickened his pace, hoping to shake off the unease that had settled over him like a heavy fog."
"It paid off in the early autumn. When I came down for breakfast one morning, I found","Graham at the counter with a dictionary and a tin of protein powder, performing exegesis on the label.",35,"It paid off in the early autumn. When I came down for breakfast one morning, I found the table set with an unexpected feast. The aroma of freshly baked bread and simmering stew filled the air, and my siblings were already tucking into the meal. Curiosity piqued, I joined them, only to find out it was a surprise to celebrate my upcoming birthday. The day turned out to be filled with laughter, games, and heartfelt wishes, making it one I would never forget."
"Adela was of the “never been to the GP in my life because I’m not a pussy” school of care, and nothing changed. If the expats were","dangerously ill, they’d be removed to the wards and never mind the trigger; if they could get a grip and deal with it at home, they should.",54,"Adela remained steadfast in her belief that natural remedies and home cures were superior to any doctor's advice. Despite numerous health scares among the expat community, she insisted on treating minor ailments with herbal teas and rest. Her friends often joked that she was more of a ""doctor"" than any of the local GPs, but deep down, they admired her resilience and independence. However, when a severe flu outbreak hit, Adela found herself questioning her stance, as her immunity seemed to wane. In the end, it took a near miss with pneumonia to convince her that sometimes, it's okay to be a ""pussy"" and seek professional medical help."
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky. But then again, I knew enough about his biography to know that he was very, very lucky.",141,"of the book on eighteenth-century sexual mores, but I wasn’t sure if it would help. Graham’s reticence was palpable, and I found myself tiptoeing around the subject, afraid of saying the wrong thing. One evening, after a particularly tense dinner, I finally mustered the courage to ask him about his past. His response was evasive, and I could tell he was uncomfortable. ""It's complicated,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. I pressed him, but he only shrugged, his eyes avoiding mine. The silence that followed was deafening. That night, I lay awake, wondering if I had made a mistake in bringing up the subject. The next day, I decided to give him space, hoping he would open up when he was ready. Weeks passed, and while we never fully addressed the issue, our relationship seemed to find a new balance, one that was more comfortable for both of us."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory. Every time I gave Graham a book, I was trying to shunt him along a story I’d been telling myself all my life.",101,"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was a complexity to her that I couldn’t quite grasp, a depth beneath the surface that made me question my own assumptions. I knew I had to approach her with more respect and less judgment, but it wasn’t easy. Every interaction felt like a test, a chance to prove or disprove my theories about her. Over time, I began to see her not just as a blank slate, but as a person with her own history, struggles, and dreams. It was a slow process, but one that taught me the importance of empathy and understanding. I realized that Margaret, like all people, deserved to be treated with dignity and respect, and that my opinions, no matter how well-intentioned, could still be harmful if not based on genuine knowledge and understanding."
Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had,ever seen him to entreating. I thought about it a lot. I liked being entreated by him.,34,"Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had ever felt to his secret world, a place where even the gravest matters were kept hidden from prying eyes. His determination to face the illness alone was both admirable and isolating, a testament to his strength yet also a burden that weighed heavily on me, as his friend, to respect his wishes while longing to offer more than just silence."
"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right? They fed us all poison from a bottle marked “prestige,” and we developed a high tolerance for bitterness. I would have been more frightened if the pressure lifted, like an indoor cat struck by sudden rain.",119,"You see, the tram had been rigged, and the lever was a decoy. The real danger lay in the prisoners, not the machine. I had to act fast, but I couldn't risk the lives of the innocent. The crowd was growing restless, and the guards were tightening their grip. I had to make a choice, and I chose to save those who couldn't defend themselves. It wasn't about who was right or wrong; it was about survival. Adela's actions were erratic, and her motives were unclear. I couldn't trust her, but I also couldn't ignore the danger she posed. The situation was complex, and the stakes were high. In the end, I had to rely on my instincts, and they led me to make a decision that would change everything. The tram swerved, and the prisoners were left behind. It was a gamble, and it paid off, but the cost was immense. The truth is, I was never truly in control, and that's what scares me the most."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.",39,"I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible to change the course of events given the weight of the past. I explained that while history shapes us, it doesn’t have to define our future. Graham nodded, but I could tell he was still preoccupied with the idea that there might be a way to rewrite the script of his life, no matter how entrenched the circumstances seemed."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.",56,"One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between his fingers, his eyes half-closed as if already lost in the evening's tranquility. The room was dimly lit by a single lamp, casting long shadows that danced on the walls. I could hear the soft hum of the stove from the kitchen, and the aroma of freshly baked bread mingled with the savory scent of roasting vegetables. It was a cozy scene, one that made me feel instantly at peace. Graham looked up as I entered, a faint smile playing on his lips, and I couldn't help but feel a wave of affection for him. The evening stretched out before us, filled with the promise of warmth and comfort, a perfect end to a long, busy day."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.",94,"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission. He would spend hours poring over cookbooks, tracing the origins of each dish, and trying to replicate the flavors. His enthusiasm was infectious, and soon I found myself learning more about the spices and techniques that made these dishes unique. We experimented with different recipes, sometimes with hilarious results, like the time we ended up with a bowl of what tasted like burnt cardboard and licorice. Despite the mishaps, Graham's passion for Southeast Asian cuisine only grew, and we found ourselves traveling to local markets, tasting new dishes, and even attending cooking classes together. It was a journey of discovery that brought us closer, teaching us not just about food, but about the rich cultural heritage behind each dish."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself. Whatever Adela said, he wasn’t ready, he’d barely left London, let alone land. But I wanted him to stay for other reasons too. It was humiliating to know that about myself and to say nothing into his implacable placidity.",98,"The pressure to find stable employment weighed heavily on us both. I feared the navy would not offer him the career stability I envisioned for him, while he worried about the monotony of a desk job. We sought advice from mutual friends, family, and career counselors, but none seemed to offer a clear path forward. In the end, we decided to take a different approach, exploring opportunities in international consulting, where he could leverage his maritime experience and still have the flexibility to travel occasionally. This decision opened up a world of new possibilities, and we both felt a sense of relief and excitement about the future. The transition was challenging, but it also brought us closer together as we navigated this new chapter of our lives. We faced many obstacles, but with each step, we grew stronger and more resilient. The journey was far from perfect, but it taught us valuable lessons about compromise, communication, and the importance of finding a balance between our individual desires and our shared goals."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.",64,"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.” The song’s infectious rhythm made it hard to ignore, and soon enough, the office was filled with the familiar sounds of the past. Despite the inappropriate timing, Graham couldn’t help but smile, reminiscing about simpler times when such music was the soundtrack to life. The song’s lyrics seemed to fit the moment perfectly, as if it were meant to be a reminder of the hold that certain memories have on us. It was a bittersweet moment, a reminder of how music can bridge the gap between past and present, and how it can evoke emotions that are both nostalgic and poignant."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:",122,"When Graham started browsing, the results were far more innocuous than I had feared. Mostly, it was a collection of articles on Victorian fashion and historical clothing. I sighed in relief, but the relief was short-lived. The next query was something else entirely—a series of searches related to ""anorexia recovery"" and ""eating disorders."" My heart sank as I realized that Graham's interests were far more complex than I had initially imagined. I decided to reach out to him, hoping to understand what was going on. After a few emails, it became clear that Graham was struggling with his own demons, and I found myself offering support in ways I never expected. This experience taught me that appearances can be deceiving, and that sometimes, the most unexpected places can hold the deepest truths."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.",151,"Amid the chaos, a sense of community began to emerge. Neighbors who had never spoken before found themselves working side by side, sharing tools and supplies. The air was thick with the smell of wet concrete and the sound of hammering nails. Despite the fear and uncertainty, there was a strange kind of unity in the shared effort. The council's response, though late, had sparked a wave of solidarity that spread beyond just the immediate area. People were not just preparing for the flood; they were preparing for each other. The high-vis jackets became a symbol of resilience, and the makeshift barricades were more than just barriers—they were a statement of defiance. As the night wore on, the rain continued to pour, but the spirit of the Blitz was alive once more. It was a reminder that no matter the adversity, people could come together to face it. The flood might have brought destruction, but it also brought a renewed sense of hope and unity. In the days that followed, the community would rebuild not just the streets, but the bonds that held them together."

"Adela’s voice contracted on that last sentence. She wiped her gaze, concentrated in her one working eye, up and down my face, to see if I’d noticed, and continued, “Our first priority","is protecting the expats and the time-door.

We must act swiftly and with precision. I need you to trust me, to follow my lead, and to stay calm. The situation is more complex than it appears, and we are dealing with individuals who are not to be underestimated. We have limited time, and every second counts. Let’s focus on the task at hand and leave the rest to the experts. We can’t afford to make mistakes, so let’s move forward with confidence and determination.” Adela’s tone was firm yet reassuring, and I found myself nodding in agreement, though the gravity of the situation weighed heavily on my mind."

Arthur's support helped me discover a passion that I never knew I had, and for that, I will always be grateful."
"My email made a chiding noise. Adela was the originator, and she’d put me in blind copy.",It was a short email. Adela had a real gift for cramming apoplexy into a couple of lines.,35,"The message was a gentle reminder about an upcoming meeting, but it felt more like a warning. Adela had a way of making her intentions clear, even when she didn't need to. I knew better than to ignore it, but part of me wished she had trusted me enough to include me directly. Blind copies always made me feel like an afterthought, no matter how many times I asked her to change it."
The email told us that her death would be reported to the expats as,"a suicide. “This cannot be emphasized enough,” Adela had written, with a double underline.",28,"The email told us that her death would be reported to the expats as a tragic accident, though the true cause remained undisclosed, leaving many to speculate about the circumstances surrounding her passing."
"Arthur smiled and sat down beside me, stretching out his long legs. Twisting the signet ring on his finger—a tell as","clarion as my skin biting—he murmured, “We didn’t know her as well as we would have liked. I wish we had.”",42,"Arthur smiled and sat down beside me, stretching out his long legs. Twisting the signet ring on his finger—a tell as to his nervousness about the upcoming meeting. The room was quiet, save for the ticking of the old grandfather clock in the corner. I could feel his eyes on me, waiting for me to break the silence. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I spoke, asking him about his plans for the evening. His response was vague, but his gaze never wavered as he spoke, leaving me with more questions than answers. It was clear that Arthur was hiding something, and I was determined to find out what."
"Anne Spencer almost made it off those wards. After I read the email, an ancient and exuberant terror blazed through me. It was partly the terror that had grown in me alongside my very bones,","knowing as I did that I only existed because my mother had outrun almost; I don’t know at what point you stop feeling the need to run, generation by generation, when you’re born after that.",70,"Anne Spencer almost made it off those wards. After I read the email, an ancient and exuberant terror blazed through me. It was partly the terror that had grown in me alongside my very bones, the kind that whispers in the dark, the kind that makes your heart race and your palms sweat. It was the fear of losing her, of failing to protect her, of being too late. Every fiber of my being screamed for her safety, but the weight of what I had to do pressed down on me like a mountain. I knew the risks, yet I couldn't turn back. The decision was made, and now I had to live with the consequences, hoping that my actions would be enough to keep her safe. The days that followed were a blur of preparation and anxiety, each moment filled with the fear that I might not succeed. Anne's fate rested in my hands, and the pressure was unbearable."
"He was sitting at the noisome kitchen table, staring at nothing. Rogue Male was lying splayed and face down by the ashtray. The thing in my chest kicked again","as I realized he must have grabbed it as we left our home. When I came in, he didn’t move anything but his gaze, which swung up like a whip.",59,"The pain was sharp and sudden, a reminder of the turmoil within. I could feel the weight of the past pressing down on me, each breath a struggle. The silence in the room was oppressive, only broken by the faint ticking of a clock somewhere in the distance. I wanted to move, to do something, but my limbs felt heavy, as if anchored to the chair. Rogue Male remained still, unmoving, and I couldn't shake the feeling that this moment would define everything that followed. The kick in my chest grew stronger, a silent plea for action, for escape, for anything but this suffocating stillness."
