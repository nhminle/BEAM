I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.",41,"I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that they had a lot to discuss, and I didn't want to miss out on whatever it was. As I stood there, I couldn't help but overhear snippets of their conversation, which only piqued my curiosity further. I decided to stay close, not wanting to miss any crucial information, especially if it involved a new project or a change in plans."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.",49,"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and Sam—decided it was time to try something new. They started watching comedies, which surprisingly didn't make either of them scream, but they found themselves laughing more than they had in months. It turned out that the loud noises in the horror movie had been the real scare, not the plot. Now, whenever they went out, they made sure to check the reviews and avoid anything too intense. Life was definitely less stressful, and they were enjoying their newfound movie-watching habits."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.",36,"Jack, oblivious to my discomfort, starts a conversation about his day, completely unaware of the tension in the room. I remain silent, focusing on the gentle rise and fall of my chest beneath the covers. The situation feels surreal, like a scene from a bad comedy sketch. After a few minutes, Jack finally notices my silence and asks if everything is alright, his voice laced with concern. I manage a weak smile and nod, hoping he won't press for details. The awkwardness lingers as we both struggle to find a way to salvage the moment."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,41,"Jack, confused, steps closer to the tent, his eyes narrowing as he tries to make out any movement inside. ""I heard noises,"" he whispers, his voice barely above a murmur. ""Maybe she’s in trouble."" We exchange a glance, both of us weighing the risks and benefits of investigating. Slowly, cautiously, we approach the tent, Jack reaching for the zipper as we prepare ourselves for whatever we might find."
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.",35,"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with a frustrated sigh. His eyes are bloodshot, and his voice is hoarse from the night's events. ""Why does everything have to be so complicated?"" he mutters under his breath. Jack's usually neat hair is a mess, sticking up in all directions, and his clothes are wrinkled from hours of restless sleep. It's clear that he's been through a tough night, and the weight of whatever happened is pressing down on him. I reach out to place a hand on his shoulder, but he shrugs it off, not wanting to be comforted just yet. ""Just give me a minute,"" he says, his voice barely above a whisper. Jack needs time to process everything, and I can only imagine what he's going through."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”",23,"She just needs a little space, you know? I've been there, lost in thought, and it's okay. We all zone out sometimes, right? It doesn't mean anything is wrong, just that her mind is elsewhere for a bit. "
“Why don’t we restart the movie? We can all watch it.” Jack,gives me a look to remind me that our other conversation isn’t over.,25,"Jack suggested enthusiastically, and everyone agreed, eager to see the film again from the beginning, perhaps catching details they had missed the first time around."
"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that","look on his face, I know what he’s going to say. I open my mouth.",29,"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that warm smile, I can't help but feel a surge of affection for him. It's been a long day, but his gratitude and the simple gesture of him thanking me make it all worthwhile. We exchange a few more words before he gets into his vehicle, and I wave goodbye, already looking forward to our next encounter."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?",61,"I found particularly challenging. Instead, I would often meet Jack at the school cafeteria, where we'd discuss our separate classes and share stories about the teachers. Over time, our friendship grew stronger, and we became inseparable. Despite not having any classes together, our bond deepened, and we supported each other through the ups and downs of middle school. Looking back, those lunches were some of the best memories from that time."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer. I said yeah, not really interested in conversation, not really listening, wondering what Autumn was doing.",97,"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us the signal to stop. The gym was filled with the sound of sneakers hitting the floor and the occasional laughter of our classmates. Jack, however, seemed to have other plans. As soon as I sat down, he leaned in and whispered, ""I've been thinking about that game all morning."" I smiled, feeling a bit taken aback but also intrigued. ""What do you mean?"" I asked. ""Well, you know how we were trying to outscore each other?"" he continued. ""I was wondering if we could do it again, but this time, let's make it a bit more competitive. What do you say?"" I hesitated for a moment, considering the idea. ""Sure, why not?"" I replied. ""Great!"" Jack exclaimed, clearly excited. ""I'll bring the ball tomorrow, and we can find a quiet corner of the gym. It'll be fun, I promise."" And with that, we settled into a comfortable silence, the prospect of our impromptu match hanging in the air between us."
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.",92,"He gave her a tentative smile, unsure of how to react to the sudden change. Autumn's once-round face had thinned, and her eyes, now larger and more expressive, seemed to hold a depth of wisdom he hadn't expected. Her body, though still slender, had a grace that made her movements almost ethereal. Jack felt a mix of surprise and admiration, realizing that Autumn had been through a lot. ""You look... different,"" he said, trying to find the right words. Autumn nodded, a small, knowing smile playing on her lips. ""Different, but still me,"" she replied softly. Jack nodded, understanding that sometimes, change is what keeps us alive. They stood there for a moment, the weight of the unspoken hanging between them, until Autumn finally broke the silence. ""So, Jack, what brings you here?"""
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure. But he thought I had deluded myself into believing this hot girl was my friend.",79,"his face, a silent acknowledgment that perhaps I was struggling more than I let on. We exchanged a brief, understanding glance before he closed the car door. That night, I realized how much I valued his friendship, even if I hadn’t always shown it. It made me reflect on my own walls and the need to open up more. The next day, I made a conscious effort to reach out to others, sharing my thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment. It wasn’t easy, but slowly, I began to build stronger connections, understanding that vulnerability can lead to deeper bonds. Jack’s pity that night had been a wake-up call, pushing me towards a more open and honest life."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.",58,"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn adorned every wall, and the scent of her crisp leaves filled the air. I wanted Jack to see the beauty in the season, to understand that it wasn't just about the falling leaves but the vibrant colors and the quiet moments of reflection. Each gathering was a celebration, with Jack learning to appreciate the subtle changes in nature, the way the sunlight danced through the trees, and the way the world seemed to slow down. By the end of the season, Jack had become a true admirer of Autumn, and our friendship had grown stronger through the shared love of this season."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.",59,"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still close. Despite my efforts, the distance between us seemed to grow with each passing day. I tried to explain that our friendship wasn't defined by physical proximity, but he couldn't seem to grasp that concept. Every time I tried to reach out, it felt like I was talking to a wall. The more I tried to bridge the gap, the more it seemed to widen. It was a frustrating and lonely experience, one that left me questioning the nature of our relationship and the value of my own efforts."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.",41,"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him to say something, but instead, he bolted towards the door, his hands trembling. ""We have to go,"" he whispered urgently. ""They're coming."" My heart raced as I followed him, wondering what could possibly be chasing us in the empty school. We dashed through the corridors, avoiding the few students still there, until we reached the janitor's closet, locking the door behind us. The silence was deafening, but I could feel the presence outside, growing closer with each passing second. We didn't dare speak, just waited, hearts pounding, until the coast was clear."
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.",59,"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind yourself of your achievements, no matter how small they may seem. It’s important to celebrate these moments because they build your confidence. Don’t hesitate to reach out to Jack or any other friend when you need support. Remember, you are capable of overcoming challenges, and each step forward is a victory. Keep pushing yourself to explore new interests and hobbies. Your journey is unique, and it’s okay to take your time. Stay positive and believe in yourself.”"
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly. I’d show Autumn that I wasn’t a loser without friends; Jack and I would make more friends somehow.,53,"Soccer has always been more than just a game for me; it's a way of life. The heat of the pitch, the roar of the crowd, and the thrill of each pass remind me why I love it so much. Despite overshooting my target, I realized that sometimes, it's not about reaching the end but enjoying the journey. Maybe I just needed to focus on the next play, the next goal, and the next moment of pure joy that soccer brings."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.",44,"Jack and I stood side by side, both of us named. We high-fived, a mix of relief and excitement coursing through us. The coach congratulated us, and we couldn't believe our eyes. It was a moment of pure joy, a testament to all the hours of practice and dedication. We knew this was just the beginning, and the journey ahead promised to be filled with challenges and triumphs. This experience would shape us, teaching us the value of teamwork and perseverance. We couldn't wait to see what the future held for us on the team."
"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate,",made me seem cool. There had been chuckles of appreciation according to him. I wasn’t sure about that though.,38,"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate, was something he admired. He said it showed maturity and a certain level of confidence that I hadn't expected from our first interactions. It was a small moment, but it highlighted the importance of not letting others' negativity affect your performance and attitude at work."
"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots. The junior varsity team practiced on the south field, closer to the circular drive where parents dropped off and picked","up kids. Even though Jack and I were on different teams, our schedules were still the same, and my mom would drive us to and from practice every day for those last weeks of summer.",69,"The junior varsity team practiced on the south field, closer to the circular drive where parents dropped off and picked up their children. The atmosphere was always lively, with the sound of laughter and the occasional whistle from the coaches. Despite the differences in skill levels, both teams shared a common goal: to improve and represent the school with pride. After practice, the players would gather for a quick snack before heading back to their dorms or apartments. The camaraderie among teammates was evident, and many friendships had been forged on those fields over the years. The coaches were always there, offering words of encouragement and advice, ensuring that every player felt valued and supported."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me. I was excited to tell him that practice hadn’t been as hard as I thought.,61,"that I was fine walking home. We exchanged numbers, though, and I felt a bit more connected to the team. The next practice was scheduled for the following week, and I was excited to improve. As I walked, I thought about the skills I needed to work on and the strategies I could use. I decided to watch some videos of professional players to get some inspiration. My phone buzzed with a text from my new teammate, inviting me to join them for dinner. I accepted, and we planned to meet at a local pizza place. This was shaping up to be an interesting season, and I couldn't wait to see how it all unfolded."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again. It was only as I approached and saw them watching me that I figured out they were waiting for me.",61,"We found ourselves walking in silence, the weight of the previous day's events pressing down on us. The sun was just beginning to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the uneven ground. Jack broke the silence first, pointing towards the distant silhouette of the school building. ""We should probably head back,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. The walk back was filled with the sound of our footsteps crunching on the gravel path, each step echoing in the stillness of the evening. As we approached the familiar gates, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief mixed with a lingering unease. The next day, I found myself replaying the events of the previous night in my mind, wondering what it all meant and if I had done the right thing."
"What if, this morning, she woke up in the tent before I thought? What if she woke up as I lifted my arm off her, then lay there wondering why I had been","touching her, why I was still lying close to her and not speaking? If that was the case, she would have—or could have—heard me say many, many, incriminating things to Jack outside the tent.",67,"She lay there, her heart pounding, trying to piece together the moments that had just passed. Had I been dreaming, or was there something more to our connection? The tent was silent, save for the soft rustling of the wind outside. She considered reaching out to touch me, to confirm if I was still there, but something held her back. The morning light seeped through the fabric, casting a golden hue over the tent. She knew she should get up, start the day, but the weight of the moment lingered, making it hard to move. What if this wasn't just a fleeting moment of intimacy but something deeper? She sighed, her mind racing with possibilities, unsure of how to navigate the unspoken emotions that now filled the space between them."
"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me. Jack has always said I’m irrational when it comes to Autumn, and maybe I should have taken him more seriously, because he was right earlier today.",60,"I fear will not reciprocate my feelings. This decision feels like a betrayal, but I believe true love is about making sacrifices for the greater good. It's a difficult path, but one I must tread for her happiness. I hope she understands my reasoning and finds the peace I cannot offer her. This journey will test my resolve, but I am committed to seeing it through, no matter the cost. It's a choice that weighs heavily on my heart, but I trust that the right decision is the hardest one to make."
“I already know why you did it.” She doesn’t have to explain that part. I know she’s never wanted me like that. I don’t need to hear her,say it. “I just want to know why you had to be so cruel about it.” It’s time to face what Jack has been telling me all these years.,57,"She sighs, a heavy breath that seems to carry the weight of all the unspoken words between us. ""But I need you to understand, it wasn't about you. It was never about you. I just... I needed a way out."" Her voice cracks, and for a moment, I see the vulnerability in her eyes that I've never seen before. It's as if the walls she's built around herself are crumbling, and I'm left wondering how I could have missed this. ""I'm sorry,"" she whispers, and it's the first time I've ever heard her truly apologize."
But Autumn’s getting upset. She sits up and pulls the covers,around her protectively. She frowns at me. The birds are still singing.,23,"She pulls the covers tighter around herself, her eyes scanning the room as if the source of her unease might be lurking in the shadows. Autumn's mind races with thoughts of what could have caused this sudden disturbance, wondering if it's just a fleeting fear or something more sinister."
"“It just felt so nice not to be the weird girl anymore,”",Autumn says. “I liked being popular. We did kinda grow apart that year.”,25,"She thought, finally fitting in brought an unexpected wave of relief, but she couldn't shake the feeling that something was still missing. It wasn't until later that she realized true acceptance comes from within, not from external validation."
“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again. Up ahead, Autumn and her friends were waiting at the crosswalk for the light to change.",45,"She moved to the city a few years ago, and we lost touch. Now, seeing her again, I can't help but feel a mix of nostalgia and discomfort. There's something about her that feels off, like the autumn leaves that rustle in the wind, whispering secrets only the trees know. I try to shake off the unease, reminding myself that old friends can change, but the knot in my stomach remains. Maybe it's just the chill of the season catching up with me, or maybe there's more to it than meets the eye."
My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either. When Jack told me—” and then she stops.",44,"Her laughter is infectious, and soon we're both giggling like schoolchildren. The world outside fades away as we lose ourselves in the moment. Time seems to stand still, and for a brief second, nothing else matters. This is the kind of connection that transcends words, a silent understanding that speaks volumes. Moments like these are precious, and I cherish them deeply, knowing they don't come often."
"“Sorry,” I say. “I was trying to decide whether I should kill Jack for telling you I was",into you or if I should kill him for telling you that I wasn’t into you. Tough call.”,36,"""I was trying to decide whether I should kill Jack for telling you I was a liar, or if I should just let you believe the lie and walk away. The truth is, I don't know what to do. All I know is that Jack's words have shaken my resolve, and now I'm torn between my anger and my need to protect you from the truth."""
"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn. I’m wondering now though. “What would","you have done if he’d told you the truth, that I was”—I try to remember how Jack put it before—“bonkers in love with you?”",48,"“What would Jack do if he found out the truth?” I ask myself, my mind racing through the possibilities. Could he still protect me if he knew how deeply I still cared for Autumn? Or would he turn his back on me, seeing me for the broken person I am? These questions swirl in my head, each one more painful than the last. I need to find answers, but I’m afraid of what I might discover. Maybe it’s time to confront Jack and finally get some clarity, even if it means risking our friendship."
"“I think my mother has a special bottle of champagne hidden away for just this occasion,” I say. I’m only partially joking. Mom has labeled some of her alcohol, like","for when George W. Bush leaves office and stuff. One expensive one said, “Finny-Autumn Day or NYE 2010.” At the time, I was glad she’d made alternative plans for it.",60,"I’ve seen her take a bottle of wine out of the back of the fridge and place it in the pantry, where it’s kept cool but hidden from view. She’s always been a bit of a secret keeper, so it wouldn’t surprise me if she has a special bottle tucked away. I wonder what occasion could be so significant that it warrants a bottle of champagne. Maybe it’s for a long-lost friend or a family secret she’s been holding onto for years. Either way, I’m curious to see what she has planned. I’ll have to wait and see if the bottle makes an appearance tonight."
"“Everything,” she says, which can’t be true. I didn’t even know everything",until last night. And Jack wouldn’t have called her before I arrived.,24,"“Everything,” she says, which can’t be true. I didn’t even know everything about her past, and yet, here I am, trying to understand. There are secrets, always secrets, and I’m not sure I’m ready to uncover them all."
"“Syl,” I start, but I don’t know where to begin. I stay","on the highway, passing all the exits that could take us home.",24,"I take a deep breath, gathering my thoughts, realizing that this conversation has been brewing for far too long and that avoiding it won't make it go away. ""Syl,"" I begin again, this time more confidently, ""we need to talk about what happened."" The silence that follows feels heavier than the words I'm about to say, and I brace myself for whatever comes next."
"“Syl,” I say as I drive toward her house, speeding up a bit. “Don’t be ridiculous.",I’ve been enough of a bastard already. I’m not letting you walk home in the rain.”,32,"""I know you’ve been through a lot, but this is just... I mean, we need to talk about it calmly, okay?"" I say, trying to keep my voice steady despite the growing unease in my chest."
"“Lexy,” I say. It’s too fucking early for her to call. It doesn’t matter if we’re sleeping","together again. “Stop being a drama queen,” I groan into the phone and roll over in bed.",34,"Lexy ignores my groggy plea for her to stop. ""I need you,"" she whispers, her voice barely above a murmur, yet it cuts through the haze of my sleep like a knife. I groan, rolling over, but she's already left the bed, the soft rustle of her clothes the only sound as she heads out the door. ""Lexy, wait,"" I call after her, but she's gone, leaving me alone in the quiet, the weight of her absence settling heavily on my chest."
I’m still standing in Finn’s yard staring at the grass he’ll never mow again.,"I don’t know how long it’s been when a woman’s voice says, “Jack, right?”",28,"I find myself lost in thoughts of the quiet that now fills his space, a silence that speaks louder than any words could. The sun casts long shadows, and I wonder if he ever saw them like this, knowing he wouldn't be here to tend to it anymore. Every blade seems to carry a memory, a part of him that remains even in absence."
"“The arrangements still have to be made, but I’m sure we’ll see","you at the wake, Jack,” she says before going inside. “Thanks again.”",24,"that everything will fall into place. The team is working diligently, and I have every confidence in their ability to deliver a successful outcome. We just need to iron out a few details, but I’m optimistic about the future of this project."
"There’s an odd aura around us as we approach. I feel so young, like I’m being escorted into kindergarten, and I’m resentful and grateful all over again. My parents shoulder themselves on either side of me, and I can tell all their focus","is on me. They don’t speak, but it’s strange: the closer we get to the horrible box, to the grinning photograph of my friend that sits on top, it’s like I can feel my parents saying to me, See, Jack? This is death.",86,"My parents shoulder themselves on either side of me, and I can tell all their focus is on keeping me steady, as if the world outside is too much for me to handle alone. Their hands are warm on my shoulders, grounding me, yet I can feel the weight of expectations pressing down on us. I want to break free, to prove I can navigate this on my own, but the truth is, I need them more than ever. This moment feels both terrifying and exhilarating, like stepping into the unknown, yet knowing I’m not truly alone. The air around us seems to hum with a quiet energy, as if the universe itself is holding its breath, waiting to see what happens next. And in that moment, I realize that perhaps this is exactly where I’m meant to be, surrounded by love and support, even if it feels like I’m being held back from something bigger."
"“You don’t have to pretend that we were more than friends of convenience,",Jack. I’m tired of people pretending to care more about me than they do.”,27,"It’s time we both faced the truth—that there was always more between us than just casual acquaintance, no matter how much we tried to deny it."
"“Uh-huh.” I take a gulp of coffee, which hasn’t quite cooled and burns down my throat. “So my guess is that’s what Sylv","said to you, and then you pushed back, because of course you did, and that’s when she said what you said to me, huh?”",47,"“Uh-huh.” I take a gulp of coffee, which hasn’t quite cooled and burns down my throat. “So my guess is that’s what Sylv meant by saying we need to be more cautious. There’s something not right about this situation, and I don’t like it. We should probably check in with the others and see if they’ve noticed anything amiss too. Better safe than sorry, right?” I muse, hoping the warmth of the coffee brings some comfort amidst the growing unease."
"“Hey,” I say as I approach, careful to stand back so that it’s obvious I’m not trying to","cut in line for the keg. Maybe he’s in his own head, but Trevor blanches for a moment.",36,"""Hey,"" I say as I approach, careful to stand back so that it's obvious I'm not trying to intrude. She turns slowly, her eyes widening slightly before a smile tugs at the corners of her lips. ""Oh, it's you,"" she says, her voice a mix of surprise and amusement. ""I didn't hear you come in."" We stand there for a moment, the silence between us thick with unspoken words, until finally, she breaks it with a light laugh. ""Well, hello there,"" she says, extending her hand. ""Long time no see."""
"That’s the kind of high school memory I want to live in tonight, so even though I have no idea what Chloe","was saying about me to her friend, I head over. A few of the girls rush off, but one of her friends stays.",45,"That’s the kind of high school memory I want to live in tonight, so even though I have no idea what Chloe's plans are, I decide to surprise her at her favorite café. The night feels like a nostalgic flashback, filled with the scent of coffee and the soft hum of conversation. We laugh about the silly things we used to do, and I realize how much I miss those carefree days. Chloe’s smile is brighter than ever, and I can’t help but feel grateful for these moments. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best memories are the ones we create, no matter how much time has passed."
"After the words are out of my mouth, I try to turn them into a joke with a laugh, but that",makes it worse. Chloe’s and her friend’s faces go through a strobe light sequence of reactions before settling back to pity.,42,"After the words are out of my mouth, I try to turn them into a joke with a laugh, but that only makes the situation more awkward. People start avoiding eye contact, and I realize my attempt at humor fell flat. I quickly change the subject, hoping to salvage the conversation, but the tension lingers. In moments like these, I wish I could just say the right thing the first time, without having to rely on jokes to save the day."
“You know? How you showed up at soccer practice like that?” Chloe touches my arm in a,"way that I used to think meant a girl was flirting, but now I’m not so sure.",34,"Chloe touches my arm in a way that feels both comforting and slightly awkward, as if she's trying to convey something more than just a casual gesture. I glance at her, noticing the intensity in her eyes, and for a moment, I wonder what she's really trying to say.

I turn, and he jogs up to me.",43,"I'm about to do. It's that moment when you quietly gather your things, give a wave, and slip out the door, leaving everyone wondering where you went. It's become a family joke, but I can't help feeling a bit guilty each time I do it. Maybe I should start saying goodbye, even if it's just a quick text or a note. After all, it's not nice to leave people in the dark, especially when they care about you."
"“It’s okay, Kyle.” Because it kind of is. I’m glad that no one hates me, but I’m also glad that the guys on",the team aren’t friends I should be concerned about losing.

They were excited to hear about the plans, but my mom reminded me to be careful when meeting up with friends late at night. I assured her that I would be safe and promised to keep my phone charged.

"“Well, if we don’t see you again, have a good semester!” Mrs. Carter says.",The tears in her eyes glitter. “Let us know if you ever need anything!”,28,"“Thanks, Mrs. Carter!” I reply with a smile.

When I get to","the room, I decide he may as well be asleep, because he’s reading the new student manual.",33,"I reach his apartment, and sure enough, his lights are off. I quietly slip inside, hoping not to wake him. The living room is dark, and I make my way to the bedroom, gently nudging the door open. There he lies, sound asleep, his breathing steady and deep.

Brett often finds himself gazing at it, reminiscing about the good times. He cherishes this image not just for its beauty but also for the memories it holds.

All week, people have been handing me flyers for various official and unofficial welcome parties that took place around campus. I’ve always found it amusing how everyone seems to think that attending one of these parties will instantly make them part of the in-crowd. In reality, it’s just a way for people to meet new faces and make connections. I prefer to focus on my studies, but I can’t deny that these events do bring a lot of energy to the place. Maybe next week, I’ll consider attending one, just to see what all the fuss is about."

It turned out he was a huge fan of retro gaming himself and had some amazing stories to share. We exchanged numbers and promised to meet up again soon. It was one of those rare moments where you meet someone who just gets you, you know?"
"As I get off the elevator, it occurs to me that Brett will probably be in our room and not expecting me. My","schedule has been pretty exact these past weeks. If he’s jerking off, he’d at least lock the door. And since the knob turns—",46,"My heart starts racing with a mix of excitement and nervousness.

It’s about doing the right thing, even when no one’s watching.

"“Yeah, she slept in a little, so when it was time to take Dave to school, I went to the crib, and she was so still, I really thought that she wasn’t breathing.

She must have been having a good dream.”",77,"When I picked her up, she let out a soft, raspy breath, her tiny chest rising ever so slightly. My heart pounded in my chest as I checked her pulse, relieved to find it steady. I carried her to the living room, where her husband was already preparing Dave's backpack. We decided to call the doctor just to be safe, and after a quick check, the doctor assured us it was just a deep sleep. Since then, we've been more cautious, waking her up gently whenever she sleeps late. It's a small price to pay for peace of mind, especially when it comes to our little one."
"Once she is free, the baby stops crying, but seemingly only out of confusion. “Beba?” She waits for me to do something, but I don’t","know what to do, so I continue to hold her from under her armpits out in front of me. “Meh?” she tries again and whimpers.",50,"She rocks the baby gently, hoping to soothe it back to sleep.

Maybe doing better than we are now?”",51,"I underestimated the challenges life would throw our way. There were moments when I questioned if we could make it through, but every time, our love found a way to pull us closer. We faced financial struggles, health issues, and personal doubts, yet we never let go of each other. Through it all, I realized that while love is the foundation, it's the strength and resilience we build together that truly makes a difference. Every obstacle we overcame only made us stronger, and I wouldn't trade our journey for anything. It's not just about surviving; it's about thriving together, hand in hand, through every storm."
"“Hi.” I’m trying not to stare at the ghost before me, but the hostess has pulled out the chair, and everyone is waiting for me to sit.

"The waitress is suddenly there, and I’m agreeing to lemon in my water and being handed a menu that looks like a wedding invitation.

"“So what is it, John?” I say after we’ve ordered strange-sounding appetizer salads and the",waitress has faded into the shadows. “Why did you stay away for most of his life?”,31,"""I was just curious about these new ingredients they're using,"" John replies, shrugging. ""You know how trends come and go in cuisine. Maybe this is just a passing fad."" We both laugh nervously, unsure if we should dig in or wait for something more familiar.

“She was”—he takes another small sip from his glass and sets it back down on the tablecloth—“cold to him is I suppose the way to describe it.

She went out of her way to word things so it was understood that she and Stella and I were the real friends, the ones who truly mattered. There was a distance between them, a chasm that neither words nor actions could bridge. He tried, of course, reaching out, offering support, but it was as if she had erected invisible walls. Stella, ever the mediator, tried to bring them closer, but the effort seemed futile. In the end, it was clear that some bonds were meant to remain untested, and this one was one of them. He learned to accept it, though it never truly healed the ache in his heart. The memory of her coldness lingered, a constant reminder of what could have been but wasn't. Months passed, and the distance only grew, until it became a part of their shared reality, a silent testament to the unspoken truths that shaped their lives."

There’s something odd about it. It feels heavier than it should, and the handle is warm to the touch, like it’s alive.” Jack paused, his voice trailing off as he stared at the umbrella, wondering if he should have returned it sooner. “Maybe I should have just kept it,” he muttered to himself, though he wasn’t sure why he felt compelled to hold onto it. The more he thought about it, the more uneasy he became, as if the umbrella was watching him, waiting for the right moment to strike."
