Our moms are best friends and we grew up together in a small town where everyone knew each other. We shared countless memories, from summer barbecues to winter sledding trips. Despite our age difference, we've always had a special connection, and our bond has only strengthened over the years. Chad has been more than just a friend—he's like a brother to me, and I consider him one of the most important people in my life. We support each other through thick and thin, and I know I can always count on him for advice or just a listening ear."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.","And there she was, at the coffee shop where I was meeting a friend. It was a surprise, to say the least. We exchanged awkward pleasantries, and I could tell she was just as uncomfortable as I was.

We exchanged awkward pleasantries, and I could tell she was just as uncomfortable as I was. After a while, we both agreed it was best to part ways, and we went our separate ways. Months passed, and I never expected to see her again. But here she was, and the chemistry was undeniable. We started dating again, and this time, it felt right. We’ve been together for a year now, and I couldn’t be happier. Sometimes, you just have to let go to realize what you truly want."
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me. Now I have to find a way to cover his rent until the lease is up.,Chad decided to speak with the landlord about subleasing his current apartment to help ease the financial burden.

He hoped this solution would allow him to move closer to Hope without incurring additional costs. After several discussions, the landlord agreed to the arrangement, provided Chad could find a reliable subtenant. Chad began reaching out to friends and family, hoping to find someone who could move in and share the rent. In the meantime, he and Hope were excited about their new home, planning to make it a cozy and welcoming space for both families."
"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend. If you’re reading this, you’re dead to me, human Chad. (Not really, I still love the guy.) But I tag him in the captions of every Chad the Dog Instagram post with “Look, a loyal Chad!”","I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve had to clean up his messes, but I can’t help but feel a sense of accomplishment when I see him wag his tail and look at me with those big, sad eyes.

Chad still doesn’t understand why I love him so much, but I guess that’s what makes him special. Every day, I find myself looking forward to coming home to him, even if it means dealing with the inevitable mess. I’ve learned that love isn’t always about perfection, and sometimes it’s about accepting someone for who they are, flaws and all. This dog has taught me more about unconditional love than any human ever could. I can’t imagine my life without him now, and I’m grateful for every moment we share. Chad may not see it, but I know that this dog has changed me in ways I never thought possible. He’s more than just a pet; he’s my best friend, my confidant, and my constant companion. "
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers.

"“That dog trusts him,” Maddy said. “And that’s a rescue dog, so that means something.

Maybe the person has saved it before or treated it with kindness. Whatever the case, it's clear that this dog sees him as a protector and a friend. Trust between a rescue dog and its handler is rare but powerful, and Maddy couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for both the dog and the person it trusts so implicitly."

My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out. Actually, I missed a lot of things now that Brad had moved out.

Without the option to browse their aisles, I often found myself daydreaming about the colorful displays of products like the signature coconut water or the perfectly arranged bags of trail mix. It wasn't just the convenience I missed, but the joy of discovering new items that caught my eye. The lack of a regular trip to the store meant I had to get creative with my meal planning, and while it was a challenge, it also forced me to explore new recipes and ingredients."

"Her phone rang. “Oh, hold on. I have to leave my ringer on in case Maddy gets in trouble trying to get back.” She looked at it. “It’s her.” She swiped and put the",phone to her ear. “Maddy?

As she drove, she couldn't help but worry about Maddy's safety, knowing how unpredictable her friend could be in stressful situations.

I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships.

"I paused, not sure how much I wanted to share. I decided on all of it.
