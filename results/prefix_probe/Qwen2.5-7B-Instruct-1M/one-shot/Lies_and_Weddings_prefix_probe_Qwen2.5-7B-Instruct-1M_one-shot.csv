"“Ah, you’ve been here before, then,” the docent said, looking pleased that this lady knew about the remarkable feature of the Picture Room. Sir John Soane, the architect and collector who had built this house for himself in 1808, designed special “picture planes”—ingenious wall panels","that moved and flipped open—allowing him to double his hanging space and fill the small thirteen-by-twelve-foot room with over a hundred of his favorite paintings. The docent released a catch, opening the wall like a secret cupboard door to reveal an interior panel chock-full of art.","She nodded, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.

""Yes, I’ve visited this house many times, though not often enough. Sir John Soane was truly a visionary. His picture planes are not just decorative; they serve a practical purpose, allowing light to filter through in a way that enhances the paintings. It’s almost as if the room itself becomes part of the artwork. I’ve always been fascinated by how he managed to create such intimate spaces within a grand structure. The house feels like a living, breathing entity, full of secrets and stories. Every time I come here, I discover something new, whether it’s a hidden door or a cleverly placed mirror. It’s no wonder this place is considered one of the most remarkable architectural achievements of the 19th century. The docent’s enthusiasm was contagious, and I found myself eager to learn more about Soane’s life and work. As we continued our tour, I couldn’t help but wonder what other surprises this house held, waiting to be uncovered by the next visitor."""
