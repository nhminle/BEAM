He's the guy who knows the color of my father's car, the type of coffee my mother prefers, and the exact day my father's birthday is, all without ever setting foot in their home. It's a strange dynamic, one that makes me feel both closer to my family and more distant, as if Jake has become an extension of my relationship with them. Despite this, I can't help but feel grateful for his insights, even if they sometimes make me feel like an outsider in my own family."

It's a feeling that makes my heart ache with longing, yet it's also a comfort, knowing she's here with me, even if just for a little while."

"“Anna?” he says, like he’s not entirely sure, and then does a full top-to-bottom sweep of my body, which recalls the lack of pants.","When he digs his hand into his luscious head of hair, I forget to be embarrassed again, because it all comes back to me.","Anna, with her arms crossed, meets his gaze, her eyes narrowing slightly.

Anna raises an eyebrow, her expression unreadable. ""You didn't make me uncomfortable,"" she counters, her tone light but her eyes sharp. ""Then why are you standing there like a deer in headlights?"" he asks, his voice tinged with frustration. Anna shrugs, her posture relaxed, but her eyes never leave his. ""Maybe because I'm trying to figure out what you're really up to,"" she replies, her voice calm but her words carrying a subtle warning. He opens his mouth to respond, but before he can, the door creaks open, and a voice calls out, ""Anna? Are you in here?"""
The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna.

Yet, despite the distance, I felt closer to him than anyone else ever had, as if our connection transcended the mundane details I could predict."
"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house.

It's as if the world has paused, waiting for me to process what has just occurred, but time doesn't seem to want to move forward.

“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation.

Like you're not quite... here.” I shrug, not really knowing how to respond. The truth is, I don't understand it either. Every morning, I wake up to the smell of my own sweat, my hair matted and tangled, and the realization that I've been sleeping in the same clothes for days. It's a cycle I can't seem to break, no matter how hard I try. He sighs, clearly frustrated, but there's a hint of something else in his eyes—sympathy, maybe. “Maybe we can figure this out together,” he offers, extending a hand. I hesitate, unsure if I can trust him, but something in his eyes gives me a glimmer of hope. “Okay,” I say, taking his hand, “let's give it a shot.”"
"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs.

"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity.

Let’s just take things one step at a time and see how it goes. We can always revisit this conversation later if needed.” She pauses, hoping to ease the tension. “What do you think about grabbing a coffee? It might help clear our heads.”"
"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay. When she got home, she made a point of thanking me for the help. Apparently, the trip itself was fine, but the highlight for her had been flying on an airplane.","Anna was so grateful that she insisted on treating me to dinner at a fancy restaurant in Seattle. We ended up at a cozy little café that had a view of the Puget Sound.

We ended up at a cozy little café that had a view of the Puget Sound. The food was delicious, and we spent the evening catching up on all the things we had missed while she was away. After dinner, we walked around the Pike Place Market, where Anna was fascinated by the fresh produce and the colorful displays. She even tried her hand at buying some local honey and fresh salmon. The next morning, we explored the University of Washington campus, and Anna was impressed by the architecture and the green spaces. She took several photos and promised to send them to her family. As we prepared to leave, Anna gave me a big hug and thanked me again for everything. It was a memorable trip for both of us, and we made a promise to do it again sometime soon."
"“That person deserves jail time.” She brings the glass to her lips, taking a tiny","sip. “Mmmmm.” Anna turns to meet my eyes. “And by the way, it’s anything over ninety-nine.”","She takes another sip, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for an escape, but finding",31,"She takes another sip, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for an escape, but finding none.

"I walk back inside, realizing I’d been so focused on the sleeping situation, I haven’t properly flailed over the sheer bliss that is our bungalow. In fact, I’m pretty sure the only thing in here I could afford is the roll of eco-friendly toilet paper I can clearly see from where I stand. And even that looks pretty fancy.

Her breath smelled faintly of wine, and I wondered if she’d been drinking. The room was dim, only the soft glow of the streetlight through the curtains illuminating the space. I lay still, unsure if I should wake her or let her sleep. Eventually, she shifted again, her body pressing closer to mine. I felt a mix of affection and confusion.

Yet, as much as I want to believe that this is just a phase, a momentary lapse in trust, I can’t shake the feeling that there’s more to it. Maybe it’s time to confront him, to finally lay everything out on the table. But what if he doesn’t believe me? What if the truth is even more complicated than I can imagine?
