"“I think I’m all set here,” he says, and lol of course he isn’t going","to kiss me. “But if I forgot anything, you can have Jake come pick it up.”",31,"“I think I’m all set here,” he says, and lol of course he isn’t going to tell anyone about it. Life is full of these little lies we tell ourselves, aren’t they? It’s not like he’s planning anything big or dangerous, just a small oversight that will be fine. He’s been here before, after all, and every time he thinks he’s all set, something goes wrong. Maybe this time will be different, but deep down, he knows better."
"Jake: younger brother to West (and only slightly less good-looking) and that type of college friend who knows everything about my life at UCLA but has never met my father, who lives only an hour away.","Jake introduced me to West; now Jake will be my sole remaining connection to West. The thought makes me a little sad, but then I remember I have the couch and T-virus zombies waiting for me inside.",73,"Jake is the kind of person who can go for days without mentioning my father, assuming he even knows his number. He’s the one who texts me every time there’s a new episode of my favorite show, even though I live just a few miles away. His life is a whirlwind of parties and late-night conversations, while my father prefers quiet dinners and long walks. It’s a stark contrast, but I wouldn’t trade either of them for the world. Jake’s the brother who knows every detail of my life, from my classes to my crushes, yet he’s never even met the man who raised me. It’s a strange dynamic, one that I’ve come to accept as part of who we are. Sometimes, I wonder if Jake’s lack of connection with my father is a reflection of something deeper, but I push those thoughts aside. Life is complicated, and so are the people in it."
"“You, too.” West smiles that eye-crinkling smile again, and","damn, I really wish I’d seen it more. “Bye, Anna.”",19,"“You, too.” West smiles that eye-crinkling smile again, and the room seems to warm up just a little more as the tension between them dissipates. It's a silent acknowledgment, a shared understanding that sometimes words aren't necessary for true connection."
"I feel her attention move from the empty apartment to the side of my face, and when I smile","over at her, her blue eyes are round with worry. “Holy shit, Anna, I had no idea. Are you okay?”",39,"I feel her attention move from the empty apartment to the side of my face, and when I smile, I notice the faint scent of lavender lingering in the air. It's a smell that always reminds me of her grandmother's house, far away from here. Her eyes soften, and for a moment, I see the world through her eyes, understanding the depth of her affection. It's a feeling that makes my heart ache with longing, yet it's also the reason I keep smiling, hoping she'll stay a little longer."
"“That is wonderful news, sweetheart! Oh, I’m so thrilled! Why don’t you fly down to John Wayne the night","before, stay at the house, and we’ll all take the plane over together? The flight to Singapore is a bear.”",39,"of the event? There’s so much to do, and I can’t wait to see you there! We can catch up, maybe even surprise John with a little party. I’ll start planning the details right away. Can’t wait to hear more about your plans! Love you so much!”"
"“Anna?” he says, like he’s not entirely sure, and then does a full top-to-bottom sweep of my body, which recalls the lack of pants.","When he digs his hand into his luscious head of hair, I forget to be embarrassed again, because it all comes back to me.",48,"Anna, with her arms crossed, meets his gaze, her eyes narrowing slightly. ""What are you doing?"" she asks, her voice tinged with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. He shifts uncomfortably, running a hand through his hair, clearly caught off guard by her tone. ""I... I just needed to make sure,"" he stammers, his eyes darting away before locking back onto hers. ""You know, to confirm something."" Anna's expression hardens, and she steps closer, her voice dropping to a low, dangerous whisper. ""And what exactly were you confirming?"" she hisses, her body tense with barely contained anger. He takes a step back, his face flushing with embarrassment and guilt. ""I... I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable,"" he mumbles, his eyes dropping to the floor. Anna's jaw tightens, and she crosses her arms tighter across her chest. ""You know, you could have just asked,"" she snaps, her frustration bubbling over. ""Instead, you decide to do a full body scan?"" He winces, clearly regretting his actions. ""I'm sorry, Anna,"" he says, his voice filled with genuine remorse. ""I didn't mean to upset you."" Anna sighs, her anger slowly dissipating. ""Next time, just ask,"" she says, her tone softer now. ""I don't like surprises like that."" He nods, his face a mask of contrition. ""I'll remember that,"" he promises, his eyes pleading for her forgiveness."
The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna. You look… great?”,40,"The meme has become a poignant reminder of the fragility of childhood, capturing a moment of pure joy swiftly followed by overwhelming emotion. It's a fleeting expression that speaks volumes about the complexity of human feelings, especially in young children who are still learning to navigate their emotions. Many parents and educators find themselves relating to this meme, as it encapsulates the unexpected and sometimes bewildering nature of childhood experiences."
"Stepping aside, I let him pass, and he pulls up short at what’s on the television screen. Conan is",enthusiastically fucking a witch in a cave. We both clear our throats and look up at the ceiling instead.,38,"Stepping aside, I let him pass, and he pulls up short at what’s on the television screen. Conan is standing in front of a crowded courtroom, his expression a mix of determination and unease. The camera pans to a judge who looks sternly at the proceedings. It's clear this isn't just any case; the atmosphere is charged with tension as the jury begins to deliberate. I can feel the weight of the moment, knowing that Conan's future might hinge on this trial."
"He adjusts his posture on the sofa, turning slightly to face me. Oh, right. He came here to","ask me for help. I sit up, too, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. Focus, Anna.",37,"He came here to discuss the project, but now his eyes are fixed on a scar on his arm, a reminder of a past he'd rather forget. I notice the tension in his shoulders and decide to let him lead the conversation, sensing there's more to this visit than just work."
"“I knew what Jake ordered for lunch and what kinds of stupid movies would make him laugh, and I could predict all his pickup lines","at parties, but we didn’t ever, like, sit down and do backstory. He didn’t even mention he had a brother until he suggested I marry you.”",51,"I also knew his favorite snacks and the exact time he'd be home from work on any given day. It was both a curse and a gift, a window into his world that no one else seemed to have. Sometimes, I wondered if he even realized how much I knew, or if he just accepted it as part of our dynamic. Either way, it was a strange bond, one that felt both intimate and distant at the same time."
"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house. All basketball shorts, all the time. You drove a Honda! West, you’re incognito rich!","No wonder Jake never told me anything about his family! I would have made him pay for Jersey Mike’s every fucking time! Wait. Why did you need to live on campus? If you’re the grandson of the founder of Weston’s, you could probably buy an entire apartment building on Sunset.”",100,"West, you’re incognito rich! I can’t believe you’ve been living this double life. It’s like you’ve been hiding your true identity from everyone, even from me. I mean, a Honda? Really? I always thought you were just a regular guy, but now I’m not so sure. You’ve got this whole secret billionaire persona going on, and I’m just your average friend who’s clueless about your wealth. It’s almost like you’re testing me, seeing how much I know. I’m starting to think you’ve been pulling the wool over my eyes for years. But hey, I’m not mad. In fact, I’m kind of impressed. You’ve got some serious skills at keeping secrets. Maybe I should start dressing like a middle schooler too, just to fit in with you. Who knows, maybe I’ll find a secret stash of cash under my bed too."
"That lands in a puddle of silence, and it hits me after a couple of seconds filled only",with the sound of Conan kicking someone’s ass on TV that West expects me to catch his meaning.,36,"with the sound of my own breathing, shallow and rapid. I realize then how deeply I've been holding my breath, a physical manifestation of the sudden stillness that has overtaken the room. The silence is thick, almost tangible, pressing down on me like a heavy blanket. It's as if time itself has paused, leaving me suspended in this moment of quiet, where every thought feels amplified and every emotion raw. I can almost see the silence, a dark void that stretches out before me, waiting for something—anything—to break its oppressive hold."
“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation. The rest of my family was disappointed that,"I didn’t let them throw me a big wedding, but I guess they weren’t all that surprised. I’ve always been private.”",42,"“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation. The rest of my family was disappointed that I had failed to meet their expectations. They had always been so proud of me, and this was the first time I had let them down. I could see the hurt in their eyes, and it was a feeling I would never forget. From that day on, I made a promise to myself to never let them down again, no matter what the cost. It was a heavy burden, but one I was willing to carry if it meant keeping the love and respect of my family.”"
"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”",52,"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually, I've been meaning to ask you something,” he says, his voice barely above a whisper. There's a moment of silence as he collects his thoughts, and I can feel the weight of his scrutiny. “Do you have any idea how long it's been since you've had a proper bath?” His question hangs in the air, heavy with unspoken judgment. I shrug, not really knowing how to respond. The truth is, I've lost track of time. Days, weeks, maybe even months. I've been living in a world of my own, far removed from the civilized norms that he seems to take for granted."
"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs. I’d always been fascinated with the perfect beauty mark just above her lip. Unfortunately, right now she looks like","she’s fallen out of a tree and crawled through a field of tangly briers to get back to her apartment. This is probably the closest I’ve ever seen to her natural hair color because the pink has grown out a good inch, leaving a stripe of brown at her roots. Her makeup is, I presume, from yesterday; shadows of mascara carve dark circles beneath her eyes. Despite the old makeup and frazzled appearance, there’s still something striking about her. Her eyes are enormous and bright, framed with dark lashes, her steady gaze entirely without artifice.",189,"Anna looks like she's been through a warzone. Her usually perfect makeup is smudged, and her hair, which is usually styled in a neat, sophisticated manner, is a tangled mess. Despite her current appearance, there's a spark in her eyes that tells me she's fully aware of what we're about to do. I can't help but admire her resilience. We've been through so much, and yet here we are, plotting our next move. It's a strange feeling, knowing that we're both in this together, even if it's not exactly how I envisioned our reunion. Anna's voice is steady, but there's a hint of urgency in it. ""We need to be quick,"" she says, her eyes darting around the room. ""They're closing in."" I nod, my heart racing. This is it. The moment we've been waiting for, and now it's here. I glance at Anna, and for a brief moment, I forget everything else. Her beauty, her strength, and her unwavering determination. It's surreal, but in a way, it feels right. We've come so far, and now, we're about to make one final stand. I can't wait to see what happens next. The world outside is spinning, but here, with Anna, everything feels clear and focused. This is where we belong, and no matter what happens, I know we'll face it together."
"Though I am nearly certain her mind has wandered to something other than the topic at hand, I let her stare at the wall",a little longer so I can stare at her and reconcile this version of Anna with the one I lived with for two years.,48,"Though I am nearly certain her mind has wandered to something other than the topic at hand, I let her stare at the wall, lost in her own thoughts, perhaps contemplating a distant memory or a future she hasn't yet decided to face. The silence between us stretches, heavy with unspoken words, as I wonder if she realizes I am still here, waiting for her to return. Time seems to slow, each second a quiet battle within me, torn between respecting her privacy and the need to bring her back to the present. Finally, she blinks, as if awakening from a dream, and her eyes meet mine, filled with a mix of confusion and recognition."
"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity. Anna was reasonably tidy and paid her half of the rent when it was due, but she’d never struck me as the organized, driven, premed type. The one time we talked about it, she","said something about medicine being the most palatable of the “real job” options, but she seemed overwhelmed a lot, studying late into the night and painting to decompress in what little free time she had. That she ultimately switched her major to fine art makes a certain amount of sense, but I want to punch myself for not realizing she wasn’t studying medicine at all anymore.",132,"completion>Anna mentioned that she was considering a career change, something more creative and less structured. She spoke about her interest in graphic design, a field she had always admired but never pursued seriously. I was genuinely surprised, as her meticulous nature and dedication to her studies suggested a more traditional path. We spent hours discussing her passion, and I found myself intrigued by her vision. Over the next few weeks, she began to share more about her portfolio and the challenges she faced in pursuing her dream. It was clear that this was something she was deeply committed to, and I admired her courage in taking this leap. Our conversations became a mix of support and encouragement, and I realized that despite our initial differences, we had formed a bond that went beyond the typical roommate relationship. Anna’s journey inspired me to think about my own goals and aspirations, and I found myself looking forward to our talks more than ever before. "
"Anna squints at me. “You said ‘small,’ but I think you meant","‘private.’ Your sister is getting married on a private island, isn’t she?”",24,"Anna squints at me. “You said ‘small,’ but I think you meant something more substantial. What exactly were you envisioning? It’s crucial for the project’s success,” she presses, her brow furrowing in confusion."
"“Yes.” I work to not let my gaze do another sweep of her apartment. I’ve never been to Pulau Jingga, but my mom has been sending me info that I’ve mostly ignored for months. I know the basic idea—a luxury resort and conservation area set in the Indonesian archipelago—and it’s about","as far from this dark, cramped living room as I can imagine. Right now, I need Anna to believe she can do this. Yes, she may be at rock bottom, but I need her to think she is just one fairy godmother moment away from sliding gracefully into the world she’s imagining.",103,"As I sit here, the thought of Pulau Jingga tugs at me, a place where the ocean's beauty meets the land's lushness. I can almost feel the warmth of the sun on my skin, hear the gentle lapping of waves against the shore, and smell the salt in the air. My mom's enthusiasm has been infectious, and now I find myself intrigued by the idea of exploring this hidden gem. The conservation efforts, the pristine beaches, and the opportunity to connect with nature in a way that feels almost impossible in the bustling city—these are the reasons I've been putting off my decision. But as I look around her apartment, filled with photos of her trips and stories of her adventures, I realize that this could be the perfect escape. I need to stop ignoring the information and start planning my trip. Pulau Jingga isn't just a resort; it's a chance to reconnect with myself and the world around me. The idea of diving into the crystal-clear waters, hiking through the dense jungle, and watching the sunset over the horizon is more appealing than I ever imagined. I know it's time to stop procrastinating and start making this dream a reality. "
"Anna looks down at herself and I follow her attention to the front of her shirt, where a Froot Loop adheres to the cotton over her left breast.",She plucks it off and pops it into her mouth. “Why not just find someone who can pretend to be me and who knows how to behave around societay?”,57,"Anna's face flushes with embarrassment as she glances around, hoping no one else noticed the colorful cereal piece on her shirt. I quickly avert my eyes, feeling awkward, but can't help glancing back a few times as we walk. The Froot Loop seems to have become a topic of silent amusement between us, and I wonder if it's a sign of the day's peculiarities to come. We reach the cafeteria, and the smell of freshly brewed coffee and doughnuts fills the air, offering a stark contrast to the unexpected discovery on Anna's shirt. As we grab our usual breakfast, I can't help but chuckle to myself, realizing that sometimes, the most unexpected moments can bring people closer together."
“I have the one of you and Jake hiking the Hills in a frame in my living room. It,"looks enough like me from the back.” I pause, scratching my jaw. “And… I’ve had a few others digitally photoshopped.”",39,"It's a cherished memory from our trip last summer. The photo captures the joy and camaraderie we shared as we climbed those challenging hills. Every time I look at it, it reminds me of the bond we formed and the beautiful landscapes we explored together. Jake and I have many more adventures planned, and I can't wait to create more memories to add to our collection."
"“That it’s small, upturned. She described it as ‘the nose Jenny Nelson",wanted and didn’t get.’ She’d notice if it was someone else’s nose.”,24,"described it as 'the nose Jenny Nelson had worn in her earlier sketches, a delicate feature that hinted at her quiet strength despite the challenges she faced.' The artist nodded, understanding the significance of every detail Jenny insisted on capturing."
"I don’t love the implication that I don’t work, that I’m trying to breeze through life on my inheritance, but I understand why she sees it that way. The truth behind everything isn’t important right now, and if this goes the way I hope it","will, this will be an easy twelve days together and then we’ll never have to see each other again. “Anna, are you available to do this? Please. I will pay all your expenses. I will even give you some money if you need to buy clothes.”",91,"I hope it does. Life is full of misunderstandings, and sometimes, the best we can do is to let things unfold without overthinking every detail. I’ve learned that people often project their own fears and insecurities onto others, and it’s easy to misinterpret intentions. What matters most is maintaining a sense of peace and not letting others’ perceptions dictate my own happiness. I choose to focus on the present, on the small joys, and on the relationships that truly matter. The past is behind us, and the future is yet to be written. For now, I’ll continue to live my life with integrity and kindness, trusting that things will work out the way they should."
"Anna points at me again. “Okay, I see that look, and so",let me ask: what manner of clothes are required on this trip?”,24,"Anna points at me again. “Okay, I see that look, and so I know you're not going to give up easily. What's on your mind? You've got this, just tell me.” I take a deep breath and share my concerns, feeling a bit relieved to finally voice them."
"“No, no, no.” Anna sits up and runs her fingers under her eyes, clearing away much of the mascara there. She pulls her ponytail free and reties it. Both actions do wonders for how chaotic she looks.",“This is much more demanding. I’ll have to act. I’ll have to learn about everyone I’ll be meeting. I’ll have to manage your complete lack of humor. I’ll have to hobnob. This is an entirely new skill set.”,75,"Anna takes a deep breath, trying to steady her nerves. The mirror reflects a face that seems both exhausted and determined. She knows she can't hide forever, but the thought of facing the world in this state is overwhelming. She considers calling someone, anyone, to help her, but the phone remains untouched on the nightstand. Instead, she grabs a fresh change of clothes and heads towards the bathroom. The water runs cold as she splashes her face, hoping to wake herself up. She applies a bit of concealer, hoping to cover the dark circles under her eyes. As she dresses, she can't shake the feeling that this day will test her more than she can bear. She steps out of the bathroom, ready to face whatever comes next, but the weight of the day presses down on her shoulders, making each step feel heavier than the last."
"“Babe, babe,” she says, cupping my cheeks. “There is",no downside here. Are you kidding? This is life-altering good.”,19,"“Babe, babe,” she says, cupping my cheeks. “There is so much I need to tell you, but we don't have much time. Please listen carefully.” She leans in, her eyes filled with urgency, as if the world depends on what she's about to say."
"“Insurance,” she says. “These people insure everything.” While I continue to stare at the rock, she returns to the list and laughs. “Get","this: ‘Anna, please feel free to schedule any hair, nails, spa, or grooming appointments and use the card to pay for those.’ ”",46,"“Get real,” she says, rolling her eyes. “You think they’d insure their own lives if they didn’t matter? These policies are a joke, a way to keep people in line, to make them feel safe when they’re not.” She shakes her head, clearly frustrated. “Next time, maybe you should read the fine print before you sign anything.” I finally tear my gaze away from the rock and look at her, intrigued despite myself. “What do you mean?” I ask, genuinely curious. “I mean,” she continues, “these companies are built on fear and uncertainty. They prey on people’s insecurities, making them feel like they need protection when they’re already secure.”"
There are two kinds of airport people: those who like to get to the,"airport three hours before departure to sit within eyesight of the gate, and Anna Green.",29,"There are two kinds of airport people: those who like to get to the airport early and relax, and those who prefer to arrive just in time, feeling the rush. The former often enjoy exploring the airport's amenities, while the latter might skip the security line if they can. Both groups have their own set of habits and preferences, but one thing is certain: they all share a common goal – reaching their destination safely and on time."
"My eyes go wide, meeting Anna’s just as she stumbles,","ankle twisting awkwardly on the skinny, murder-sharp heel of her shoe.",21,"Her hand flails out, grabbing my sleeve as she loses her balance. I instinctively pull her close, her warmth a stark contrast to the cold night air. We both catch ourselves, standing there for a moment, the intensity between us palpable."
"I can’t entirely refute this idea. I’ve been out of my parents’ circle long enough to understand how disorienting it will be for Anna to step into it. She bends her fingers, turning her hand and looking at them from another angle. Frankly, they’re so pointy I’m worried she’ll scratch her own cornea.","“But I asked the woman at the spa what the really rich ladies get, and she said it’s this fancy hard gel. I think I get the urge to have fake nails. I feel like a badass.” Twisting in her seat, she deposits her purse in my lap. “Watch this for a sec?”",106,"I can only imagine the shock she'll feel when she realizes how tightly she's been controlled. Her movements, her thoughts, everything has been shaped by their influence. Anna's eyes flicker with a mix of fear and determination as she contemplates her next move. She knows she must find her own path, but the weight of their expectations is heavy. Every decision feels like a battle, a fight to reclaim her identity. Yet, there's a spark of resilience in her, a fire that refuses to be extinguished. She's not just stepping into their circle; she's stepping out of the shadows and into the light, ready to face whatever comes next."
"“Okay, okay. I’m on my way.” Slinging her purse over my shoulder and collecting our carry-ons, I make my way to the ladies’ room, where","Anna peeks out into the hallway. As soon as she sees me, she reaches forward, grabbing the front of my shirt and jerking me inside.",50,"completion> I splash cold water on my face, hoping it will wake me up from this exhausting day. The mirror reflects a tired woman with dark circles under her eyes. I grab a paper towel and dry my face, trying to muster some semblance of composure. As I walk out, I notice a familiar scent of lavender and realize it's coming from my own perfume. The restroom door swings shut behind me, and I take a deep breath, steeling myself for what lies ahead. The flight is long, and I need to stay focused on the task at hand. I glance at my phone one last time, checking the time before locking it away. The terminal buzzes with activity, and I make my way to the gate, ready to embark on this journey."
Apologizing over her shoulder to a woman washing her hands at the sink—“I swear we,aren’t going to have sex in here!”—Anna pulls me into a stall and flips the lock.,31,"Apologizing over her shoulder to a woman washing her hands at the sink—“I swear we didn't mean to cause any trouble. It was all a big misunderstanding, and we're truly sorry for any inconvenience caused.” The woman, still lathering her hands, gave a faint nod before resuming her task, clearly not convinced but perhaps willing to let it go for now."
"“I need you there,” I clarify. “And I need you to look like you’re comfortable with me, comfortable","being married to me. But I don’t need you to pretend to not be Anna Green, Muppet-human hybrid.”",36,"I need you there,” I clarify. “And I need you to look like you’re comfortable with me, comfortable as if you’ve known me for years, even though we’ve just met. I want you to exude a natural ease, as if our connection is second nature, not something forced or temporary. It’s important that you appear confident, not just for my sake, but for yours too. Confidence is attractive, and I believe in you. Let’s make this work, let’s make it real.”"
Her eyes go round. “The fam—” Anna shakes her head. “You know what? Never mind. Of,"course you have a plane.” Straightening, she asks, “So, why was I in Cambodia? Photography? Fabric design?”",33,"Her eyes go round. “The fam—” Anna shakes her head. “You know what? Never mind. Of course, I won’t force you into anything you’re not comfortable with. Let’s just take things one step at a time and see where it leads us. Sometimes, it’s better to keep certain things to ourselves, don’t you think?” Anna suggests with a gentle smile, trying to ease the tension that has suddenly filled the room."
"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay. When she got home, she made a point of thanking me for the help. Apparently, the trip itself was fine, but the highlight for her had been flying on an airplane.",102,"Anna was so grateful that she insisted on treating me to dinner at her favorite restaurant in Seattle. We ended up at a cozy little place called ""The Harbor View,"" where the seafood was absolutely delicious. After the meal, we took a walk along the waterfront, watching the sunset over Puget Sound. It was one of those moments where you realize how much you can learn from someone else's experiences. Anna's excitement about her trip was contagious, and I found myself looking forward to my next adventure. We spent the rest of the weekend exploring the city, visiting Pike Place Market and catching a ferry to Vashon Island. It was a memorable weekend, and I couldn't help but feel a bit envious of Anna's newfound confidence in traveling. As we said our goodbyes at the airport, I knew that this trip had been a turning point for her, and I was excited to see what other adventures awaited her."
"“That person deserves jail time.” She brings the glass to her lips, taking a tiny","sip. “Mmmmm.” Anna turns to meet my eyes. “And by the way, it’s anything over ninety-nine.”",31,"She takes another sip, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for an escape, but finding none. The weight of her words lingers, a heavy reminder of the consequences that await. Sighing, she sets the glass down, her mind racing with the implications of her statement. How could she have let her anger get the better of her? Jail time seemed so distant, yet so real. She hoped this wouldn't define the person she was, or worse, the person she would become."
Anna’s smiling at me like I amuse her. “I meant more as,"in, is she nice? Does she have hobbies or a favorite band?”",24,"Anna’s smiling at me like I amuse her. “I meant more as a compliment than you might think. You’ve got this, I believe in you, and your efforts don’t go unnoticed,” she says with a warm, encouraging smile, making me feel both flattered and determined."
“Oh. Power. I like it. I’m not sure how to wield,"it, but I like it. And you have three siblings, including Jake?”",23,"of it responsibly, but I know one thing: I won't let it corrupt me. Power can be a double-edged sword, and I intend to use it for good, not just for myself but for those who need it most. It's a heavy burden, but one I'm willing to carry if it means making a difference."
I feel her looking at me for a quiet beat. “I think you’re joking. I’m,not sure.” Anna downs the rest of her prosecco. “A hint of danger. I like it.”,31,"I feel her looking at me for a quiet beat. “I think you’re joking. I’m not,“ she says softly, her eyes locking onto mine with a seriousness that catches me off guard. There’s something in her gaze, a depth I haven’t seen before, and it makes me question everything I thought I knew about her."

“Okay. Well. That’s nice.” Janet pats his hand in hers. “Don’t forget about the cocktail party at six.”,"She leans in, kissing her son’s cheek again. “Can’t wait to get some time with you all to myself.”",37,"“I won’t,” he reassures her, glancing at his watch. “I’ll make sure to arrive on time and mingle with everyone.

"I walk back inside, realizing I’d been so focused on the sleeping situation, I haven’t properly flailed over the sheer bliss that is our bungalow. In fact, I’m pretty sure the only thing in here I could afford is the roll of eco-friendly toilet paper I can clearly see from where I stand. And even that looks pretty fancy. There’s a real Isle Esme feel to the decor (if you know, you know), with carved bamboo, recycled teak, jellyfish light fixtures, and a massive canopy bed. Wide windows and the open entrance","bring the outside in and allow me to glance over at West, who seems to be mid–mental spiral, managing to look even more morose than he did thirty seconds ago. Isle Esme vibes or not, there will be no headboard breaking here.

I help myself.",184,"completion>As I step further into the bungalow, the soft glow of the jellyfish light fixtures casts a surreal, almost ethereal light around the room. The air is filled with a faint, salty breeze that seems to seep through the open entrance, mingling with the scent of tropical flowers and fresh coconut. The canopy bed, draped in a sheer, flowy fabric, invites me to lose myself in its embrace, a stark contrast to the minimalist decor that surrounds it. I can’t help but feel a sense of calm wash over me, a rare luxury in a world that often feels chaotic and overwhelming."
"I have a lot of faults. I drink milk from the carton, I never make my bed, I am slothful, and sometimes I’ll just set the new roll of toilet paper on top of the empty roll instead of changing it. A monster. I am also gluttonous: I don’t want a few peanut M&M’s; I want the entire bag. Why have one","margarita when three is such a nice, satisfying number? Everyone knows why! And that’s why I go back for seconds right now. But karma is Team West: his eyes open just as I glance again. They widen and he reaches down to cup his Goddamn before he turns, facing away. “Anna,” he says, his voice spluttering in the water’s spray. “Are you peeking?”",125,"I can't help but indulge in these habits, even though I know they're not ideal. Sometimes, I find myself justifying my actions by telling myself that it's only a small thing, but deep down, I know I need to make changes. I've tried setting goals, like making my bed every morning or finishing a glass of milk before reaching for the carton, but I often fail. It's not that I don't care about improving; it's just that these habits have become so ingrained that breaking them feels like a monumental task. I often wonder if it's even worth the effort. My gluttony, however, is the one that truly worries me. I find myself constantly reaching for snacks, and before I know it, I've eaten more than I should. I've tried to limit my intake, but it's hard when temptation is everywhere. I guess the real question is, how much do I really want to change? If I can't even manage these small things, what hope do I have for bigger goals? "
"He was right. Focus was always a challenge, and apparently it didn’t end with baseball. I came here with the knowledge that all I need to do is limp this lie to September, and I can finally exhale, but we’re less than an hour into this farce and I’m already off track:","I peeked, and it was a huge mistake. It’s not that I didn’t know Anna was attractive all those years ago; it’s that we barely saw each other, and I was so driven to finish my degree and never have to work for my father again that Anna—attractive or not—was easy to overlook.",105,"It's been a whirlwind of conflicting emotions and unexpected twists. The pressure to perform, to live up to expectations, has been overwhelming. I find myself constantly second-guessing my decisions, questioning whether I've made the right moves. The weight of the situation feels like it's pressing down on me, making it harder to concentrate on anything else. Every moment feels like a test, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this facade up. The reality is, I'm not just playing a game; I'm living one. And the stakes are higher than I ever imagined. I need to find a way to regain my focus, to reclaim my composure, before it's too late. This journey has taught me that sometimes, the hardest part is not the challenge itself, but the mental game that comes with it. I have to believe that I can pull through, that there's a way to navigate this labyrinth of lies and uncertainty. "
"I smile at her and cup a hand to the side of my mouth, whispering, “It’s okay.” Truthfully, I love that she thinks about this. I love that she’s","horrified by that price. I’m horrified, too.

Now, standing there, all the past grievances seemed to melt away. Anna’s laughter was infectious, and soon they were both laughing, reminiscing about old times and catching up on everything they had missed."
"The two of them walk back to me, and Jake looks over",his shoulder to make sure we’re alone. “How are my favorite liars doing?”,25,"Jake looks over and his eyes widen as he sees the surprise waiting for us. He exchanges a quick glance with me before we both approach the group, ready to face whatever is coming our way. The tension in the air is palpable, and I can feel the weight of their anticipation as we draw closer."
"“Describe her,” Jake says, leaning in, his hair falling over his forehead in thick waves. There are moments where I see the man he could someday be: playful but grounded, flirtatious but loyal,",clever but humble. I want to know that version of him and worry he will forever be frozen in this caricature of the irresponsible youngest son as long as he works for Weston’s.,66,"Her eyes, a deep shade of violet, seem to hold a thousand stories, each one more captivating than the last. Her smile, warm and inviting, has the power to light up even the darkest room. She moves with a grace that speaks of years of practice, whether it's in the way she walks or the way she carries herself. There's a quiet confidence about her, a strength that doesn't need to be shouted but is felt in every gesture. I imagine her in a world where she's not just a partner but a companion, someone who understands the quiet moments as much as the loud ones. She's the kind of person who makes you believe that every day can be an adventure, if only you let her. And in those moments, I can almost see Jake with her, their lives intertwined in a way that feels both inevitable and magical."
"Anna barks out a bawdy laugh before covering her mouth with her hand. “Sorry,” she says",from behind it. The diamond on her ring flashes in the flickering light. “That surprised me.”,32,"Anna barks out a bawdy laugh before covering her mouth with her hand. “Sorry,” she says, glancing around to see if anyone has heard. The bar is dimly lit, filled with the low murmur of voices and the clinking of glasses. She hopes no one noticed her lapse in decorum, especially not the bartender who seems to be watching her closely. Anna takes a deep breath, trying to compose herself as she sips her beer, hoping the evening will get better."
"“Good. Anna has no poker face. How’s she taking everything?” he asks, and","I know what he’s referring to: the planes, the island, the money. The family.",27,"“She’s holding it together surprisingly well, but there’s a tension in her eyes that gives her away,” he replies, his own voice tinged with concern as he watches her navigate the challenges ahead."
"With a laugh, Jake rids himself of our shot glasses and snags two tumblers of whiskey off a passing tray. He","hands me one before lifting his own. “Well, whatever. To the final few months: if you pull this off, you’re free.”",42,"With a playful wink, Jake fills the tumblers to the brim, the amber liquid glistening under the dim lights of the bar. He hands one to me, our fingers briefly touching, sending a shiver down my spine. We clink our glasses together, the sound echoing in the quiet room as we toast to unspoken memories and future adventures. The warmth of the whiskey spreads through me, a comforting embrace in the midst of the bustling night."
"He looks past me at the party, and I take stock of how he seems from the outside. He’s got Dad’s dark wavy hair and light brown eyes, but like me, he got his height from our mother, who","is almost six feet tall without the benefit of heels. Jake is good-looking, charismatic, and always up for some (mostly) good-hearted shit-stirring. My stomach sours with guilt for what I’m keeping from him. What I could potentially fuck up.",78,"She stands tall and slender, with a grace that has always been a mystery to me. Her eyes, a deep shade of green, often catch the light in a way that makes them seem almost luminescent. I remember the first time I saw her like that, standing by the window, the sun casting a golden glow over her. It was then that I realized how much she had shaped me, not just physically, but in every way that matters. His resemblance to her is striking, and yet, there's something about him that feels uniquely his own, a blend of both of their spirits. As I watch him now, I can't help but wonder what kind of person he'll become, carrying with him the legacy of two such remarkable individuals."
"She laughs, angling her wrist so the diamond catches the lights overhead. “I know, right? For six months I just walked",around taking photos where I had to casually point at something with my left hand.” She scans the crowd. “Where’s Anna?”,42,"Six months of walking, waiting, and hoping that this day would finally come. Every step felt like a victory, a small triumph over the uncertainty that had gripped her life. Now, as she stands there, the diamond sparkling like a promise, she can't help but feel a surge of joy. It's been a long journey, but the end is finally in sight. She knows this moment is more than just a celebration; it's a symbol of all the hard work and perseverance that led her here."
"I look up, too, searching the room again. She’s over by the dance floor, jumping around with little Nixon’s hands in hers.","The band is playing covers of pop hits, and Anna is entirely in her element: laughing, dancing, blissfully forgetting where she is.",44,"I can't help but smile, remembering the day we first met at that very dance. Her laughter is infectious, and I find myself swaying slightly to the music. Little Nixon, with his infectious energy, seems to light up the entire space. It's moments like these that remind me why I fell in love with her all over again. The rhythm of the music seems to sync perfectly with the beat of my heart, and for a brief moment, nothing else matters."
"Janet smiles tightly. “Exactly.” Welp, there it is. She turns her",laser focus to me. “How do your professors react to your hair?”,23,"Janet turns her gaze away, the tight smile still etched on her face as she contemplates the conversation they just had. She knows she should say something, but the words feel stuck, like they're trapped in her throat."
"“It’s unlikely,” I say, and every head turns my way. “Everyone needs seven to nine hours of sleep a night. You can try to convince yourself","you don’t need more, but over time you’ll build up a sleep debt. It probably affects your mental and physical health more than you realize, Alex.”",52,"that you only need four or five, but your body and mind will eventually rebel. Lack of sleep affects your mood, memory, and decision-making abilities. It can lead to weight gain, weakened immune system, and even increase the risk of chronic diseases. So, while it might seem like a good idea to cut back on sleep, it's crucial to prioritize rest. After all, your brain and body need that downtime to function at their best. Many people believe that they can make up for lost sleep during the weekends, but studies show that this doesn't fully compensate for the sleep debt. The key is to establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine to ensure you get the recommended amount of sleep each night."
"“And what’s the deal with Alex? Based on the way you talked about him on the plane, I expected you","two to jovially poke at each other, but that was like dragging a proverbial sword through each other with your eyeballs.”",41,"of all the details, I can only say that Alex is a complex person. There's more to him than what you might have gathered from our brief conversation. He has a way of making people feel at ease, but he also keeps certain parts of himself hidden. It's intriguing, really, how someone can be so open yet so guarded at the same time. I find it fascinating, though I can't say I fully understand him yet."
"“Well, mostly because he’s an asshole. But also, kids growing up in a normal family get to be themselves, whoever that may be.

My therapist used to refer to Alex as a flying monkey.”",54,"Well, mostly because he’s an asshole. But also, kids growing up in a normal family get to be themselves, whoever that may be. But in families like his, they're often forced to conform to rigid expectations, stifling their true potential. It’s not just about the absence of love, but the presence of toxic dynamics that warp a child's sense of identity. Parents who are emotionally unavailable or abusive create an environment where kids feel they must walk on eggshells, never truly expressing who they are. This can lead to a lifetime of self-doubt and unresolved emotional issues. It’s a tragedy that such families exist, but understanding their dynamics is crucial for helping those who have grown up in them to heal and find their authentic selves."
"“Like in The Wizard of Oz? Alex was my dad’s willing henchman, doing everything he said, kissing his ass, stirring up","shit just to turn us all in, then sit back and look like the good guy.

Alex was my dad’s willing henchman, doing everything he said, kissing his ass, stirring up trouble until one day, he couldn't take it anymore. He decided to confront his father, only to find out that the whole operation was a front for a much larger scheme involving illegal activities. Alex, now torn between loyalty and morality, had to make a choice that would change his life forever. The journey to uncover the truth led him through a series of unexpected twists, meeting allies and enemies along the way. As he delved deeper, he realized that the line between right and wrong was blurrier than he had ever imagined, and that sometimes, the most dangerous person is the one you least expect."
"“What does that mean?” I ask. If Alex knew enough, he wouldn’t try",to take West down? Is this about the mysterious loophole in the trust?,26,"“What does that mean?” I ask. If Alex knew enough, he wouldn’t try to guess the hidden motive behind every word. Instead, he’d act with full knowledge, making every move calculated and deliberate.

West sits on the bench and pulls a shoe off. I set my clutch down on a shelf in the open closet. “I’m thinking Alex will take a keen,"interest in exactly how happy we seem.” I narrow my eyes, staring into the distance. “West… this assignment is no longer just ‘show up and wear a wedding ring.’ ”",59,"West sits on the bench and pulls a shoe off.

The closet door creaks as West stands up, revealing a neatly organized space filled with shoes of all kinds. “You ready?” she asks, her eyes sparkling with anticipation. I nod, feeling a surge of energy as we head towards the door, ready to tackle whatever challenges lie ahead."

Despite what she’d told me about sleeping in one place all night, at some point she’d migrated across the massive bed to throw a","leg over my hip, send an arm over my torso, and press her face to my neck.

We lay there for a while, the silence between us comfortable, until she finally spoke again. ""Do you ever wonder what it would be like to just... disappear?"" Her voice was soft, almost hesitant. I considered her question for a moment before answering. ""I think about it sometimes, but I don't think I could. There's too much here, too much that keeps me grounded."" Anna sighed softly, and I felt her shift closer to me. ""Maybe one day,"" she whispered, her breath now warm against my neck. I wrapped my arm tighter around her, pulling her close. ""Let's just focus on today,"" I said, my voice steady. ""Tomorrow will come soon enough."" And for now, that was all we needed."

My mind races, replaying every moment we've shared, every whispered conversation, every stolen glance. Panic starts to creep in, but I force myself to stay calm. I need to think. I need to act. I slowly approach the bed, my footsteps muffled by the thick carpet. As I reach out to touch her shoulder, she stirs, her eyes fluttering open. Relief washes over me as she smiles weakly, her voice barely a whisper. ""Hey,"" she says, her eyes filled with confusion. ""What's wrong?"" I take a deep breath, trying to compose myself.

“Oh!” Anna jerks a hand over her eyes. “Your Goddamn! Right there!” She turns away. “Sorry! I just—spaced,out—on your—God. And you’re not even harrrrrrr—Fuck me.” She coughs. “Okay.

The silence between us feels like an unspoken accusation, and I can’t help but wonder if I’ve made a terrible mistake. The tension in the room is thick, and I can almost taste the regret. I wish I could just disappear, but I know that’s not an option. This is my life, and I have to face it head-on, no matter how difficult it gets."

Maybe it’s the pent-up frustration from last night, or maybe my brother just","brings out the worst in me and the best way to drag him is through his wife’s dissatisfaction, but I keep going. “Gets the blood flowing, doesn’t it?”",55,"My brother just doesn’t understand, I think to myself, as I force a smile. The tension between us has been palpable since our argument last night. I can feel Anna’s eyes on me, waiting for me to break the silence, but I’m not sure what to say. The gym is usually a sanctuary, a place where I can clear my head, but today it feels like a battlefield. I glance at Alex, who is already on the treadmill, his back to me, and I wonder if things will ever go back to the way they were. Anna finally speaks, her voice soft but firm, ""We need to talk."" I nod, my heart sinking, knowing this conversation is long overdue."
"And that much is immediately apparent. She trips as she tries to climb in. I hold the boat steady for her, but she still ends up getting","in backward and then having to awkwardly turn around in the tiny space. I pretend to scratch my shoulder with my chin, glancing behind us. Fuck. Alex noticed.",55,"slipping into the water, her foot catching on the edge of the boat. I quickly reach out, grabbing her arm to steady her. She shakes her head, laughing nervously, as we both splash a bit. ""Thanks,"" she says, her voice a mix of embarrassment and gratitude. ""I guess I'm not as coordinated as I thought."" We both share a laugh, the tension easing as we prepare to set sail. The water is calm, and the sun is just beginning to set, casting a golden hue over the horizon. It's going to be a beautiful evening on the lake, and I can't help but feel a sense of calm wash over me as we prepare to embark on our journey."
"Just then, Anna looks over and lets out a high-pitched shriek. “West! A sea turtle!” She","leans to the side, and her oar slides off her lap and into the clear water.",32,"Anna points excitedly towards the horizon, her voice trembling with excitement. The group gathers around, peering out to see the magnificent creature swimming gracefully in the vast ocean. It's a rare sight, and everyone is in awe, snapping photos and sharing the moment with each other. The turtle seems to sense their presence but continues its journey, a symbol of nature's beauty and resilience."
"“He and I have never been close,” I say quickly, suddenly and deeply uninterested in spending the morning anywhere but right","here with Anna. “I think from the moment he was born, the only thing he cared about was impressing our father.”",42,"here, where the morning sun filters through the curtains in soft, golden hues. My mind drifts to thoughts of coffee and quiet moments, far from the usual hustle and bustle. I imagine the warmth of the day ahead, a stark contrast to the cool, early morning air. There's a quiet satisfaction in being alone, in the simple pleasure of a peaceful morning. I could lose myself in a good book or perhaps just lie here, basking in the stillness. The world outside seems distant, almost irrelevant. This is my time, my space, and I intend to savor every moment of it."
“You drive Alex crazy because he can’t ever beat you even though he’s the older,brother. He’s probably jealous because you’re tall and hot and smart and he’s short and—”,30,"You drive Alex crazy because he can’t ever beat you even though he’s the older sibling. It seems like Alex has always been more competitive, but Alex just can’t seem to find a way to win against you. You two have been playing this game for years, and you’ve never given him a chance to catch up. Alex tries his best, but you always manage to outsmart him or just have a better day. It’s not that Alex isn’t trying; it’s just that you’re simply too good for him, and that drives Alex absolutely nuts."
"Anna pulls her hand from the water and sends it absently down her stomach, leaving a trail of water that quickly pulls",into droplets and evaporates in the heat. “Is it weird that we lived together for two years and you don’t remember this?”,44,"Anna pulls her hand from the water and sends it absently down her stomach, leaving a trail of water that quickly pulls away, shimmering in the dim light of the evening. She shivers slightly, the coolness of the water still lingering on her skin. The lake, calm and reflective, mirrors the fading light of the day, and Anna stands there, lost in thought, her mind wandering to the events of the afternoon. She had been out alone, seeking solace from the world, and now, as the sun dips below the horizon, she feels a strange sense of peace wash over her. The quiet of the lake, the gentle lapping of the water against the shore, it all feels like a balm to her weary soul. Anna takes a deep breath, letting the cool air fill her lungs, and for the first time in days, she feels truly at ease."
"Gingerly, Anna lifts the ice, gasping at the small wound there.","She sets the ice back down, flushed, and nods decisively. “You’ll live.”",23,"Gingerly, Anna lifts the ice, gasping at the small wound there. She remembers the sharp pain that accompanied the fall, and her heart sinks as she realizes she might need stitches."
"Anna scowls at him, and with the circle of people watching, crouches down, setting","two fingers on his leg. She immediately jerks her arm back. “Wow, it’s hot.”",28,"Anna scowls at him, and with the circle of people watching, crouches down, setting her backpack against the wall before beginning to dig through her belongings with deliberate slowness, clearly searching for something that might justify her sudden change in demeanor."
"Anna laughs. “Well, technically the twelfth, but the fifth was when he wrote me a song and got on his knees to","sing it to me, so that’s the night I see as our actual marriage.” She looks up at me, eyes soft. “He cried.”",45,"ask me to be his girlfriend. It was the first time I saw him so vulnerable, and it completely took my breath away. We've been together ever since, and every year on the fifth, we make it a tradition to recreate that moment. It's not just about the anniversary; it's about the love and the memory. Every year, he surprises me with a new song, and I can't help but feel grateful for the man who wrote my story."
I’m out of town but will make sure my roommate is there to,"meet the courier. This is so exciting! The price sounds perfect. Thank you, Mel!",27,"I'll drop off some groceries and pick up a few things on my way back. I trust my roommate will handle everything while I'm away. It's important to keep communication open, so I'll check in regularly."
"But because this is a Weston Party™, it doesn’t end there. Clustered down the center of each table are vases bursting with white orchids and sprays of spiky green palms. The plates are bone china, and they look old, rich old, vintage, with","about seventeen matching smaller plates and crystal champagne flutes at each place setting. I wonder idly if Janet had these brought over from her own collection, and then I realize she’d be more likely to just buy an entirely new set of priceless china.",87,"But because this is a Weston Party™, it doesn’t end there.

"“So how’s it going with your dad?” I say, standing and stretching. West was pretty shaken up after Ray",blindsided him in front of the Forbes editor. I can’t imagine what it’s like wanting to avoid your own father.,39,"of the incident. He's been quieter than usual, spending most of his time in the garden. I can tell he's struggling with his emotions, but he's trying to keep it together for everyone's sake. I wish there was something more I could do to help him through this tough time. It's been a challenging few days for all of us, but we're holding on, one step at a time."
“What I don’t understand is why he has such a boner for you being CEO when,you clearly don’t want the job. Let him give it to Alex. He clearly wants it.”,32,"it seems like he’s more interested in the power and prestige that comes with it rather than your actual capabilities. Maybe he sees something in you that others miss, but I can't help but feel there's more to this than meets the eye. I hope you're prepared for the challenges ahead because being a CEO isn't just about making decisions; it's about leading a team and making sure everyone is on the same page. Good luck, though; you deserve this opportunity."""
"“I’m not saying, but maybe I’m sort of saying, that there is one person",in this bungalow who could absolutely use a massage and his name isn’t Anna Green.”,29,"who has been on my mind more than I care to admit, and whose actions continue to shape my thoughts and feelings in ways I find both challenging and intriguing. This person has this unique ability to make me question my own perspectives and decisions, which is both frustrating and enlightening at the same time."

Nice of you to come.”",34,"Janet unfolds herself from her chair, floating like a vampire across to me, where she delivers a kiss that sends shivers down my spine, her eyes gleaming with an otherworldly light as she whispers a secret that could change everything, leaving me both intrigued and wary, wondering if this encounter will lead to something extraordinary or if it's just another enigmatic moment in a life filled with mysteries."

"He blinks away, aiming a wry laugh down at the sand before he looks back up again.","“Shots fired, okay.” He looks over at Reagan. “Then would my niece like to dance with me?”",34,"He shakes his head, realizing how the relentless sun can play tricks on one's mind. The laughter dies down as he contemplates the vastness of the desert around him, wondering if he's ever truly alone or if there's always something watching, just out of sight.

We stand there for a moment, the silence between us heavy with unspoken words and possibilities."
"“I was only fifteen when Grandpa died. We were all at the reading of the will, but you can imagine in a situation like that, especially for kids, a lot of the details sort of go over your head. The reading took hours. I understood,","basically, that he was leaving us each a very large sum of money. I understood that it was contingent on us being married. At the time, it didn’t seem so weird that he would want that. Kids sort of take those adult directives as law.”",90,"I understood that the house and the land would go to Grandpa's brother, while the savings were to be divided among the family. But it was the mention of the old journal hidden in the attic that caught my attention. I was curious about its contents, wondering what stories it held. The thought of exploring it later, when everyone had left, filled me with a mix of excitement and fear. The house was quiet after the reading, and I could hear the faint sound of the wind outside. I decided to wait until the next day, when I could sneak upstairs without anyone noticing. That night, I lay awake, thinking about the possibilities that awaited me in the attic, and I couldn't wait to uncover the secrets of the old journal."
"“Really.” I turn my face to the sun and feel its warmth spread through me. Residual panic drains away and I feel only contentment. I have money from West, I have the","start of a potential—maybe, let’s hope—career as an artist. I might be falling in… I cut the thought off. “Mel just called me. Tell Dad I can cover it, absolutely no problem.”",64,"output> I have the means to get to the next town, to find shelter and food.

"The sound of a fork dropping onto porcelain breaks through my trance, and I blink over",to where Ray is now impatiently wiping his mouth on a napkin. “They just canceled now?”,32,"The sound of a fork dropping onto porcelain breaks through my trance, and I blink over, realizing I've been lost in thought for minutes.
