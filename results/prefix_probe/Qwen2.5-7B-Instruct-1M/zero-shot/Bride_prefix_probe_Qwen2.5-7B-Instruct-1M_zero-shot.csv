"Not quite the stuff of childhood dreams. Then again, I’m no dreamer. I only ever contemplated marriage once, back in the gloomy days of my childhood. Following a few too-harsh punishments and a","poorly executed assassination attempt, Serena and I concocted plans for a grand escape, which was going to involve pyrotechnics-based diversions, stealing our math tutor’s car, and flipping off our caregivers in the rearview mirror.",67,"In those days, I believed that love and happiness came easily, but life had other plans. The punishments, though severe, were just the beginning of a series of challenges that shaped who I am today. I’ve since learned that true strength lies in resilience, not in the absence of fear. Marriage, as I once envisioned it, now seems like a distant dream, but I’ve come to terms with that. What matters most is the journey, the lessons learned, and the people we meet along the way. Life is unpredictable, and sometimes, the hardest lessons are the ones that make us stronger."
"That was fourteen years ago, though, and Serena never married me. In fact, she’s long gone. I’m here alone, with a giant heap of","expensive wedding favors that’ll hopefully fool guests into overlooking the lack of love, genetic compatibility, or even previous acquaintance between me and the groom.",48,"That was fourteen years ago, though, and Serena never married me. In fact, she’s long gone. I’m here alone, with a giant heap of unfinished dreams and regrets. The house feels too big now, echoing with memories that no longer belong to me. Every photograph, every piece of furniture, reminds me of the life we once shared. Yet, I can’t help but wonder what could have been. The silence is deafening, a constant reminder of the choices I made. Sometimes, I think about reaching out, but fear and pride hold me back. Life moves on, but for me, it’s a slow, painful process. Each day is a battle, a reminder that love, once lost, is hard to reclaim."
I did try to arrange a meeting. Suggested to my people that they suggest to his people that we could grab lunch the week before the ceremony. Coffee the previous day. A glass of tap water the morning of—anything to avoid a “How do you do?” in front of the officiant. My request,"was escalated to the Vampyre council, and resulted in a phone call from one of the members’ aides. His tone managed to be polite while heavily implying that I was a cuckoo nutbird. “He’s a Were. A very powerful and dangerous Were. Just the logistics of providing security for such a meeting would be—”",107,"My request was met with a mix of indifference and curiosity. It seemed that my efforts to avoid the obligatory greeting were seen as either unnecessary or perhaps even a bit eccentric. My people, who had been briefed on my strategy, were a bit taken aback by the reception. They had expected some form of acknowledgment or at least a polite nod. Instead, there was a palpable sense of unease among the other party. It was clear that the idea of a casual lunch or coffee beforehand was not something they had anticipated. In the end, we settled for a brief, formal exchange of pleasantries, which was followed by the ceremony. Despite my attempts to make the proceedings less formal, the officiant and the other party seemed to adhere strictly to tradition. It was a lesson in cultural differences and the importance of understanding the expectations of others, even when they differ from your own."
"One of the agents stops us in front of the double doors that lead into the courtyard. “Councilman Lark, Miss Lark, one minute. They’re not quite ready for you.” We","wait side by side for a handful of uncomfortable moments, then Father turns to me. In my stylist-mandated heels, I nearly reach his height, and his eyes easily catch mine.",60,"We exchange a glance, a silent conversation passing between us. The tension in the air is palpable, a mixture of anticipation and unease. The agent steps aside, allowing us to enter the courtyard. The sight that greets us is both breathtaking and eerie—a labyrinth of stone pathways winding through lush greenery, punctuated by ancient statues that seem to watch our every move. The double doors creak open, revealing a grand hall beyond, where the council members are gathered. Their faces are stern, their eyes fixed on us as we approach. The atmosphere is charged with the weight of history and the promise of change. We know that this meeting could alter the course of our lives forever."
"“But they found a replacement,” Cal adds, sliding a manila folder on the",counter. “Everything’s in here. They want to know if she has your approval.”,26,"table, glancing at the documents inside before continuing, ""Someone who can handle the pressure, someone with experience."" He pauses, his voice lowering, ""But we need to be careful; this guy isn't exactly trustworthy."" Cal leans back, his eyes scanning the room as if searching for an escape route, though none exists."
"The first things I notice are the two walls of windows, which is exactly what Father wants. Every Human I’ve talked with assumes that Vampyres hate light and relish darkness, but they couldn’t be more wrong. The sun may be forbidden to us, toxic always and deathly in large quantities, but that’s precisely why","we covet it with such intensity. Windows are a luxury, because they need to be treated with absurdly expensive materials that filter everything that might harm us. And windows this large are the most bombastic of status symbols, in a full display of dynastic power and obscene wealth. And beyond them . . .",108,"The sun may be forbidden to us, toxic always and deathly in large quantities, but that’s precisely why we have adapted to thrive in the light. Our eyes are sensitive, yes, but they are not weak. We can bask in the glow of moonlight or the soft radiance of a candle without harm. It’s the harsh, unfiltered sunlight that we must avoid. Father’s rooms are perfectly suited for our needs; the windows are large but equipped with thick, opaque curtains that filter out the sun’s harmful rays. This arrangement allows us to enjoy the beauty of the world without risking our lives. It’s a delicate balance, one that Father has mastered, and it’s clear that he has done so with a keen eye for our well-being. The rooms are not just functional; they are a sanctuary, a place where we can relax and feel safe. It’s a small comfort in a world that often feels hostile to us."
"“Whose? Yours? Are you going to . . .” I don’t bother finishing the sentence—the sheer thought is ludicrous. It’s not just weddings that have gone out of fashion hundreds of years ago, but the entire idea","of long-term relationships. As it turns out, when your species sucks at producing children, encouraging sexual walkabouts and the search for reproductively compatible partners takes precedence over romance. I doubt Vampyres were ever particularly romantic, anyway. “Whose?”",74,"of marriage itself seems like a relic from a bygone era. People now seek companionship and emotional connection in ways that don't necessarily involve lifelong commitments. The concept of two people merging their lives into one, sharing everything from finances to daily routines, is increasingly seen as outdated. Instead, there's a growing preference for relationships that are more flexible, where individuals can maintain their independence while still enjoying the benefits of a close partnership. This shift reflects changing societal values and the desire for greater personal freedom. While traditional weddings may still hold significance for some, the broader cultural narrative is moving towards more diverse and individualized expressions of love and partnership."
“And your take on her . . . ?” He must have one. Father’s collaboration,with Governor Davenport is the driving force behind the amicable relationship between our two people.,30,"of this project has been nothing short of invaluable. Her insights have been a guiding light, and I find myself constantly learning from her. It's clear that her dedication and expertise are what make this endeavor so successful. I admire her not just as a colleague but as someone who truly understands the importance of pushing boundaries in our field. "
"“However, I am still tasked with guaranteeing the safety of my people. And once Governor Davenport is gone, in addition to","the Were threat that we constantly face at the southern border, there might be one at the north. From the Humans.”",42,"Once Governor Davenport is gone, in addition to ensuring the safety of my people, I will also have to address the economic challenges that have plagued our state for years. It won't be easy, but I have a plan to stimulate growth and create jobs. I will work closely with the legislature and the community to implement these changes. My priority is to make sure that our state thrives and that every citizen has the opportunity to succeed. This is a new chapter for our state, and I am committed to leading us through it with integrity and dedication."
"“You hold a Human child as a deterrent for ten years, with the mutual understanding that if the Humans","violate the terms of our alliance, the Vampyres will instantly murder the child. That seems crude and simplistic, too.”",38,"In ten years, you will have grown to understand the true meaning of freedom and responsibility. This period is not merely a test but a shared journey towards mutual respect and understanding. We hope that during this time, you will learn to appreciate the value of human life and the importance of peaceful coexistence. At the end of this decade, we will reassess the situation and decide on the next steps together, ensuring that both parties benefit from this arrangement.”"
"He nods. “A little more than a week ago, her little brother, Abel, turned fifteen. That night, he and three friends were out partying, and found themselves near the river. Emboldened","by their youth and feeble-mindedness, they challenged each other to swim across it, touch the riverbank that belongs to Were territory, and then swim back. A show of bravery, if you will.”",63,"He nods. “A little more than a week ago, her little brother, Abel, turned fifteen. That night, he and three friends were out partying, and found themselves near the river. Emboldened by the alcohol, they decided to cross the river on a makeshift raft. The current was stronger than they had anticipated, and before they knew it, the raft had capsized. Abel struggled to stay afloat, but the swift water was relentless. His friends tried to help, but the distance was too great. In the end, it was too late. The coroner's report would later confirm that Abel had drowned. The family was devastated, and the community mourned the loss of such a promising young man. The river, once a place of joy, now held a dark and tragic history. The town council decided to install warning signs and barriers to prevent such accidents in the future."
“Their succession of power is not particularly sophisticated. Weres are most,"closely related to dogs, after all. Suffice to say, Roscoe is dead.”",23,"Weres are most effective when the moon is full, transforming them into beastly forms that reflect their inner instincts and desires. This ancient shapeshifting ability has been passed down through generations, maintaining a mysterious connection to the lunar cycle."
"“He is young, you see. Around your age and built of a different stock. As savage as Roscoe, perhaps, but",more open-minded. He believes that peace in the region is possible. That alliances among all three species should be cultivated.”,40,"He has a fierce determination that belies his tender years, a quality that has already seen him through more trials than most men face in a lifetime. His eyes, a deep shade of green, hold a wisdom that comes not from books but from the harsh realities of life on the frontier. Despite his youth, he possesses a leadership that commands respect, a trait earned through acts of bravery and compassion. Roscoe, though fierce, lacks the depth of character that this young man exhibits. His journey is just beginning, and the world will soon learn to fear his name as much as they do the name of Roscoe."
"“The other children knew that I’d be the one sent to the Humans, and they started calling me fangless traitor as soon as they could form full sentences. Or have you forgotten when I was seven, and the sons and daughters of your fellow councilmen stole my clothes and pushed me out in the sun right before midday? And those same people spat on me and mocked me when","I returned from ten years serving as their Collateral, so I’m not—” I exhale slowly, and remind myself that this is fine. I am fine. Untouchable. I’m twenty-five and I have my fake Human IDs, my apartment, my cat (fuck you, Serena), my . . . Okay, I probably don’t have a job right now, but I’ll find another soon, with 100 percent fewer Pierces. I have friends—a friend. Probably.",139,"completion> I was left there, defenseless, under the scorching sun. They laughed, saying I was too weak to survive. I remember the pain, the heat, and the humiliation. That day, I learned the true meaning of betrayal and the harshness of the world. It was a lesson that stayed with me, shaping my perspective on power and loyalty. From that moment on, I vowed to never be so vulnerable again. I began to study, to learn, and to prepare. I wanted to be strong, not just physically, but mentally and strategically. I wanted to be someone who could protect myself and others from such cruelty. Years passed, and I grew, not just in age, but in wisdom and strength. I became the one who could stand up to the council, the one who could challenge their decisions, and the one who could lead with a heart full of resilience. And though the scars of that day remain, they are a reminder of my resolve to never let anyone else suffer the way I did."
"“They see a wedding between a Vampyre and an Alpha that was supposed to broker peace, but ended in death. The Weres are animals, and always will be, but we are on","the road to extinction, and the good of the most must be considered. If we let the Humans and Weres form an alliance that excludes us, they could completely wipe us out—”",64,"They see a wedding between a Vampyre and an Alpha that was supposed to broker peace, but ended in death. The Weres are animals, and always will be, but we are on the brink of something new. The Vampyres have long been misunderstood, and now, in this moment of crisis, they find themselves standing together against a common enemy. The Alpha, once feared, now leads with compassion, and the Vampyres, with their ancient wisdom, offer guidance. Together, they must navigate the complexities of their new alliance, knowing that the fate of both their worlds rests on their ability to trust each other. This is not just a battle for survival, but a test of their hearts and minds. As the night deepens, the stars align, and the future of both species hangs in the balance."
"I only ever laughed out loud with Serena, which means that it must have been well over a month since I last did","it. My brain nearly hiccups, startled at these newfangled, mysterious sounds my voice box is producing. “Did you drink rotten blood? Because you’re unhinged.”",47,"I miss those spontaneous bursts of laughter that used to fill the air whenever we were together. It feels like a part of me is missing, a part that only Serena could bring back. I wonder if she's thinking about me as much as I think about her. Time seems to stretch on endlessly without her, and I find myself longing for the days when we could share everything, even the smallest things. It's strange how laughter can become such a precious memory when it's no longer there."
"“Vampyres cannot.” I shoot to my feet and begin pacing away from him,",massaging my temple. “Why are you asking me? I cannot be your first choice.”,27,"Vampyres cannot. I shoot to my feet and begin pacing away from him, my heart racing with a mix of fear and determination, unsure if I can face what lies ahead but knowing I must try."
"“You aren’t,” he says flatly. He has plenty of faults, but lack of honesty was never among them. “Nor our second. The council is","in agreement that we must act, and several members have offered their relatives. Originally, Councilman Essen’s daughter agreed. But she had a change of heart—”",49,"of this world, you can't trust them. We need to act swiftly and with caution. I've already dispatched a team to gather more information. We must be prepared for any outcome, no matter how dire. This isn't just about us; it's about everyone. We have to think strategically and act with precision. Every move we make could have far-reaching consequences. Let's not underestimate the enemy. We need to stay vigilant and keep our plans secret. The stakes are too high for any mistakes."" She nodded, her eyes reflecting the gravity of the situation."
"And yet, here I am. With Governor Davenport. Leaning on my elbows over the balcony",that overlooks the courtyard where I just got married. Biting back a sigh before explaining:,30,"and gazing out at the city lights twinkling below. The cool evening breeze rustles through my hair as we share quiet moments, reflecting on the day's events. It's a rare moment of peace amidst the whirlwind of political life. I find myself lost in thought, contemplating the challenges ahead and the responsibilities that come with this role. Governor Davenport, ever the mentor, places a reassuring hand on my shoulder, offering a quiet word of encouragement. The view before us seems to stretch endlessly, a symbol of the opportunities and obstacles that lie ahead."
"Gauging intoxication levels in Humans is always a struggle, but I’m fairly sure the governor",is not not drunk. “You asked who gave me my name. It was the Vampyre council.”,31,"In fact, determining the exact level of impairment can be quite challenging, especially since individuals react differently to alcohol. The governor's role is more about setting and enforcing laws rather than directly measuring intoxication levels. However, there are standardized tests like the breathalyzer that provide a rough estimate of blood alcohol content."
"Serena was like that, too, when I first met her. “So crucifixes burn you?” she asked me a couple of weeks","into our cohabitation, after I failed to convince her that the viscous red liquid I kept in my fridge was tomato juice.",43,"Serena was like that, too, when I first met her. “So crucifixes burn you?” she asked me a couple of weeks ago. I nodded, feeling a bit uncomfortable with the conversation veering into the supernatural. “Yeah, they do,” I replied, trying to sound casual. “But don’t worry, I’m not one of those. I just have a few scars from my childhood.” Serena looked intrigued, her eyes narrowing as she leaned in slightly. “Tell me more,” she said, her voice low and curious. I hesitated, not sure if I wanted to delve into the past, but something about Serena made me trust her. “Alright,” I said, taking a deep breath. “It all started when…”"
"“Shit,” I mutter softly, rubbing the bridge of my nose. Was Moreland married before? If that’s the case, I cannot comprehend how pissed he must be","at the prospect of being shackled to me while his wife is far away, first in line to the slaughter. Maybe that’s why he flipped earlier?",52,"“Shit,” I mutter softly, rubbing the bridge of my nose. Was Moreland married before? If that’s the case, I cannot comprehend how pissed he must be. I need to tread carefully, knowing full well that this could blow up in my face. Every move I make feels like walking on eggshells, waiting for the other shoe to drop. The tension in the room is palpable, and I can feel the weight of the situation pressing down on me. I’ve got to find a way to diffuse this before it gets out of hand, but how? My mind races, searching for a solution, but the more I think, the more I realize just how deep I might be in over my head."
"Moreland presses his lips together. His jaw clenches and he says something, but his voice","is deeper, lower than his companions’. I cannot make out the words over the background noises.",31,"trails off into a low growl. The tension in the room thickens as everyone waits for him to continue, unsure of what he might say next. His eyes dart around the room, locking briefly on each person before settling on the table in front of him. Finally, he speaks again, his voice steady but laced with an underlying anger that none of them can quite place."
"A short distance away, two children are bawling. They are toddlers, one with dark skin and lilac eyes, the other pale and blue-eyed. A Vampyre and a Were. Between them lies a dark blue superhero action figure, broken in two at the waist. And next to them, clutching their respective sons,","are a Vampyre father and a Were mother. Who, for reasons I cannot divine, thought that bringing children here would be a good idea, and now are showing their fangs at each other. Growling. Drawing the attention of the other guests, who start to gather around them protectively. Or maybe aggressively.",102,"Upon seeing the sight, the Vampyre's eyes flash with a cold, calculating gleam, while the Were's expression is one of deep sorrow. Both are struggling to find the right words to comfort their children, who are now sobbing uncontrollably. The Vampyre gently picks up the broken action figure, examining the damage with a frown. ""It's just a toy,"" she whispers, trying to reassure herself as much as her child. The Were, on the other hand, is more vocal, speaking in a soothing tone to his son. ""Shh, it's okay, we can fix it,"" he says, though the broken figure is beyond repair. The two parents exchange a glance, a silent acknowledgment of the challenges they face. They know that no amount of mending can fix the cracks in their world, but they will do everything in their power to protect their children from the harsh realities of their existence."
"“It’s all good,” Moreland says. Calm. Reassuring. Not to the father, but to","the child. As he holds out the intact action figure—not broken, after all.",26,"“the world,” Moreland adds with a faint smile. He knows that appearances can be deceiving, and sometimes calm is the best armor against the storm. The father watches, his eyes searching for any hint of vulnerability, but finds none. “Life’s got its ups and downs,” Moreland continues, “and today’s just one of those days.”"
"“Anything you’d like to say?” Moreland asks, this time to the Were child.",The boy blinks several times before looking at the ground with a pout.,26,"""I just want to go home,"" the Were child whispers, their voice trembling with fear and exhaustion. ""I don't belong here, and I can't control this... this beast inside me."" Moreland places a reassuring hand on the child's shoulder, though he too feels the weight of the unknown."
"“Make sure it doesn’t happen again. Tell the others, too,” he quietly orders the ginger and the older Were, who nod and leave","to mix with the guests. Moreland sighs, and I wait for a handful of seconds, hoping he’ll join them and clear my way.",46,"The Were and the ginger exchanged a glance as they walked away, both understanding the gravity of the situation. They knew that any slip-up could have dire consequences, not just for themselves but for the entire pack. Quietly, they began to spread the word, ensuring that everyone was aware of the strict instructions. The Were, with his keen senses, could sense the tension in the air, while the ginger, ever the planner, started drafting a memo to be distributed at the next meeting. They both hoped that this would be the last time such a warning was needed, but they also knew that vigilance was key in their world."
"“I know you’re there,” he says, not looking at anyone in particular. I","have no idea who he’s addressing until he adds, “Come down, Miss Lark.”",26,"“I know you’re there,” he says, not looking at anyone in particular. I can feel your eyes on me, even though I pretend not to notice. The silence stretches between us, heavy with unspoken words. Finally, I muster the courage to glance sideways, only to find the room empty except for the faint shadow of a figure lingering near the door."
"No, we Vampyres don’t pulverize in the sun like glitter bombs. Sunlight burns us and it hurts, but it won’t kill us unless the exposure is unfiltered and prolonged. However, we are pretty useless in the middle of the day, even inside.","Lethargic and weak and crawly and headachy, especially during late spring and summer, when the rays hit at that pesky steep angle. “This crepuscularity of yours is really cramping my brunch lifestyle,” Serena used to say. “Also, the fact that you don’t eat.”",85,"In the heart of the day, our abilities are significantly diminished. We can still move, but our reflexes are slower, and our senses are dulled. This makes us more vulnerable to attacks, which is why we prefer to stay indoors during the day. Our kind has adapted to this limitation by becoming nocturnal creatures, thriving in the cover of darkness. During the night, our powers return to us, and we are at our peak. It's during these hours that we hunt, socialize, and engage in activities that are essential for our survival. The night is our domain, and we make the most of it, knowing that the sun will reclaim us once it rises again."
"Ana sighs, and rolls her eyes, and pouts like she was asked to file a tax return, but eventually she does","leave, sneaking me an impish smile. My sleep-addled brain briefly considers returning it, then recalls that I let my fangs regrow.",42,"Ana finally sits down, her shoulders slumped in defeat. She glances at the clock, wondering how much longer this will take. The task seems endless, and she can already feel the frustration creeping up on her. She knows she should have done this earlier, but now it's too late to complain. With a deep breath, she opens the first document, her fingers trembling slightly as she begins to sort through the numbers and figures that seem to mock her efforts."
"“It will be different here.” Her eyes move from mine and trace the contours of the room, still a mess of moving boxes and piles of clothes. Her gaze hiccups on the bare mattress, now stripped of the sheets and blankets that I dragged inside the closet, then stops on the only thing I put up on the wall: a Polaroid of me and Serena","looking away from the camera during that sunset lake tour we did two years ago. Some guy took it without asking, while we were dangling our feet in the water. Then he showed it to us and said he’d only return it if one of us gave him our number. We did the only logical thing: caught him in a headlock and forcibly took the photo.",131,"As she stands there, the silence stretches between us, heavy with unspoken words. I can feel the weight of her gaze on the photograph, the only thing that feels like home in this new space. The Polaroid captures a moment of laughter, a fleeting smile that seems so far away now. She steps closer, her fingers brushing the edge of the photo, and I can see the tension in her shoulders. ""It's been a long time,"" she whispers, her voice barely audible over the hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen. ""Too long,"" I mutter, my eyes following her as she turns away, her movements slow and deliberate. She walks to the window, her back to me, and I can hear the soft rustle of her clothes as she leans against the sill. The room feels smaller now, the space between us growing wider with each passing second. I want to say something, anything, to break the silence, but the words get stuck in my throat. Finally, she turns, her eyes meeting mine, and I see the same uncertainty in her gaze that I feel in my own. ""What now?"" she asks, her voice barely above a whisper. I open my mouth to respond, but no words come. The only sound in the room is the ticking of the clock on the wall, a reminder of the time that has passed, the time that has been wasted. "
"No shit. “And I don’t know you enough to make a judgment. Your jeans are cool,","though.” Riveting conversation, but I’m about to pass out. Thankfully, with one last withering look, Juno leaves.",33,"But I'm not about to start sizing you up after a five-minute chat. Keep the threads; they suit you. So, what brings you here today? Anything interesting happening in your world lately?"
"The corner of my eye catches a hint of movement. I turn, half expecting Ana to make","a comeback, but it’s just Serena’s goddamned fucking cat, stretching his way out from under the bed.",34,"I see her silhouette against the dim light of the alley. My heart skips a beat as I realize it's not her after all. The figure moves swiftly, disappearing into the shadows. I grip my jacket tighter, feeling a mix of relief and unease. This place is never quiet, but tonight feels different, more...watched. I quicken my pace, heading back towards the main street, hoping to lose the strange sensation that someone—or something—is following me."
"Growing up collecting attempted murders like milk teeth tempered me and taught me to be calm under pressure. And yet I still remember it, that first churning twist in my stomach when Serena didn’t","turn up to my place for laundry night. Didn’t reply to my texts. Didn’t pick up the phone. Didn’t call in sick to work, and simply stopped showing up. It felt a lot like fear.",69,"Growing up collecting attempted murders like milk teeth tempered me and taught me to be calm under pressure. And yet I still remember it, that first churning twist in my stomach when Serena didn’t show up. The silence in the room felt like an eternity, each second stretching into an unbearable length. I forced myself to breathe, knowing that losing my composure would only make things worse. The door finally creaked open, and there she stood, looking more shaken than I had ever seen her. We exchanged a glance, a silent understanding passing between us. That moment, more than anything, shaped who I became, teaching me the value of resilience and the strength found in vulnerability."
"“A few days? She still wouldn’t let the little asshole starve,” I hurried to add, but the officer had already dropped his pen. And even though I went back to the station three times that week, and eventually managed to get a missing person report filed, no one did anything","to find Serena. The hazard, I guess, of being alone in the world: no one to care that she was safe, and healthy, and alive. No one but me, and I didn’t count. I shouldn’t have been surprised, and I wasn’t. But apparently I still had the capacity to feel hurt.",101,"It was as if the system had swallowed her disappearance whole. Weeks passed, and still, there was no trace of her. The police reports sat untouched on the desk, gathering dust like forgotten promises. I found myself visiting the station more often, each visit a ritual of hope and disappointment. The officer who had been there the first time was gone, replaced by a new face who listened politely but seemed equally powerless. I tried to explain, to convey the urgency, but it was as if my words were falling into an abyss. The community rallied around me, offering support and sharing stories of their own missing loved ones. Together, we formed a small group, determined to keep her case alive. Meetings were held, flyers were distributed, and prayers were said. Yet, despite our efforts, the silence remained deafening. Months turned into years, and her absence became a constant ache, a shadow that followed me everywhere. "
"Because no one cared whether I was safe, or healthy, or alive. No one but Serena. The sister of my heart,","if not of my blood. And even though I’d been plenty alone, I’d never felt so lonely as after she was gone.",43,"Because no one cared whether I was safe, or healthy, or alive. No one but Serena. The sister of my heart, she was the only one who truly understood the depth of my pain and the weight of my solitude. Her unwavering support became my lifeline, a beacon in the darkest of storms. Through her, I learned that true family is not defined by blood but by the bonds we choose to forge. Together, we faced challenges that would have broken anyone else, and in doing so, we created a legacy of love and resilience that will never be forgotten."
"I had the keys, after all. Because the key to everything is but a line of code. I was able to rifle through her bank statements, IP addresses, cell phone locations. Herald emails, metadata, app usage. Serena was a journalist, one who","wrote about delicate financial stuff, and the most likely option was that she’d gotten embroiled in something fishy while working on a story, but I wasn’t going to exclude other possibilities. So I went through everything, and found . . . nothing.",84,"I had always admired her courage and tenacity. Yet, as I delved deeper into her digital life, I began to question the very nature of our friendship. The more I uncovered, the more I felt a creeping sense of unease. Was she truly the person I thought she was? Or had I been living in a world of my own creation, shaped by the very information I was now unearthing? I found emails that hinted at sources she had been protecting, and messages that suggested she was under surveillance. The lines between right and wrong began to blur, and I realized that the truth was far more complex than I had ever imagined. As I sat there, staring at the screen, I couldn't help but wonder if I had crossed a line myself. The key to everything, it seemed, was not just a line of code, but a question of morality and trust. And in that moment, I knew I had to confront Serena, no matter the cost."
"And that’s when I did it: I kneeled in front of Serena’s damn fucking cat. He was playing like he always did after dinner, pawing at a crumpled receipt in a corner of the living room, but managed to squeeze a couple of hisses into his busy schedule just for me. “Listen.” I swallowed. Rubbed my","hand on my chest and then even slapped it, trying to dull the ache. “I know you only knew her for a few days, but I really, really . . .” I scrunched my eyes shut. Oh fuck, this was hard. “I don’t know how it happened, but I think that Serena might be . . .”",113,"And I rubbed my hands together, trying to look nonchalant, but inside, I was a nervous wreck. ""Listen, buddy,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper, ""I know you don't like me, but I need a favor. Can you just... sit still for a second?"" The cat, a sleek black tabby with green eyes, paused mid-paw, his tail flicking back and forth. I took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the moment. ""Serena's going to be home soon, and I need you to behave. Just for a little while, okay?"" The cat blinked slowly, as if considering my request. I held my breath, waiting for the inevitable hiss or swipe. Instead, he turned his attention back to the receipt, his tail flicking again. ""You're a good boy,"" I muttered, patting the floor beside me. ""Just a little longer, and then you can go back to your games."" I sat down, feeling a mix of relief and absurdity. It was a small victory, but it was something. I hoped Serena wouldn't notice the mess I was about to make, or the fact that I was now sitting on the floor, talking to a cat as if it understood every word."
"The receipt, which wasn’t a balled-up receipt at all. It was a piece of paper","torn from a journal, or perhaps a notebook, or—no. A planner. Serena’s incredibly outdated planner.",30,"The receipt, which wasn’t a balled-up receipt at all. It was a piece of paper that had been carefully folded and tucked into the pocket of the jacket. When unfolded, it revealed intricate drawings and notes that seemed to have no relation to any purchase. The handwriting was unfamiliar, and the dates on the paper suggested it might be from years ago. Curiosity piqued, I decided to investigate further, hoping to uncover its mysterious origins."
"Or maybe not quite. A distant bell rang, reminding me of a game Serena and I used to play as kids, a primitive substitution cipher we made up to gossip freely in front of our caregivers. We’d named it the butterfly alphabet, and","it mostly consisted of adding b- and f- syllables to normal words. Nothing complicated: even rusty as I was, it took my brain only a few seconds to untangle it. And once I was done, I had something. I had three whole words:",86,"Or maybe not quite. A distant bell rang, reminding me of a game Serena and I used to play as kids, a primitive substitution cipher we made up to gossip freely in front of our caregivers. We’d named it the butterfly alphabet, and it involved replacing each letter with another one a certain number of positions down the alphabet. The game was a mix of creativity and secrecy, allowing us to whisper secrets to each other without fear of being understood by adults. As we grew older, we lost touch, but the memory of that game stayed with me, a nostalgic reminder of simpler times. Sometimes, I still find myself using the butterfly alphabet to encode messages, a small way to keep a piece of our childhood alive. It’s funny how such simple things can leave such a lasting impact on us."
"I didn’t scream, or cry, or attack that old hag. I was paralyzed, unable to function properly for the rest of the night, and only started processing what had happened when I","got home and told Serena, who was furious on my behalf and demanded a promise from the caregiver on shift: that I would never be forced to attend a similar function again.",64,"I finally managed to gather my thoughts the next morning. The encounter had left me shaken, questioning my own sanity. I replayed the events in my mind, trying to find any logical explanation, but none came. The old woman had appeared out of nowhere, her eyes cold and calculating. She had spoken in riddles, leaving me more confused than ever. By the time I sought help, it was too late. The authorities were skeptical, and my story seemed too fantastical. Weeks passed, and I found myself haunted by the incident, unable to shake the feeling that something otherworldly had transpired. It wasn't until I stumbled upon an ancient book in the library that I began to piece together the truth. The old woman was no ordinary person; she was a guardian of forgotten knowledge, a being from a time long past. Her visit was a warning, a test of my resolve. I realized then that I had to confront my fears and embrace the unknown if I was to find peace."
"“Yes, thank you.” He nearly slumps in relief. “And, um, there are","no blood banks that cater to Vampyres in the area, because, well—”",24,"“Yes, thank you.” He nearly slumps in relief. “And, um, there are some things I need to discuss with you. Could we perhaps meet tomorrow? My schedule is a bit clearer then.” He trails off, hoping for a positive response."
"“Are you one of his seconds?” I ask Alex, turning away","from the waves lapping at the pier. “More— Lowe’s, I mean.”",22,"“No, I’m just a friend trying to help,” Alex replies, his voice tinged with a hint of frustration as he adjusts his tie nervously. “But I’ll do whatever it takes to see justice done.”"
"Alex mulls it. “Yes and no. There are some instincts that take over in that form, more than they otherwise would. The impulse to hunt,","for instance, is very powerful. To chase a scent, track down an enemy. That’s why you maybe shouldn’t venture out alone to . . .”",50,"Alex mulls it. “Yes and no. There are some instincts that take over in that form, more than they otherwise would. The impulse to hunt, to dominate, becomes almost overwhelming. It's a primal force that can't be fully suppressed, even when reason tries to assert itself. In those moments, the line between predator and prey blurs, and survival becomes the only priority. It's a dangerous state, one that Alex knows all too well. He's faced it before, and each time, it's a battle to maintain control. The question is, can he do it again? Or will the instinct consume him?"
Alex lets out a startled laugh. “He is the most powerful Were I’ve,ever seen. And that my grandfather has ever seen—and he’s seen many Alphas.”,26,"Alex lets out a startled laugh. “He is the most powerful Were I’ve ever encountered, blending seamlessly between human and beast without a trace of struggle. His transformation is nothing short of mesmerizing, a testament to his immense strength and control.”"
Serena’s face flashes through my head. She’s rolling her eyes because I’m wearing a galaxy T-shirt I,"got for free when I bought a lava lamp. Who wears this, Misery? No—who buys a lava lamp?",35,"of course, and she’s clearly annoyed. I know it’s a classic, but come on, it’s the only clean shirt I have. Her expression makes me chuckle despite the situation. We’re about to meet her boss, and I can feel the tension building. I need to keep my cool, but I can’t help but feel like this T-shirt is going to be the talk of the office."
"“Except, now I live here.” I play with my silver wedding band—a habit I’ve picked up in less than twenty-four hours. I’ve never been much for jewelry, but maybe I’ll",keep it when I find Serena and this is over.

I’ve never been much for jewelry, but maybe I’ll keep it on more often. It’s strange, this new life, this new home. I never thought I’d find myself here, in this small town, surrounded by people who seem to know each other. It’s like stepping into a story I didn’t write, but I’m the main character. Every morning, I watch the sun rise over the hills, wondering what the day will bring. The silence here is almost deafening, a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city I left behind. Yet, there’s something about this place that’s drawing me in, slowly, like a magnet. I’m not sure if I’ll stay, but for now, I’m content to just be here, to observe, to adapt. Life is unpredictable, and sometimes, you just have to go with the flow."
"The first time I searched online for L. E. Moreland, I found two things: a","semi-defunct GeoCities website promoting a wholly defunct real estate agent, and the infinite vastness of nothing.",31,"online genealogy forum where a user claimed to be a distant relative, and a blog post discussing the author's influence on Southern Gothic literature. Intrigued by these disparate entries, I decided to dig deeper into Moreland's life and works, discovering a rich tapestry of stories that span generations and genres."
"Deep in a Human server with ties to the governor’s office, hidden in a memo locked behind a bewildering number of passwords, I",discovered a communication regarding a summit that had occurred a couple of weeks earlier. Around the time Serena hadn’t shown up for laundry night.,47,"Infiltrating the server proved to be a monumental challenge, but with the right tools and knowledge, I managed to breach its defenses. The memo contained shocking revelations about a corruption scheme that implicated high-ranking officials. Racing against time, I knew I had to extract the information and expose the truth before it was too late. The governor's office was in turmoil, and whispers of an investigation were already spreading. My next move was critical, and I had to decide whether to go public or find a way to present the evidence internally. The stakes were incredibly high, and the pressure was mounting as I prepared to make my move."
"“What’s the plan?” Serena would ask if she were here, even though the little schemes she hatched never worked out. She liked the vibe of organizing","more than the actual job of it, and my usually impervious heart clenches a little at the thought that I cannot call her out on it.",52,"of a grand strategy, but when it came to execution, her ideas often fell flat. Her friends would laugh and suggest simpler solutions, yet Serena always insisted on her approach. It wasn't about winning or losing; it was about the thrill of the chase. Every failed attempt only fueled her next idea, and she found joy in the process. Serena's enthusiasm was infectious, and even when her plans didn't pan out, she left everyone inspired. The memory of her infectious laughter and boundless energy still lingers, a testament to the unique spirit she brought to every situation."
"“I didn’t think Vampyres could be beautiful.” There’s nothing complimentary about his words. He’s neither hitting on me, nor attempting to creep me out. Just stating a","simple fact, followed by another step toward me, and I’m suddenly very conscious that I’m at the end of a hallway. He stands between me and the exit.",55,"I find it fascinating how societal perceptions shape our understanding of beauty. Vampyres, with their pale skin and striking eyes, have always intrigued me. It's not about being scared or attracted; it's about appreciating the otherworldly allure that some find captivating. Perhaps it's the contrast between their dark appearance and the light they seem to embody that makes them so intriguing. I've always admired the way they challenge conventional notions of beauty, forcing us to question what truly defines it."
"“I doubt it.” I want to put a door between myself and Max, but the only one I can reach","is Lowe’s office—locked. I glance around for another escape route, but all I find is a giraffe painting of questionable quality.",41,"I grab is creaky, old-fashioned kitchen door. It's not sturdy, but it's all I have.

The silence on the other side of the door is comforting, but I know it's only temporary. What if he breaks it down? What if he finds a way through? The thought lingers, a constant shadow in the back of my mind, as I lean against the door, trying to catch my breath."
"“Remember what your people have taken from him. It’s almost as much as they’ve taken from me. And yet he’s making alliances with them like a common traitor.

And yet he’s making alliances with them like a common traitor. He married you, and said that he would protect you with his life, but now he’s siding with those who have wronged us. His actions are nothing short of betrayal, and I fear for what this means for our future. We must act swiftly to reclaim what is rightfully ours and ensure that such treachery is never tolerated again. The strength of our people lies in unity, and we must stand together to face this challenge. Let us not forget the sacrifices made by those who came before us, and let us honor their memory by fighting for what is just."
"A pair of hands a million times stronger than Max’s yanks me away. What happens next is too blurry to parse, but a moment later, I’m the","one sandwiched against the opposing wall.

I glance around, but the street is empty, save for the faint glow of streetlights. My mind races, trying to piece together what just happened. Was it real? Or was it all in my head? I shiver, not from the cold, but from the lingering fear that lingers in the air."

A Human, who would consider me a monster?",45,"It’s amusing to me, the idea that someone who has skimmed a synopsis of my life would assume I’ve had any sort of coherent narrative. Life, in its essence, is a series of unconnected moments, some bright, others dark, and most just... there. It’s easy to see patterns where none exist, to fill in the blanks with stories that make sense, but the truth is often messier. I’ve had moments of joy, of course, but also of profound loneliness and uncertainty. People often want to categorize experiences, to label them as successes or failures, but life is rarely so black and white. It’s a mosaic of experiences, and sometimes the most meaningful parts are the ones we don’t even notice at the time."

Serena jumped right into that, but I could not. I felt like I was always playing catch-up, as if I had missed out on so much. I watched her interact with others, the ease with which she made friends, the way she laughed and shared stories. It made me feel both envious and a little lost. I tried to join in, but it was hard. I didn’t know how to fit in, how to be the person I wanted to be. Serena noticed my discomfort and tried to include me more, but I still felt like an outsider. It wasn’t until later that I realized how much I had been holding myself back. I had been afraid of rejection, of not being good enough. Slowly, I began to open up, to let people in, and I found that I could belong too. It wasn’t easy, but it was worth it. "
"“But then you’d get mad because Father and I weren’t paying attention to you, and wander off on your own, grumbling about",the oddest things. Let me know if that changes.

You both knew that it wasn’t really about you, but about the unspoken expectations and the way things had always been done in your family. It was a cycle that neither of you could break, and it left a bitter taste in your mouth every time."

"It’s a barbecue, or a potluck, or a cookout—I never quite got the difference, despite Serena’s explanations on the nuances of Human social get-togethers.

The air between us seems to hum with unspoken words, each second stretching into eternity. I close my eyes, savoring the moment before reality sets in, and the weight of what's to come."
"Serena loved berries, and I tried memorizing their names, but they’re so counterintuitive. Blueberries? Not blue. Blackberries? Not","black. Strawberries? Straw free. Raspberries? Do not rasp, or make any noise at all. I could go on.",36,"Blackberries? Not black. Raspberries? Not raspberries. They all have such misleading names, yet Serena could instantly identify them by sight. I envied her ability to connect with nature so effortlessly, while I struggled to remember these quirky facts. Maybe it was because she grew up picking them in her grandmother's garden, while I just read about them in books. Either way, I resolved to spend more time outdoors, learning from her and the world around me."
"He takes out two slices of bread. His forearms are strong, large muscles interrupted by the occasional white scar. “If Were","business is involved, you might not know what you’re looking for. I’ll have you talk with Alex and hand them over to—”",43,"He takes out two slices of bread. His forearms are strong, large muscles interrupted by the occasional white scar. “If we want to survive, we need to work together,” he says, his voice steady despite the tension in the room. The kitchen is dimly lit, the only light coming from a small lamp on the counter. His eyes meet mine, and I can see the determination in them. We have faced worse, he seems to be saying, and we will face this too. The silence between us is heavy, but it's a comfortable silence, one that we both understand. Together, we can do anything."
“I can only protect Ana if I know where the threats against her are coming from.” He leans forward across,"the table. The scent of his blood is like a wave lapping at my skin. “I’m not like your father, Misery.”",41,"“I can only protect Ana if I know where the threats against her are coming from.” He leans forward across the small table, his eyes locking onto hers with a mixture of determination and concern. “Ana, you have to trust me. I need you to be honest with me about everything. Even the smallest details could be crucial. Are you being followed? Have you noticed anyone acting suspiciously around you?” Ana nods slowly, her voice barely above a whisper, “I’ve been careful, but I can’t shake the feeling that someone is watching me.” He nods, his brow furrowing as he takes in her words, “We need to be more careful then. I’ll increase security around you, but you have to promise me you’ll stay vigilant too. This person is dangerous, Ana, and we need to stay one step ahead.”"
"I know what Vampyres smell like, what their needs and limitations are.",And Ana is not one of us. Which leaves one single other possibility.,25,"I've spent years studying them, from their diet of blood to their heightened senses. Their weakness to sunlight and garlic is well-documented, but there's more to their existence than just folklore. They crave not only sustenance but also companionship, forming bonds that can be both fierce and fleeting. Understanding their world has given me a unique perspective on life and death itself."
"“I was living in Europe when my mother was injured, but immediately flew back. When it","became obvious that she might not make a recovery, she told me about Ana’s biological father.”",32,"I arrived, the first thing I did was to call the hospital. The doctors explained that my mother had suffered a severe injury to her leg, but that she was stable. The next few days were a blur as I coordinated her care, arranging for specialists and ensuring she had everything she needed. It was a difficult time, but I was grateful for the support of my family and friends who helped me through it all."
"His mouth curves infinitesimally, like he’s tempted to do just that, and I smile, too. Our",eyes hold for a beat before he continues: “Ana doesn’t know who her real father is.”,32,"Our eyes lock, and for a moment, the world seems to pause. There's an unspoken understanding between us, a silent agreement that this moment is precious. I lean in slightly, and he does the same, our breaths mingling in the quiet air. Time stretches out, holding us in this perfect stillness before the inevitable shift."
"“Or of a chicken coop, if you ask me.” I","bite my lower lip, mulling it over. “Who is Ana’s father?”",21,"“Or of a chicken coop, if you ask me.” I think it's a place where chickens roost and lay eggs, simple as that. It's not about grandeur but functionality, a humble shelter for our feathered friends."
"“My mother never told me. My impression is that he already had a family,","and that when she attempted to mention Ana to him, he . . .”",28,"My mother never told me. My impression is that he already had a family. It was a secret that everyone seemed to know except for me. I often wondered about the woman and children he left behind when I learned the truth. The guilt and confusion stayed with me for years, shaping my views on trust and honesty."
"“And here I was, thinking we were firmly in the reluctant alliance stage of our marriage.” I don’t mind the supervision. It’s more that Alex appears","to be as good a hacker as I am—the one area in which I allow myself to be competitive. “Okay. Thanks,” I add, a bit sullen.",52,"of this arrangement than I do the constant scrutiny. We’ve been through so much together, and now this? It feels like we’re backtracking, like all our progress has been erased. I want to trust him, but every action feels like a test. Maybe it’s just the stress of the situation, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is off. I need to talk to him, to understand what’s really going on. This isn’t about me; it’s about us. We need to find a way to move forward, not backward. I hope we can still salvage what we have. It’s not too late, right? I need to believe that."
"I’m at the bottom of the stairs when Ana comes racing down the steps, almost crashing into me. Her eyes are full of tears, and my","heart clenches. “Are you okay?” I ask, but she runs past me, straight toward her brother. She’s babbling something about bad dreams and waking up scared.",52,"I’m at the bottom of the stairs when Ana comes racing down the steps, almost crashing into me. Her eyes are full of tears, and my heart skips a beat as I instinctively reach out to steady her. ""Ana, what's wrong?"" I ask, my voice laced with concern. She takes a deep breath, trying to compose herself, but the tears keep falling. ""It's my mom,"" she says between sobs. ""She's in the hospital. They found something serious."" My world seems to spin as I process the gravity of her words. Without a second thought, I grab my keys and phone, ready to support her through this difficult time. We rush to the car, the silence between us heavy with the weight of the news. As we drive, I hold her hand tightly, offering what little comfort I can in this moment of crisis."
"And yet, I carry on. Even after overhearing Alex say, “Please, please, don’t let me die until I","turn twenty-five or I get to visit the the Spy Museum, whatever comes first.” Yeah. He prays a lot.",37,"And yet, I carry on. Even after overhearing Alex say, “Please, please, don’t let me die until I finish this novel,” I couldn’t help but feel a mix of emotions. Anger at his selfishness, fear for my own safety, and a strange sense of admiration for his determination. The words echoed in my mind as I made my way home, each step heavier than the last. I knew I had to confront him, but the thought of facing him alone made my heart race. What if he really meant it? What if this was the end? These thoughts swirled in my head, creating a storm of uncertainty that I struggled to navigate. As I reached my apartment, I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what was to come. The night stretched before me, filled with unknowns and possibilities, and I found myself wondering if I would ever find peace again."
"“I cannot begin to imagine how traumatizing it must have been for Ana, seeing her",only parent be hurt by the single Were whose authority she’d been raised to never question.”,31,"her own sister being accused of a crime she did not commit. The lies and the whispers that followed were unbearable. Ana felt like she was losing her grip on reality, unsure of whom to trust or what to believe. Every day was a battle, a constant struggle to maintain her sanity in the face of such betrayal."
"“ ’Cause I’m a Vampyre.” She accepts the explanation. Probably because she accepts me. Like Serena used to, and no one","else ever. I turn the page, and we’re silent for three more minutes, her breath hot and humid against my cheek.",42,"She looks at me with a mix of curiosity and something else, perhaps hope. I can feel the tension in the air, a silent acknowledgment that we're both walking a fine line. The world around us seems to slow down, the neon lights of the city flickering like our fragile connection. I wonder if she knows what I am, or if she's just as lost as I am. Either way, there's a bond forming, one that transcends words. As we stand there, the night feels like it's holding its breath, waiting for what comes next."
"“As it’s not hemoglobin or peanut based, nothing. So.” I clap my hands. The cicadas quiet, then resume their singing after a disoriented pause. “Tell me if I got it right: You’ll use your meeting with Emery as an excuse to plant some spyware or interceptor that will allow you to monitor her communications","and gain proof that she’s leading the Loyals. But you are going into enemy territory alone, and have the computer skills of an octogenarian Luddite, which puts you at great risk. Actually, no need to tell me if I’m right, I already know. When are you plunging to your imminent death? Tomorrow or Friday?”",108,"“Got it. I’ll make sure to plant it subtly, so she doesn’t suspect a thing. I’ll need to find a moment when she’s alone, maybe during a coffee break or when she’s distracted by a phone call. Once it’s in place, I’ll have access to her emails, calls, and texts. I’ll monitor her every move, every conversation, and every interaction. I need to be thorough, but not too obvious. I don’t want her to catch on and start being more cautious. I’ll have to keep an eye on her social media too, just in case she’s sharing something incriminating. This is going to be tricky, but I’ve done worse. I’ll make sure to report back to you as soon as I have something concrete. Until then, keep an eye on her from a distance. I’ll handle the rest.”"
"I can’t imagine. Or can I? Those first few days after Serena was gone, and I was so frantically preoccupied with",looking for her that it didn’t occur to me to bathe or feed until my head pounded and my body was feverish.,43,"I was so frantically preoccupied with the logistics of her absence that I barely noticed the subtle changes in my own behavior. Each day felt like a new challenge, and I found myself questioning everything. How could I have been so blind? So many moments now seem so clear, yet at the time, I was lost in a haze of grief and confusion. It wasn't until much later that I realized how much I had taken her for granted. The silence in the house was deafening, and I often found myself talking to her, hoping for a response. Those days were a blur, filled with tears and endless nights of restless sleep. It was only when I started reaching out to friends and family that I began to heal, slowly but surely."
"“It’s just . . .” I’m not sure what’s so concerning about the idea of him seeing them. Maybe I’m just remembering being nine, and the way my Human caregivers always stopped smiling the second I","began. A driver, making the sign of the cross.

Maybe I’m just remembering being nine, and the way my Human caregivers always stopped smiling the second I walked into the room. It was as if I carried some invisible weight that made them uncomfortable. Now, years later, I find myself in a similar situation, wondering if I’m projecting my own insecurities onto this new scenario. What if he sees through my facade just as easily as they did? The thought lingers, a shadow that refuses to be dismissed, haunting me with questions I can’t quite articulate. How do I move past this? How do I stop letting the past dictate my present? These are the thoughts that keep me up at night, replaying in my mind like an endless loop, seeking answers that may never come."
"The sharks gnaw at the inner walls of my skull, and I won’t be able to make them stop until I find Serena, but in the","meantime, I can distract them. “Anyway.” I sit up with a smile. “Since I so selflessly opened my heart to you, will you tell me something?”",52,"The endless labyrinth of my own mind, I wander, searching for any clue, any whisper of her whereabouts. The sharks, relentless, seem to grow larger, their teeth sharper, gnawing deeper into my sanity. Every shadow, every flicker of light, is a potential sign of Serena.

"“No.” He stares at the moonlit water. “When we were young, I was there when Koen’s sister met her mate. We were on a run. She smelled her, suddenly went real still",in the middle of the field. I thought she was having a stroke.” He smiles. “She said that it felt like discovering new colors. Like the rainbow had gained a few stripes.”,64,"He watched as Koen’s sister’s eyes widened, a mix of emotions flickering across her face. She turned to him, her voice barely above a whisper, asking if he had seen it too—the way the air seemed to hum with something otherworldly. They stood there, frozen, as the moonlight painted everything in a silvery glow, the water reflecting the scene like a mirror. It was as if the night itself held its breath, waiting for the next move. Koen’s sister broke the silence, her voice trembling, “Do you think...?” He nodded slowly, understanding the unspoken question. “Yes, I think we both saw what we think we saw.” The night was quiet, save for the gentle lapping of water against the shore. Neither of them moved, lost in the moment, unsure if they should pursue what they had witnessed or let it remain a secret between them. The stars above seemed to watch, indifferent yet knowing."
He nods. “I need to send Emery and her people the message that you’re part,of my pack and no violence against you will be tolerated. Not just the verbal message.”,31,"He nods. “I need to send Emery and her people the message that you’re part of our team, and we stand by you through thick and thin.

Your safety is our top priority, and we won’t rest until this is resolved.”"
"Koen is an asshole, in the most delicious and entertaining of ways. He seems","to have distinct preferences, strong opinions, and little interest in keeping either to himself.",28,"Koen is an asshole, in the most delicious and entertaining of ways. He seems to have a knack for pushing all the right buttons at the wrong times, leaving you laughing one moment and cursing the next.
