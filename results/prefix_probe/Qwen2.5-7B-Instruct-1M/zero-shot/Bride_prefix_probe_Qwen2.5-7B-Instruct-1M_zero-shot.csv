"Not quite the stuff of childhood dreams. Then again, I’m no dreamer. I only ever contemplated marriage once, back in the gloomy days of my childhood. Following a few too-harsh punishments and a","poorly executed assassination attempt, Serena and I concocted plans for a grand escape, which was going to involve pyrotechnics-based diversions, stealing our math tutor’s car, and flipping off our caregivers in the rearview mirror.","In those days, I believed that love and happiness came easily, but life had other plans.

The punishments, though severe, were just the beginning of a series of challenges that shaped who I am today. I’ve since learned that true strength lies in resilience, not in the absence of fear. Marriage, as I once envisioned it, now seems like a distant dream, but I’ve come to terms with that. What matters most is the journey, the lessons learned, and the people we meet along the way. Life is a series of chapters, and each one teaches us something valuable. So, while I may not have the traditional fairy tale ending, I’ve found my own kind of happiness in unexpected places."
"That was fourteen years ago, though, and Serena never married me. In fact, she’s long gone.

I did try to arrange a meeting. Suggested to my people that they suggest to his people that we could grab lunch the week before the ceremony. Coffee the previous day. A glass of tap water the morning of—anything to avoid a “How do you do?” in front of the officiant. My request,"was escalated to the Vampyre council, and resulted in a phone call from one of the members’ aides.

The day of the ceremony arrived, and as I stood before the officiant, I took a deep breath and extended my hand. To my surprise, he did the same, and the exchange was far less awkward than I had anticipated. It was a small victory, but one that left me feeling relieved and more confident in my ability to navigate such situations in the future."

"The first things I notice are the two walls of windows, which is exactly what Father wants.

"“Whose? Yours? Are you going to . . .” I don’t bother finishing the sentence—the sheer thought is ludicrous. It’s not just weddings that have gone out of fashion hundreds of years ago, but the entire idea","of long-term relationships. As it turns out, when your species sucks at producing children, encouraging sexual walkabouts and the search for reproductively compatible partners takes precedence over romance.

People now seek companionship and emotional connection in ways that don't necessarily involve lifelong commitments. The concept of two people merging their lives into one, sharing everything from finances to daily routines, is increasingly seen as outdated. Instead, there's a growing preference for relationships that are more flexible, where individuals can maintain their independence while still enjoying the benefits of a close partnership. This shift reflects changing societal values and the desire for greater personal freedom. While traditional weddings may still hold significance for some, the broader cultural narrative is moving towards more diverse and individualized expressions of love and partnership."

"“You hold a Human child as a deterrent for ten years, with the mutual understanding that if the Humans","violate the terms of our alliance, the Vampyres will instantly murder the child.

I could feel the eyes of everyone in the room on me, waiting for some kind of reaction, but I remained composed, a skill honed from years of practice. The moment felt surreal, as if time had paused just for me. I knew then that this was different, that this was the moment when everything changed. The weight of the situation settled on me, and I realized that calmness under pressure was no longer just a skill—it was a necessity. From that day on, I carried that moment with me, a constant reminder of the importance of staying composed in the face of uncertainty."
"“A few days? She still wouldn’t let the little asshole starve,” I hurried to add, but the officer had already dropped his pen. And even though I went back to the station three times that week, and eventually managed to get a missing person report filed, no one did anything","to find Serena. The hazard, I guess, of being alone in the world: no one to care that she was safe, and healthy, and alive. No one but me, and I didn’t count. I shouldn’t have been surprised, and I wasn’t. But apparently I still had the capacity to feel hurt.","It was as if the system was designed to protect the status quo, not the people who needed help.

I found myself questioning whether the police were truly there to serve and protect, or if they were just another layer of bureaucracy. The weeks turned into months, and still, there was no sign of her. I began to feel like a voice in the wind, my pleas falling on deaf ears. The case was closed, but the wound remained open, a constant reminder of the system's failures. I started volunteering at a local shelter, hoping to make a difference in some small way. Every day, I met people who had stories just as heartbreaking, if not more so. It made me realize that change had to come from within, and that sometimes, the fight was just beginning."

Through her, I learned that true love and loyalty are not measured by blood but by the depth of one's commitment and care. Serena's presence in my life was a gift, a reminder that even in the most desolate of times, there is always someone who sees you for who you truly are."
"I had the keys, after all. Because the key to everything is but a line of code. I was able to rifle through her bank statements, IP addresses, cell phone locations. Herald emails, metadata, app usage. Serena was a journalist, one who","wrote about delicate financial stuff, and the most likely option was that she’d gotten embroiled in something fishy while working on a story, but I wasn’t going to exclude other possibilities.

Or had I been living in a world of my own creation, shaped by the very information I was now unearthing? I found evidence of sources she had been in contact with, hints of stories she was working on that could potentially rock the foundations of several powerful institutions. The lines between right and wrong began to blur, and I realized that the truth, once exposed, could have consequences that would ripple far beyond what either of us could have anticipated."
"And that’s when I did it: I kneeled in front of Serena’s damn fucking cat. He was playing like he always did after dinner, pawing at a crumpled receipt in a corner of the living room, but managed to squeeze a couple of hisses into his busy schedule just for me. “Listen.” I swallowed. Rubbed my","hand on my chest and then even slapped it, trying to dull the ache. “I know you only knew her for a few days, but I really, really . . .” I scrunched my eyes shut. Oh fuck, this was hard. “I don’t know how it happened, but I think that Serena might be . . .”","And I rubbed my hands together, trying to look nonchalant, but my heart was racing.

The cat, a sleek black tabby with green eyes, paused mid-paw, his tail flicking back and forth. I took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the moment. ""I need you to stay here, okay? Just for a moment. I promise I won't hurt you."" The cat's ears twitched, and he let out a low growl, but he didn't move. I exhaled slowly, relief washing over me. ""Thank you, buddy. You have no idea how much this means to me."" I stood up, my legs wobbly, and made my way to the kitchen. The cat watched me go, his eyes never leaving me. I returned a few minutes later with a small dish of water and a treat. ""Here you go, friend,"" I said, placing the dish on the floor. The cat sniffed it cautiously, then ate it. I smiled, feeling a strange sense of accomplishment. ""You're a good boy,"" I whispered, patting the floor beside me. The cat stretched out, curling up in a perfect circle, and closed his eyes. I sat down beside him, feeling a strange bond forming. ""I guess we're going to be friends now,"" I said, laughing softly. The cat opened one eye, then the other, and let out a contented purr."

"Or maybe not quite. A distant bell rang, reminding me of a game Serena and I used to play as kids, a primitive substitution cipher we made up to gossip freely in front of our caregivers.

We would spend hours creating our own secret language, using it to plan our after-school adventures or simply to share our day-to-day experiences. The bell continued to ring, a soft, muffled sound that seemed to echo through the old house, stirring up memories of simpler times. It was a sound that always brought back the warmth of those carefree days, when the world was full of possibilities and the future seemed endless. The butterfly alphabet was more than just a game; it was a symbol of our friendship, a bond that has lasted through the years, even as life took us in different directions."
"I didn’t scream, or cry, or attack that old hag. I was paralyzed, unable to function properly for the rest of the night, and only started processing what had happened when I","got home and told Serena, who was furious on my behalf and demanded a promise from the caregiver on shift: that I would never be forced to attend a similar function again.","I finally managed to gather my thoughts the next morning.

The authorities were skeptical, and my story seemed too fantastical. Weeks passed, and I found myself haunted by the incident, unable to shake the feeling that something otherworldly had transpired. It wasn't until I stumbled upon an ancient book in a forgotten library that I began to uncover the truth behind the old woman's visit. The revelation was both terrifying and enlightening, forcing me to confront aspects of reality I had never considered before."
