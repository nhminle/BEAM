"They approached the altar positioned at the edge of the cliff and gazed out at the dramatic view of the Kona coastline just as the sun was dipping into the ocean. Gopal Das (Brimmer and May/Groton/Williams/UC Berkeley/Four Winds Shaman School), a tall, lanky Caucasian",man in his midforties with shoulder-length strawberry-blond hair and a matching beard stretched out his densely freckled arms in a godlike manner. “Let us welcome this blessed sunset.

His presence was almost ethereal, as if he had stepped out of a mystical tale. The wind whispered through the trees, carrying with it the scent of salt and earth, a perfect symphony to the breathtaking scene. He felt a deep connection to the land, a bond that transcended time and space. As the last rays of sunlight kissed the horizon, he closed his eyes, allowing the moment to seep into his soul. The tranquility of the moment was only broken by the distant call of a seabird, a reminder of the vastness of the world beyond the cliff. He took a deep breath, feeling both humbled and inspired. The journey ahead was uncertain, but this moment would forever be etched in his memory, a beacon of peace and clarity."
"Gopal Das tucked the tight white tee that showed off his sinewy pecs into his camo-green cargo shorts and said, “Close your eyes. Now breathe","in deeply…. Let your first chakra connect with the ground, rooting in the earth, connecting with Gaia, connecting with spirit.

Now breathe in slowly through your nose, hold it for a count of four, and exhale through your mouth for a count of six.

The forest around them was quiet, save for the distant calls of birds and the rustling of leaves in the breeze. Gopal’s eyes scanned the area, ensuring they were alone, before he continued, “This spot is perfect for what we have in mind. Let’s make sure we’re both prepared.”"

You’d be quite dead if that were the case,” Thomas said, looking down at the prone figure of his friend, whose pale face and shallow breathing told him that immediate medical attention was crucial.

"Arabella bolted up from the chaise, her cashmere eye pillow falling to the floor. “Spectacular? Seeing that almost killed me! That lava you",see is a volcanic fissure that opened up earlier today—right in the middle of the garden where Augusta’s wedding ceremony is supposed to be!”,47,"of the volcano was so intense, I thought I'd never see another sunrise. I had to get out of there, fast. The heat was unbearable, and the ash made it hard to breathe. I ran as far as my legs could carry me, not daring to look back. When I finally stopped, I realized I was in a small village, its inhabitants staring at me with curiosity. I needed help, but I didn't know where to turn. The villagers, sensing my distress, offered their assistance, leading me to a nearby clinic where I could clean up and recover. It was a close call, but I survived to tell the tale."
*3 Although “cottage” could be rather misleading for the spacious four-bedroom house with a thatched roof,"that was decomposing so perfectly, Thomas was constantly finding DIY influencers taking selfies by the garden gate.",33,"In rural areas, such properties often come with large gardens and ample space for outdoor activities. The thatched roof adds a unique charm and requires regular maintenance to preserve its aesthetic appeal and functionality. Many buyers are drawn to these homes for their historical significance and the peaceful countryside setting they offer, making them ideal for those seeking a quieter lifestyle away from urban bustle."
"*4 Though Arabella was raised speaking the Queen’s English in what was then the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong and spoke with the poshest of accents, whenever she came into contact with other Asians—particularly","family members and service people—her accent would take on the inflections and sentence structuring that were peculiar to upper-crust Hong Kongers.

Despite her fluency in English, she often found herself struggling to find common ground with those who spoke different dialects or languages. It wasn't until she visited her grandparents in rural China that she began to understand the depth of her cultural heritage. This experience led her to embrace her identity more fully, blending her English upbringing with the rich traditions of her Asian roots. Arabella realized that her accent was just one part of who she was, and that embracing her full heritage made her stronger and more complete."
"“That’s because I’m the only one around here who eats carbs,” Eden said as she took","a bite of her chocolate croissant, still warm from the oven. “You really ought to try one.”",33,"Eden continued, ""and I can't even finish my plate, yet I still feel guilty about it. Everyone else here is on some kind of diet or the other, but carbs are my weakness. I guess that's why I always end up being the odd one out at meal times."" Eden sighed, realizing that her love for carbs wasn't going away anytime soon, and maybe it was time to find a healthier way to indulge without feeling so guilty."

Eden, you’ll offer your assistance, won’t you, in our time of need?”",32,"Suddenly Arabella’s eyes lit up and she seemed to recover slightly. “Yes, she will be good for the role, I can feel it.

I nodded, feeling a bit overwhelmed by the praise but also touched. ""I try my best,"" I replied, ""but it's not always easy. Babies can be quite demanding.""

"Arabella credits her own mother for her confidence to upend centuries of tradition. “My mother grew up in Shanghai, which was the Paris of the East, so for her, Asian Fusion wasn’t a fad, it was a way of life.” Arabella’s barrister father","hailed from one of Hong Kong’s most respected legal families. “People are constantly surprised to learn that I didn’t grow up in a rice paddy. My grandfather and father both went to Oxford, and we had a house in Kowloon Tong with five servants.”",87,"Arabella’s barrister father, though stern and traditional, encouraged her to explore her mother’s heritage. He believed that understanding one’s roots was crucial, even if it meant challenging long-standing customs. Arabella took this advice to heart, using it as a foundation to create her own unique identity. She started by learning Mandarin, which not only connected her to her mother’s past but also opened doors to a new world of culinary and cultural experiences. Her mother’s stories of Shanghai inspired her to blend Eastern and Western flavors in her cooking, leading to the creation of dishes that were both familiar and exciting. This fusion approach became the cornerstone of her restaurant, which quickly gained popularity for its innovative yet comforting menu. Arabella’s journey was not without its challenges, but her unwavering confidence and the support of her family helped her overcome them. Today, she continues to push boundaries, always striving to create something new and exciting that bridges the gap between East and West."
"The countess never imagined that her modern spin on Marco Polo would spawn her own design and hospitality empire, but after a famously finicky Qatari prince spent the weekend and was wowed by the countess’s hospitality, he commanded her to design a hotel in London “for people who can only bear to stay in palaces when they travel,” promising to book out","the entire place every year for the London Season. Arabella quickly conceived of Bella’s, the gemlike London oasis that has set the standard for boutique establishments everywhere.

Her unique vision had struck a chord with discerning travelers who sought more than just a place to rest their heads. The hotel in London, named ""Palace Escape,"" was a testament to her philosophy of blending opulence with comfort. The prince's endorsement had opened doors to other wealthy patrons, and soon, the countess found herself designing hotels in cities across Europe and Asia. Each project was tailored to the tastes of its intended clientele, ensuring that every guest felt like royalty. The countess's success was not just about aesthetics; it was about creating an experience that exceeded expectations. She believed in the power of hospitality to transform lives, and her empire was a reflection of that belief. As the countess continued to expand her reach, she remained true to her roots, always striving to offer the best in luxury and service.

The chorus of birds outside sounded more spirited than anything she’d heard before, and they had been at it all night. Having arrived very late the previous evening, she found herself in a quaint village nestled amidst rolling hills. The air was crisp and fresh, carrying with it the scent of pine and earth. She stretched, feeling the stiffness in her muscles from the long journey. The village was quiet, save for the birds, and she could see the first rays of sunlight peeking over the horizon. Curiosity piqued, Eden decided to explore, eager to uncover the secrets of this hidden place. As she wandered through the cobblestone streets, she noticed the vibrant colors of the morning light filtering through the leaves of the trees. The village seemed to be awakening, with the occasional sound of a cart creaking down the road or a dog barking in the distance. Eden felt a sense of peace, as if the world had paused just for her. She knew this was a place she would never forget, and she was excited to discover what else it had to offer."
“Watch your step!” came a shout behind her. Eden looked down and saw the large gray rock,she was about to step on suddenly move. It was a sea turtle basking in the sun.,34,"Eden took a cautious step around it, her heart racing as she wondered if she was being followed. The forest seemed to close in around her, the dense canopy casting long shadows that danced eerily on the ground. She quickened her pace, her eyes scanning the path ahead, but the shout echoed in her mind, urging her to be vigilant. The air grew colder, and a sudden gust of wind rustled the leaves, making her shiver. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was not alone in the woods that day."
"“Oh my god!” Eden exclaimed, backing off. She turned around to see",a woman in her late twenties sitting on a sun-bleached tree trunk.,24,"""What the heck is that?"" Eden whispered, her heart pounding. She couldn't believe her eyes as a towering figure emerged from the shadows, its eyes glowing an eerie red. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end, and she felt a cold sweat break out on her forehead. ""Who are you?"" she managed to choke out, her voice trembling. The figure took a step forward, and Eden's legs turned to jelly, threatening to give way beneath her. She knew she had to get out of there, but her feet seemed glued to the spot."
"“I should put on some proper clothes first,” Eden said, realizing she was still",in her sleeping clothes—an old pair of cotton jersey shorts and a skinny tee.,28,"“wearing my old, tattered sweatshirt and jeans,” Eden continued, glancing down at her attire with a mix of embarrassment and self-consciousness.

“Why? Are you going to the Wolseley? Look how I’m dressed.” Rufus gestured to his tattered board shorts and bare feet as they cut through a wooded path that led from the beach to a road that to Eden seemed straight out of a dream. Tall coconut,"palms, fragrant hibiscus bushes, and mango trees lined the winding lane of relaxed old bungalows and wooden beach cottages next door to the occasional sprawling mansion. Rufus reached up into one of the low-hanging branches as they walked past and plucked two ripe mangoes. “For breakfast.” He grinned.",95,"Rufus shrugged, his voice tinged with a mix of curiosity and a hint of self-consciousness. ""I dunno, maybe. The place just seems... different. Like it's not real."" He paused, glancing around at the dense greenery that surrounded them. ""It's like the trees are whispering secrets to each other, and the wind carries them away before you can catch them."" They continued walking, the path narrowing slightly as they approached the road. Rufus's eyes widened as they reached the edge of the forest, revealing a sprawling estate that seemed to stretch endlessly. The house itself was a grand Victorian structure, its paint peeling and windows dark, as if it hadn't seen a soul in years. ""Eden,"" Rufus whispered, his heart pounding in his chest. ""This is Eden."" He took a step forward, his bare feet sinking slightly into the soft earth. ""But why do I feel like I've been here before?"" He turned to Eden, who was staring at the house with a mixture of awe and fear. ""Eden, do you know what this place is?"" Eden shook their head, their eyes wide. ""I don't know, Rufus. But I think we're about to find out."" Rufus swallowed hard, the weight of the unknown pressing down on him. As they approached the house, the air seemed to grow heavier, as if the very atmosphere was holding its breath. The door creaked open as they reached it, and Rufus stepped inside, the cool darkness enveloping him like a blanket. The house was silent, save for the faint sound of footsteps echoing somewhere in the distance. Rufus felt a chill run down his spine, and he knew that this was just the beginning of a journey that would change everything."
"“Puako Beach Road is one of the only places left on the entire island that still has these original cottages from the sixties right on the beach,” Rufus","explained. “It’s a real neighborhood, as opposed to some poncy resort. You love hunting down the local hangouts whenever you travel, so I thought you’d prefer it over here.”",57,"Rufus continued, ""It's a rare find, really. These cottages are not just a relic of the past, but a piece of Hawaii's history. They've withstood the test of time, offering a glimpse into what life was like for the early beachgoers. The architecture is simple yet charming, with large windows that let in the ocean breeze and views that are nothing short of breathtaking. It's a place where you can almost hear the echoes of laughter and the sound of waves crashing against the shore."""
Rufus gestured outside. On one end of the back deck was an outdoor shower nestled between thick tropical bushes and a,wall of stacked volcanic rocks. Rufus pointed to a galvanized steel cistern on the roof. “That tank collects rainwater for the shower.”,43,"Rufus gestured outside. On one end of the back deck was an outdoor shower nestled between thick tropical bushes and a weathered wooden bench. The shower's rusted nozzle glistened under the afternoon sun, inviting anyone to wash away the day's grime. Nearby, a hammock swayed gently, offering a perfect spot for a post-shower nap. The vibrant greenery of the tropical bushes provided a cool, refreshing backdrop, while the distant hum of insects filled the air. Rufus smiled, knowing this hidden gem of a shower was a favorite among guests, offering a moment of tranquility in the heart of nature."
"“Now, you and I both know that Rufus is wasting his life away",in Hawaii. It’s high time Rufus settled down and did something with his life…”,27,"“Now, you and I both know that Rufus is wasting his life away on meaningless pursuits while ignoring his true passions and talents.

"“Not only is she to the manor born, she is to the hotel born too!” Bea jumped in. “The de Courcys own a fabulous crop of hotels all over",France and the French Caribbean.

Lost in the story, she barely noticed the time passing until she heard her name being called softly from inside the house."
"“Mmm. Love it.” Eden smiled as she took a long, slow sip, closed her eyes, and eased into her chair.

She wondered if they missed her as much as she missed them, if the silence in their home was as deafening as the waves crashing against the shore. A tear escaped, rolling down her cheek as she realized how much she longed for the simplicity of her past life."

"“Yes! I had nothing to wear for this evening and they came to my rescue.

"“How can you say such a thing, Countess? I have known Eden since my very first visit to Greshamsbury Hall three years ago, and the girls and I even went camping in the Outer Hebrides","last year.

It's hard to believe that just three years have passed since those camping days. Now, whenever I visit, we always find time to catch up, and I look forward to our next adventure together.
