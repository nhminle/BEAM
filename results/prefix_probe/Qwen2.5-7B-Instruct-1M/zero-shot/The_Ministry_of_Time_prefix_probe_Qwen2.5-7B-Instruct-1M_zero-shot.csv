"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.","Graham found himself grappling with the profound disorientation that came with returning to the nineteenth century.

The world around him seemed to move at a slower pace, and the people he encountered were strangers to his modern sensibilities. He missed the conveniences of the future, the instant communication, and the advanced medical care that had saved his life. Yet, he also felt a deep sense of loss for the world he had left behind. The extraction process had not only taken a physical toll but also a psychological one. He often found himself questioning the ethics of time travel and the impact it had on both the past and the future. As he adjusted to his new reality, Graham couldn't help but wonder if he would ever fully belong in either time. The other expats, though they shared his experiences, seemed to be adapting more easily, perhaps because they had been there longer. Graham, however, felt like an outsider, a relic from a time long past, unsure of his place in the world."

The garden, though small, was meticulously maintained, a testament to the care taken by the previous tenants. Inside, the house retained much of its original charm, with high ceilings and large windows that let in plenty of natural light. Despite its age, the structure was solid, a testament to the craftsmanship of its builders. The Ministry had made sure to keep the house in good condition, ensuring that Gore, if he had lived, would have found a comfortable and familiar place to call home."

The small mirror above the sink reflected his determined yet weary face, a stark contrast to the confident persona he projected in public.

Men in their right minds are reluctant to embrace change, especially when it comes to tools that have served them well for generations. Gore, however, found himself in a world that was rapidly shifting from the familiar to the unfamiliar. The steam engine had begun to replace the wind, and the telegraph was starting to weave its way into the fabric of daily life. It was a time of great upheaval, and those who clung too tightly to the past risked being left behind. Gore, though, was not one to resist change entirely. He saw the value in adapting, even if it meant stepping outside his comfort zone. The future, after all, was not something to be feared but something to be embraced, albeit cautiously."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people.

His home was a veritable library, filled with books that spanned centuries and genres. Gore was a man of many talents, but it was his ability to connect with people that truly set him apart. He had an uncanny knack for making everyone feel like they were the center of his world, no matter the setting. Whether it was a casual dinner or a formal gathering, Gore always managed to make the conversation flow effortlessly, often with a touch of humor that could lighten even the most somber of moments. His wit and charm made him a beloved figure in his community, and his legacy continues to inspire those who knew him."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea.

His mind, however, remained anchored in the past, a time when the world moved at a slower, more deliberate pace. He often spoke of the importance of preserving the past, of not letting the relentless march of progress erase the rich tapestry of history. Gore believed that every era had its own unique charm and that it was crucial to appreciate the beauty of the past while also embracing the future. He would often lament the loss of traditional craftsmanship and the disappearance of certain skills that had been passed down through generations. Despite his longing for the past, Gore was also a forward thinker, recognizing the need for innovation and progress. He once said, ""We must learn from the past, adapt to the present, and prepare for the future."" His thoughts on the subject were often shared in his writings and speeches, where he urged people to strike a balance between nostalgia and progress. Gore's perspective on the world was one of a man who had seen too much change and too much loss, and he hoped that future generations would learn from his experiences."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake.

But there was also fear—fear of the consequences, fear of losing the friendship that had once been so important to me. In the end, we talked it out, and while the trust was damaged, we managed to rebuild it, albeit on a different foundation. It was a lesson in honesty and the importance of being true to oneself, even when it’s hard."

He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and began his routine with a brisk walk around the block. His days were filled with a quiet, almost serene rhythm, punctuated by the occasional visit to the local library or a quiet afternoon spent reading on the porch. Graham had a knack for finding joy in the simplest of things, and his contentment was infectious. I often found myself drawn to his calm, envying his ability to find peace in a world that seemed to rush by. It was during one of these early morning walks that Graham first noticed the peculiar pattern in the shadows cast by the trees. Intrigued, he began to study the phenomenon, and soon, his mornings were filled with a new kind of curiosity, one that would lead him down a path he never expected. "
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.","In those moments, I found myself mirroring his sentiments, resisting the urge to embrace the digital age. Every new gadget or social media platform felt like a betrayal of the values I held",65,"In those moments, I found myself mirroring his sentiments, resisting the urge to embrace the digital age. Every new gadget or social media platform felt like a betrayal of the values I held dear. Graham's disdain for modern conveniences was not just a personal preference but a reflection of a broader cultural divide. We often clashed over the necessity of adapting to the fast-paced world, and these disagreements only deepened our connection. His resistance became a source of fascination for me, a puzzle I couldn't seem to solve. Despite our differences, I admired his unwavering commitment to preserving the traditions of the past. It was a constant reminder of the importance of balance in a rapidly changing world, a lesson I continue to learn from him even today."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized.

They observed that the expats' reactions were more natural in the park, but the data was still inconsistent. The researchers realized that they needed to find a balance between a controlled environment and a setting that would allow the expats to feel comfortable. This realization led to a series of adjustments in the testing protocol, which eventually yielded more reliable results. The expats, though still uneasy, began to participate more willingly, and the researchers were able to gather valuable insights into the effects of empathy and disgust on their subjects."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm. They began to resist the exams psychologically, spoiling our hard-won data. It was agreed that we’d delay introducing them to Hiroshima, Auschwitz, and the Twin Towers. Control promised to provide a timeline for the revelations, but it hadn’t materialized.","After Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had been unusually quiet, finally spoke up, their words were filled with a mixture of sorrow and anger.

Graham nodded in agreement, his eyes reflecting the same determination. The group, though diverse, shared a common goal: to uncover the truth behind the soldiers' plight. They decided to start by reaching out to local historians and veterans' associations, hoping to gather more information. As they delved deeper into the archives, they discovered that the tests were not just about empathy but also about control. The authorities were using these exams to gauge the emotional resilience of the population, preparing them for the harsh realities of war. The group realized that their mission was not only to help the soldiers but also to challenge the system that was exploiting their pain for its own gain."

"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder.

The dinner ended with a toast to the team's success and a promise to meet again soon. As I left the Ministry, I felt a sense of belonging, even if it was a tentative one. The experience had been enlightening, and I was looking forward to the next dinner."

There was something about his gaze, a desperation that tugged at my heartstrings, making me question my own choices and stability. I decided to offer him a meal, not out of charity, but because I couldn't bear the thought of him suffering."

It would be a chance to embrace our individuality and perhaps even find a deeper connection with each other away from the pressures of everyday life."
"When I brought the glass up—stoppering the rest of the bottle for dinner—I could hear Graham singing “I love to steal awhile away,” occasionally muffled by his drags on a cigarette.

The water level in the tub began to drop, and I could hear the soft splash of it as it settled. The song ended, and there was a moment of silence before Graham spoke, his voice barely above a whisper, ""Another day, another song."" I felt a strange sense of connection, as if I were part of something deeper, something that transcended the mundane. The night stretched on, and the sounds of the city outside seemed to fade into the background, leaving only the quiet hum of the evening."
"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century.

He found solace in the ritual of chopping vegetables, measuring spices, and watching the food transform from raw ingredients into something delicious. Cooking allowed him to reclaim a sense of control in a time where so much was beyond his understanding. He experimented with recipes, trying to recreate dishes from his own era, but often found himself improvising with ingredients he had never seen before. The challenge of adapting to new flavors and textures kept his mind engaged, and he found a certain satisfaction in mastering the art of cooking. Over time, he became known among his peers for his culinary skills, and even began teaching others how to cook, sharing his knowledge and experiences.

"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket.

It was as if the room had been frozen in a moment of neglect, a snapshot of a life left to its own devices.

"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century.

"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one.

I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs.

One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop.

We spent hours discussing spices, techniques, and the stories behind each dish. His enthusiasm was infectious, and soon I was helping him experiment with new recipes. We tried making Pad Thai from scratch, learning to balance the sweet, sour, and savory elements. The process was as much about the journey as it was about the final dish. We would sit for hours, tasting, adjusting, and laughing. Through this shared passion, I realized how much I had missed connecting with someone over something so meaningful. Graham became more than just a friend; he was a mentor, guiding me through the rich tapestry of Southeast Asian cuisine. Each meal we prepared together was a step closer to understanding not just the food, but the cultures that shaped it."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself.

"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.","Graham sighed, realizing that the music had been playing for quite some time, and he had been too engrossed in his work to notice.

He glanced at the screen, seeing the lyrics scrolling across the bottom of the screen. The song had a nostalgic feel to it, reminding him of his college days when he used to play it on repeat. He decided to let it play for a while, enjoying the familiar melody. As the song progressed, he found himself humming along, tapping his fingers on the desk. The sound of the music was oddly comforting, and he felt a wave of nostalgia wash over him. It was strange how a simple song could bring back so many memories. He wondered if the music had any effect on his productivity, or if it was just a coincidence that he had been listening to it during a particularly challenging project. "
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:","As the years passed, Graham's online activities became more varied, though never quite escaping the shadow of those early, awkward forays into the digital world.

I found myself frequently revisiting the search history, not out of any lingering concern for his well-being, but rather out of a morbid curiosity. The entries grew more complex, ranging from obscure scientific papers to deeply personal queries about relationships and self-esteem. There were moments when I felt a pang of guilt, wondering if I was prying too deeply into his life. Yet, the allure of uncovering the truth, no matter how mundane or embarrassing, was too strong to resist. Eventually, I realized that the real issue wasn't Graham's online behavior, but my own inability to trust him. The search history became a mirror reflecting my own insecurities and fears, rather than a tool for understanding him. In the end, it was not the content of the searches that mattered, but the fact that I had become so invested in them. The digital footprint, once a source of discomfort, had evolved into a symbol of our complicated relationship, one that I would carry with me long after the search history had been deleted."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.","As the rain continued to pour, the scene on our street became a surreal mix of chaos and community effort. Neighbors, strangers, and even passersby had joined forces, their faces illuminated by the dim glow of flashlights and the occasional burst of lightning.

The air was thick with the smell of wet concrete and the faint scent of fear. Despite the dire situation, there was a strange sense of unity, a shared resolve to weather the storm together. The high-vis jackets, now drenched, moved like a coordinated dance, filling sandbags, stacking them against the walls of houses, and reinforcing the makeshift barriers. The sound of shovels scraping against the ground and the occasional splash of water filled the night. The council's trucks, their massive wheels now mired in the mud, stood as silent witnesses to the scene. The newspapers had been right; this was indeed a display of Blitz spirit, a testament to the resilience of a community under siege. As the night wore on, the rain showed no sign of letting up, but the spirit of the people did not waver. The street, once a familiar path, had become a battlefield, and everyone was fighting for its survival."
