"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.",103,"Graham found himself grappling with the profound disorientation that came with returning to the nineteenth century. The world around him seemed to move at a slower pace, and the people he encountered were strangers to his modern sensibilities. He missed the conveniences of the future, the instant communication, and the advanced medical care that had saved him. Yet, he also felt a strange sense of nostalgia for the simpler times, the slower rhythms of life. The other expats, who had been through the same ordeal, were scattered across different parts of the world, each trying to adjust to their new reality. Some had embraced the past, while others, like Graham, were torn between the two eras. The extraction process had not only changed their physical forms but also their very souls, leaving them with a deep longing for both the future and the past. As Graham walked through the bustling streets of London, he couldn't help but wonder if this was just the beginning of a new chapter in human history, one that would forever alter the course of civilization."
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties. As it was, he was thirty-seven years old and had not experienced crinolines, A Tale of Two Cities, or the enfranchisement of the working classes.",53,"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into the early 20th century. The architecture was a stark contrast to the modern developments springing up around it, a reminder of a bygone era. The garden, though small, was meticulously maintained, a testament to the care taken by the previous tenants. Inside, the rooms were spacious, with high ceilings and large windows that let in plenty of natural light. Despite its age, the house was in excellent condition, a far cry from the run-down properties often associated with such structures. It was here that Gore's spirit might have lingered, a place of comfort and familiarity in an ever-changing world."
“Mm. Beside your elbow is a white box with a handle. It’s a refrigerator—a,"fridge, we call it. Could you open the door and take out the milk, please?”",29,"It's a small portable cooler designed for keeping drinks cold during picnics or outdoor activities. The handle makes it easy to carry, and the white color ensures it stands out on any surface. While not as powerful as a standard refrigerator, it still maintains a cool temperature for several hours. Perfect for keeping your favorite beverages chilled without taking up much space.”"
"Gore was already fully dressed and sitting on the edge of the bath, smoking. The bottom of the bath",had a low-tide mark of cigarette ash and soap scum. Two cigarettes were crushed out in the soap dish.,38,"Gore was already fully dressed and sitting on the edge of the bath, smoking. The bottom of the bath was filled with steaming water, and the room smelled faintly of cigar smoke. Gore's eyes flickered with a mix of anticipation and anxiety as he waited for the perfect moment to make his move, unaware that the door was about to creak open, signaling the arrival of an unexpected visitor."
"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale. A vile smell was seeping up from the floor.",39,"Water was gushing out from under the sink, and it was clear that repairs would be needed before the day was over. Gore, however, seemed more concerned with finishing his cigarette than addressing the issue. As the day progressed, other problems began to surface, each one adding to the growing list of challenges that lay ahead. It was a stark reminder of the difficulties that often accompany new beginnings, where every small problem seems to multiply into a larger issue."
"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant. Men in their right minds are","not usually overcome with a mania for pulling the plumbing apart. I suggested he might like to wash his hands at the sink downstairs, and I could, perhaps, call a plumber, and we could, potentially, take a constitutional walk on the nearby heath.",85,"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant. Men in their right minds are reluctant to embrace change, especially when it comes to tools that have served them well for generations. Gore, however, found himself in a world that was rapidly shifting from the familiar to the unfamiliar. As the steam engine began to replace the wind, and the telegraph replaced the semaphore, he found himself at a crossroads. He had to decide whether to cling to the past or adapt to the future. In the end, Gore chose to adapt, not because he was forced to, but because he recognized that change was inevitable. This decision would shape the course of his career and the legacy he left behind."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry. By the end of the first week he was visibly going bonkers with no one but me to talk to.",79,"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and he also had a deep passion for literature, often spending hours reading classic novels. His home was a veritable library, filled with books that spanned centuries and genres. Gore was a man of many talents, but it was his ability to connect with people that truly set him apart. He had an uncanny knack for making everyone feel like they were the center of his world, no matter the setting. Whether it was a casual dinner or a formal gathering, Gore always managed to make the conversation flow effortlessly, touching on everything from politics to philosophy. His wit and charm were legendary, and it was clear that he had a profound impact on those around him."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea. He told me stories as if he were trying to catch himself in amber. Just like my mother, though I didn’t tell him that.",105,"Gore's eyes scanning the bustling streets of London or New York, marveling at the rapid changes that had overtaken the world in just a few decades. His mind, however, remained anchored in the past, a time when the world moved at a slower, more deliberate pace. He often spoke of the importance of preserving the heritage and traditions of the past, fearing that the relentless march of progress would erase the very essence of what made humanity unique. Gore's thoughts were a constant battle between nostalgia and the need to adapt to the new realities. He would often retreat to his study, surrounded by books and artifacts from the 18th century, seeking solace in the past. His friends and family noticed the toll this internal conflict was taking on him, but they could only offer limited support. Gore's life became a testament to the challenges of bridging the gap between the old and the new, a struggle that continues to resonate with many in the modern world today."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake. Another person’s unguardedness in that moment can be very useful, interpersonally, as long as you don’t soften. There is language I could use about this if I were the melodramatic type: behind enemy lines, for example, or double agent. My sister might use these terms, or she might call me a fraud.",119,output

He’s left a smear on the table the color of tamarind flesh.,"There is a sour, steady pain in his palm that he briefly misunderstands as a taste.",32,"Gore wipes his hand on his trousers, leaving a darker stain. The smell of tamarind begins to permeate the air, mingling with the scent of old books and spilled coffee. His colleagues exchange uneasy glances, knowing that this is not the first time such an incident has occurred."
"Gore considers the weight of the sack he’d carried, which had felt so meaningful. “Three partridges,”","he says, “and a boatswain gull too far off to hit. Nothing else. Not even tracks.”",32,"Gore whispers, his voice barely audible, recounting the journey that led him to this moment. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the field, and the weight of the sack now seems insignificant compared to the burden of his memories. He remembers the thrill of the hunt, the camaraderie of his friends, and the quiet satisfaction of a successful day. Yet, as he walks home, the partridges inside the sack feel heavier than ever, a reminder of the fleeting nature of joy and the importance of cherishing every moment."

He is a fussy, short-tempered, handsome man who does not enjoy his job. “I must impress upon you the urgency of our situation,” he says, his voice low but firm. Stanley has always been meticulous about details, and he knows that every second counts. He has a reputation for being difficult to work with, but his colleagues respect his dedication. Stanley's eyes dart around the room, scanning for any sign of potential danger. ""We need to act quickly,"" he continues, his tone urgent. ""The longer we wait, the more difficult this will become."" Stanley's mind races, already formulating a plan. He has faced challenges before, but this one feels different. There's a sense of unease in the air, and Stanley knows that he must lead with confidence, even if he's not entirely sure of the outcome."
"Gore is looking at his left palm. The sour pain is still there, seeping","through the bandages. So is the blood, but it seems melodramatic to observe this.",28,"Gore feels a wave of nausea wash over him as he contemplates the source of the pain. He remembers the accident vividly, the sharp sting of metal against flesh. The doctors assured him it would heal, but the memory lingers, a constant reminder of that fateful day. The pain, though less intense, remains a haunting echo of what once was."

They feared the worst, knowing the ice could crush them at any moment. As dawn broke, they found the cat’s lifeless body, its eyes wide open in a final, frozen gaze at the world it would never see again. The loss weighed heavily on their hearts, a reminder of the harsh, unforgiving nature of the Arctic. In that moment, they vowed to honor the cat’s memory by navigating with greater caution and respect for the icy realm they dared to explore."
"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats. I was expecting he’d","go through a group therapy session, but Gore was in a sunny mood, so he must have been envisaging something closer to a salon.",47,"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats. I was expecting he’d be greeted with a warm handshake and some small talk, but instead, the atmosphere was tense. Gore seemed uneasy, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an exit. The expats, though polite, maintained a cautious distance, their expressions unreadable. I couldn’t help but wonder what secrets the Ministry held, and why they needed to keep these people on such tight leashes. As the meeting drew to a close, I felt a chill run down my spine, realizing that I might have stumbled into something far more dangerous than I had anticipated."
"“Complex,” said Adela. “Thanks for your input. Given their histories, mental trauma is to be anticipated.

Collaboration between all parties is essential to navigate this complex terrain effectively."
"“We can’t risk the temporal repercussions,” said Adela. “They are supposed to be dead. As long as they’re here, it’s functionally as if they are dead in","their own time.

""We need to find a way to send them back without drawing attention. This could be our only chance to restore the balance before things spiral out of control.

I could feel the weight of history pressing down on us, a silent reminder of the significance of this place."
"We went for lunch at a small bistro near the Ministry. Gore came from an era of service à la française, private dining rooms and putting everything into jelly.

Gore came from an era of service à la française, private dining rooms and putting everything into jelly. When I began to realize how much the world had changed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia for those simpler times. The bistro, however, offered a modern twist on classic French cuisine, with a menu that catered to both traditionalists and those seeking something more adventurous. The atmosphere was cozy, with soft lighting and the faint aroma of freshly baked bread wafting through the air. As we sat down, the waiter brought over a bottle of wine, and we toasted to the unexpected blend of old and new that this meal represented. It was a perfect blend of tradition and innovation, a testament to the enduring appeal of French gastronomy."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house. I am looking forward to seeing what visions of sin this era has concocted for the humble tavern.”,53,"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to be fixed, but I wasn't sure if he was being sincere. There was something about him that made me wary, a certain calculating air that didn't sit well with me. Still, I couldn't deny the opportunity for advancement that came with his association. We shook hands on it, and I left the room with a sense of unease, wondering if I had just made a grave mistake.”"
"Back at the house I was still struggling to think of as “home,” Gore shyly asked me if I would also “come for a drink.” He had done well, at lunch, to hide his deep embarrassment over my payment",of the bill (with a Ministry expense card); he was adjusting with gold-star alacrity in recognizing that it wouldn’t be a reputation-detonating act for a respectable woman to be seen in a public house in the company of bachelors.,78,"That moment felt surreal, as if the weight of the day's events had not yet fully settled on us. I hesitated, unsure whether to accept his invitation or to retreat further into my shell. The house, still unfamiliar, seemed to hold its breath, waiting for my response. Gore, sensing my hesitation, offered a small, reassuring smile, his eyes reflecting a mix of hope and anxiety. I finally nodded, and we made our way to the kitchen, the air thick with unspoken words. The drink, though simple, became a bridge between us, a tentative step towards understanding. As we sipped, I found myself opening up, sharing stories of my journey, and Gore, in turn, revealed more about his life, his dreams, and his fears. It was a start, a fragile beginning, but one that promised more to come."
"I coughed at my half-pint. Ralph, a snide and etiolated former field agent, was my",least favorite bridge. He had somehow managed to get assigned the only young woman expat.,30,"Ralph, a snide and etiolated former field agent, was my mentor, someone I had to learn to respect despite his sharp tongue and cynical outlook on life. His experience in the field was invaluable, though his demeanor often left much to be desired. We clashed frequently, but those spats only served to strengthen our bond. Ralph taught me more than just the tricks of the trade; he showed me the importance of resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity."
“No. Apparently it was very awkward when Ralph came in here for a lunchtime gallon of merlot and spotted him. He’s part of Defence’s tracking,team. You know they don’t much like the fact that the Ministry is a separate institution. They thought the time-door ought to fall under their remit.”,51,"of a suspicious individual who had been loitering near the secure entrance. Ralph's eyes narrowed as he sized up the man, clearly out of place in the quiet office environment. He quickly excused himself and made his way over, his voice low but firm as he asked what the man was doing there. The man, visibly nervous, stammered out some excuse about checking on a package delivery, but Ralph's experience told him otherwise. Within minutes, security was alerted, and the man was escorted out. It was a close call, but Ralph's vigilance had prevented a potential breach. As he returned to his desk, he couldn't help but wonder if this was just the beginning of a series of covert operations targeting the facility."
"“He used the word ‘Negro’ until I stopped him, but I don’t think he meant it with","two g’s, if that’s what you’re asking me. How’s your expat managing the news of your miscegenation?”",34,any offensive intent. It was just a reflection of the times he grew up in. We had a long talk about the evolution of language and why certain terms are better left in the past. He listened intently and promised to be more mindful in the future.

I choked. “Uh. We don’t use that word anymore. We just say,"‘Black.’ As an adjective. You would say, ‘She is a Black woman.’ ”",25,"I choked. “Uh. We don’t use that word anymore. We just say ‘person’ or ‘individual’ when referring to someone’s gender. It’s about respect and inclusivity.” She explained patiently, sensing my discomfort."
"Graham used other words too, not wrong, exactly, but not right, like “your people,” or “your culture.” When I said, in a wincingly tight voice, that we had the same people and culture, he replied, mildly, “But I don’t think that we do.” Then came the image searches about Cambodia, on food and dress","and customs. I had to do those for him, in the early days, because he still didn’t know how, and the English-language internet was not on my side. Exotic, friendly, conservative, resilient. The way he couched his questions, too, was imperfect. I had to correct “ancestor” for “grandparent,” “sacred” for “polite,” “tribal leaders” for “farmers.”",109,"Graham's tone was calm, almost detached, as he scrolled through the images of Cambodia. The pictures showed people in traditional dress, eating rice and fish, and performing ceremonial dances. I felt a pang of discomfort, realizing that he was right. Our people and culture, as I had always understood them, seemed distant, almost foreign. The images of Cambodia were a stark reminder of the diversity within our own borders. I had always thought of ""our people"" as a monolithic entity, but now I saw the complexity and richness of different communities. It was a humbling experience, one that made me question my assumptions and broaden my perspective. Graham's challenge to my thinking was a gift, even if it was delivered in a way that made me squirm. The conversation left me with more questions than answers, but it also opened the door to a deeper understanding of the world around me."

As the Brigadier left, he left Arthur with a cryptic message, ""Trust no one, not even yourself."" The atmosphere in the room was thick with tension and unspoken fears, leaving Arthur to ponder the gravity of the situation."
"This old wound, formerly healed, he’d received in Australia with Captain Stokes. A gun had exploded in his hands. They were rowing up a river in the captain’s gig, charting its","course.

He’d taken up his fowling piece and sighted along the barrel.",63,"The river was vast and untamed, its waters a deep, mysterious blue. The sun beat down, but the shade of the overhanging trees offered a brief respite. Captain Stokes, a seasoned explorer, had a calm demeanor, his eyes scanning the riverbank for signs of life. The old soldier, now a weathered man, recounted the tale with a mix of nostalgia and regret. ""It was a beautiful day,"" he reminisced, ""but the gun went off too soon. I thought I was done for. Yet, here I am, still telling the story."" The captain, ever the gentleman, listened intently, his face a mask of quiet respect. They continued their journey, the gig slicing through the water, leaving a trail of ripples in its wake. The river held secrets, and with each passing mile, the old soldier felt a little closer to understanding its mysteries."
"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC. I thought it was a form of juvenilia, drawn in","his earliest years as a modern man, something to remind him of on a significant anniversary of his arrival here; and not, as it would turn out to be, a red letter from another era.",70,"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC. I thought it was a form of juvenilia, drawn in a moment of whimsy, perhaps to remind me of a time when ideas flowed freely without the burden of practicality. Yet, as the years passed, I found myself returning to that drawing, not as a relic of my youth, but as a source of inspiration. The simplicity of the design, its elegance in its absurdity, seemed to hold a truth that I had long since forgotten. It was as if the drawing had a life of its own, evolving in my mind, becoming a symbol of the creative process itself. I began to wonder if the device, in its imagined form, could be more than just a whimsical doodle. Could it be a blueprint for something real? The more I thought about it, the more I realized that the true value of the drawing lay not in its literal interpretation, but in the questions it raised about the nature of creation and the limits of imagination."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle.

He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and began his routine with a brisk walk around the block. His days were filled with a quiet, almost serene rhythm, punctuated by the occasional visit to the local library or a quiet afternoon spent reading on the porch. Graham had a knack for finding joy in the simplest of things, and his contentment was infectious. I often found myself drawn to his calm, envying his ability to find peace in a world that seemed to rush by. It was during one of these early morning walks that Graham first noticed the peculiar pattern in the shadows cast by the trees. Intrigued, he began to study the phenomenon, and soon, his mornings were filled with the thrill of discovery. This newfound passion became the cornerstone of his summer, and by its end, Graham had not only become a master of his washing-machine cycle but had also uncovered a hidden world of natural patterns."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.",65,"In those moments, I found myself longing for the simplicity of a time when the world moved slower, when the internet was a novelty and not a necessity.

"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized.

Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled to focus. His hands trembled, and his breathing became shallow, making it clear that the environment was not conducive to gathering reliable information. The researchers, aware of the challenges, decided to move the tests to a more neutral setting, a quiet room with comfortable chairs and a window view. This change, however, brought its own set of issues. The expats, now more relaxed, began to discuss their experiences openly, which led to a different kind of data collection. They shared stories, fears, and hopes, providing insights that were rich but difficult to quantify. The researchers, though, found these narratives invaluable, as they offered a deeper understanding of the expats' emotional states and the impact of the tests. The experiment continued, with adjustments made to the protocol, aiming to balance the need for scientific rigor with the comfort and well-being of the participants. Despite the challenges, the researchers remained committed to their goal, hoping to contribute to the broader understanding of empathy and disgust in diverse cultural contexts."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm.

Control promised to provide a timeline for the revelations, but it hadn’t materialized.",105,"After Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had been unusually quiet, finally spoke up, their words were filled with a mixture of sorrow and anger. ""We can't just sit here and do nothing,"" Sixteen-forty-five said, his voice steady but tense. ""We need to find a way to help them, but also to understand why this is happening."" Graham nodded in agreement, his eyes reflecting the same determination. The group decided to form a committee to address the situation, aiming to find a solution that would not only help the soldiers but also shed light on the broader issues affecting their community. They knew it would be a challenging task, but they were committed to making a difference. Over the next few days, they gathered information, held discussions, and brainstormed ideas. Despite the initial shock and disbelief, they found strength in unity, knowing that together, they could make a positive impact. As they continued their efforts, they hoped that their actions would inspire others to take a stand and work towards a better future."

Her presence seemed to instill a sense of unease among the other participants, who whispered behind her back. Despite this, Adela remained calm and composed, her eyes never leaving the examiner. It was clear that she was not just a passive observer but a key player in the unfolding drama of these exams."
"Adela smiled with about a third of her mouth. Her face had changed again. She looked pinched and hungry,",and hauntingly as if her skin was held in place by a bulldog clip at the back of her skull.,39,"Adela's eyes, once bright and full of life, now seemed hollow, as if the light within her had dimmed. The lines around her mouth deepened, telling a story of struggles unseen by most. She shifted uncomfortably, her body language a silent plea for understanding. The transformation was subtle but undeniable, a testament to the hardships she had endured. Despite the weariness etched into her features, there was a resilience in her gaze that refused to be broken."
"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder. Bridges tended not to eat at the Ministry canteen with administrative staff and the operators on the Wellness team—the office-based employees—and the decorous hostility with which the paper pushers met me was adorable. When I got to the","kitchen itself, the first thing I saw was Graham leaning down to light a cigarette on the gas ring, his curls dangerously close to the hob. We’d had to disable smoke detectors in every Ministry room that Graham used. If he couldn’t have a cigarette, he’d throw whatever experiment he was strapped into.",106,"I arrived, the aroma of freshly cooked chicken wafting through the air, I was greeted by a few familiar faces from the Wellness team. They exchanged pleasantries, but the atmosphere was still tinged with the lingering tension from our previous encounters. I made my way to the table where the team usually gathered, and as I sat down, I noticed a new addition to the group—a young intern who seemed a bit overwhelmed. The conversation flowed easily among the regulars, discussing the latest health initiatives and upcoming events. I couldn't help but feel a sense of camaraderie, despite the initial awkwardness. The meal was a welcome break from the usual office routine, and I found myself enjoying the company more than I had anticipated. After the meal, we moved to the lounge area, where we continued our discussions over coffee. It was a refreshing change to engage with colleagues in a more relaxed setting, and I left feeling more connected to the team than ever before. The experience taught me that even in the most unlikely places, genuine connections can be formed."
"She put a glass down in front of me—ice, water, an oily suggestion of cordial, and,","sure enough, some fussy edible garnishes. I blinked at it and then at Margaret, who smiled.",32,"she hesitated, her hand lingering on the rim of the glass as if unsure whether to pour more. Finally, she stepped back, her eyes locking onto mine with an intensity that made me squirm slightly in my seat. ""To us,"" she said, raising her own glass, ""to new beginnings and old friends."" We clinked glasses, the sound echoing in the quiet room as we both took a sip, savoring the moment."
"Graham said, “Hm!” and pulled hard on his cigarette. He wandered off with the expansive air of a man who might pick up some parsley, not because",he has been told to but because that might be a jolly thing to do en route to his next footloose and fancy-free destination. I watched him go.,55,"Graham said, “Hm!” and pulled hard on his cigarette. He wandered off with the expansive air of a man who might pick up some parsley, not because he needed it, but because he felt like he could. The world seemed to stretch out before him, vast and uncharted, and for a moment, he felt the weight of it all. He had always been one to take life by the horns, but lately, the horns felt heavier, more cumbersome. Perhaps it was time to find a quieter corner, a place where the noise of the world didn’t quite reach. As he walked, the scent of rain-soaked earth filled his nostrils, and he couldn’t help but smile. The world, in its chaotic beauty, was still worth exploring, even if the path ahead was uncertain."
"“No,” said Margaret. She shrugged at my expression. “An’ I forsake this duty,” she said, “we’ll sicken. Forty-seven",thinks tobacco is an herb. But womenfolk were cordoned at the stove for centuries. The men mun take lessons.”,37,"“Forty-seven years we’ve served this land,” Margaret continued, her voice steady but filled with a quiet resolve. “And I won’t let that number become forty-eight. This is my duty, and I will see it through, no matter the cost. You may not understand now, but one day, you will.” She looked me in the eye, her gaze unwavering. “This is not a decision to be taken lightly, and I have given it much thought. I will not falter.”"
The Brigadier drifted closer. He did look hungry. He looked like I did as a student when I ate nothing but buttered,toast and apples. He turned the white of used candlewax when Margaret opened the oven to better squint at her roast potatoes.,44,"The Brigadier drifted closer. He did look hungry. He looked like I did as a student when I ate nothing but buttered toast for days. His eyes were hollow, and his skin had a gaunt appearance. I could see the bones in his cheeks, and his breath smelled faintly of stale alcohol. I wondered if he had been living on the streets, or if this was a more permanent state for him. Either way, I felt a pang of sympathy mixed with a healthy dose of fear. The thought of him wandering around in such a condition made me shudder. I decided to offer him some food from my own meager supplies, hoping it would help him regain some strength."
"“ ’Tis all the same to me, sir,” said Margaret, “though I fear",this cod will grow legs and walk afore my ‘colleague’ returns with my parsley.”,27,"“’Tis all the same to me, sir,” said Margaret, “though I fear the outcome will not be as kind as we hope. Life has its ways, and sometimes they lead us down paths we did not choose. Yet, I shall face it with courage, for what else is there to do?”"
"Because we lived in a government-owned residence, there were also restrictions on how","long we could have the air-conditioning on. Graham picked at this, irritating and irritated.",27,"Because we lived in a government-owned residence, there were also restrictions on how we could decorate the space or invite guests over. Meals were often communal, and we had to adhere to a strict schedule for work and leisure activities. These arrangements, while sometimes challenging, fostered a strong sense of community among residents."
"Movement was anathema. I slept, mostly, naked and poaching in my sweat. The water ration forced Graham to switch finally to thirty-second showers. I didn’t see him for the whole of the heat wave.",We left our bedroom doors open with the intention of letting the air circulate—though the air hung like an executed corpse—and said lackluster things about making a salad to each other from our separate cells.,69,"The heat wave stretched on, a relentless grip on the city. Outside, the streets shimmered under the unrelenting sun, and the air was thick with humidity. Inside, we huddled in the narrow confines of our apartment, seeking any semblance of coolness. The power went out one evening, plunging us into darkness. We huddled together, the only source of light coming from the faint glow of a phone screen. The days blurred into one, each one a struggle to survive the oppressive heat. As the weeks passed, the water ration became more stringent, forcing us to ration our showers even further. The once lively city streets were empty, save for the occasional delivery truck or emergency vehicle. The heat wave seemed to have a strange effect on people, making them more irritable and less social. By the time it finally broke, we were all relieved, though the memory of those endless days of heat would linger in our minds."
"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest. She always arrived first, and we’d find her sitting at the top of",a long table like a mannequin awaiting the gift of demonic possession. But this time I arrived a quarter of an hour early and she wasn’t there.,53,"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest. She always arrived first, and we’d find her sitting at the top of the conference table, her eyes already scanning the documents spread out before her. Her presence was a testament to the importance of these meetings, where every word and gesture was scrutinized. The room was a sanctuary of sorts, where the usual bureaucratic noise was muffled, allowing for focused discussions. Adela’s efficiency was legendary, and her ability to distill complex issues into actionable points was unparalleled. It was clear that she was not just a participant but a driving force behind the Ministry’s strategic direction."
Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold,"water. She looked unwell, but God alone knows how her plastic surgeon thought she was supposed to look.",36,"Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold water, her mind elsewhere, lost in thoughts of the day's events, wondering how she would manage to finish her chores before the water supply was cut off. She sighed, the water trickling down her arms, a small rebellion against the larger societal constraints that governed her life. As she turned off the tap, she glanced at the meter, a silent reminder of the community's struggle with resources."
"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery. She didn’t enjoy the prestige, as the Secretary did, and she seemed bizarrely overworked for the proxy boss of a project in its pilot stage.",56,"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it, remains a mystery. Her demeanor suggested she expected us to be grateful for her presence, despite her lack of experience in the field. It was clear that her rise to the position was not due to merit but perhaps some form of nepotism or political maneuvering. The office buzzed with whispers about her methods, and it was evident that her tenure was not going to be one of transparency or hard work. We were left wondering if she truly understood the responsibilities that came with the role or if she was merely biding her time until something better came along."
"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him. I frowned, and he frowned, and we were frowning into our tea.",64,"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had been living in the woods for years, surviving on what nature provided. His eyes, though weary, held a depth of wisdom that spoke of resilience and solitude. I could see the stories etched into his face, each line a testament to his journey. The silence between us was rich with unspoken understanding, a bond formed not by words but by shared experiences of life's quiet moments. As I gazed at him, I felt a profound connection, as if we had known each other for lifetimes, yet here we were, strangers in a world that seemed to have forgotten the value of true connection."
"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it. He was a severe disciplinarian, it’s true. Held grudges. But he was a very lonely person. Romantic, too, which made his loneliness worse.”",53,"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the first to do so. He’s more of a realist, I suppose, someone who faces the world as it is, flaws and all. There’s a certain strength in that, but it doesn’t mean he’s without compassion. It’s just that his compassion is often directed inward, towards himself, which makes him seem distant at times. I’ve always admired his resilience, though I can’t say I fully understand it. Maybe that’s the point—maybe it’s something you can’t fully grasp until you’ve walked in his shoes."""
"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running. Given how much of our working day the data collection took, we all assumed that the time-travel project was running to the stated purpose. Every day I had to record his heart rate, his blood pressure, his temperature; every day a written record of what he wore, what he ate, how much","exercise he took; every week checking progress against the imaginary benchmarks set by Control, use of phone, use of transport, use of media and the assessment of how harmful or useful each medium was; all the time the corrective tests for vocabulary and habit; novelistic observations on his character and temperament. It seemed that the job continued. I suppose if you switch on your lights and boil your kettle with energy provided by a nuclear power station, you don’t spend much time reflecting on the fact that the atom had originally been split to kill cities.",192,"completion>As the days stretched into weeks, the monotony of the routine began to weigh heavily on me. The relentless repetition of recording minute details about his daily life started to feel like a form of imprisonment. I found myself questioning the true purpose of the project, wondering if we were truly making progress or if we were simply going through the motions. The data collected seemed to grow in volume but not in meaning. The bridges' core reports continued to churn out endless streams of information, but there was no discernible breakthrough."
"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on","a wet and putrid night, to shoot a fox, and pulled out one of his own rotting teeth (he showed it to me afterward; it was the color of a tombstone, caped with gelatinous red)—was this Victorian, or was this “irregularities”?",81,"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on a blanket that smelled faintly of pine. The sun had begun to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the lawn. I approached cautiously, unsure of what to expect. His eyes were closed, but I noticed a slight twitch in his left hand. I knelt beside him, gently shaking his shoulder. ""Graham?"" I whispered. No response. I called out louder, but still, there was no reaction. Concerned, I decided to call for help, not knowing what else to do. As I stood up, I noticed a small notebook lying beside him. Curious, I picked it up, only to find it filled with cryptic notes and sketches. It was then that I realized I might be dealing with something far more complex than I had initially thought."
"So I was anxious about Graham’s disdain for the twenty-first century, because never mind that I felt rejected by it, I was worried that the universe would feel the atemporal sting of his contempt and take","him away. My England wasn’t like this, he’d told me—but this was the natural evolution of his England. I was the natural evolution. I was his lens if he would only raise me and look with me.",73,"So I was anxious about Graham’s disdain for the twenty-first century, because never mind that I felt rejected by it, I was worried that the universe would feel the atemporal sting of his contempt and take it out on us. His rejection of modernity seemed to echo through the cosmos, a silent protest against progress. I feared that the very fabric of time might unravel, a consequence of his disdain. Yet, I couldn’t help but wonder if perhaps Graham’s rejection was a form of resistance against the relentless march of change. Could it be that his atemporal stance was a plea for a world where things didn’t have to constantly evolve? The universe, after all, is vast and ancient, and perhaps it too craves moments of stillness. In the end, I hoped that Graham’s stance wasn’t a harbinger of cosmic discord, but rather a reminder of the beauty in impermanence."
"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test. The Ministry gave no indication of what format","the test would take, or what manner of questions would be asked, or tasks set. I thought this was unfair, and suggested as much to him.",52,"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test. The Ministry gave no indication of what format the exam would take, leaving us both in a state of uncertainty. We spent hours poring over old papers and studying diligently, hoping to cover all the possible topics. Despite our efforts, the test proved to be more challenging than we anticipated, with unexpected questions that tested our knowledge in ways we hadn't prepared for. In the end, we both felt relieved when it was over, but also anxious about the results. The experience taught us the importance of being adaptable and ready for the unexpected in any situation."
"There was an embarrassed silence, then: “Shame!” yelled Margaret","from the audience. “Fie! Rhubarb, rhubarb! And diverse other curses!”",19,"Embarrassment spread across the room as Margaret's outburst echoed, prompting a series of awkward coughs and shifting of feet before someone finally broke the silence."
"The person I was referring to was lurking at the far edge of the auditorium, with hair the color of wet earth under moonlight and a pinched, unhappy expression. I don’t think Salese could have looked more disapproving if we’d all started","sucking at one another’s fleshly parts and chanting “Hail, Satan!” The Brigadier was standing beside Salese. They were speaking, heads close together. They looked as if they were in an invisible bell jar of gloom which blocked out the room’s miniature festivities.",84,"The person I was referring to was lurking at the far edge of the auditorium, with hair the color of wet earth under moonlight and a pinched, unhappy expression. I don’t think Salese could have looked more disapproving if we’d all started to question the very foundations of our beliefs. The room was filled with the low murmur of voices, and the faint scent of old books lingered in the air. As I turned to face the stage, I noticed the dim outline of a figure standing near the podium. The person seemed to be watching us, their eyes fixed on the audience with an intensity that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was not just any performance, but something far more significant, perhaps even a test of our resolve. The lights flickered, and for a moment, everything seemed to pause, as if the world itself was holding its breath, waiting for the next move."
"“I’m afraid I’ve only ever met the Secretary,” said the Brigadier.",“But I would very much like to meet Vice Secretary Adela.”,22,"“The Secretary is a busy man,” the Brigadier continued, “and I daresay he wouldn’t have much time to spare for someone like me.” The thought made him feel both insignificant and slightly resentful, though he tried not to show it."
"I went home and, on arrival, checked my emails. As with a driving",test—or the lieutenants’ exam—the acclimatization exam results were delivered immediately. Graham had passed.,26,"I found several messages regarding a meeting scheduled for next week. Noting the importance, I replied promptly, suggesting a few possible dates. Afterward, I relaxed with a cup of tea, reflecting on the day's events, hoping for a more leisurely tomorrow filled with no work-related tasks."
"I cycled up to the nice grocery store to buy a bottle of champagne, pausing on the way home for a soft-serve ice cream. I sat on the bench to lick the ripple into a mound and think about the","Brigadier. A man of bivouac experience, I felt; there was something disturbingly makeshift about both him and Salese, as if they’d been dropped behind enemy lines and were mimicking familiarity while waiting for the right moment to cut a throat.",80,"I was thinking about the evening ahead, the sparkle of the champagne reflecting in the candlelight. I imagined the warmth of the summer night as we shared the bottle, the soft music playing in the background. The ice cream melted slowly, its creamy sweetness contrasting with the fizzy bubbles in my mind. The world seemed to slow down, the worries of the day fading away. I couldn't wait for the moment to arrive, the promise of a night filled with laughter and good cheer. As I finished the last bite of ice cream, I felt a smile spread across my face, a smile that would stay with me until the bottle was uncorked and the evening began."
"“Apparently I can pass as an eccentric. I suggested that somewhere like Scotland, Arthur and I might","simply pass as Englishmen. One of the panel was a Scotsman, and I think he liked that.”",34,"might find a more relaxed atmosphere for our unconventional lifestyle. The highlands, with their misty mornings and ancient stone structures, could offer us the solitude we seek. Arthur, ever the romantic, envisioned ourselves wandering through the ruins, lost in conversation about literature and philosophy. It was a whimsical notion, but one that brought a smile to both our faces. We imagined hosting impromptu gatherings under the stars, surrounded by friends who appreciated our unique blend of intellect and eccentricity."
"When I brought the glass up—stoppering the rest of the bottle for dinner—I could hear Graham singing “I love to steal awhile away,” occasionally muffled by his drags on a cigarette. Water plashed against the tub.","He dropped to humming and presumably soaping. I slid quietly to the floor and leaned my head against the wall. I wasn’t going to see a Ministry therapist. I knew I should, and I knew I wouldn’t.",73,"As the evening wore on, the steam from the tub mingled with the scent of jasmine incense. Graham's voice grew softer, more melancholic, as if the song were a reflection of his inner thoughts. I could see his silhouette through the fogged-up bathroom window, the light from the candle casting a warm glow on his face. The clinking of glasses and the occasional laughter from the dining room added a contrast to the quiet serenity of the bathroom. The night seemed to stretch on, each moment filled with the quiet anticipation of the evening's end."
"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century. On ships there were cooks and officers’ stewards; at home, on the few occasions he was at home, there were women. Nevertheless, he had taken to cooking in a way he had failed to take to","television or texting or the use of deodorants (“I bathe every day,” he’d said to me with hurt dignity). Tonight, he hummed with a busyness that hardly shielded nervousness. He burned the onions and automatically reached for his cigarettes. I took them away—I didn’t want ashy Bolognese—and he accused me of “nanny-stating” him, a turn of phrase I found very alarming because I certainly hadn’t taught it to him. Where was he picking this stuff up?",152,"Graham had taken to cooking in a way he had failed to take to anything else in his life. The act of preparing meals became a form of therapy, a way to ground himself in the present. He found joy in the process of chopping vegetables, measuring spices, and watching the food transform from raw ingredients into something delicious. Cooking allowed him to explore new flavors and techniques, and it gave him a sense of accomplishment. He started experimenting with different cuisines, from Italian pasta dishes to Japanese sushi rolls. Each dish was a new adventure, and he found himself learning more about the world through food than he ever had before. The kitchen became his sanctuary, a place where he could escape the chaos of the world outside. As he continued to cook, he realized that the act of creating something from nothing was deeply satisfying. It was a reminder that even in the most challenging times, there was always something he could control. Graham's culinary journey was just beginning, and he couldn't wait to see where it would take him next."
Margaret was wearing high-waisted cerulean bell-bottoms and a white blouse clocked with lace. She looked like a disco,"goddess, an astonishing concoction given that she was only barely older than the piano, never mind the synth.",36,"Margaret was wearing high-waisted cerulean bell-bottoms and a white blouse clocked with lace. She looked like a disco diva from the 70s, her hair styled in big curls, and her smile radiating the kind of confidence that made everyone around her feel like they could dance the night away. The room buzzed with the sound of lively music, and Margaret moved with the grace of someone who knew every step of the dance floor."
"Arthur was happy and flushed. He was one of those unusual extroverts who have all the attributes of an introvert, save that they like being around other people. He had a gift for gentleness too, one of the rarest virtues in","any gender and especially in the kind of man Arthur was supposed to be. I eased some biography out of him: half-decent public school; classics at Oxford, where he’d had a lot of fun and failed his exams; retraining as a doctor.",83,"Arthur's world. This gift often made him a natural mediator, someone who could soothe tensions and bring people together. Despite his outward enthusiasm for social gatherings, he found solace in quiet moments, where he could reflect and recharge. His friends admired his ability to balance the needs of both introverts and extroverts, creating environments where everyone felt valued. Arthur's life was a testament to the idea that true strength lies not in conformity but in embracing one's unique qualities. He believed that every individual had a special role to play in the grand tapestry of life, and his mission was to help others discover and fulfill theirs. In his community, he was known as a pillar of support, always ready to lend a listening ear or a helping hand. Arthur's journey was one of self-discovery and growth, and he continued to inspire those around him with his wisdom and kindness."
I saw Graham’s eyebrow quirk in a rascally way as he did,"the math. “You became a captain extremely quickly, Sixteen. Found your forte?”",24,"Graham leaned in with a mischievous glint in his eye, clearly up to no good. I raised an eyebrow of my own, intrigued despite myself. ""What are you planning now, Graham?"" I asked, already suspecting the answer. ""Oh, you'll see,"" he replied enigmatically, a sly smile playing on his lips."
"Arthur grimaced. I saw his hand shiver momentarily on his glass, and then he","swallowed everything in it with a wet click. “Promotion was—fast—in the war,” he said shortly.",29,"Arthur took a deep breath, steadying his hand before raising the glass to his lips. His eyes flickered with a mix of emotions, but he managed a small smile, hoping to reassure those around him that everything was alright."
"Margaret, incidentally, listened to the men talk about their careers with a suffused urgency that only I noticed. In her own era, she’d slept in the room next to the one where she had been born.","She thought Scotland was far-flung and semi-barbaric. When we came round to talking about my time working as a translator in Cambodia, I felt her attention all over me. I may have talked slightly too much.",72,"Margaret's curiosity about their professional lives seemed to reflect a deep-seated longing for a world where her voice might be heard. Her generation had been denied many opportunities, and she often spoke of the sacrifices they made. Yet, despite the challenges, she remained resilient, always finding moments to engage in meaningful conversations. It was clear that her presence, though quiet, carried a weight of its own. As the evening drew to a close, Margaret excused herself, her mind already turning to the next chapter of her life, one that she hoped would be more inclusive and just."
"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag. I was shortly handing my grinder and papers to Graham (who was far more adept at rolling).,52,"my view was the internet, but that’s a topic for another day. Anyway, the conversation turned to weed, and opinions were as varied as the skyline of New York City. Some argued it was a harmless plant, while others saw it as a gateway to chaos. I tried to remain neutral, but the more I listened, the more I realized how much we all have in common, despite our differences. It’s funny how such a simple topic can lead to such deep discussions. In the end, we all agreed that it’s not the substance itself that matters, but how it’s used and regulated. As we wrapped up the debate, I couldn’t help but wonder if we were just scratching the surface of a much larger conversation about freedom and responsibility."
"Meeting Margaret made me vivid and receptive. Sentences weighed more. I kept a half-conscious catalog of where the men were looking. I’ve seen people deal with this in different ways. By “this,” I mean power. I mean magnetism. I try to absorb it. Within twenty minutes Margaret","and I were planning a girls-take-Soho night out, which necessitated me explaining the history of Soho, the concept of clubbing, the genre of R & B, the club night R & She, and dancing. I hadn’t been clubbing since I was an assistant in Languages. No matter.",94,"Within twenty minutes, Margaret had already begun to exert a subtle influence over the room. Her presence was a magnet, drawing eyes and attention. I found myself not just observing, but also feeling the energy she radiated. Some people cope with power by projecting it outward, while others, like Margaret, seem to embody it effortlessly. I tried to absorb her grace and poise, hoping to learn from her. Her quiet confidence was infectious, and I felt a strange sense of admiration and envy. By the time the meeting concluded, I had a newfound respect for those who wield power with such ease. It was a lesson in both humility and ambition, one that I would carry with me for a long time."
"“Such matters are between myself and God,” he said gravely. “Oh, stop frowning, Sixty-five.","Arthur, will you please lead her in a polka, if you can still stand.”",28,"“I have my own burdens to bear,” he continued, his voice tinged with a hint of sorrow. “Do not concern yourself with what I choose to do, for it is my life and my choices.” Sixty-five sighed, understanding that sometimes, there are things better left unsaid, as the weight of another's decisions can be heavy to carry."
"“In this age, musicians are imprinted inside music boxes, and there is no need for the band to","keep time,” said Margaret. “You will instruct me in the polka, or I will step on your toes.”",36,"In this age, musicians are imprinted inside music boxes, and there is no need for the band to perform live. Instead, they are played like records, their melodies echoing through digital realms. This shift has transformed the music industry, offering endless possibilities for artists to reach global audiences instantly. However, some purists lament the loss of the live experience, the energy of a packed venue, and the spontaneous magic of a live performance. Despite this, the evolution continues, blending tradition with technology to create a new era of musical expression."
"Arthur, by contrast, danced beautifully. He dipped me, and I bent like","a reed. He spun me, and I was, with such satisfaction, spun.",24,"graceful reeds in a gentle breeze. His eyes sparkled with joy as he twirled me around, each movement synchronized perfectly with the lively music. I felt a surge of excitement, lost in the rhythm and Arthur's skilled embrace."
"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket. My bedside table sprouted two water glasses and a mug. Dust crouched on the skirting boards and in the seams of","my chest of drawers. When a woman is as impossibly attractive as Margaret, the mediocrity shed by a woman like me bustles around her like a horde of pigeons. Or so I thought, at that time. Truthfully, I’d been foxed by how beautiful she was. I felt a complicated anguish when I saw her little besocked toes treadling the carpet.",119,"As the sentence trailed off, I found myself lost in the minutiae of her untidiness, each item a silent witness to the passage of time and the lack of attention it had received. The air was thick with the scent of old tea and unwashed dishes, a familiar aroma that always seemed to linger in her home. I couldn't help but wonder if she even noticed the chaos around her, or if it was simply a part of her routine, something she had grown accustomed to over the years. The dust bunnies had multiplied, weaving intricate patterns along the baseboards, while the neglected plants on the windowsill drooped pitifully, their leaves curling in a silent plea for water. It was as if the house itself was holding its breath, waiting for some sign of life, some spark of order to return. I sighed, realizing that this was not just a matter of untidiness but a reflection of the larger disarray in her life. How long had it been since she had taken the time to sit down and breathe, to let go of the constant barrage of tasks and responsibilities?"
Margaret appeared unaware of any of these concerns. She didn’t even glance at herself,in the mirror. She gave me an interested grin as I pulled out my lipsticks.,29,"Margaret appeared unaware of any of these concerns. She didn’t even glance at herself, lost in a world of her own making where only her thoughts mattered, oblivious to the room's growing silence as her colleagues exchanged concerned glances."
"I’d stopped wearing it—I was, at the time, thinking of the way my face might be received by a Victorian who didn’t approve of cosmetics—but I demonstrated the coverage of my sole foundation. Margaret","was amazed by the smoothness of its application and the faithfulness of its shade. She drew an arrow with it on her cheek. On her fair skin, it looked like clay. We started giggling.",68,"Margaret, with a delicate smile, began to apply the foundation to her face, her hands moving with practiced ease. The room was filled with the soft hum of conversation, but her attention was solely on the task at hand. She had always been fascinated by the history of cosmetics, and how they were used to bridge the gap between the wearer and the observer. As she blended the foundation, she couldn't help but wonder how different her life might have been if she had been born in a different era. The foundation, a simple product, held within its formula a world of stories and transformations. She finished applying it, stepping back to admire her reflection. The coverage was flawless, a testament to the skill of the artisans who had created it. In that moment, she felt a sense of empowerment, a reminder that beauty was not just skin-deep, but a reflection of one's inner strength and confidence."
"The door grumbled shut and I fell back into a doze. Margaret was snoring lightly, like a puppy being squeezed. The door reopened, and I","surfaced to vague consciousness. I felt a wave of cool air, and then a gentle warmth. He had spread a blanket over the pair of us.",51,"The door reopened, and I found myself staring at the dimly lit hallway, my heart racing. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. Slowly, I pushed myself up, my muscles protesting the sudden movement. The snoring continued, steady and rhythmic, as if nothing had happened. I took a deep breath, trying to calm my nerves. The silence that followed was deafening, and I wondered if I had imagined the whole thing. As I stood there, the door creaked open once more, and a faint light spilled into the room, casting eerie shadows on the walls. I held my breath, waiting for whatever might come next."
"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century. I was therefore unsurprised when, about half an hour after their plane landed, I got a call from Arthur’s phone.",55,"In years he had spent in this foreign land. Each time, it was to check the weather, ensuring he dressed appropriately for the unpredictable climate. The Ministry's phones came with pre-installed apps that helped them navigate the local culture and customs. Despite the convenience, Graham found himself missing the simplicity of his old phone, which never failed him. He often wondered if the Ministry's oversight extended to other aspects of their lives, perhaps even their personal relationships. One evening, while sitting in a local café, he overheard a conversation about the Ministry's influence on daily life, realizing that he had become part of a larger experiment, one he wasn't sure he wanted to be a part of anymore."
"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece,","but then again, so did Pimlico. I hadn’t seen him since the men had got back from Scotland and I asked him whether he enjoyed his trip.",53,"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece, as if he had stepped out of a photograph from the 1920s. His face was set in a determined expression, though his eyes betrayed a hint of uncertainty. The world around him seemed to move in slow motion, the people passing by barely registering in his consciousness. He had a mission, one that felt both urgent and impossible, like chasing a shadow that just outpaces you. The wind, which he knew didn’t exist, seemed to whisper secrets only he could hear, urging him forward, yet cautioning him to be careful. As he turned the corner, the streetlights flickered, casting long shadows that danced eerily in the night. The air was thick with the scent of rain and something else, something he couldn’t quite place, but it made his heart race, knowing that tonight, everything could change."
"It paid off in the early autumn. When I came down for breakfast one morning, I found","Graham at the counter with a dictionary and a tin of protein powder, performing exegesis on the label.",35,"It paid off in the early autumn. When I came down for breakfast one morning, I found the table set with an unexpected feast. The aroma of freshly baked bread and simmering stew filled the air, and my family was already seated, exchanging quiet, excited whispers. My curiosity piqued, I joined them, and we shared stories of the day's adventures, laughter, and plans for the future, making this simple meal a cherished memory."
"Adela was of the “never been to the GP in my life because I’m not a pussy” school of care, and nothing changed. If the expats were","dangerously ill, they’d be removed to the wards and never mind the trigger; if they could get a grip and deal with it at home, they should.",54,"Adela remained steadfast in her belief that visiting a general practitioner was a sign of weakness, and her health issues persisted, leading to increasing frustration. The expats, on the other hand, had long since embraced routine check-ups, finding them essential for maintaining their well-being. Despite her stubbornness, Adela's friends tried to convince her of the importance of preventive care, but she remained resolute in her stance. Eventually, a severe illness forced her to reconsider her approach, and she found herself sitting in a doctor's office, realizing that sometimes, admitting vulnerability is the first step towards true strength."
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky. But then again, I knew enough about his biography to know that he was very, very lucky.",141,"of a book on the history of sexual practices across centuries. It was a curious mix of scholarly analysis and personal anecdotes, which made for an intriguing read. Graham, however, seemed uninterested in discussing it, choosing instead to focus on his latest project at the Ministry. His reluctance to engage in any form of intimacy was becoming increasingly apparent, and I found myself wondering if there was more to his past than he was willing to share. The tension between us grew, and I couldn't help but feel that there was a deeper issue at play. Perhaps it was time to confront him, but I wasn't sure how to approach the subject without making things worse. The days passed, and the unease between us continued, each of us avoiding the elephant in the room. I began to suspect that Graham's aversion to intimacy was not just a personal choice but a symptom of something far more complex. As I delved deeper into the mystery of his sexuality, I realized that understanding him might be the key to resolving the growing rift between us."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory. Every time I gave Graham a book, I was trying to shunt him along a story I’d been telling myself all my life.",101,"I found myself constantly trying to decode the subtleties in her expressions, the way her eyes would flicker when she spoke of her home country, or the slight hesitation in her voice when discussing her past. It was a delicate dance, trying to balance respect for her privacy with the need to understand her better. Margaret was a puzzle, one that I couldn't seem to solve, no matter how hard I tried. Her stories were like fragments of a larger narrative, each piece tantalizingly close to revealing the whole picture, yet always just out of reach. I realized that Margaret's silence was as powerful as her words, and that her experiences were far more complex than any single label or assumption could capture. In the end, I learned that true understanding comes not from labeling or categorizing, but from listening and respecting the individual's journey."
Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had,ever seen him to entreating. I thought about it a lot. I liked being entreated by him.,34,"Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had to a secret that felt like it could consume me if exposed. Despite the risk, I respected his decision, understanding the weight of his burden. However, deep down, I couldn't help but worry about the consequences of keeping such a significant secret. The tension between loyalty and concern gnawed at me, making each day feel like a delicate balancing act."
"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right? They fed us all poison from a bottle marked “prestige,” and we developed a high tolerance for bitterness. I would have been more frightened if the pressure lifted, like an indoor cat struck by sudden rain.",119,"You ask me why I wasn't more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad, and yet, I found myself drawn to her, despite the warning bells in my head. There was something about her that made me question my own judgment. I had seen her in the market, her eyes gleaming with a secret that I couldn't quite place. She was always one step ahead, and that was what made her dangerous. I should have seen it, but I didn't. I was blinded by her charm, her ability to make me believe in her innocence. Now, as I sit here, I wonder if I made the right choice. The tram's path was set, and there was nothing I could do to change it. The prisoners were bound, their fate sealed. And yet, I can't help but wonder what might have happened if I had acted differently. If I had been more cautious, more suspicious, would the outcome have been different? These questions haunt me, and I can't shake the feeling that I made a grave mistake."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.",39,"I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible to fit so much into such a small space, referring to a particularly cramped historical event. I sighed, realizing that some stories were simply too big to be contained, no matter how tightly you tried to squeeze them. ""Graham,"" I said, ""sometimes, history is like a puzzle with missing pieces, and we just have to make do with what we've got."" He nodded, though I wasn't sure if he truly understood or was just trying to appease me. Either way, the conversation had shifted, and we moved on to lighter topics, though I couldn't shake the feeling that the bollocking had left a mark, even if it wasn't visible."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.",56,"of his fingers, his eyes half-closed in a contented haze. The aroma of freshly baked bread mingled with the smoky scent of a nearby fire. I could hear the soft crackling of the flames as they danced in the hearth. Graham's presence was a comforting anchor in the cool evening air. We sat in silence for a while, the only sounds being the occasional gust of wind outside and the steady hum of the fire. It was one of those rare moments when time seemed to stand still, and the world outside faded away. The evening stretched on, and we found ourselves reminiscing about old times, the warmth of the fire and the smell of the meal creating a cocoon of tranquility around us."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.",94,"Graham had a knack for capturing the essence of flavors, and I found myself drawn into his world of culinary exploration. We spent hours discussing spices, techniques, and the stories behind each dish. His enthusiasm was infectious, and soon I was helping him experiment with new recipes. We tried making Pad Thai from scratch, learning how to balance the sweet, sour, and savory elements. The process was as much about the journey as it was about the final dish. We would often sit in silence, savoring the results, only to be interrupted by Graham's sudden exclamations of delight over some unexpected flavor combination. Through these shared experiences, I realized that food was more than just sustenance—it was a bridge to understanding different cultures and the people who created them."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself. Whatever Adela said, he wasn’t ready, he’d barely left London, let alone land. But I wanted him to stay for other reasons too. It was humiliating to know that about myself and to say nothing into his implacable placidity.",98,"He was concerned about the long deployments, but I was worried about his safety in the modern navy. The bridge year had changed him, and I feared he might not be the same person who had left. I suggested he consider a career in maritime law or perhaps even a role in naval intelligence, where he could still contribute to the navy without the risks of being at sea for extended periods. He listened to my concerns but remained steadfast in his desire to return to the navy. We spent many nights discussing the pros and cons of each option, trying to find a middle ground. In the end, he decided to take a year off to explore other career paths, hoping to find a way to serve his country without the sacrifices he felt were necessary for a naval career."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.",64,"Graham sighed, realizing that the music had been playing for quite some time, and he had been too engrossed in his work to notice. He glanced at the screen, seeing the lyrics scrolling across the bottom of the screen. The song had a nostalgic feel to it, reminding him of his college days when he used to play it on repeat. He decided to let it play for a while, enjoying the familiar melody. As the song progressed, he found himself humming along, tapping his fingers on the desk. The sound of the music was oddly comforting, and he couldn't help but smile. It was a small moment of joy in what had otherwise been a long and tedious day. Graham wondered if the music had a way of connecting people, even across decades. He decided to search for more Beatles covers, hoping to find something equally as uplifting. As he scrolled through the playlist, he came across a cover of ""Let It Be"" by a local band. He added it to his queue, eager to hear how they interpreted the classic tune. Little did he know, this simple act of listening to music would lead to an unexpected encounter later that evening."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:",122,"As the years passed, Graham's online activities became more varied, though never quite escaping the shadow of those early, awkward forays into the digital world. I found myself constantly monitoring his searches, a habit I could not shake, even as I tried to convince myself that it was merely out of concern for his well-being. The database revealed a mix of interests—some innocuous, others deeply personal—but nothing that suggested the kind of ""cracked"" sexuality I had feared. Instead, I found myself questioning my own assumptions, realizing that the world was far more complex than the crude stereotypes I had allowed myself to believe. Eventually, I came to understand that Graham's online behavior was a reflection of his own journey, one that I was privileged to witness, albeit from a distance. This realization did not erase the initial embarrassment, but it did offer a new perspective, one that allowed me to see him as a person, not just a subject of curiosity or concern."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.",151,"As the rain continued to pour, the scene on our street became a surreal mix of chaos and community effort. Neighbors, strangers, and even passersby had gathered, each contributing in their own way. Some were reinforcing the sandbags with bricks and stones, while others were using buckets to transfer water from flooded basements to the street. The air was thick with the smell of wet concrete and the sound of splashing water. Despite the dire situation, there was a sense of unity that I hadn't felt in years. The council's response, though late, seemed to have galvanized the community into action. People were sharing tools, food, and even their homes for those who had lost theirs. The Blitz spirit, as the newspapers had called it, was alive and well. It was a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, a reminder that in times of adversity, people come together to face challenges head-on. The rain showed no signs of letting up, but the spirit of our community was unshaken. As I stood there, watching the scene unfold, I felt a deep sense of pride and belonging. This was more than just a flood; it was a moment that would be remembered, a story of survival and solidarity."
"“It’s better that we continue to work closely with Eighteen-forty-seven,” Adela","had said, “given that he seems likely to survive the year.”",22,"“It’s better that we continue to work closely with Eighteen-forty-seven,” Adela said, “given their track record of innovation and reliability in the sector.” She believed that collaboration would lead to mutual benefits and growth for both parties involved."
"Adela’s voice contracted on that last sentence. She wiped her gaze, concentrated in her one working eye, up and down my face, to see if I’d noticed, and continued, “Our first priority","is protecting the expats and the time-door. The time-door has been moved to a secure location. I suggest you retake the physical aptitude assessment, and then we can work on your lateral-reasoning scores—”",65,"Adela’s voice contracted on that last sentence. She wiped her gaze, concentrated in her one working eye, up and down my face, to see if I’d noticed, and continued, “Our first priority is to ensure the safety of everyone involved. We must act swiftly and with precision. Every second counts, and we cannot afford any mistakes. The situation is delicate, and we need to tread carefully. We have limited resources and even fewer allies. Our plan must be flawless, and we must execute it without hesitation. Failure is not an option, and we must succeed at all costs.” Adela’s voice trembled slightly as she finished, her single eye reflecting the gravity of the situation. I nodded, understanding the weight of the task ahead. The room fell silent, the only sound being the ticking of the clock on the wall, reminding us of the urgency of our mission."
"Arthur was gentle, no matter how grotty my behavior. He had found out about Scrabble, and he sometimes brought",his travel set along—my inner competitive bitch could stave off a black mood for half an hour or so.,38,"Arthur was gentle, no matter how grotty my behavior. He had found out about Scrabble, and he sometimes brought along a dictionary to help me improve. His patience never seemed to run out, and I admired his unwavering support. We would spend hours playing, and it wasn't just about winning; it was about the bond we formed over the game. Arthur's kindness taught me the value of perseverance and the joy of friendly competition. Even when I lost, he always encouraged me to try again, reminding me that learning was the real prize."
"My email made a chiding noise. Adela was the originator, and she’d put me in blind copy.",It was a short email. Adela had a real gift for cramming apoplexy into a couple of lines.,35,"The chiding noise was a gentle reminder that Adela was not someone to be taken lightly. I opened the email cautiously, bracing myself for whatever critique or request she might have. Her messages were always thought-provoking, and this one was no exception. It turned out to be a constructive feedback on a project I had submitted, which I appreciated despite the initial jolt of surprise."
The email told us that her death would be reported to the expats as,"a suicide. “This cannot be emphasized enough,” Adela had written, with a double underline.",28,"The email told us that her death would be reported to the expats as a tragic accident, but we knew better. There were inconsistencies in the timeline and the details didn't add up. We decided to investigate further, not just for closure, but also to honor her memory by uncovering the truth."
"Arthur smiled and sat down beside me, stretching out his long legs. Twisting the signet ring on his finger—a tell as","clarion as my skin biting—he murmured, “We didn’t know her as well as we would have liked. I wish we had.”",42,"of his nervousness, he glanced around the room, ensuring no one was watching. The ring, an heirloom passed down through generations, seemed to pulse with an ancient energy. Arthur had always been cautious, but today, there was a particular urgency in his movements. He leaned in closer, his voice barely above a whisper, ""We need to be careful. They're watching us."" I nodded, my heart racing, as we plotted our next move, unaware of the eyes that followed us from the shadows."
"Anne Spencer almost made it off those wards. After I read the email, an ancient and exuberant terror blazed through me. It was partly the terror that had grown in me alongside my very bones,","knowing as I did that I only existed because my mother had outrun almost; I don’t know at what point you stop feeling the need to run, generation by generation, when you’re born after that.",70,"Anne Spencer almost made it off those wards. After I read the email, an ancient and exuberant terror blazed through me. It was partly the terror that had grown in me alongside my very bones, the kind that never truly leaves you, no matter how many years pass. It was the fear of losing control, of being overwhelmed by the chaos that seemed to follow her everywhere. I had always been her protector, her anchor, but now, standing there, I realized that I was just as vulnerable as she was. The weight of that realization pressed down on me, making it hard to breathe. I had to find a way to keep her safe, not just from the outside world, but from the darkness that lurked within her. As I watched her, I knew that this was a battle we would have to fight together, no matter the cost."
"He was sitting at the noisome kitchen table, staring at nothing. Rogue Male was lying splayed and face down by the ashtray. The thing in my chest kicked again","as I realized he must have grabbed it as we left our home. When I came in, he didn’t move anything but his gaze, which swung up like a whip.",59,"The pain was sharp and sudden, a reminder of the turmoil within. She approached cautiously, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of movement. The silence was oppressive, only broken by the faint ticking of a clock somewhere in the distance. Her heart pounded in her chest, each beat a reminder of the danger lurking just out of sight. She reached out, her fingers trembling as they brushed against the cold metal of the ashtray. A chill ran down her spine, and she knew she had to act fast, before it was too late."
