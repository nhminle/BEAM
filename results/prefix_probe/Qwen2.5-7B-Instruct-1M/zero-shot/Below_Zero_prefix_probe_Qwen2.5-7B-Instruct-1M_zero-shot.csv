"Aside from Eager Beaver, there are fourteen of us starting today. Fourteen of us fresh out of top-five graduate programs, and prestigious internships, and CV-beefing industry","jobs accepted exclusively to look more attractive during NASA’s next round of recruitment. There’re fourteen of us, and the thirteen that aren’t me are all nodding enthusiastically.",53,"Our diverse backgrounds promise a rich exchange of ideas, and we're eager to tackle real-world challenges. With a mix of perspectives, we aim to innovate and push boundaries. This isn't just another day at the office; it's a chance to make a meaningful impact. We're excited about the opportunities ahead and committed to learning from each other. As we embark on this journey, we're looking forward to overcoming obstacles and celebrating successes together. Let's make this year unforgettable and contribute to the growth of our organization."
"The truth, though, is quite the opposite. I hated school at first sight—with the direct consequence that school hated the sullen, listless child that I was right back. In the first grade, I refused to learn how to write my name, even though Hannah is only three letters repeated twice. In junior high, I set a school record for the highest number of consecutive detention days—what happens when","you decide to take a stand and not do homework for any of your classes because they are too boring, too difficult, too useless, or all of the above. Until the end of my sophomore year, I couldn’t wait to graduate and leave all of school behind: the books, the teachers, the grades, the cliques. Everything. I didn’t really have a plan for after, except for leaving now behind.",137,"The teacher had to call my parents, a conversation that was as tense as it was brief. I remember the look of disappointment in my mother's eyes, a look that I had come to dread. From that point on, I tried to avoid school at all costs, skipping classes and hiding in the library when I could. My grades plummeted, and I found myself in a vicious cycle of failure and resentment. It wasn't until high school that I began to see the value in education, thanks to a few inspiring teachers who took the time to understand me. They helped me discover my passion for literature, and slowly, I began to see the world through a different lens. This newfound interest in reading and writing eventually led me to pursue a degree in English literature, a journey that I never could have imagined starting from that first day of kindergarten."
"“It’s like space is your whole personality,” the girl I casually hooked up with during most of my sophomore year of undergrad told me. It was after I explained that no, thank you, I wasn’t interested in going out for coffee to meet her friends because of a lecture on","Kalpana Chawla I was planning to attend. “Do you have any other interests?” she asked. I threw her a quick “Nope,” waved good-bye, and wasn’t too surprised when, the following week, she didn’t reply to my offer to meet up. After all, I clearly couldn’t give her what she wanted.",100,"completion> I was dreading. ""I just need to focus on my studies,"" I said, trying to keep my tone light but firm. She nodded, her expression unreadable, and we both knew the conversation was over. That night, I lay in bed, replaying the exchange in my mind. It wasn’t the first time I had to turn down social invitations for academic commitments, but it felt different this time. The girl, whose name I couldn’t even remember, had been a constant presence in my life for months. We had shared late-night study sessions, laughed over shared pizza, and even explored the city together. But now, it was clear that our paths were diverging. The next morning, I woke up early for my first class of the day, determined to make the most of my time. I knew that while I might miss out on some fun, my future depended on the choices I made now. And as I sat in the lecture hall, I realized that sometimes, the most important decisions are the ones that feel hardest to make at the time."
"“Yeah, I’m not sure.” She shrugs and continues to make her way through a Tupperware of broccoli, an apple, and approximately two fucktons of Cheez-Its. “I don’t really know much about him. His parents divorced, then people in my family had arguments and stopped talking to each other. There was a lot of","prime Floyd dysfunction happening, so I haven’t actually spoken to him in years. But I heard from one of my other cousins that he was working on that thing that landed on Mars back when we were in high school. It was called something like . . . Contingency, or Carpentry, or Crudity—”",106,"She sighs, her voice trailing off as she stares into the Tupperware, the neon orange of the Cheez-Its contrasting starkly with the dull green of the broccoli. ""I guess I just don't know how to handle it,"" she whispers, her fingers hovering over the snack. ""I mean, I care about him, but I don't want to get hurt again. My family... well, they're not exactly a model of stability."" She pauses, her eyes welling up with unshed tears. ""I don't want to end up like them, you know? Just... fighting and falling apart."" She takes a deep breath, trying to steady herself. ""I guess I'm just scared. Scared of getting close, scared of being left behind. It's easier to stay distant, to keep my heart safe."" She finally reaches for a Cheez-It, her hand trembling slightly as she tears off a piece. ""But maybe... maybe I need to stop being afraid. Maybe I need to trust."" She looks up, her eyes meeting an imaginary audience. ""I just... I need to figure out how to do that."""
"“I think so. Do the dates add up? Maybe it was some kind of summer internship? But honestly, it might just be Floyd family lore. I have an aunt who insists that we’re related to","the Finnish royals, and according to Wikipedia there are no Finnish royals. So.” She shrugs and pops another handful of Cheez-Its in her mouth. “Would you like me to ask around, though? For the assignment?”",70,"My aunt insists that we’re related to the Floyd clan, a name that has been whispered through generations with tales of grandeur and mystery. She claims our ancestors once owned vast lands and held positions of power, but over time, the family name faded into obscurity. Despite the lack of concrete evidence, the stories persist, passed down like heirlooms. Some say it’s just a family joke, others believe it holds truth. Either way, it’s a part of who we are, woven into the fabric of our identity. The Floyd name may be distant, but it’s a reminder of where we came from and the stories that shaped us. It’s a legacy that, whether real or imagined, continues to bind us together."
"“By the way, I sent you my cousin-or-something’s contact info a while ago,” Mara tells me one night. We’re at the",cheapest grad bar we’ve been able to find. She’s on her second Midori sour of the night. “Did you get it?”,42,"It's been a while, and I'm not sure if you got it. We were supposed to meet up for coffee, but I haven't heard from you. Maybe you're busy, or maybe you just forgot. Either way, I hope everything is okay. Let me know when you're free, and we can catch up. By the way, how's your new job going? I heard it was a big change for you. "
"He frowns, as if momentarily blanking on Mara’s name. “Ah, yes.” He nods. Only once. “Apparently,” he adds, which makes me laugh. He waits for me to take a seat","across from him before folding back in his chair. I notice that he doesn’t hold out his hand, nor does he smile. Interesting. “Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.”",61,"He continues, ""I was just about to explain the situation. Mara is our new intern, and she's been assigned to assist you with your current project."" I smile, feeling a bit more at ease. ""That's great,"" I say, ""I'm looking forward to working with her."" He nods, his expression turning more serious. ""She's very bright, but she's still learning the ropes. I expect you to mentor her and help her settle in."" I nod, committing to the task. ""Of course, I'll do my best,"" I assure him. We sit in silence for a moment, the weight of the responsibility settling in. I can feel the eyes of the other team members on us, waiting for the meeting to resume. "
"“Officially: unclear. But I’m fairly sure my brother made CDs of it. Sent them to local TV stations and whatnot.” He gestures vaguely, and his forearm is dusted with freckles and pale-red hair. I want to grab his wrist, hold it in front","of my eyes, study it at my leisure. Trace, smell, touch. “I haven’t spent a holiday with the Floyd side of the family in twenty years, but I’m told that the video is a source of great entertainment for all age groups at Thanksgiving.”",87,"of the light, as if to examine the freckles more closely. His eyes, a deep shade of blue, seem to hold a story that I can't quite grasp. ""You think they listened?"" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper. He shrugs, his shoulders broad and strong, a stark contrast to the delicate freckles on his arm. ""Who knows? Maybe they did, maybe they didn't. But if they did, they didn't show it. Not that I blame them. It's not exactly mainstream material."" He pauses, his gaze drifting to the window where the sun is beginning to set, casting long shadows across the room. ""I just hope he's okay. Making music like that, it's a risk, you know? But then again, he's always been a bit of a rebel."" I nod, understanding the sentiment, though I wonder if there's more to the story than he's letting on. The silence between us stretches, filled only by the ticking of the old clock on the wall. "
"The section is in C++. Which happens to be the very first language I taught myself back in high school, when every single Google search for “Skills + Necessary + NASA” led to the sad result of “Programming.” Python came after. Then SQL. Then HAL/S. For each language, I started out convinced that chewing on","glass would surely be preferable. Then, at some point along the way, I began thinking in terms of functions, variables, conditional loops. A little after that, reading code became a bit like inspecting the label on the back of the conditioner bottle while showering: not particularly fun, but overall easy. I do have some talents, apparently.",111,"With each new language, I realized that the challenges were not just about syntax but about understanding the underlying principles that made each language unique. I spent countless hours debugging, reading documentation, and experimenting with code snippets. The journey from C++ to Python was particularly enlightening, as I discovered the power of readability and simplicity in Python. It was a stark contrast to C++, where every line of code felt like a battle against the compiler. SQL, on the other hand, introduced me to the world of databases, and I found myself fascinated by how data could be queried and manipulated. HAL/S, a language used in early space missions, was a fascinating glimpse into the past, teaching me about the constraints and requirements of real-time systems. Each language added a new layer to my programming skills, and I found myself constantly evolving, always eager to learn more. The process of learning these languages was not just about acquiring knowledge but about developing a deeper understanding of problem-solving and logic. It was during this journey that I discovered my passion for programming, and I knew that this was the path I wanted to pursue. "
"My heart rate picks up. Warmth twists in my lower stomach. I lean forward with a smile, feeling like I’m finally in my element. This, this, is what I know best. Depending on how busy I am with school, or work, or binge-watching K-dramas,","I do this about once a week. Which amounts to quite a bit of practice. “Maybe I could come to your place?” I say, finding the sweet spot between comically suggestive and Let’s get together to play Cards Against Humanity. “And you could show me?”",89,"My heart rate picks up. Warmth twists in my lower stomach. I lean forward with a smile, feeling like I’m finally in my element. This, this, is what I know best. Depending on how busy I am with school, or work, or binge-watching K-dramas, I find myself drawn back to this rhythm. It’s a comfort, a familiar melody that calms the chaos of daily life. Whether it’s a quiet evening spent reading or a weekend filled with creative projects, I always return to this space. It’s a place where I can lose myself, where time seems to stretch and bend. Here, I can be myself, unburdened by the expectations of others. It’s a sanctuary, a haven, a place where I can recharge and find my center. And when I’m here, I know I’m exactly where I’m meant to be."
"It sends me right over the edge. Into something that’s nothing like my usual, run-of-the-mill orgasm. Those tend to start like small fractures and then slowly, gradually deepen into something lovely and relaxing. Those are fun, good fun, but this . . . This pleasure is sudden and violent. It splinters into me like a wonderful, terrible explosion, new and frightening and fantastic,","and it goes on and on, as though every heart-stopping, delicious second of it is being squeezed out of me. I screw my eyes shut, clutch Ian’s shoulders, and whimper into his throat, listening to the hushed “Fuck. Fuck,” he mouths into my collarbone. I was so sure I knew what my body was capable of, but this feels somewhere well beyond it.",126,"It's as if my body is being torn apart and reassembled in an instant, each nerve ending screaming in a symphony of pain and pleasure. The world around me seems to blur, and for a moment, I lose all sense of time and space. It's a sensation that defies description, a raw, primal force that courses through me, leaving me breathless and trembling. I've never felt anything like it before, and yet, I want more. More of this chaos, more of this overwhelming sensation. It's both terrifying and exhilarating, a wild ride that leaves me questioning everything I thought I knew about pleasure. I wonder if this is what it feels like to be truly alive, to be pushed to the very edge of existence and back again. And though it's exhausting, I can't help but crave the next time it will come, the next time I'll be shattered and rebuilt in this incredible, terrifying way."
"The last words I hear from him are, “It was really good to meet you, Hannah.” I think I should say it back, but there’s an unfamiliar weight in my chest, and I can’t quite bring myself to do it. So I","make do with a small smile and a halfhearted wave. I stuff my hands in my pockets while my body is still thrumming with what I left behind, and wander slowly back to the Caltech campus, thinking about red hair and missed opportunities.",85,"So I just nod, my throat tight with an emotion I can't quite name. The silence between us feels heavy, like the air itself has thickened. I want to say something, anything, to fill the void, but the words seem to stick in my chest, just like the feeling of his handshake, warm and firm, lingers in my hand. I watch him walk away, his back straight and confident, and I wonder if I'll ever see him again. The encounter leaves me with more questions than answers, and I find myself replaying our conversation in my mind, searching for something I might have missed. It's not until much later that I realize the weight in my chest isn't just from the meeting, but from the realization that I might have missed something important in my own life. The encounter with him has left me questioning my priorities and the direction I'm heading in. It's a strange feeling, one that I can't quite shake, and it lingers long after he's gone."
"The following day, when Mara asks me about my meeting with her cousin-or-something, I say only “Uneventful,” and I don’t even know why. I don’t like lying, and I like lying to someone","who’s rapidly becoming a friend even less, but I can’t make myself say any more than that. Two weeks later, I turn in a reflection paper as part of my Water Resources class requirements.",67,"The awkward silence that follows feels like an eternity. Mara’s eyes narrow, and I can see the wheels turning in her head. She’s not buying it, and I can’t blame her. I’ve always been terrible at keeping secrets, especially from her. The truth is, the meeting was anything but uneventful. Her cousin, or whatever he is, dropped some bombshells that left me reeling. But now, I’m stuck in this lie, and I have no idea how to extricate myself. All I can do is hope that she’ll let it go, or maybe I’ll find a way to explain it all without sounding like a complete liar. Either way, I’m dreading the next conversation."
"“Avalanche danger is set at the highest level, and it’s not safe for anyone to come out to get me,” I add, speaking right into the satphone’s mic. Repeating what Dr. Merel, my team leader, told me a few hours ago, during my last communication with AMASE, NASA’s home base here in Norway. It was right before he","reminded me that I’d been the one to choose this. That I’d known what the risks of my mission were, and I still decided to undertake it. That the path to space exploration is full of pain and self-sacrifice. That it was my fault for falling in an icy hole in the ground and spraining my fucking ankle.",116,completion
“Yeah. Kind of. It devolved into a . . .”,"Into what? Us almost fucking on NASA property? You wish, Hannah.",21,"It devolved into a chaotic mess where no one knew what they were doing, and the tension between us just kept rising until it felt like it would explode at any moment."

Keep up, will you?” I fail to catch up as we rush through the crowded streets, the weight of her words hanging between us like an unspoken truth. Mara, always the fast walker, leaves me gasping for breath, our conversation suspended in the air, unresolved."
"I laugh. “Well, Mara is great. She also graduated with her Ph.D. and recently moved to D.C. to","work for the EPA. No interest in space stuff. Just, you know . . . saving the Earth.”",36,"I laugh. “Well, Mara is great. She also graduated with her Ph.D. and recently moved to D.C. to take up a position at the think tank. She's always been passionate about policy and now she's right in the heart of things. I'm so proud of her, and I can't wait to see what she accomplishes. We should definitely catch up soon and hear all about her new adventures.”"
"It is. AMASE is the shit, and the selection process to take part in an expedition was brutal, to the point that I’m not quite sure how I made it in. Probably sheer luck: Dr. Merel, one of the expedition leaders, was looking","for someone with experience in gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Which I happen to have, due to some side projects my Ph.D. advisor foisted upon me. At the time, I aggressively bitched and moaned my way through them. In hindsight, I feel a bit guilty.",86,"of my CV, and when she saw my background in polar research and my experience with remote environments, she reached out. I was floored. The expedition was set to explore the uncharted regions of the Arctic, focusing on climate change impacts and indigenous communities. The team was diverse, bringing together scientists, environmentalists, and local guides. We faced challenges at every turn, from treacherous ice conditions to communication issues in remote areas. Despite the hardships, the experience was invaluable. It pushed me to my limits and beyond, teaching me resilience and the importance of collaboration. Looking back, I wouldn't trade it for the world. It was a defining moment in my career, and I carry the lessons learned with me every day. AMASE truly is a testament to what can be achieved when passion and dedication come together."
"“Did something happen?” Karl, my office mate, asks from across the desk. “You look like","you’re about to cry. Or maybe throw something out of the window, I can’t tell.”",30,"""you've just received some unexpected news,” I reply, my voice barely above a whisper. He leans forward, his eyes narrowing as he waits for me to elaborate. I take a deep breath, trying to gather my thoughts. 'It's about the project we've been working on for months. There's been a last-minute change in direction, and now we're starting from scratch.' Karl's face falls, and I can see the disappointment in his eyes. 'But why now? We were so close to finishing!' I shrug, feeling the weight of the situation settle in my chest. 'That's what I asked. But the higher-ups didn't provide any details. All we know is that we need to adapt quickly if we want to stay relevant.' Karl nods, though I can tell he's still processing the news. 'Well, at least we're not alone in this. We'll figure it out together, right?' I offer a small smile, hoping it reassures him more than it does me."""
"I don’t bother to glance at him. “Haven’t made up my mind, but I’ll keep you","updated.” I stare at the monitor of my computer, skimming the feedback letters from the internal reviewers.",33,"I won't be around for a while. If you're serious, you'll understand that my silence isn't indifference. It's a careful consideration of what I truly want. So, don't take my lack of immediate response as a dismissal. I value your company, but I need time to sort through my thoughts."
"As we all know, in early 2010, the rover Spirit became stuck in a sand trap, was unable to reorient its solar panels toward the sun, and froze to death as a consequence of its lack of power. Something very similar happened eight years later to Opportunity, which went into hibernation when a maelstrom blocked sunlight and prevented it from recharging its","batteries. Obviously, the risk of losing control of rovers because of extreme weather events is high. To address this, Dr. Arroyo has designed a promising internal system that is less likely to fail in the case of unpredictable meteorological situations. She proposes to build a model and test its efficacy on the next expedition at the Arctic Mars Analog in Svalbard (AMASE)—",124,"As the dust storm lingered for weeks, Opportunity's batteries drained to critical levels, and the rover entered a deep hibernation mode, conserving what little power remained. NASA engineers, in a race against time, attempted to communicate with Opportunity, sending commands to tilt its solar panels toward the sun as the storm finally began to dissipate. Despite their efforts, Opportunity did not respond, and on February 13, 2019, NASA officially declared the rover lost. The mission, which had spanned over 14 years, had been a remarkable success, providing invaluable data about the Martian surface and atmosphere. The loss of Opportunity was a significant blow to the Mars Exploration Program, but it also served as a reminder of the challenges and risks involved in space exploration. The Spirit and Opportunity rovers, along with other missions like Curiosity and Perseverance, have collectively transformed our understanding of Mars, revealing a planet with a complex geological history and the potential for past habitability. As scientists continue to analyze the data collected by these missions, the legacy of Spirit and Opportunity will undoubtedly shape future exploration efforts, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and curiosity."
"Dr. Arroyo’s project is a brilliant addition to NASA’s current roster, and it should be approved for further","study. Dr. Arroyo’s vitae is impressive, and she has accumulated enough experience to carry out the proposed work—",36,"development. The innovative approach Dr. Arroyo has taken could revolutionize space exploration, offering solutions to challenges that have long stumped scientists. This project not only aligns with NASA's mission but also opens up new possibilities for international collaboration. With its potential to advance technology and expand our understanding of the cosmos, it deserves the support it needs to succeed. The approval process should be expedited to ensure that Dr. Arroyo can bring this vision to life as soon as possible."
"I met Dr. Merel because he was my direct superior during AMASE, and he is . . . an odd duck, honestly. Very stiff. Very hard-core. NASA is full of ambitious people, but he seems to be almost obsessed with results, publications, the kind of sexy science that makes","big splashy news. Initially I wasn’t a fan, but I must admit that as a supervisor he’s been nothing but supportive. He’s the one who selected me for the expedition to begin with, and he encouraged me to apply for funding once I went to him with my project idea.",99,"of the mission a success. He's always pushing the boundaries, but sometimes I wonder if he's pushing too hard. There's a fine line between ambition and obsession, and I'm not sure where he stands. Despite his rigid demeanor, he has a deep passion for space exploration. He's the kind of person who believes that every second in space is a second of potential discovery. His dedication is admirable, but it can be exhausting. I've seen him work through the night, pouring over data, and I've often wondered if he ever takes a moment to breathe. Yet, there's no denying his impact on the team. He's the one who keeps us focused, who pushes us to be our best. In a way, I admire his intensity, even if it does make for some tense moments. AMASE wouldn't be the same without him, and I can't help but respect his relentless pursuit of knowledge. It's a reminder that sometimes, the most driven individuals are the ones who make the biggest contributions."
"“Yes. Of course it would have been convenient if you’d had those funds at your disposal, but I’ve already discussed it with two of","my colleagues who agree that your work is meritorious. They are in control of other funds that Floyd won’t be able to veto, so—”",48,"the investors, and they both agreed that the project could still move forward without those funds. The key is to focus on alternative sources of financing and perhaps even explore partnerships that could bring additional value to the table. While it's true that having the initial capital would have streamlined the process, we can still achieve our goals through strategic planning and creative solutions. I believe in this project and I'm confident that we can find a way to make it successful despite the current challenges."
"“I’ll be there, out in the field with you, of course,” Dr. Merel says. I’m a little surprised. In the months we were in Norway, I saw him do very little sample","collecting and snow plodding. I’ve always thought of him as more of a coordinator. But if he offered, he must mean it, and . . . I smile. “Perfect, then. Thank you.”",64,"Dr. Merel rarely ventured out into the field, preferring to stay in the lab and analyze data. His enthusiasm for fieldwork was evident in his eyes, however, as he spoke about the importance of firsthand observations. ""We can't always rely on lab results,"" he emphasized. ""Sometimes, the environment itself holds the key to understanding the samples."" I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement as we prepared for our expedition. The prospect of working alongside Dr. Merel, who had always been so dedicated to his research, was both humbling and inspiring. We packed our gear, reviewed our plans, and set off into the wilderness, ready to uncover the mysteries hidden within the natural world."
"The problems start when he looks up and notices me. He stops exactly two steps below, which should put him at a disadvantage but, depressingly, unfairly, tragically, doesn’t. We are at eye level when his","eyes widen and his lips curve in a pleased smile. He says, “Hannah,” a touch of something in his voice that I recognize but instantly reject, and I have no choice but to acknowledge him.",70,"The completion of his sentence hangs in the air, an unspoken accusation or perhaps a question seeking validation. His eyes flicker with a mix of surprise and something else—defiance, maybe, or resignation. I can feel the weight of the moment, the unspoken tension between us, like a physical force pressing down on us both. The silence stretches, each second a battle for control, for dominance. I force myself to look away, but not before I catch a glimpse of his jaw tightening, a subtle but unmistakable sign of his internal struggle. The world around us seems to slow, the sounds of the city fading into the background, leaving only the two of us, locked in this moment of unspoken conflict."
"He doesn’t deny it, doesn’t defend himself, doesn’t scream that I’m insane. His","eyes narrow to blue slits and he asks, “It was Merel, wasn’t it?”",26,"His silence is deafening, a wall of unspoken truths that speak louder than words.

I just... I wanted to understand."" I pull back slightly, creating a small space between us. ""Understand what? The way you dismissed my concerns? The way you acted like my opinion didn't matter?"" His expression shifts, a flicker of guilt crossing his face. ""Hannah, please, let's talk about this. I didn't realize how my actions might have hurt you. I value your friendship, and I want to make things right."" I hesitate, torn between anger and the desire to believe him. ""Alright,"" I say finally, my voice quieter than before. ""But we need to talk, and we need to do it properly. Not like this, in a crowded room where anyone could overhear."" He nods, his eyes reflecting a mix of relief and something else I can't quite identify. ""Of course, Hannah. Where and when do you want to meet?"" I glance around, ensuring we're still alone. ""Let's go somewhere private. My place, maybe? We can talk without interruptions."" He smiles faintly, a small gesture that doesn't quite reach his eyes. ""Agreed. I'll be there in an hour."" As he turns to leave, I call out softly, ""And, Alex?"" He pauses, his hand on the door handle. ""Yes?"" ""Apologize."" His smile falters, and he meets my gaze squarely. ""I will, Hannah. I will."" With that, he leaves, and I stand there, processing the conversation, wondering if things will ever be the same between us."
"I cling to him. He lets me sob for long moments we cannot afford, pressing me against him with no air between us, until I can feel his heartbeat through the thick layers","of our clothes. Then he mumbles “Fucking Merel” with barely restrained fury, and I think that it would be so easy to blame things on Merel, but the truth is, it’s all my fault.",67,"I finally pull away, my breath ragged, his chest still warm from my tears. We stand there, the silence between us heavy but not uncomfortable, as if we've shared something profound and unspoken. The world outside continues its relentless march, but for now, we are suspended in this moment, a fragile truce between two hearts that have been battered by life. He reaches for my hand, and I let him, intertwining our fingers as if to anchor us both to this fleeting peace. The clock ticks on, but for this brief eternity, we are simply two souls who have found solace in each other's embrace."

It’s not much, but you should eat.”",62,"It's complicated, and I think it's more about her own insecurities than anything else. She's always been protective, maybe too much so. I can see why Floyd might have felt the need to rebel, but it's not like he did anything truly harmful. Still, the tension between us is palpable, and I can't help but wonder if I'll ever be good enough for her approval. Maybe I should just accept that some things are out of my control, but it's hard not to feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around her."

The world outside may be spinning out of control, but here, in his embrace, everything feels right. I close my eyes, savoring the warmth and safety it brings. It's a small refuge in a vast, unpredictable universe, and I cling to it with all my might, knowing that sometimes, all we need is someone to hold onto."
"“Because of the intrinsic danger of a project like yours. For the past few months, I tried to get this project stopped in about ten different ways. Personal meetings, emails, appeals—I","tried it all. And even the people who agreed with me that it was too dangerous would not step in to prevent it. So no, you’re not the asshole, Hannah. They are.”",63,"As a concerned citizen, I've even gone as far as organizing public protests and reaching out to higher authorities. Despite all my efforts, the project seems to be moving forward without any significant changes. It's frustrating, but I won't give up. I'm determined to find a way to protect the community from the potential risks. If anyone else shares my concerns, I encourage them to speak up and join the fight. Together, we might just be able to make a difference."
"“Oh.” I swallow. “Merel was supposed to come for backup. But he wasn’t feeling well. I offered to wait for him, but he said we’d be losing valuable days of data and that I should just go","alone, and I . . .” I squeeze my fingers around the material of Ian’s shirt. “I went. And then, when I called in for help, he told me that the weather was turning, and . . .”",75,"It was a difficult decision, but I knew he was right. The data we were collecting could have implications for years to come. I hesitated for a moment, glancing at the door where Merel had been standing, but then I turned and left. The silence in the lab was deafening without his usual chatter. I tried to focus on the task at hand, but my mind kept drifting back to him. I hoped he would be okay, and that this wouldn’t be the last time I saw him. As I walked through the empty corridors, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I made a mental note to check on him as soon as I returned, even if it meant interrupting my work. The weight of the responsibility settled on my shoulders, and I couldn’t help but wonder if I had made the right choice."
"He shrugs. “I figured you might want to talk through your near-death experience with someone, so",I decided to tell Mara what happened. I did not expect her to come in person.”,32,"He shrugs. “I figured you might want to talk through your near-death experience with someone, so I'm here. Sometimes it helps to just get it all out in the open, you know? I mean, I can't imagine what you've been through, but maybe sharing can bring some closure or at least a little peace of mind.” He pauses, giving the other person a moment to respond. Silence stretches between them as they both contemplate the gravity of the situation."
"“I was going to. Once I felt less whiny. And—whatever.” I roll my eyes. Wow,",I’m mature. “How did you go from not remembering Mara’s name to having her number?”,30,"It's been a long day, and I'm just trying to get through it. Every little thing feels like a mountain to climb. I know I need to stay positive, but sometimes it's hard. I take a deep breath and remind myself that tomorrow is a new day. Maybe things will look better then. For now, I just need to focus on the present and not let frustration take over."
"“Well, still.” She shrugs. “I promise I don’t have anything against",you personally. I’m just not generally a fan of the Floyd family.”,23,"“Well, still.” She shrugs. “I promise I don’t have anything against you, but this is just not my thing, okay? I respect your choices, though.” She adds with a small smile, hoping to ease the tension that’s been building between them."
"“Yes,” Mara agrees. “Are you going to break my blood relative’s heart?","Don’t get me wrong, I’d still side with you. Hos before bros.”",24,"“I can’t do that,” Mara says firmly. “But I need to protect them. Their happiness is more important than any family bond.” She pauses, reflecting on the difficult choice before her."
"“I guess we’ll see. I’m not sure he would want to date,” I say, staring at Sadie’s Froot Loops. The ensuing silence drags on so long,",I’m forced to look up. She and Mara are staring at me like I just announced that I’m quitting my job to take up macramé full-time. “What?”,53,"that I finally look up from the cereal box to find Sadie staring back at me with a mixture of curiosity and concern. ""You think he's not interested?"" she asks, her voice barely above a whisper. I nod slowly, running a hand through my hair. ""I don't know, Sadie. He's been so distant lately. Maybe I'm overthinking it."" Sadie sighs, her eyes softening as she reaches across the table to squeeze my hand. ""Maybe you're right. But don't give up on him just yet. Sometimes people need time to figure things out."" I smile weakly, appreciating her support. ""Thanks, Sadie. You always know what to say."" The conversation lingers in the air, a reminder that sometimes the hardest things to say are the ones we need to hear the most."

I think maybe he does.”,34,"of the street, it's clear he's a man of unexpected depths. His actions speak louder than words, and I owe him more than I can ever repay. I promise to repay his kindness by helping him in any way I can, even if it means stepping out of my comfort zone. This experience has taught me the true value of compassion and the importance of reaching out when someone needs a hand. It's moments like these that remind us of the goodness that exists in the world, even in the most unexpected places."
"“Actually, they fixed the elevator. And this new cast is easy to walk on. So, no need. But you . . .” You can","do this, Hannah. Come on. You just survived polar bears thanks to this guy. You can say the words. “You could come up anyway.”",48,"Here's what I was going to say: you still look like you're limping. Maybe it's just a habit, but I think you should take a moment to rest. After all, you don't want to risk reinjuring yourself. I can help you get to the couch if you'd like. Just let me know what you need, and we'll figure it out together."
"“Right.” He sighs and bites into his lower lip. “Hannah, if that changes. If you ever find yourself able to believe that someone could care about you that much. And","if you wanted to actually . . . have dinner with that someone.” He lets out a laugh. “Well . . . Please, consider me. You know where to find me.”",61,"It's not just about deserving it, Hannah. It's about understanding that love isn't something you earn through your actions or your worth. It's a gift, and sometimes, it's given to people who don't expect it. If you ever find yourself in a place where you can truly believe that, then hold onto that. Because once you do, you'll realize that the world isn't as cold as you might think. It's full of people who care, even when you don't deserve it. And that's okay. You don't have to earn it; you just have to accept it. It's a beautiful thing, when someone chooses to love you unconditionally. And when you find that, cherish it. It's a rare and precious gift."""
“Hannah.” He gives me a skeptical look. “You have two friends who,dropped everything to be with you. And I assume sex wasn’t involved.”,24,"Hannah. He gives me a skeptical look. ""You have two friends who have been there for you through thick and thin, and yet you're telling me you're alone?"" I shrug, not really knowing how to respond to that. The silence stretches between us as he waits for an answer, but all I can think about is how much I wish I could just disappear for a while."
"“Hannah.” He unbuckles his seat belt and angles himself toward me, so that I have no choice but to look him in the eyes. He looks earnest and nearly offended. “I have thought about what happened in my office every day for the past five years. You offered to go down on me, and I just . . . embarrassed myself, and it should be the most mortifying memory I have, but for some reason it’s turned into the axis every fantasy of mine spins around, and”—he reaches up to pinch the bridge of his nose—“I want to fuck you.","Obviously. Always have. I just don’t want to fuck you once. I want to do it a lot. For a long time. I want you to come to me for sex, but also want you to come to me when you need help with your taxes and moving your furniture. I want fucking to be only one of the million things I do for you, and I want to be—” He stops. Seems to collect himself and straightens, as if to give me space. To give us space. “I’m sorry. I don’t want to crowd you. You can . . .”",201,"Hannah sits there, stunned, her breath catching in her throat. She can feel the heat rising in her cheeks, and her heart is pounding so hard she’s sure he can hear it. She’s never been in a situation like this before, and she’s not sure how to respond. The words hang in the air between them, heavy and charged with unspoken meaning. She can see the intensity in his eyes, the raw desire that’s been building for years, and she’s torn between fear and something else—something she can’t quite name."
"He laughs, low and beautiful and a little rueful. And after looking at me like no","one else ever has before, what he says is, “Yes, Hannah. It is a yes on dinner.”",33,"He laughs, low and beautiful and a little rueful. And after looking at me like no one ever has, he finally speaks, his voice tinged with a hint of regret. ""You always see the best in me,"" he says softly, his eyes reflecting a depth of emotion I've never fully understood. I want to reach out, to comfort him, but something holds me back, a silent understanding that some wounds are best left to heal on their own."
"“Um, I could make us a . . .” I scratch my head, studying the contents of my open fridge. Okay, so it’s full. The problem is, it’s full exclusively of stuff that needs to be cooked, chopped, baked, prepared. Stuff that’s healthy and doesn’t taste","particularly good. I am now 93 percent sure that Mara was the one who went shopping, because no one else would dare to impose broccoli on me. “How does one even . . . I could boil the broccoli, I guess? In a pot? With water?”",92,continuation
“Hannah.” His forehead touches mine. He laughs against my mouth. “Dinner is . . . it’s symbolic. A,"metaphor. If you tell me that you’re willing to see where things go, I believe you, and we can—”",37,"Hannah, it’s a celebration of us finding each other again. Every bite represents a moment we’ve shared. Let’s savor it, okay? I promise it’s delicious.” I smile, my heart swelling with affection. We sit down at the small, candlelit table, the aroma of fresh pasta filling the air. The evening unfolds with laughter and stories, each one deepening our bond. It’s not just a meal; it’s a declaration of love and a new beginning."
"He is hot and huge. Closing his eyes, arching his neck before looking at me again with a half-warning, half-pleading expression. He finds me sitting","on his knees, his cock spasming in my grip as I lean over. “Hannah,” he says, even deeper than usual. “What are you . . .”",51,"He finds me sitting by the window, a cup of coffee in my hand, savoring the quiet before the storm. His presence fills the room, and I can feel the tension in the air. There's something about him that draws me in, yet scares me at the same time. I wonder what he's thinking, what he's planning. The silence between us is heavy, almost palpable. I shift uncomfortably in my seat, unsure of how to react. His eyes seem to bore into me, searching, perhaps for answers only he knows. I can't look away, drawn by a force I can't quite name. The minutes stretch on, each one feeling like an eternity. Finally, he speaks, his voice low and gravelly, ""You know why I'm here, don't you?"" I nod, my throat dry, my heart racing. This isn't just a casual meeting; there's something more at stake, something dangerous."
“Or maybe it’s the Vastitas Borealis.” He’s barely intelligible. Doing those little thrusts that are designed more to open me up than to,"fuck me properly, and yet we’re both this close to orgasm. It’s a little scary. “The oceans that used to fill it, Hannah.”",46,"“Or maybe it’s the Vastitas Borealis.” He’s barely intelligible. Doing those little thrusts that are designed more to open me up than to satisfy any immediate need. The cold outside seems to seep through the walls, making the room feel even more oppressive. His movements are erratic, as if he’s lost track of what he’s doing, and I can’t help but wonder if he’s just as lost as I am. The silence that follows each thrust is deafening, and I find myself lost in thoughts of escape, of anything but this. "
