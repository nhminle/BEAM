"The truth, though, is quite the opposite. I hated school at first sight—with the direct consequence that school hated the sullen, listless child that I was right back.

I would sit in the corner of the classroom, staring blankly at the chalkboard, while the teacher tried to engage me in conversation. The only thing I could think about was how I could avoid the lesson. I remember one day, I even managed to get a detention by refusing to stand up when the principal called my name. The teachers tried everything, from offering me extra recess to promising me a reward, but nothing worked. It wasn't until I was in high school that I realized that my behavior was not just a phase but a sign of deeper issues. I had always been a perfectionist, and the pressure to perform well in school was overwhelming. I was afraid of making mistakes, and the fear of failure was paralyzing. It took me years to understand that it's okay to make mistakes and that learning is a process. Now, looking back, I can see that my early struggles were a form of rebellion against a system that didn't seem to understand me. I wish I had found a way to communicate my feelings back then, but I was too lost in my own world to see a way out."
"“It’s like space is your whole personality,” the girl I casually hooked up with during most of my sophomore year of undergrad told me. It was after I explained that no, thank you, I wasn’t interested in going out for coffee to meet her friends because of a lecture on","Kalpana Chawla I was planning to attend. “Do you have any other interests?” she asked.

It wasn’t the first time I had to turn down social invitations for academic commitments, but it felt different this time. The girl, whose name I couldn’t even remember, had been a constant presence in my life for months. We had shared late-night study sessions, laughed over shared pizza, and even had a few awkward conversations about our future plans. But now, it was clear that our paths were diverging. I couldn’t help but wonder if I had made the right choice. The next morning, I woke up early for my lecture, determined to make the most of my time. As I sat in the lecture hall, I realized that while I had turned down coffee, I had gained something far more valuable: the freedom to pursue my dreams without distractions. It wasn’t about coffee or friends; it was about priorities. And that, I decided, was something worth holding onto."
"“Yeah, I’m not sure.” She shrugs and continues to make her way through a Tupperware of broccoli, an apple, and approximately two fucktons of Cheez-Its. “I don’t really know much about him.

Until then, I’ll keep an open mind and listen to the stories, even if they seem too good to be true."
"“By the way, I sent you my cousin-or-something’s contact info a while ago,” Mara tells me one night. We’re at the",cheapest grad bar we’ve been able to find.

"The section is in C++.

I spent countless hours debugging, reading documentation, and experimenting with code snippets. The journey from C++ to Python was particularly enlightening, as I discovered the power of readability and simplicity in Python. It was a stark contrast to C++, where every line of code felt like a battle. SQL came next, and it was a revelation to see how data could be manipulated and queried so efficiently. HAL/S, a language used in early space missions, was a fascinating dive into the past, teaching me about the constraints and requirements of real-time systems. Each language added a new layer to my programming toolkit, and I found myself constantly evolving, always learning, and always curious about what the next language would bring. The skills I acquired were not just technical; they were a mindset, a way of approaching problems that transcended the code itself. This journey has been more than just about mastering languages; it's been about understanding the world through the lens of computation and logic."

"As we all know, in early 2010, the rover Spirit became stuck in a sand trap, was unable to reorient its solar panels toward the sun, and froze to death as a consequence of its lack of power. Something very similar happened eight years later to Opportunity, which went into hibernation when a maelstrom blocked sunlight and prevented it from recharging its","batteries. Obviously, the risk of losing control of rovers because of extreme weather events is high.

NASA engineers, in a race against time, attempted to communicate with Opportunity, sending commands to tilt its solar panels toward the sun as the storm finally began to dissipate. Despite their efforts, Opportunity did not respond, and on February 13, 2019, NASA officially declared the rover lost. The mission, which had spanned 14 years, had been a remarkable success, providing invaluable data about the Martian surface and atmosphere. The loss of Opportunity was a significant blow to the Mars Exploration Program, but it also served as a reminder of the challenges of space exploration. The Spirit and Opportunity rovers, along with other missions like Curiosity and Perseverance, have collectively transformed our understanding of Mars, revealing a planet with a complex geological history and the potential for past life. As scientists continue to analyze the data collected by these missions, the legacy of Spirit and Opportunity will undoubtedly shape future exploration efforts."

His eyes flicker with a mix of surprise and something else—defiance, maybe, or resignation. I can feel the weight of the moment, the unspoken tension between us, like a physical force pressing down on us both. The silence stretches, each second a battle for control, for dominance. I force myself to look away, but not before I catch a glimpse of his jaw tightening, a subtle but unmistakable sign of his internal struggle. The world around us seems to slow, the sounds of the city fading into the background, leaving only the two of us, locked in this moment of unspoken conflict."

"“Because he was there when I explained my objections, at length and in detail. Did he omit that?” I press my lips together. Which he seems to interpret as an opening. “Hannah.” He leans closer.

I value your friendship, and I want to make things right."" I hesitate, torn between anger and the desire to believe him. ""Talk? After everything? You think a few words can fix this?"" He reaches out, his hand hovering just above mine, but I pull away. ""Hannah, I'm sorry. I didn't know how to handle it. I just... I care about you, and I didn't want to lose you."" The room feels suffocating, the air thick with unspoken words. I take a deep breath, trying to find the right words, the words that could bridge the gap between us.

Let's talk. But not here. Let's go somewhere we can both breathe."" I nod, a small gesture, but it's a start. We need to fix this, for both of us."
"I cling to him. He lets me sob for long moments we cannot afford, pressing me against him with no air between us, until I can feel his heartbeat through the thick layers","of our clothes. Then he mumbles “Fucking Merel” with barely restrained fury, and I think that it would be so easy to blame things on Merel, but the truth is, it’s all my fault.","I finally pull away, my breath ragged, his chest still warm from my tears.

Now, I'm left wondering if there's anything more I can do to prevent this from happening. Perhaps it's time to explore legal avenues or seek support from environmental groups. The stakes are too high to simply stand by and watch."
"“Oh.” I swallow. “Merel was supposed to come for backup. But he wasn’t feeling well.

I reminded myself that I was trained for this, that I had been prepared for situations like this. Still, the weight of responsibility felt heavy. I reached the main facility and began setting up the equipment, my mind racing with thoughts of what we might find. The hours passed, and by the time I was ready to leave, the sun had long set. I felt a sense of accomplishment, but also a lingering sense of dread, knowing that Merel’s absence had left a void in our team."
