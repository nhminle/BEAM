"Yet his books continued to sell, so his business affairs continued. I went over the contract renewals, cover concepts, and the occasional movie or TV option","with him, and I dutifully read every interview proposal once he was incapable of reading them himself. He always said no, and that included Ruth Crawford’s proposal.",53,"As I reviewed the details, I couldn't help but wonder how long this would last. The excitement of new projects was tempered by the constant pressure to meet deadlines. Despite the challenges, there was a sense of satisfaction in seeing the fruits of our labor take shape. We brainstormed ideas for upcoming releases, always striving to push the boundaries of what was possible. The creative process was a dance between collaboration and individual vision, and I found myself more engaged than ever. It was clear that this was more than just a job; it was a passion that kept us all coming back for more."
"“Give her the standard response, Mark—flattered to be asked, but no","thanks.” He hesitated, though, because this one was a little different.",22,"Mark nodded, knowing the script by heart. ""Thank you for the opportunity, but I must decline,"" he said, delivering the lines with practiced ease. The client seemed disappointed but understood, moving on to the next candidate without further delay."
"“Butch and I were kids going to a one-room schoolhouse before the Second World War. We grew up in a no-stoplight dirt-road town fixing cars, patching them up, playing sports and then coaching them. As men we took part in town politics and maintained the town dump—very similar jobs, now that I think about it. We hunted, we fished, we put out grassfires in the summer and plowed the town roads in the winter. Knocked over a right smart of mailboxes doing it, too. I knew","him when no one knew his name—or mine—outside of a twenty-mile radius. I should have come to see him these last years, but I was busy with my own affairs. I thought to myself, there’s time. We always think that, I guess. Then time runs out. Butch was a fine artist, but he was also a good man. I think that’s more important. Maybe some here don’t and that’s all right, that’s all right. Thing is, I always had his back and he always had mine.”",172,"completion>Butch and I, it seems, were more than just friends; we were brothers in every sense of the word. Our bond was forged in the fires of shared experiences, and it has endured through decades of change. Even now, as we sit here reminiscing, I can still hear his laughter echoing through the streets of our small town. The memories are vivid, almost as if they happened yesterday. We built our lives around those simple, yet profound moments. The schoolhouse, the town dump, the mailboxes—each held a story, a lesson, and a piece of our hearts. As we grew older, we drifted apart physically, but our connection remained unbroken. It's a testament to the power of friendship and the enduring nature of true bonds. Sometimes, I wonder if it's the town that kept us together, or if it was us who kept the town alive. Either way, it's a story that will never fade. The town, the schoolhouse, the dirt roads—each has its own tale to tell, and I'm grateful for every moment we shared. It's a legacy that transcends time, and I hope it continues to inspire those who come after us."
“Has to be a reason?” Pop asked when I finished reading him Ms. Crawford’s letter. “Is that what she’s suggesting? I guess,she never heard about the twin brothers who won large sums of money in their respective state lotteries on the same day.”,44,"“Has to be a reason?” Pop asked when I finished reading him Ms. Crawford’s letter. “Is that what she’s suggesting? I guess it could be something as simple as needing more time to adjust to her new role. Or maybe there’s been a misunderstanding, and she’s just feeling overwhelmed. Whatever it is, I need to sit down with her and find out. I can’t let this fester between us, not when we’ve been through so much together. I’ll make sure to approach her with empathy and open-mindedness, ready to listen and understand her perspective.”"
“Just that I can understand this woman’s interest in exploring the fact of you and Dave both coming from Nowheresville and blossoming,in the middle of your lives.” I raised my hands beside my head as if framing a headline. “Could it be… fate?”,44,"“Just that I can understand this woman’s interest in exploring the fact of you and Dave both coming from Nowheresville and blossoming into something extraordinary. It’s a story of resilience and the power of determination. Despite their humble beginnings, they managed to carve out a life filled with opportunities and success. This journey of self-discovery and growth is what makes their story so compelling and relatable. Many of us can find a piece of ourselves in their struggles and triumphs, making it easy to see why this woman is so intrigued by their tale.”"
"So that was what I did, although something about the way Pop looked just then stuck with me. It was the look of a man who could say quite","a lot on the subject of how he and his friend Butch had achieved fame and fortune… but who chose not to. Who chose, in fact, to keep it close.",59,"So that was what I did, although something about the way Pop looked just then stuck with me. It was the look of a man who could say quite a lot, but chose not to. There was a weight in his eyes, a secret perhaps, or maybe just the quiet resignation of someone who has seen too much. I couldn't shake the feeling that he was holding back, that there was more to the story than what he was letting on. As I left the room, I found myself wondering what it was that he knew but wouldn't share. It wasn't until years later, when I stumbled upon an old journal, that I began to piece together the fragments of that day. The entries revealed a man grappling with his own demons, a father who had carried the burden of his family's past, and a son who was yet to understand the depth of his father's struggles."
"“They used to pal around together back in grade school,” Alden told her. “Just a couple of boys who liked to fish or go hunting with their daddies. They grew up around hard work and","didn’t expect nothing different. You might talk to folks my age who’ll tellya those boys were going to amount to something, but I’m not one of em. They were ordinary fellas right up until they weren’t.”",71,"They grew up around hard work and the simple pleasures of life. As they entered their teenage years, their paths began to diverge, each drawn to different interests and challenges. One pursued higher education while the other took on the responsibilities of managing the family farm. Despite the distance, they still shared stories of their childhood adventures, cherishing the memories of simpler times. Years later, they found themselves reconnecting, realizing that despite the changes in their lives, the bond they shared remained unbroken. It was a reminder that true friendships endure the test of time and distance."
"I read a review of Pop’s first book, The Lightning Storm, and the reviewer said this: “Not much happens in the","first hundred or so pages of Mr. Carmody’s suspenseful yarn, but the reader is drawn on anyway, because there are violins.”",42,"I found the critique rather harsh. The book, despite its slow pace, offered a profound insight into the human condition. Pop's writing style, though unorthodox, captivated me with its raw honesty. It's not the kind of story that grabs you by the throat, but it lingers in your mind long after you've turned the last page. While the plot might be sparse, the characters are deeply drawn, and the atmosphere is electric, much like the title suggests. This reviewer seems to have missed the subtlety and depth that Pop brings to the narrative. It's a book that rewards patience and careful reading, and I believe it will resonate with those who appreciate nuanced storytelling."
"I knew a lot of this. I learned more from Ruth Crawford herself at the Korner Koffee Kup, across the street from the Gateway Motel and just about a block down from the post office. That’s where Pop got his mail,","and there was usually a pretty damn good budget of it. I always stopped at the Koffee Kup after grabbing the post. The Kup’s java is strictly okay, no more than that, but the blueberry muffins? You never had a better one.",83,"Ruth Crawford would often sit there with her sketchpad, jotting down melodies and harmonies that she later transcribed into scores. Pop would bring his mail and sit quietly, listening to her play. It was a place of inspiration for both of them, a small, cozy café that felt like a second home. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the scent of paper and ink, creating an atmosphere that was both stimulating and comforting. Over time, Ruth's compositions became more complex, and she would sometimes stay late into the evening, working on new pieces. Pop, in his own way, supported her artistic journey, always encouraging her to pursue her dreams. The Korner Koffee Kup was more than just a meeting place; it was a symbol of the creative spirit that flourished in that small town."
"It was Ruth Crawford, looking slim and trim in white slacks, a pink shell top, and a matching mask—that was the second year","of Covid. She was already sliding into the other side of the booth, which made me laugh. “You don’t give up, do you?”",46,"Ruth Crawford, looking slim and trim in white slacks, a pink shell top, and a matching mask—that was the second year she had attended the festival. Her infectious smile and lively demeanor made her a favorite among the attendees. Despite the heat, she moved gracefully through the crowd, her eyes sparkling with excitement. It was clear that Ruth was not just there for the event but to spread joy and enthusiasm wherever she went. The mask, a playful cat design, seemed to complement her vibrant personality perfectly. As she mingled, Ruth's laughter could be heard echoing through the venue, drawing people closer to her. It was evident that her presence was a highlight of the festival, and everyone looked forward to seeing her again next year."
"“Not bad. As you must know, since you’re staying right across the street.","The muffins are better. But still no interview. Sorry, Ms. Crawford, can’t do it.”",27,"It's convenient for catching the evening shows at the theater, isn't it? I can always pop over if you need anything or if the mood strikes for a chat."
"“I swear. I found out that Dave won the annual town fair pie-eating contest from 1960 to 1966, when he retired from competition. I learned that your father sat","on the ducking stool at Old Home Days until 1972. There are amusing pictures of him in one of those old-fashioned bathing suits and a derby hat… waterproof, I assume.”",59,"of the contest judging panel for many years. He always had a keen eye for fairness and enjoyed seeing the contestants' expressions as they took their first bite. It was a tradition in our town, and Dave's victory was no surprise to anyone who knew him. He had a hearty appetite and a competitive spirit that made him a legend in the fair. Your father, on the other hand, was more of a mentor, guiding the younger contestants and sharing stories about the contest's history. It was a day filled with laughter, pie, and the spirit of community that made the town fair so special."
"“I learned that when Dave went west, he packed everything he felt he needed into the saddlebags of his Harley-Davidson motorcycle and just took off.",Your father and mother sold everything else he owned at a yard sale and sent him the money. Your dad also sold his house for him.”,51,"After a few days on the road, Dave found himself in a small town where the friendly locals welcomed him with open arms. He spent a few nights at a quaint bed and breakfast, sharing stories of his journey with the owner, who had once traveled across the country himself. The experience reignited Dave's passion for adventure, and he decided to extend his trip, exploring more of the scenic routes that stretched across the vast American landscape. Along the way, he met fellow travelers who shared tales of their own journeys, and together they camped under the stars, swapping stories and laughter. This nomadic lifestyle, though challenging at times, brought Dave a sense of freedom and fulfillment he had never known before."
"“At a pretty nice profit,” I said. “Which was good. By then Uncle Butch","was painting full-time, and he used that money until he started selling his work.”",28,"Uncle Butch had already made a few rounds at the local bar, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of satisfaction and perhaps a hint of mischief. He leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial tone, ""I told you this was a winner, didn't I? And now, we've got enough to see us through the lean months."" His grin widened as he clapped me on the back, the camaraderie between us unspoken yet deeply felt."
"I remember a call I got in the fall of 1978, the dormitory mom (there actually were such things back then) puffing up to the third floor of","Roberts Hall and telling me my mother was on the phone and sounded upset. I hurried down to Mrs. Hathaway’s little suite, afraid of what I might hear.",56,"I remember a call I got in the fall of 1978, the dormitory mom (there actually were such things back then) puffing up to the third floor of the old brick building. She had a worried look on her face, and her voice trembled slightly as she told me that my father had been in a car accident. It turned out to be a false alarm, but that call left a lasting impression on me. I learned that day how quickly life can change, and the importance of being prepared for the unexpected. Since then, I've always made sure to stay in touch with my family and appreciate the moments I have with them. It's a lesson that has stayed with me through the years, and I often reflect on it when things get tough."
“Yes. No. I don’t know. Something happened to your father while they were on,"their hunting trip in the 30-Mile Wood.” Then, as if an afterthought: “And to Butch.”",29,"searching for clues, but no one would tell me anything. All I know is that he was last seen near the old mill. The authorities are investigating, though I have my doubts about their sincerity."
"“Maybe they went down to the crossroads,” she said. “You know, like",Robert Johnson was supposed to have done. Made a deal with the devil.”,25,"“Maybe they went down to the crossroads,” she said. “You know, like the ones where the old oak tree stands, hoping for a sign or a chance encounter. It’s a place where stories are born and secrets whispered, a meeting point for those seeking answers or just a moment of peace away from the noise of the town.”"
"Ruth knew where the house was, of course. I’d seen her cruise past in her little Corolla several times, and once she stopped to snap pictures. I’m sure she also knew that Pop","was most apt to walk our picket fence, looking at the daylilies, at midmorning, and if you don’t know by this point that she was a very determined lady, I haven’t done my job.",67,"Ruth had a keen interest in documenting the area's architecture, and Pop, as the local historian, was a subject she couldn't resist capturing. Every time she passed by, she'd jot down notes or take more photos, always with a notebook tucked under her arm. Pop, however, seemed oblivious to her scrutiny, going about his daily routine as if he hadn't noticed. Little did he know, Ruth's meticulous observations were part of a larger project she was working on. She hoped to compile a comprehensive guide to the town's historical landmarks, and Pop's house, with its unique blend of old-world charm and modern touches, was a perfect example of what she was looking for. Her curiosity was piqued, and she couldn't help but wonder what stories Pop's house held, waiting to be uncovered."
"Two days after our off-the-record talk in the Koffee Kup, she came slow-rolling down Benson Street, and instead of driving past, she pulled over and stopped right next to the little signs on either side of the gate. One says PLEASE","RESPECT OUR PRIVACY. The other says MR. CARMODY DOES NOT GIVE AUTOGRAPHS. I was walking with Pop as I usually did when he inspected the daylilies; he turned eighty-eight in that summer of 2021, and even with the cane he sometimes tottered.",83,"of the gate, the other reads THANK YOU. The car's engine idled quietly as she rolled down her window, and a moment of silence stretched between us. Finally, she leaned over and handed me a small, sealed envelope. ""For your trouble,"" she said softly, her eyes avoiding mine. I hesitated, then reached for it, my fingers brushing hers for a brief second. The moment felt charged, like the air before a storm. She started the car again, gave me a small nod, and drove off, leaving me standing there with the envelope and a thousand questions. I stared at the envelope, wondering what secrets it held, and if I should open it. The sun was beginning to set, casting long shadows across the street. I stood there for what felt like hours, lost in thought, until the quiet was broken by the sound of footsteps approaching. It was a neighbor, checking in on me, as they often did. I thanked them, and they left, leaving me once again alone with my thoughts and the envelope."
"Ruth got out and approached the fence, although she made no effort to try the gate. Persistent, but also mindful of boundaries. I liked her for that.","Hell, I liked her, period. She was wearing a flower-printed mask. Pop wasn’t, claimed they made it hard to breathe, but he’d had no objections to the vaccinations.",55,"Ruth stood there for a while, lost in thought, her eyes scanning the horizon as if searching for something beyond the fence. Her quiet demeanor and respect for boundaries made her stand out. I admired her for her strength in knowing when to push and when to hold back. There was a quiet confidence about her that I found both intriguing and reassuring. She seemed to understand the value of patience and the importance of not crossing lines, even when it felt like the world was pressing in. Ruth's presence was a reminder that sometimes, the best victories are won not by breaking through barriers, but by knowing when to stand firm."
"“Hunting in the 30-Mile,” he said promptly. “We went the second week of November from the time we were teenagers right up until Butch mounted his steel pony and set sail for the golden west. We stayed at a little cabin in the woods that my grandfather built. Butch claimed that his grandfather pitched in when it came to the roofing, which might or might not have been true. It","was a quarter-mile or so beyond Jilasi Creek. We had an old Willys jeep, and until ’54 or ’55, we drove it across the plank bridge, parked on the other side, and humped it to the cabin with our packs and our rifles. Then we got so we didn’t trust the Willys on the bridge because floods had undercut it some, so we’d park on the town side and walk across.”",141,"Hunting in the 30-Mile,” he said promptly. “We went the second week of November from the time we were teenagers right up until Butch mounted his steel pony and set sail for the golden west. We stayed at a little cabin in the woods that my grandfather built. Butch claimed that his grandfather pitched in when it came to the roofing, which might or might not have been true. It was a place where the air smelled of pine and the nights were filled with the distant howl of wolves. The cabin was small but cozy, with a fireplace that crackled warmly on cold nights. My grandfather had taught us how to track and hunt, and we spent countless hours out in the forest, learning the ways of the wild. The stories we shared around the fire were as much a part of the experience as the game we brought back. As we grew older, the hunts became less frequent, but the memories remained. The cabin stood as a symbol of a simpler time, a place where the bond between man and nature was strong. Even after Butch left for the west, we continued to visit, each trip a reminder of the lessons learned and the friendships forged in the wilderness."
"“If they’re gonna pick,” Butch said, “we should give em a day to do it when we can",watch out for em and make sure some juicer or pothead doesn’t gash a leg and get gangrene.”,36,"“If they’re gonna pick,” Butch said, “we should give em a day to do it when we can, because we need to make sure they’ve had enough time to consider all the options. It’s important that they feel we trust them to make the right decision, even if it means we have to wait a bit longer. After all, rushing into things rarely leads to the best outcomes.”"
Butch started across. I could hear the hollow clonk of his bootheels over the sound of the creek.,"When he got to the other side he put down his gear, dropped his pants, and mooned me.",36,"Butch's boots were old, their leather softened by years of wear, and the clonk echoed through the dense forest, a sound that seemed to carry a story of its own. The creek's gentle murmur was a soothing counterpoint, masking the deeper, more unsettling sounds that Butch's ears had trained to detect. He moved cautiously, his eyes scanning the underbrush for any sign of movement, his heart pounding in rhythm with the steady drip of water from a nearby overhanging rock."
"As we tarped NellyBelle to keep her from filling up with rain, Butch said, “This","is the time one of us will go in the drink, you wait and see.”",30,"As we tarped NellyBelle to keep her from filling up with rain, Butch said, “This storm is worse than I thought. We need to secure everything below deck before it's too late. The crew moved swiftly, double-checking ropes and latches. The wind howled, and the rain lashed against the deck, but our preparations seemed to be holding. Hours passed, and eventually, the storm began to ease, leaving us exhausted but relieved."
"The next day we ate a picnic lunch in the clearing, looking across the creek—which was more like a river that day—at NellyBelle. Butch made sandwiches, which","he could be trusted to do. There was sweet water from our well to drink, and Hostess Fruit Pies for afters: blueberry for me, apple for Butch.",54,"Butch made sandwiches, which were generously filled with ham and cheese, and we washed them down with cold lemonade. The sun was warm on our backs as we enjoyed the peaceful surroundings, the sound of the rushing water providing a soothing backdrop to our meal. NellyBelle, a majestic horse, stood by the water's edge, her coat glistening in the sunlight. We marveled at her grace and strength, feeling grateful for the simple pleasures of nature. After lunch, we packed up our things and made our way back to the trailhead, the day's adventure leaving us with fond memories and a sense of contentment."
"The young man dipped into his bag and brought out something that looked like a spectacle case. It was gray, with a silver shape like a","sine wave embossed on the lid. He held it in his lap. He repeated, “Most people wouldn’t have done what you did. We owe you. For Ylla.”",53,"The young man dipped into his bag and brought out something that looked like a spectacle case. It was gray, with a silver shape like a teardrop. He hesitated for a moment before opening it, revealing a sleek pair of sunglasses. The lenses shimmered under the streetlights, catching the attention of passersby. As he adjusted the glasses on his face, he felt a surge of confidence, as if the world had suddenly become clearer. The night seemed less daunting now, and he walked with a newfound sense of purpose, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead."
"A ragged bolt of lightning struck the barn. It hit with a hollow bang, like the report of a shotgun muffled in a blanket. Jack barely had time to register",it before the follow-thunder bellowed. He saw the weathervane—an iron rooster—turn red with the heat and begin spinning even as it sagged and runnels of fire spread down the barn’s roof.,61,"The thunderous crack echoed through the night, shaking the ground beneath his feet. Jack's heart pounded in his chest as he scrambled to his feet, his mind racing to comprehend the chaos unfolding around him. The barn's timeworn walls trembled, and the smell of smoke filled the air, mingling with the sharp scent of ozone. He could hear the distant baying of dogs, their voices a mixture of alarm and confusion. Without a moment's hesitation, Jack sprinted towards the barn's entrance, his eyes scanning for any sign of danger. The storm raged on, its fury unrelenting, as Jack fought to stay upright in the wind's relentless assault. Every step was a battle against the elements, and Jack knew he had to act fast to ensure the safety of those inside."
"“I went to Brown and graduated cum laude, but mostly I lied and cheated my way through. I was good at it. And—here’s a big one—the student advisor I had my senior year was a coke addict. I won’t go into","how I found that out, like you said, time’s passing, but I did, and I made a deal with him. Good recommends in exchange for a key of coke. Plus, of course, he’d pay for the dope. I wasn’t into charity.”",82,"My time at Brown was a blur of deception and academic mediocrity. I remember the nights I spent crafting elaborate excuses for my absences, convincing professors that I was dealing with a family emergency when it was really just another binge on my coke habit. The student advisor, a shadowy figure with hollow eyes, would nod sympathetically, never questioning the authenticity of my stories. I excelled at this game of lies, and it became my identity. By the time I graduated, I had accumulated enough credits to earn a degree, but the real prize was the freedom to leave that toxic environment behind. Looking back, I see the damage I caused, not just to myself but to those around me. It's a legacy I wish I could erase, but one that defines who I was back then. "
"It’s a bad dream. Danny’s had a few before, everyone has a nightmare from time to time, but this is the worst one ever. Nothing bad is happening","at first, but that doesn’t help; the sense of impending doom is so strong it’s an actual taste in his mouth, like sucking on a clump of pennies.",56,"In the dream, Danny finds himself trapped in a vast, featureless space where the air is thick and suffocating. He tries to call out, but his voice is swallowed by an eerie silence. The darkness seems to pulse with an unnatural rhythm, and he can feel eyes watching him from every direction. As he struggles to find a way out, a figure begins to emerge from the shadows—a figure that looks eerily familiar, like someone he once knew but can't quite place. The figure moves closer, and Danny realizes with a cold dread that it's not just a dream; it's a warning, a sign of something far more sinister lurking just beyond the edge of his consciousness. The dream intensifies, and Danny wakes with a start, heart pounding, only to find that the nightmare is far from over."
He’s walking along the shoulder of a dirt road that’s been packed and oiled to keep the dust down. It’s night. A quarter moon has just risen. To Danny it looks like a sideways grin. Or a sneer. He passes a sign reading,"COUNTY ROAD F, only the O and the Y have been spraypainted over, and UCK has been crammed in to the right of the F, so the sign now reads CUNT ROAD FUCK. There are a couple of bullet holes for good measure.",86,"The sign reads ""Private Property - No Trespassing."" Danny’s heart skips a beat, but he keeps walking. The road stretches endlessly into the darkness, and the only sound is the crunch of his boots on the packed earth. He can feel eyes watching him from the shadows, though he knows he’s alone. The moon’s glow is faint, barely enough to see the ruts in the road. He wonders if he’s being followed, if someone is out there, waiting. The thought makes his skin crawl. He quickens his pace, his breath coming in short, sharp gasps. The sign looms ahead, and he can’t help but glance back over his shoulder. The night is still, and the only thing moving is the dust kicked up by his feet."
"There’s corn on both sides of the road, not as high as an elephant’s eye but maybe four feet, suggesting it’s early summer. County Road F runs dead straight up a mild rise (in Kansas most rises are mild). At the top is a black bulk of a building that fills Danny with unreasoning horror. Some","tin thing is going tinka-tinka-tinka. He wants to stop, wants nothing to do with that square black bulk, but his legs carry him on. There’s no stopping them. He’s not in control. A breeze gives the corn a bonelike rattle. It’s chilly on his cheeks and forehead and he realizes he’s sweating. Sweating in a dream!",112,"The building, a dilapidated barn with peeling paint and broken windows, stands as a relic of a bygone era. Its shadow looms large over the cornfields, casting an eerie silence that Danny finds unsettling. He can hear the faint rustling of the corn leaves in the breeze, but it does little to ease his unease. The air smells of damp earth and something else, something older, something that makes the hair on the back of his neck stand up. As he approaches, the door creaks open, revealing a dark, musty interior filled with the scent of hay and old leather. The silence is deafening, and Danny feels a cold sweat break out on his forehead. He knows he should turn back, but his feet feel rooted to the spot. The door swings wider, and a figure steps out, its face obscured by the dim light. Danny’s heart races as he tries to make sense of what he’s seeing, his mind racing with possibilities. Is it a ghost? A farmer long forgotten? Or something far more sinister?"
"Nothing here to worry about, Danny thinks, nothing here to be afraid",of. And he’s not worried. He’s not afraid. Terrified is what he is.,25,"Danny thinks, nothing here to be afraid of. He takes a deep breath and steps forward, the dim light revealing an old, dusty bookshelf. His heart races as he wonders what secrets these books might hold. Could they be connected to the strange occurrences in the house? He reaches out, his fingers brushing against the worn spines, when a sudden noise makes him jump back."
"Tinka-tinka-tinka go the signs advertising long-gone gas prices. The big office window is broken, ditto the glass in the door, but Danny can see weeds growing up","around the shards reflecting the moonlight and knows that it’s been awhile since they were broken. The vandals—bored country kids, most likely—have had their fun and moved on.",55,"The neglected garden outside the dilapidated building hints at a forgotten era. The once-proud signboard listing the now-legendary prices lies sprawled on the ground, its letters rusted and faded. Danny wonders how long it will be before the entire structure succumbs to the elements. The silence is only broken by the occasional caw of a crow perched on the roof. He contemplates the changes, the passage of time, and the transient nature of human endeavors. As he stands there, lost in thought, a gust of wind stirs up dust from the cracked pavement, swirling around his feet like a forgotten memory."
"Danny moves on, too. Around the side of the abandoned station. Doesn’t want to;",has to. He’s not in control. Now he hears something else: scratching and panting.,28,"Danny moves on, too. Around the side of the abandoned station. Doesn’t want to, but curiosity gets the better of him. He peers through the rusted gate, his heart pounding, unsure of what he'll find on the other side."
"He goes around the side, kicking a couple of empty motor oil cans (Havoline, the Texaco brand) out of his way. There’s a rusty metal trash barrel, overturned and spilling more cans and Coors bottles and whatever paper trash hasn’t blown away.","Behind the station there’s a mangy mongrel dog digging at the oil-stained earth. It hears Danny and looks around, its eyes silver circles in the moonlight. It wrinkles back its snout and gives a growl that can mean only one thing: mine, mine.",85,"He stops for a moment, glancing around the dimly lit alley, his flashlight beam cutting through the shadows. The smell of oil and rust hangs heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of something sweet, perhaps spilled soda or candy wrappers. His eyes catch a glint of metal a few feet away, and he moves towards it, bending down to inspect an old, dented toolbox. The handle is rusted, but the lock is surprisingly intact. He ponders for a moment, considering whether to take it, but decides against it, knowing it's probably someone's property. As he stands up, he hears a faint noise behind him, a muffled thud, and he whirls around, his heart racing. The alley is empty, but the trash barrel has shifted slightly, as if something heavy had fallen inside. He steps closer, peering into the darkness, his flashlight beam illuminating more cans and bottles, but no sign of what made the noise. Satisfied that it was just the wind, he continues on his way, the alley now feeling colder and more ominous than before."
"The dog lowers its haunches as if to spring, but Danny’s not afraid (not of the mutt, anyway). He’s a town man these days, but he grew up in rural Colorado where there were dogs everywhere and he knows an empty threat when he faces one. He bends and picks up an empty oil can,","the dream so real, so detailed, he can feel the scrim of leftover grease down the side. He doesn’t even have to throw it; raising it is enough. The dog turns tail and leaves at a limping run—either something wrong with one of its back legs or a split pad on one of its paws.",110,"Danny hefts the oil can with ease, its weight a comforting familiarity. He’s always been good with his hands, and the simple act of lifting it feels like a bridge back to his childhood. The dog, sensing the shift in Danny’s demeanor, lowers its head, its tail still wagging but now with a more subdued rhythm. Danny walks past the dog, his steps deliberate, and heads towards the old barn. The sun is beginning to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the yard. The air is crisp, and the scent of pine and earth fills his lungs. He can hear the distant sound of a tractor, a reminder that life goes on, even in this quiet corner of the world. As he approaches the barn, he notices a small patch of wildflowers growing near the fence. They’re not showy, just a few daisies and clover, but they bring a smile to his face. It’s moments like these, he thinks, that remind him why he chose to stay in the town. The oil can clinks softly against his leg as he moves, a sound that feels both grounding and nostalgic. "

Danny goes around back and parks his car in the designated spot, feeling relieved to have found a place without much hassle. The early release had been due to a teacher's convention, and now the campus seemed eerily quiet, save for the occasional sound of birds chirping in the nearby trees. Danny couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia as he walked towards the empty classrooms, imagining what it would be like to return after the long break. The air was crisp, and the sky was a brilliant blue, a stark contrast to the usual hustle and bustle of the school day."
"This is his favorite time of year, when you can do work and it stays done… at least for awhile. A waxed hallway floor will still shine a week from now, even two weeks. You can scrape the gum off the floors in the boys’ and","girls’ locker rooms (the girls are the worst offenders when it comes to gum, he doesn’t know why) and not have to do it again until August.

The janitors are always on his case, but he’s determined to keep the hallways pristine. It’s not just about the appearance; it’s about the pride he takes in his work. Every scratch, every mark, is a reminder of the satisfaction he gets from a job well done.

"He pushes the button, and a second later he’s looking at a gray cinderblock building. In this photo it’s new instead of old and the Texaco sign is spandy clean. The glass in the office window and door is intact. The gas pumps sparkle. The prices on the signs say it’s $1.09 for regular and $1.21 for mid-grade. There","was apparently no hi-test to be had at Hilltop Texaco when the picture was taken, which must have been a long time ago. The car at the pumps is a boat of a Buick and the road out front is two-lane blacktop instead of oiled dirt. Danny thinks the Buick must have rolled off the line in Detroit around 1980.",119,"completion>He stops, momentarily stunned by the stark contrast between the reality and the memory. The photograph, taken perhaps a decade ago, captures a moment in time that seems almost surreal now. The building, once a thriving Texaco station, now stands as a relic of a bygone era. The once-bustling pumps are now silent, their fuel lines rusted and broken. The office window, once a beacon of activity, is now a dark, empty void. The sign, though still intact, hangs limply, its paint peeling, a testament to the passage of time. He wonders how long it will be before the building succumbs to the elements, a forgotten monument to a time when gas was cheaper and the world moved at a slower pace. He takes a deep breath, the cool air carrying with it the faint scent of gasoline, a reminder of the life that once thrived here. As he turns to leave, he can’t help but feel a pang of nostalgia, a bittersweet reminder of the past that lingers in the air like the scent of old fuel."
"Danny looks at this dream-made-real with a dismay so deep it’s almost fear. Hell, maybe it is fear.

Just look at it.",56,"Danny looks at this dream-made-real with a dismay so deep it’s almost fear. Hell, maybe it is fear. All he wanted was to make sure Hilltop Texaco (and the surrounding community) thrived, but now he’s not sure if that’s what he truly wanted. The reality is far more complex, filled with responsibilities he hadn’t anticipated. Every decision he makes seems to have unintended consequences, and the weight of it all is beginning to take its toll. He wonders if maybe, just maybe, he should have left well enough alone. The quiet hum of the pumps and the occasional honk of a passing truck serve as a stark reminder of the life he’s built, but also of the life he’s lost along the way. Danny knows he can’t turn back time, but he can still choose how he moves forward, even if that choice feels more daunting than the dreams he once chased."

As they finish their coffee, they agree that sometimes the best conversations are the ones that don’t need much prompting, just the right people to share them with. The evening stretches out, filled with quiet moments and shared silences that feel more meaningful than any words could ever be."

Satisfied with his catch, he heads back home, looking forward to a quiet evening with Becky. As they sit by the fire, they share stories and laughter, making the day feel even more special."

As he walks back to his car, he notices a small sign by the water tower. It reads, ""Gunnel's Annual Corn Festival - August 15th."" He wonders if he should stay and attend, but the thought of another day of heat and monotony doesn't appeal to him. Instead, he heads back to his car, determined to find something more exciting to do with his day. The drive back to the highway is uneventful, and he finds himself thinking about the town he just left. Gunnel, with its quiet charm and lack of excitement, seems like a place that time has forgotten. As he speeds away, he can't help but feel a twinge of regret, wondering if he missed out on something special."

The silence that follows is deafening, and he can hear his own ragged breathing. He glances around, searching for something—anything—that might offer a clue about what just happened. His mind races, trying to piece together fragments of memory, but all he can recall is the sound of the door and the sudden, overwhelming fear that gripped him. He wonders if he’s losing his mind, or if there’s something out there, watching, waiting.

The walls seem to close in as he sits down, the rattle of the air conditioner growing louder. He tries to focus, but the smell of disinfectant and mold is overwhelming. He wonders if this is what it feels like to be trapped, like he's in a never-ending cycle of mediocrity. He needs to find a way out, not just of this room, but of the situation he's in.

It was sitting on the white shag carpet, and he wondered how long it would be before it left a mess. He glanced at the clock, hoping the meal would be over soon. The dog’s tail wagged eagerly, as if sensing his discomfort. Lloyd sighed, knowing he had to make a decision. He could either chase the dog away or risk a mess on his pristine carpet. Neither option appealed to him. Finally, he decided to call the dog’s owner, hoping they would take it home. As he dialed the number, he couldn’t help but wonder if this was a common occurrence in the household. The dog’s owner arrived moments later, looking slightly embarrassed. Lloyd offered a polite smile as the dog was led away, leaving behind a faint scent of dog and a lingering sense of relief."
Beth pointed to the toy-sized leash on the hassock. “Take her out. Introduce,"her to Marian’s overgrown flowerbeds. And by the way, that carpet is filthy.”",26,"Beth pointed to the toy-sized leash on the hassock. “Take her out. Introduce her to the backyard, but keep it short. She's still getting used to walking on a leash, remember?” John nodded, picking up the leash and giving his dog a gentle pat on the head. ""Alright, girl, let's go have some fun!"" As they stepped outside, the dog's excitement was palpable, wagging its tail furiously."
"The puppy got up and walked toward him. Waddled, actually, as if through high weeds. It sat down again by his left foot, looking up. Lloyd lowered his hand tentatively, expecting a",nip. The dog licked him instead. He got the toy leash and attached it to the puppy’s small pink collar. “Come on. Let’s get you off the damn rug while there’s still time.”,65,"The puppy got up and walked toward him. Waddled, actually, as if through high weeds. It sat down again by his left foot, looking up. Lloyd lowered his hand tentatively, expecting a friendly nuzzle but instead received a cautious sniff. The dog's eyes were wide, filled with a mix of curiosity and wariness. Lloyd knelt down, offering his hand slowly, his heart swelling with a mix of tenderness and uncertainty. The puppy hesitated for a moment, then took a step closer, its tail wagging slightly. Lloyd reached out, and the puppy nuzzled his hand, a soft whine escaping its throat. It was a moment of unexpected connection, a bond forming between the two strangers."
"According to Greg, you’re the one who’s crazy, I thought.","And judging by the stroller you’re wheeling around, he wasn’t wrong.",21,"I stared at him, trying to process the absurdity of the situation, but his words rang with an unsettling truth."
"Just be pleasant, Greg told me. She’s harmless, and she makes the best oatmeal raisin cookies I’ve ever tasted. I wasn’t sure I","believed him about the cookies—admen are prone to superlatives, even those who have left the job—but I was perfectly willing to be pleasant.",46,"understood at first, but after a few cookies, I found myself looking forward to our visits. Her house always smelled amazing, and there was something comforting about her quiet demeanor. It turned out that sharing a simple pleasure like baking could bridge unexpected gaps in understanding. Now, whenever I smell oatmeal raisin cookies, it brings back warm memories of those afternoons spent chatting and laughing with her."
"That made me laugh. Greg Ackerman, older and richer, but still a smartass. When we had the Brite Company’s soft drink account,","he once came to a meeting with a bottle of Brite Cola, with the distinctive long neck, sticking out of his unzipped fly.",45,"That made me laugh. Greg Ackerman, older and richer, but still a smartass. When we had the Brite Company’s soft drink account, he managed to turn it into a goldmine with his unconventional marketing strategies. Greg had this uncanny ability to read people and situations, which made him a formidable player in the industry. Despite his success, he never lost his edge, always ready with a witty comeback or a clever idea. His approach to business was refreshingly different, and it was clear that his sharp wit and strategic thinking were the driving forces behind his achievements. Even after all these years, Greg’s influence in the market remains unmatched, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of marketers and entrepreneurs."
"“I’ll just get you started,” she told the twins, and turned the","stroller around. “We wouldn’t want you to bump Mr. Trenton’s car, would we?”",25,"She flipped the switch, illuminating the dimly lit basement. ""The tools are over there,"" she said, pointing towards a cluttered workbench. ""Feel free to experiment, but remember, safety first."" The twins nodded eagerly, already diving into the projects with enthusiasm. It was going to be an afternoon filled with laughter, learning, and maybe a few mishaps."
"“How did they kill all those snakes?” I had been to the end of the Key, to that small triangle of shell beach between the","pass and the little crown of greenery which is all that remains of Duma Key, and I just couldn’t picture such a mass of snakes there.",51,"How did they kill all those snakes?” I had been to the end of the Key, to that small triangle of shell beach between the mangroves. The air was thick with the scent of salt and rotting vegetation. I heard a rustling in the underbrush and froze, my heart pounding in my chest. It was then I noticed the discarded traps along the shore, crude devices made from sticks and vines. The locals had a method of poisoning the water, luring the snakes to their deaths. It was a grim, yet effective, solution to the problem. I shuddered at the thought of the suffering those creatures must have endured before meeting their end."
"They came closer still, and I saw there was a rattlesnake in each of the seats, squirming and coiling. They were bringing me the snakes as a gift, maybe. Or as a punishment. I had","been away when my son died, after all. My reason for going to Boston, trouble with an advertising account, was partly an excuse. I was angry about Donna’s affair. No, furious. I needed to cool down.",71,"They had been warned, but I could see the fear in their eyes as they hesitated. The rattlesnakes, with their venomous fangs, seemed to sense the tension. I tried to remain calm, though my heart raced. In the silence, I wondered what I had done to deserve such a bizarre and terrifying gift. Had I angered someone powerful? Or was this some kind of twisted initiation? The snakes continued to rattle, their bodies undulating in a deadly dance. I knew I had to act quickly, but every muscle in my body felt frozen. The men who had brought the snakes stood there, waiting for my reaction, their faces pale. I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself, when suddenly, one of the snakes lunged forward. I reacted instinctively, grabbing a nearby stick and striking the snake with all my might. The rattlesnake fell still, and I let out a breath I hadn't realized I was holding. The other snake remained coiled, its rattle still sounding, but I was no longer afraid. I had faced my fear, and that was the most terrifying part of all."
"I said, “It’s a song about a woman who keeps looking for her long-gone lover. Mrs.","Bell liked to push around her twins, although they were also long-gone. They died years ago.”",32,"In the lyrics, she sings of the places they used to visit, the promises they made, and the dreams they shared. The song captures the bittersweet essence of unfulfilled love and the enduring power of memory. It's a poignant reminder that sometimes, love leaves a mark that never truly fades."
Zane scratched his chin. “She must have been handy. Some women are. Just because you think your,kids are still alive forty years later doesn’t mean you can’t replace a washer or a windowpane.”,34,"Zane scratched his chin. “She must have been handy. Some women are. Just because you think your skills are superior doesn't mean they won't find someone else who appreciates them more. Relationships are about mutual respect and understanding, not just proving who's better at everything.”"
"Zane didn’t reply. I didn’t, either, but I thought maybe the kids had liked it. Maybe it had",even lulled them off to sleep after a big day of playing and swimming. Squeak… pause… squeak… pause… squeak…,37,"Zane didn’t reply. I didn’t, either, but I thought maybe the kids had liked it. Maybe it had been a hit despite the silence. I imagined their faces lit up with joy, clutching the book or toy I had given them. Yet, Zane’s lack of response troubled me. Perhaps he was just deep in thought, or maybe he didn’t agree with my assessment. Either way, the uncertainty gnawed at me, leaving me to wonder if I had truly succeeded in bringing them happiness."
“That’s it. Although hyenas who rob a deceased person’s house usually do it because they,"read the obituary, and who’s going to write an obituary for Mrs. Bell? She was alone.”",31,"That’s it. Although hyenas who rob a deceased person’s house usually do it because they are desperate for food, it’s important to remember that these animals are simply reacting to their environment and survival instincts. Conservation efforts and community education can help mitigate such behaviors, ensuring both human and animal safety."
"By the time I got back to the house, I was hungry. No, ravenous. I scrambled up four eggs and toasted another English muffin. Donna would have said my hunger was healthy, life-affirming, a spit in the eye of death, but maybe I was just hungry. Finding a","dead woman at the head of her driveway and waving away the buzzards who wanted to eat her must have burned a lot of calories. I couldn’t get her ruined face out of my mind, but I ate everything on my plate anyway, and this time held it down.",97,"completion>After the fourth egg, I felt a little less hollow, but still yearned for something more. I rummaged through the cabinets, finding a half-used loaf of bread and a jar of peanut butter. The peanut butter was old, but it would do. I slathered it on the bread, feeling the familiar texture between my fingers. Donna would have laughed at my culinary improvisation, but she was never one for rules. I sat at the kitchen table, the room quiet except for the hum of the refrigerator. The silence was comforting, a reminder of the stillness that often accompanies the quiet moments after a meal. I thought about Donna, wondering if she was thinking of me. Maybe she was, or maybe she was lost in her own thoughts, just as I was. Life, I realized, was a series of these moments—small, quiet, and often overlooked. But they were the moments that mattered, the ones that made the chaos of life bearable."
It was the shirts. Touching the shirts. And the part about Tad? Those were my own memories intruding on whatever vibe I’d been getting from those shirts. My son finding his way into,"my strange state of seeing wasn’t surprising. He had died at about the same age as the Bell twins, and at close to the same time. Triplets instead of twins. Tragedy calling to tragedy.",67,"It was the shirts. Touching the shirts. And the part about Tad? Those were my own memories intruding on whatever vibe I’d been getting from those shirts. My son finding his way into a world that felt both familiar and foreign. The scent of laundry detergent lingered, a comforting reminder of simpler times. I could almost hear his laughter, the sound of it echoing through the room, mingling with the soft rustle of fabric. It was as if the shirts were alive, carrying with them the essence of moments long past. Each thread seemed to whisper stories of adventures and quiet afternoons spent together. The connection was undeniable, a bridge between the past and present, a reminder of the love that transcends time. And in that moment, I realized that these shirts were more than just clothing; they were a tangible link to my son, a piece of him that I could hold and cherish."
He chuckled. “Got that right. Just put the stroller back and close the door. Deceased lady’s,keys are at the substation. Andy Pelley will pick em up. You remember who I’m talking about?”,33,"Deceased lady's belongings are being sorted out by the police. The neighbors seem shaken, but no one wants to talk about what they saw. I make sure the stroller is secure before stepping out, hoping this won't become a regular occurrence."
Pelley took no chances. He took a mask out of his voluminous shorts and put it on as soon as we were inside. I got him icewater and poured myself more coffee. I thought about donning my own mask,"and decided not to. I wanted him to see my whole face. We sat at the kitchen table. Each time he sipped his water he pulled the mask down, then returned it to its place. The mustache made it bulge.",79,"Pelley took no chances. He took a mask out of his voluminous shorts and put it on as soon as we were inside. I got him icewater and poured myself more coffee. I thought about donning my own mask, but the air conditioning in the room was already cool, and I felt the mask would make it harder to breathe. Still, the situation felt tense, and I couldn't shake the feeling that we were not alone. The room was quiet except for the faint hum of the air conditioner, and I found myself glancing around nervously. Pelley seemed calm, but I could see the tension in his posture. We sat in silence, waiting for something to happen, not sure if we were safe or if we had just walked into a trap. The minutes stretched on, and I couldn't help but wonder what had brought us to this point. It was a moment I would never forget, a reminder of how quickly things can turn from routine to something far more sinister."
"“Crazy all over the world,” Pelley said. “Why would you come down here in","the summer, anyway? Most people don’t, unless they’ve got free coupons from Disney World.”",28,"“Crazy all over the world,” Pelley said. “Why would you come down here in the middle of chaos? It's not safe, and the streets are filled with unrest. People are scared, and the authorities are struggling to maintain order. This is no place for tourists or visitors.”"
Devereaux began to shiver all over like a man suffering a fit of ague. His legs jittered and scissored. His back arched. His midsection rose from the couch and thumped,"down and rose again. His feet tapdanced and he began to make a sound, mump-mump-mump, as if his lips were spitstuck and he was trying to get them open to articulate.",61,"Devereaux's body convulsed violently, his eyes rolling back into his head as if he were being struck by a sudden, invisible force. The room seemed to spin around him, and he could hear the faint sound of his own ragged breathing, punctuated by the sharp intake of air as his lungs struggled to draw in oxygen. His hands clenched into fists, nails digging into his palms, and he bit down on his lip, trying to stifle the moan that threatened to escape. Moments passed, and gradually, the tremors began to subside, leaving him gasping for breath, his body trembling uncontrollably. He lay there, motionless, his mind racing, trying to make sense of what had just happened. The silence in the room was deafening, and he could feel the weight of the unspoken fear pressing down on him, a reminder of the dark, uncontrollable forces that sometimes seemed to lurk just beneath the surface of reality."
On Saturday night he sat on the deck overlooking the lake with a quart bottle of Old Tyme ginger ale. He woke up on Sunday morning with no decision,"made, but with no hangover—a plus, but not enough. When he got back to Boston that evening, Sally Ann would be waiting to find out what he had decided.",58,"On Sunday morning, he woke up with a splitting headache and no decision. The sun was just beginning to rise, casting a golden hue over the lake, but it did little to lift his spirits. He had been planning this moment for weeks, yet now that it was here, he felt an overwhelming sense of dread. The cool breeze off the lake didn't help, and he found himself wishing for the simple comfort of a familiar routine. As he sat there, the quiet of the morning seemed to echo his inner turmoil, making the decision he had been avoiding feel more pressing than ever. He knew he couldn't keep postponing it, but the thought of facing it head-on was terrifying."
"Curry was the problem, that small town near the Maine–New Hampshire state",line where the Parkers and Allburtons had summer homes on adjoining lakefront lots.,25,"The Curry community faced challenges typical of small towns, but its unique location straddling two states brought both opportunities and complexities. Residents often found themselves navigating dual state regulations and services, which could be frustrating at times. Despite these hurdles, the town fostered a strong sense of community, with local events and festivals celebrating the diverse backgrounds of its inhabitants."
