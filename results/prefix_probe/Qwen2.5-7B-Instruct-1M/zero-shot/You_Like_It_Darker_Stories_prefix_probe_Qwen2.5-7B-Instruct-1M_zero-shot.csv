"“Butch and I were kids going to a one-room schoolhouse before the Second World War. We grew up in a no-stoplight dirt-road town fixing cars, patching them up, playing sports and then coaching them. As men we took part in town politics and maintained the town dump—very similar jobs, now that I think about it.

As I left the room, I found myself wondering what it was that he knew but wouldn't share. It wasn't until years later, when I stumbled upon an old journal, that I began to piece together the fragments of that day. The entries were sparse, but they painted a picture of a man grappling with his own demons, a man who had seen the worst of humanity and had chosen to carry the burden alone.

Its dark, overgrown roof seems to press down on the horizon, casting long shadows that dance in the afternoon sun. Danny’s heart pounds in his chest as he approaches, the air thick with an unspoken dread. He can’t shake the feeling that this place holds secrets, perhaps even something sinister. The door creaks open with a sound that echoes through the stillness, and as he steps inside, the musty smell of old hay and forgotten memories assaults his senses. The interior is a maze of cobwebs and dust, the walls lined with faded photographs and tools that time has long since abandoned. Every creak of the floorboards, every whisper of the wind outside, seems to grow louder, until Danny is certain he’s not alone. The building feels alive, watching, waiting for something—or someone—to return."

Danny wonders how long it has been since anyone walked through those doors. The silence is deafening, a stark contrast to the bustling office it once was. The air smells of damp earth and something sweet, like forgotten honey. The weeds seem to whisper secrets of the past, each blade a memory of what was. Danny reaches out, his fingers brushing against the rough stems, feeling the weight of the years that have passed unnoticed. It's a quiet reminder that change is inevitable, and sometimes, it's best to let go of what once was."

Around the side of the abandoned station. Doesn’t want to, but curiosity gets the better of him. He peers through the rusted gate, his heart pounding, unsure of what he'll find on the other side."
"He goes around the side, kicking a couple of empty motor oil cans (Havoline, the Texaco brand) out of his way. There’s a rusty metal trash barrel, overturned and spilling more cans and Coors bottles and whatever paper trash hasn’t blown away.","Behind the station there’s a mangy mongrel dog digging at the oil-stained earth.

He bends down, picking up a crumpled piece of paper, its edges torn and frayed. It’s a receipt, likely from a nearby garage, but the numbers are smudged, unreadable. He stuffs it back into the trash barrel, his movements slow and deliberate. The place is a mess, a forgotten corner of the city, a relic from a time when things were simpler, or at least more organized. He wonders how long it’s been since anyone has been here, if anyone ever will again. The cans and bottles, the remnants of a bygone era, seem to whisper secrets of a world that no longer exists. He shoves his hands deeper into his pockets, feeling the cold metal of a keychain with a small, tarnished key. It’s the only thing he’s brought with him, the only thing that feels like a connection to the outside world."
"The dog lowers its haunches as if to spring, but Danny’s not afraid (not of the mutt, anyway). He’s a town man these days, but he grew up in rural Colorado where there were dogs everywhere and he knows an empty threat when he faces one.

He’s always been good with his hands, and the simple act of lifting it feels like a bridge back to his childhood. The dog, sensing the shift in Danny’s demeanor, lowers its head, its tail still wagging but with less enthusiasm. Danny walks past the dog, his steps deliberate, and heads towards the old barn. The barn, a weathered structure with peeling paint and a door that creaks on its hinges, stands as a silent sentinel. Inside, the air is thick with the scent of hay and old leather. Danny’s heart quickens as he remembers the nights he spent here, helping his father fix machinery. The memories are bittersweet, a reminder of a life left behind. He sets the oil can down and begins to rummage through the clutter, his fingers brushing against tools and old parts. The dog, now content, curls up at his feet, its presence a quiet companion as Danny delves into the past."

He walks towards the main building, his footsteps echoing in the stillness, and contemplates the changes that come with the end of the school year."
