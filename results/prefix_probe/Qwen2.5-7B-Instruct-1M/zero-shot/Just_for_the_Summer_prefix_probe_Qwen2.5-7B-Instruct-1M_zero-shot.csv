I [29m] have been friends with Chad [32m] since we were born. Our moms are best friends and we grew,"up together and were roommates for the last 10 years, up until the incident that set our current situation into motion.","up together in a small town where our mothers' friendship was a cornerstone of our lives. As kids, we shared countless adventures,",41,"We grew up together in a small town where our mothers' friendship was a cornerstone of our lives. As kids, we shared countless adventures, from building forts in the backyard to exploring the nearby woods. Over the years, we've faced challenges and celebrated victories side by side. Despite the miles that have come between us, our bond remains unbroken. Chad and I have always been more than just friends; we're family, through and through. Our shared history is a treasure that we both cherish deeply, and I know that no matter what life throws our way, we'll always have each other."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.","Here we go again.

I was taken aback, but figured it couldn't hurt to meet for coffee. We ended up talking for hours, and surprisingly, there was still a spark. It's been a whirlwind since then. We're seeing each other more, and it feels different this time around. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm open to the possibility that things could work out. It's been a long time since I felt this way about someone, and I don't want to rush into anything. However, I also don't want to miss out on a potential connection. We'll just have to see where it goes from here."
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me.

He’s been trying to find a solution that doesn’t involve leaving his current apartment in a mess or leaving Hope in a difficult situation. They’ve been discussing the possibility of subletting the space, but the market is slow, and finding a suitable tenant is proving challenging. Meanwhile, Chad’s landlord has been supportive, offering to give him a month to find a new place, but Chad is still anxious about the uncertainty. He hopes that things will work out, but deep down, he knows that this transition is going to be tough for both of them."
"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend. If you’re reading this, you’re dead to me, human Chad. (Not really, I still love the guy.) But I tag him in the captions of every Chad the Dog Instagram post with “Look, a loyal Chad!”","I've decided to call him ""Mittens"" because, despite his flaws, he has a certain charm.

He's become my best friend, and I wouldn't trade him for anything. The other day, I even took him to the park, and he ran around like a little kid, chasing after squirrels. It was heartwarming to see him so happy. Now, I don't mind the extra time I spend outside, and I no longer feel the need to stare out the window. Mittens has given me a new perspective on life. He's taught me to appreciate the little things and to never give up on something just because it's not perfect. I'm so glad I decided to give him a second chance. He's changed my life in ways I never imagined possible."
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers. Maddy,"didn’t look happy, but she took the picture with my phone, then handed it back to me.","raised an eyebrow, clearly not impressed.

""Only four?"" she asked, her voice laced with skepticism. ""What are we celebrating again?"" I grinned, knowing full well the reason behind the celebration. ""Your birthday, duh!"" I exclaimed, and she rolled her eyes playfully before joining in the laughter."
"“That dog trusts him,” Maddy said. “And that’s a rescue dog, so that means something. They’re usually all","skittish and freaked out.” She went quiet again looking at his wall. “Go down further,” Maddy said. “The billboard.”","That's right, Maddy,"" he replied thoughtfully.

It's a beautiful thing to witness."" Maddy nodded, her eyes softening as she watched the dog wag its tail happily by the door, waiting for its next adventure."

It was one of those evenings that felt both simple and perfect, a moment to cherish."

She said with a sigh, realizing she needed to be more organized."
My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out. Actually, I missed a lot of things now that Brad had moved out. Like having another human to talk to, even if it was this one.","My best friend, John, would often regale me with tales of his adventures in the store, from discovering rare tropical fruits to helping customers find",62,"My best friend, John, would often regale me with tales of his adventures in the store, from discovering rare tropical fruits to helping customers find the perfect gift. His enthusiasm was infectious, and I found myself looking forward to our weekly catch-up sessions. Now, I have to navigate the aisles alone, comparing labels and prices, missing the easy camaraderie. Sometimes, I wonder if I should just order everything online, but then I think of the joy of browsing and the occasional surprise find. It’s not the same, though. I guess I’ll just have to make the most of it and maybe even learn a few things along the way."
"“This is true,” Brad said, looking at his phone. “We are",assholes. But only to each other.

They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t.

It was a beautiful way to celebrate their love and bond, making every moment special and unforgettable. The anticipation was palpable as they packed their bags, excited for the adventure ahead. They couldn't wait to create new memories together, knowing that these experiences would strengthen their relationship in ways that words could never fully capture."
Brad took a swallow of his drink. “Ask that nurse out. Go,"wherever she is. Pitch the idea to her, she might be into it.”","on, you two would make a great couple.

Brad chuckled, realizing maybe it was time to stop holding back on his feelings."
"“Yeah,” Brad said. “She dates you, you guys break up, and she rides happily into the sunset too. It’s a win-win. Seriously. This is your chance.",If you don’t do something you’re gonna spend the rest of your life sending women on to their forever families and never getting one for you.”,"Brad paused, his voice tinged with sarcasm.

Brad stood up, his eyes distant, and walked out of the room, leaving the other person to ponder his words."
Brad looked me in the eye. “You will never find someone as long as all the women you date aren’t actually meant for you. You’re not their,soulmate. Their soulmate is the person they meet after you. It’s decided the minute it starts. They are literally fated not to be The One. Think about it.”,"everything, and they’re not your forever. It’s about connection, Brad.

Don’t settle, but don’t rush either. The right person will come when you’re both ready.” I nodded, absorbing his words, realizing how much I had been chasing the wrong things in my relationships. "

We chatted for a while, catching up on old times, and I realized that despite the distance, our bond remained strong. It was a conversation that reignited a friendship I had thought was long forgotten."
“But what if it isn’t? I’m just playing devil’s advocate here. What if it isn’t?

The silence that followed was deafening, a stark contrast to the usual chatter that filled the room. I turned to him, my eyes searching for some kind of reassurance, but all I saw was a mirror reflecting my own doubts. ""What if we're just not meant to be?"" I finally asked, my voice barely above a whisper. Brad looked at me, his expression unreadable, and simply said, ""Sometimes, we have to let go to truly understand."" The conversation ended there, but the question lingered, a seed planted in the fertile soil of uncertainty."

"I nodded and put up a finger. “I’ve got to go,”",I said into the phone. “Maddy wants to watch a movie.”,"I glanced at my watch, realizing I was already late. ""I'll",22,"I glanced at my watch, realizing I was already late. ""I'll be back as soon as I can,"" I promised, hoping they'd understand.

We ended up chatting for a while, sharing stories about our recent travels, before she wished us a safe journey. It was one of those unexpected encounters that made the day a little brighter."

We lugged our bags up the stairs and were sweating by the time we made it to the door. We came in through a screened-in porch that overlooked the lake. Maddy and,I shared a glance. It was adorable.

The lake shimmered under the setting sun, and we could hear the distant sound of waves lapping against the shore. After a quick dinner, we decided to take a walk along the beach. The sand was cool beneath our feet, and the stars began to twinkle in the clear night sky. It was going to be a memorable weekend, full of laughter and adventure."
"The bedrooms were off the living room on either side of a short hallway with a single bathroom shared in the middle. The bathroom had a white claw-foot tub, pale blue","tile, and an old pedestal sink. I took the room with the cushioned reading nook in the window and Maddy picked the one with the hanging swing chair in the corner.","The tiles were a soft, soothing mint green that complemented the blue hues of the bathroom decor.

A small, frosted glass window let in just enough natural light to illuminate the space. The claw-foot tub sat regally in the center, its legs adorned with delicate floral carvings. Shelves lined the walls, holding an assortment of toiletries and decorative items. The air smelled faintly of lavender, adding to the serene atmosphere. It was a cozy, inviting space that felt like a retreat from the rest of the house."
"Four hours later, Maddy and I were back at the cottage sitting in the screened-in porch.",We’d had dinner in town and then boated back. The fridge was stocked up and we’d unpacked.,"After the long hike, we settled into comfortable chairs, sipping on iced tea as the evening",33,"After the long hike, we settled into comfortable chairs, sipping on iced tea as the evening breeze cooled our skin. The sound of crickets filled the air, and Maddy shared stories from her childhood, her laughter echoing softly. The porch light flickered gently, casting a warm glow over the rustic furniture. It was one of those perfect moments, simple yet deeply satisfying, where time seemed to stand still."
She looked away from me. “Emma…” Her eyes came back to mine. “Please. Please do it.,Do it now before you lose the chance to meet them altogether. People don’t live forever.”,"She hesitated, her voice trembling slightly as she pleaded with me. ""I can't bear the thought",32,"She hesitated, her voice trembling slightly as she pleaded with me. ""I can't bear the thought of you hurting. Just... do it for me, okay? I trust you."" Her eyes pleaded with me, filled with a mix of fear and hope. I could see the desperation in her gaze, and it tugged at my heartstrings. I wanted to refuse, to tell her it was too dangerous, but her vulnerability was overwhelming."
"“How about this,” Maddy said. “Run your DNA and make your account private. We’ll change your privacy settings for a few minutes, poke around. If you have any","relatives out there, we’ll screenshot it and go back to private. Then I’ll go and find them online and tell you if they seem like people worth knowing.”","output> Maddy, what are we looking for exactly?"" Sarah asked, her voice tinged with curiosity.

After a few minutes, they found nothing out of the ordinary, but the experience left both of them on edge. They knew better than to trust easily, especially in a world where privacy was a luxury few could afford."
We prioritized power for the coffee maker first and we brewed a pot while I sat in the kitchen with,"a towel wrapped around my head.

I took a deep breath, feeling the tension in my shoulders begin to ease as the warmth spread through me. It was moments like these, simple and grounding, that reminded me of the importance of taking time for oneself amidst the chaos of daily life. The coffee maker, a humble appliance, had become a symbol of the small pleasures that made each day a little brighter."
The snail’s-pace speed the pontoon put out somehow seemed faster with the beach approaching. Maddy threw it in reverse. The engine,"downshifted miserably, but we started to slow. Then to my horror we began to move backward, motor first, right into the dock.","sputtered, coughing up a cloud of black smoke as the pontoon struggled to maintain its backward motion.

Maddy gritted her teeth, pushing the throttle harder, but the boat seemed reluctant to gain speed. The rhythmic slap of the water against the pontoon provided the only sound as they slowly backed away from the beach, the sand retreating further with each passing second."
"When we were safely away from anything we could crash into, Maddy killed the engine and slumped in the captain’s","seat. “If we’d been on the other side of the dock, we could have hit the yacht,” she said, looking shaken.","chair, letting out a long breath she hadn't realized she was holding.

Hours passed, and as the sun began to set, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Maddy finally spoke, her voice barely above a whisper. ""We made it,"" she said, more to herself than to anyone else, but the words hung in the air, a testament to the ordeal we had just endured."
"I lined the nose of the boat up with the side of the dock and started for it again, only this time I killed the thrust earlier. We",coasted along the side and I put us into reverse to slow us down while Maddy grabbed one of the dock poles and we came to a stop.,"I could feel the boat slow down as the water resistance increased.

This time, I had done it right."
"Her phone rang. “Oh, hold on. I have to leave my ringer on in case Maddy gets in trouble trying to get back.” She looked at it. “It’s her.” She swiped and put the",phone to her ear. “Maddy?

Her breath caught in her throat, and she quickly agreed, instructing Maddy to stay put. Racing to the car, she dialed the park's number, explaining the situation to the staff. After a few tense minutes, they arrived, and together they managed to free the gate. Maddy emerged, looking relieved, and they drove home in silence, both lost in their thoughts about the evening's events."
I hadn’t really cared too much that Benny might not be here today. He wasn’t the point of this visit. But all that,had changed in the last ten minutes.

My heart skipped a beat, and for a moment, I forgot why I had been upset about his absence. It turned out that his presence wasn't just a surprise but a turning point for the meeting, as he brought a fresh perspective that we hadn't considered before. The atmosphere in the room shifted, and what could have been a routine update turned into a productive and engaging discussion."

""What happened? Is he...?"" Maddy cut her off, her voice breaking. ""Just come, please. I can't do this alone."" Tears welled up in her eyes as she hung up the phone. She glanced at the clock; it was still early. How could this be happening? She quickly grabbed her coat and keys, her mind racing with questions and fear. As she rushed out the door, she hoped against hope that Maddy was wrong, that everything would be fine. But deep down, she knew the truth. This was going to be one of those days that would change everything."
“I hope so. It’s been a little stressful.” She picked up Murder Mittens. “I don’t think I really thought this island thing through. It,"sounded like a good idea at the time but it’s kind of inconvenient. Anyway, it’s only for six weeks and Maddy likes the cottage, so…”","She took a deep breath, trying to calm her nerves.

Maddy was already off the pontoon and running toward me across the beach.

"Amber was in a flowing white-and-peach chiffon summer dress with a slit up the thigh. Her long brown hair was down, she had on a floppy wide-brimmed hat and huge sunglasses.

The day was perfect, and Amber felt as though she had stepped into a painting, her every move graceful and serene. She paused by a small pond, her reflection shimmering in the still water, and for a moment, time stood still. The world around her was a blur of colors and sounds, but Amber was content, lost in the beauty of the moment."
"“Emma, you won’t believe my day,” she said, looking back at me. “So I wanted to surprise you. I flew all the way over here on","a red-eye, got an Uber, and came out to the address you gave me, but when I knocked on the door this handsome man answered instead.”","a whim, thinking you’d be thrilled.

I’ll just have to make sure I plan something even better next time.”"
“Are you kidding me with this?” Maddy hissed as soon as they were out,of earshot. “She’s here for what? Six hours? And she’s already hypnotized our landlord?”,"of earshot,"" Maddy whispered furiously, her eyes narrowing with disbelief.

Maddy crossed her arms. “What she always does? Show up and leave a path of,"destruction in her wake? She’s not staying with us,” she said in her end-of-discussion voice.","destruction in her wake.

Maddy rolled her eyes in the way that I knew meant she was aware. “Please tell me I don’t have to stay and watch,you eat crustaceans with that woman.

She groaned, running a hand through her hair, clearly dreading the upcoming event. “Great,” she muttered, “just what I needed on my already crummy day.”"
I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships. Especially relationships.","I had known it all along, but seeing him there confirmed my suspicions.

I’d tried to be softer with her the last few days. The energy shift I’d had over Mom after my talk with Emma,"was almost as bad as being mad at her.
