It was clear that they were both feeling very intense emotions, and I didn't want to be the one to push them apart. I could see the tension building, and I knew I had to do something to diffuse the situation before it escalated. As I stood between them, I could feel the heat of their gazes on me, and I hoped that my presence would act as a buffer, giving them both a moment to cool down and think things through. It wasn't easy, but I felt it was the right thing to do at the time."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.","we decided to have a cozy night in.

Jack popped in some popcorn, and we settled down with a good thriller. As the credits rolled, Jack turned to Autumn and said, ""Well, that was certainly more enjoyable than the last one."" Autumn giggled, ""Agreed, but I still think we should avoid anything with ghosts for a while."" Jack nodded, ""Agreed, maybe we can watch a comedy next time."" Autumn smiled, ""Definitely, something light-hearted would be perfect. I need a break from all the scares."" Jack chuckled, ""You know, I think we should start a tradition of watching a different genre each week. It could be fun!"" Autumn thought for a moment, ""That sounds like a great idea. We could even make a list of movies to watch."" Jack grinned, ""Perfect, let's do it. Who knows, we might even discover a new favorite genre."" Autumn nodded excitedly, ""Yes, and we can do it together, making it even more enjoyable."" As they planned their movie nights, they felt a sense of excitement and anticipation for the week ahead."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.",Embarrassment washes over me as I hear Jack's footsteps approaching.

The silence stretches as Jack stands by the door, seemingly unaware of my predicament. After a moment, he speaks softly, asking if everything is alright. My heart races as I struggle to formulate a response, praying he doesn't insist on staying."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,"Jack, I can't just leave her there, not after everything she's been through. She needs help, and I need to know",41,"Jack, I can't just leave her there, not after everything she's been through. She needs help, and I need to know if she's okay. I glance back at the tent, my heart pounding. What if something terrible has happened? I take a deep breath, steeling myself, and push the flap aside. The dim light inside reveals a figure huddled in the corner, trembling. ""It's okay,"" I say softly, approaching cautiously. ""I'm here to help."" As I get closer, I notice the faint scent of fear and sweat. The figure slowly raises its head, revealing a face I never expected to see in this situation. ""Sarah?"" I whisper, my voice barely audible over the rustling of the tent."

He stands up, his movements stiff and weary, and heads towards the door. His eyes are heavy with exhaustion, and the room seems to spin slightly as he walks. Jack knows he needs to leave, to get away from here, but the weight of what just happened presses down on him like a physical force."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”","She drifts off into her own world, completely unaware of the chaos",23,"She drifts off into her own world, completely unaware of the chaos around her. It's both endearing and slightly concerning, the way she loses herself in thought. I've always admired her focus, but there are times when I wish she'd snap out of it and join the real world."

"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke.

Jack turned out to be quite the storyteller, and I found myself eagerly awaiting our conversations. Despite our different schedules, we managed to meet up on weekends, and soon, we became inseparable. It was during one of those weekend outings that we realized we had a lot in common, and our friendship blossomed into something more. Looking back, I can't believe how much has changed since that first day of school, but one thing remains constant: the bond we share."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer.

The gym was still buzzing with the sound of sneakers on the floor and the occasional shout of encouragement. We both knew we were late for our next class, but for a moment, it didn't matter. Jack leaned in, his voice low, ""You didn't think I'd miss this, did you?"" I shook my head, a smile tugging at the corners of my lips. ""No way,"" I replied. ""So, what's new?"" he asked, his eyes twinkling with mischief. I hesitated for a moment, unsure if I should share the news, but then decided to go for it. ""Well, actually, I got a new job offer,"" I said, watching his reaction closely. His eyes widened, and a broad grin spread across his face. ""That's awesome! When do you start?"" he asked, genuinely excited for me. ""Next week,"" I replied, feeling a surge of happiness. ""I'm so happy for you,"" Jack said, clapping me on the back. ""Let's celebrate after class,"" he suggested. ""Sounds good to me,"" I agreed, already looking forward to the day. As we stood up to leave, Jack gave me a thumbs-up. ""You're going to do great,"" he said, and I knew he meant it. That small gesture meant the world to me, and I felt a wave of gratitude wash over me. It was moments like these that made me realize how lucky I was to have friends like Jack."
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.","Autumn's smile was infectious, and Jack found himself grinning back despite the sudden rush of emotions.

Jack hesitated, unsure of how to respond. ""I... I was just passing by,"" he said, his words coming out in a rush. ""But I couldn't help but notice you. You look... different."" Autumn's eyes widened slightly, and she chuckled. ""Different in a good way, I hope?"" Jack nodded, his heart pounding in his chest. ""Yeah, definitely. I mean, you've always been beautiful, but... well, you've changed. I didn't know what to expect."" Autumn's smile grew, and she stepped closer, her hand resting gently on his arm. ""Well, I'm glad you're here. Maybe we can catch up properly this time."" Jack swallowed hard, feeling a warmth spread through him. ""Sure, that would be great."" As they began to walk, Jack couldn't help but notice how much he had missed her, and how much he wanted to know more about the changes in her life. The conversation flowed easily, and Jack found himself laughing and sharing stories, feeling a connection that had been missing for far too long."
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face.

The silence in the car was heavy, and I couldn’t help but wonder what had transpired earlier that had left him feeling so remorseful. As I drove away, I made a mental note to check in on him the next day, hoping to offer whatever support he might need. Life had a way of throwing these unexpected curveballs, and I was determined to be there for him, no matter what."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.","adorned the walls.

It was as if the very essence of our friendship had been lost in the transition from one season to another, leaving only echoes of what once was."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah?

As we stepped out into the hallway, I saw a group of students whispering and pointing. Jack's eyes darted from one person to another, his breath coming in short gasps. ""Jack, what's wrong?"" I asked, my voice trembling. He didn't answer, just kept walking, his movements jerky and unsteady. I reached out to grab his arm, but he shrugged me off, his eyes wild with fear. ""Jack, please, talk to me,"" I pleaded, my mind racing with possibilities. Whatever was happening, it was clearly affecting him deeply, and I couldn't understand why."
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack.

Keep pushing, keep growing, and never stop believing in yourself.”"
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly.

As I sat on the sidelines, I watched the game unfold, noticing the subtle differences in how the experienced players moved. It dawned on me that the key wasn't just about speed but also about patience and precision. I made a mental note to practice these aspects more rigorously. Returning to the field, I felt a renewed sense of purpose, ready to apply these new insights. The game resumed, and I could feel the difference in my play, moving more fluidly and making smarter decisions. It was a valuable lesson that I carried forward into other areas of my life, realizing that sometimes stepping back allows for greater progress."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it.

This was just the beginning, and we were excited to prove ourselves in the upcoming games."

Jack's words made me reflect on how I could handle challenges more effectively in the future. It was a reminder that everyone has their own way of dealing with stress, and sometimes, a little patience goes a long way."
"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots. The junior varsity team practiced on the south field, closer to the circular drive where parents dropped off and picked","up kids. Even though Jack and I were on different teams, our schedules were still the same, and my mom would drive us to and from practice every day for those last weeks of summer.","The parents would drop off their children before heading to the nearby coffee shop.

Many of them looked forward to the annual tournament, where their skills would be put to the test against other schools. The experience not only honed their athletic abilities but also taught them valuable life lessons about teamwork and perseverance."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me.

The quiet streets gave me time to think about the skills I needed to improve and the strategies I could use. I made a mental note to hit the gym early the next morning to work on my conditioning. Walking home, I realized that this was just the beginning of what could be a great journey with this team."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again.

I couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to happen, though I wasn't sure what. The north field stretched out before us, vast and mysterious, as if it held secrets we were about to uncover. The anticipation was almost unbearable, and yet, there was a strange sense of excitement in the air. We walked for what felt like hours, the landscape slowly transforming as the light grew stronger. Finally, we reached the edge of the field, where an old, weathered barn stood, its doors wide open, inviting us in."
"What if, this morning, she woke up in the tent before I thought?

""I was just... thinking,"" I said, my voice as uncertain as hers had been. She nodded slowly, as if accepting my explanation, but I could see the doubt in her eyes. The morning light filtered through the tent, casting long shadows that seemed to stretch between us, each one a reminder of the distance that had suddenly grown between us."
"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me. Jack has always said I’m irrational when it comes to Autumn, and maybe I should have taken him more seriously, because he was right earlier today.","It's a sacrifice I'm not sure I can make, but I feel it's the right path.

The road to self-discovery is never easy, but it's a path I must take, no matter the cost."
“I already know why you did it.” She doesn’t have to explain that part. I know she’s never wanted me like that. I don’t need to hear her,say it. “I just want to know why you had to be so cruel about it.” It’s time to face what Jack has been telling me all these years.,"She won't say it, but I see the truth in her eyes.

I guess I'll just have to deal with it, though. After all, it's not like I can avoid her forever."
My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either.

So, I let him live, at least for now. The real question is, how long will I be able to keep this secret from the others?”"
"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn.

Or is it just my imagination playing tricks on me? Either way, I can’t shake the feeling that things are about to change, and I’m not sure if I’m ready for that. What if Jack’s protection isn’t just about me? What if it’s about something bigger, something that involves both of us?
