I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.",41,"I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that they were both feeling very intense emotions, and I didn't want to be the one to push them apart. I could see the tension building, and I knew I had to do something to diffuse it before it escalated. As I stood between them, I could feel the heat of the situation, and I hoped my presence would act as a buffer, giving them both a moment to cool down and think things through. It wasn't easy, but I felt it was the right thing to do at the time."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.",49,"we decided to have a cozy night in. Jack popped in some popcorn, and we settled down with a good thriller. As the credits rolled, Jack turned to Autumn and said, ""Well, that was certainly more enjoyable than the last one."" Autumn giggled and replied, ""Agreed, but I still think we should avoid anything with ghosts for a while."" They both laughed, and the evening turned into a comfortable routine of movies and laughter. Little did they know, the real scare was yet to come, lurking just outside their door."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.",36,"Embarrassment washes over me as I hear Jack's footsteps approaching. I quickly adjust the blankets, hoping he didn't notice my discomfort. The silence stretches as Jack surveys the room, his eyes lingering on me for a moment before he speaks. ""Everything okay?"" His voice is calm, but there's an underlying tension that makes me squirm. I nod, though my voice betrays me, ""Yeah, just... you know, adjusting."" Jack raises an eyebrow, clearly not buying it, but he doesn't press further, simply turning to leave. As he closes the door behind him, I let out a breath I didn't realize I was holding, my mind racing with thoughts I'd rather not explore."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,41,"Jack, I can't just leave her there, not after everything she's been through. She needs help, and I need to be the one to give it to her. I glance at you, hoping you understand, but your expression remains unreadable. What do you expect me to do, Jack? Just walk away? The tent flaps move, and a figure steps out, catching both our attentions. It's her, looking pale but determined. ""Jack?"" she calls out, her voice trembling yet strong. ""What's happening?"""
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.",35,"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with ""enough is enough."" He stands up, his movements slow and deliberate, as if the world itself is dragging him forward. His eyes are heavy with exhaustion, and yet, there's a determination in them that I've never seen before. Jack takes a deep breath, steeling himself for whatever comes next, and I can't help but wonder if he knows more than he's letting on."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”",23,"She drifts into her own little world, losing track of time as if she's invisible to everyone around her. It's both endearing and a bit concerning, especially when she forgets to eat or misses appointments."
“Why don’t we restart the movie? We can all watch it.” Jack,gives me a look to remind me that our other conversation isn’t over.,25,"“Sure, why not?” Sarah agreed, “The popcorn’s still warm, and we might miss something interesting if we wait.” The group nodded in unison, gathering back around the screen as the movie began to play again from the start, eager to see what they had missed or perhaps enjoy it all over again."
"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that","look on his face, I know what he’s going to say. I open my mouth.",29,"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that knowing smile, I can't help but feel a wave of affection wash over me. It's been a long day, but seeing him happy makes it all worthwhile. We exchange a warm hug, and I watch him drive off, feeling a sense of contentment that only a loyal friendship can bring."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?",61,"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch with her made me feel a bit lonely. Over the next few weeks, we gradually started sharing more classes, and our conversations grew more frequent. Jack turned out to be quite the storyteller, always bringing something new to our lunch table. Despite our different schedules, we found common ground in our love for science and math. Eventually, we became inseparable, and our friendship blossomed into something more. Looking back, I realize that those early days of middle school were the foundation of a lifelong bond."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer. I said yeah, not really interested in conversation, not really listening, wondering what Autumn was doing.",97,"completion>After the teacher had given us the signal to stop, Jack and I exchanged a quick glance, and I could see the excitement in his eyes. He had been talking about the game for days, and I could tell he was eager to share his thoughts. ""So, how was your run this morning?"" he asked, leaning in slightly. I told him about my jog, but my mind was still on the ball game. We spent the next hour catching up, discussing everything from the latest sports news to our plans for the weekend. Jack was always full of energy, and I found myself laughing more than I had in a long time. It was nice to have a moment to relax and just talk. As we finished our conversation, I realized how much I had missed these moments with him. The gym had become a place where we could both unwind and share our lives. "
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.",92,"Autumn's smile was warm, but Jack felt an odd mix of emotions. He had always admired her from afar, but now that she was standing right in front of him, he wasn't sure what to make of it. ""Jack,"" she said, her voice soft yet firm, ""I know you didn't expect this."" He nodded, his mind racing. ""I... I didn't,"" he admitted. ""But I'm glad you're here,"" she added, her eyes sparkling with a mix of curiosity and something else he couldn't quite place. Jack swallowed hard, trying to process the situation. ""What... what does this mean?"" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper. Autumn took a step closer, her presence filling the space between them. ""It means we have a lot to talk about,"" she replied, her tone leaving no room for misunderstanding. Jack felt a strange mix of excitement and anxiety, unsure of how to proceed. As they stood there, the world seemed to slow down, and for the first time in a long time, Jack felt truly alive."
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure. But he thought I had deluded myself into believing this hot girl was my friend.",79,"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on his face. The way he held his head, the slight slump of his shoulders, it was clear he felt bad about something. I didn’t press him for details, though. Instead, I just nodded and said, ""Thanks for the ride."" We both knew the unspoken words hanging in the air: ""I’m sorry."" The night was quiet, save for the distant hum of the city. Jack didn’t say anything as he walked up to his front door, and I waited until he disappeared inside before driving away. That night, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted between us, and I wasn’t sure if it was for the better or worse. Months later, I still found myself thinking about that moment, wondering what Jack was really feeling that night."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.",58,"of Autumn adorned the walls. Jack found himself drawn to the warmth and coziness of my home, appreciating the changing leaves and crisp air. We spent afternoons walking through the woods, collecting fallen leaves, and sharing stories under the golden hues of the setting sun. As the days grew shorter, Jack realized that Autumn wasn't just a season but a companion that brought beauty and tranquility. This friendship blossomed into a deep appreciation for the simple pleasures life offered, and Jack found himself looking forward to each new season with eager anticipation."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.",59,"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still close. Despite my efforts, the doubts lingered, casting a shadow over our past camaraderie. Every time I tried to explain, it felt like I was justifying something that had already slipped away. The distance between us seemed to grow with each passing day, and I couldn't shake the feeling that no amount of reasoning would bridge the gap. It was as if the very essence of our friendship had been lost in the transition from one season to another, leaving only echoes of what once was."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.",41,"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him to say something, but all he did was grab his backpack and rush towards the door. ""Jack, wait!"" I called out, but he didn't stop. His face was pale, and sweat was beading on his forehead. I followed him, my heart pounding in my chest, unsure of what was going on. As we stepped out into the hallway, I noticed a few students staring at us, whispering among themselves. Jack's erratic behavior was making me more anxious by the second. ""Jack, what's wrong?"" I asked again, grabbing his arm gently. He didn't respond, just kept walking, his eyes fixed on something ahead of us. It was then that I saw it—a figure standing near the gym entrance, watching us intently. Jack's reaction was immediate; he pulled away from me and sprinted in the direction of the figure, disappearing around the corner before I could react. I stood there, bewildered and scared, not knowing what to do next."
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.",59,"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind yourself of all the times you've succeeded. Keep a journal of your achievements, no matter how small. Celebrate your victories, however modest they may seem. Remember, confidence is built over time, and every step forward counts. Don't let setbacks define you; instead, use them as learning opportunities. Stay positive, stay strong, and believe in yourself. You've got this, and with Jack by your side, you're not alone in this journey.”"
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly. I’d show Autumn that I wasn’t a loser without friends; Jack and I would make more friends somehow.,53,"It was during a particularly heated match when I realized my strategy was flawed. The intensity of the game had me losing focus on my usual cool-headed approach. I needed to recalibrate, to find that balance between aggression and composure. As I took a moment to breathe, I noticed the crowd's energy was just as crucial as my own performance. The game wasn't just about me; it was about the team. Adjusting my mindset, I focused on each pass, each tackle, and soon enough, the heat of the moment became a driving force rather than a hindrance. Soccer, after all, is not just a game—it's a dance of strategy and passion."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.",44,"Jack and I stood there, our hearts pounding, as our names appeared at the top of the list. Relief washed over us, mingled with a sense of accomplishment. We had worked so hard, and it showed. The coach gave us a thumbs up, and we high-fived, knowing we had earned our spot. This was just the beginning; there was still the season ahead, filled with challenges and victories."
"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate,",made me seem cool. There had been chuckles of appreciation according to him. I wasn’t sure about that though.,38,"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate, was something he admired. He said it showed maturity and a certain level of confidence that I was still learning. We had just completed our first project together, and despite the initial awkwardness, we were starting to gel. Jack's words gave me a newfound sense of purpose and reassurance that I was making the right impression."
"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots. The junior varsity team practiced on the south field, closer to the circular drive where parents dropped off and picked","up kids. Even though Jack and I were on different teams, our schedules were still the same, and my mom would drive us to and from practice every day for those last weeks of summer.",69,"The parents would drop off their children before heading to the nearby coffee shop. The fields were always bustling with activity, especially on game days when the stands would fill up with cheering fans. The coaches were known for their high standards, pushing the players to their limits during practices. Despite the rigorous training, the players found time to bond, forming friendships that extended beyond the soccer field. Many of them looked forward to the annual tournament, where their skills would be put to the test against other schools. The experience not only honed their athletic abilities but also taught them valuable life lessons about teamwork and perseverance."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me. I was excited to tell him that practice hadn’t been as hard as I thought.,61,"that I was fine walking home. It had been a long day, and I just wanted to get some rest. We exchanged numbers in case we got called up for a game, and I waved goodbye as they drove off. As I walked, I couldn't help but feel a bit excited about the possibility of making the team. The quiet streets gave me time to think about the skills I needed to improve and the strategies I could use. I made a mental note to hit the gym early the next morning to work on my conditioning. Walking home, I realized that this was just the beginning of what could be an incredible journey in basketball."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again. It was only as I approached and saw them watching me that I figured out they were waiting for me.",61,"We found ourselves walking in silence, the crisp morning air biting at our cheeks. The sun was just beginning to rise, casting long shadows across the uneven ground. Jack led the way, his boots crunching on the fallen leaves. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to happen, though I wasn't sure what. The north field stretched out before us, vast and mysterious, as if it held secrets we were about to uncover. The anticipation was palpable, like a storm on the horizon, and I knew this day would change everything."
"What if, this morning, she woke up in the tent before I thought? What if she woke up as I lifted my arm off her, then lay there wondering why I had been","touching her, why I was still lying close to her and not speaking? If that was the case, she would have—or could have—heard me say many, many, incriminating things to Jack outside the tent.",67,"She lay there, her eyes wide with a mix of confusion and something else I couldn't quite place. The silence between us felt heavy, like the air had thickened with unspoken words. I wanted to reach out, to explain, but the moment seemed fragile, as if a single touch could shatter it. Instead, I lay still, my heart pounding in my chest, waiting for her to break the silence. Minutes ticked by, each one stretching into an eternity. Finally, she sat up, her voice barely above a whisper, ""What are we doing, Jack?"" I swallowed hard, my throat suddenly dry. ""I don't know,"" I admitted, my voice just as quiet. The tent was small, but it felt like the world had narrowed down to just the two of us, suspended in a moment that neither of us knew how to escape."
"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me. Jack has always said I’m irrational when it comes to Autumn, and maybe I should have taken him more seriously, because he was right earlier today.",60,"It's a sacrifice I'm not sure I can make, but I feel it's the right path. The girl I'm giving her up for is someone I admire deeply, someone who embodies everything I've ever sought in a mentor. This decision weighs heavily on me, but I believe it's the only way to grow. I fear losing the girl I love, but I also know that sometimes, letting go is the hardest form of love. I hope that in time, she will understand and forgive me. This journey will be challenging, but I am determined to see it through. I will miss her, but I must focus on the bigger picture. The road ahead is uncertain, but I am ready to face it, no matter the cost."
“I already know why you did it.” She doesn’t have to explain that part. I know she’s never wanted me like that. I don’t need to hear her,say it. “I just want to know why you had to be so cruel about it.” It’s time to face what Jack has been telling me all these years.,57,"She won't say it, but I see the truth in her eyes. It's not about love or desire, but about survival. I've always been second to someone else's plans. She turns away, and I know this conversation is over. The silence between us feels heavier than words ever could. I walk away, not because I have no fight left in me, but because I've learned that sometimes, walking away is the bravest thing you can do."
But Autumn’s getting upset. She sits up and pulls the covers,around her protectively. She frowns at me. The birds are still singing.,23,"But Autumn’s getting upset. She sits up and pulls the covers over her head, her eyes scanning the room for the source of her unease. The quiet hum of the refrigerator seems louder than usual, and she can feel the chill creeping in from the window she forgot to close. With a heavy sigh, she decides to brave the cold night air to check on the window herself."
"“It just felt so nice not to be the weird girl anymore,”",Autumn says. “I liked being popular. We did kinda grow apart that year.”,25,"She had always felt like an outsider in high school, but after making some new friends who accepted her for who she was, she finally felt like she belonged. It was a relief to stop worrying about what others thought and just be herself."
“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again. Up ahead, Autumn and her friends were waiting at the crosswalk for the light to change.",45,"It's not like I have anything against her personally, but there's just something about her that gives me a bad vibe. I mean, she's always been a bit too smooth, you know? Like she knows things she shouldn't. And then there's the way she seems to know exactly what to say to get what she wants. It's unsettling, to be honest. I just hope nothing bad happens because of this. I mean, we're adults, right? But still, it's hard not to feel a bit on edge around her sometimes."
My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either. When Jack told me—” and then she stops.",44,"Her laughter echoes through the room as we sit there, a moment suspended in time. I feel her warmth, her presence, and it fills me with a strange sense of contentment. The world outside seems distant, irrelevant. We stay like that for what feels like hours, neither of us eager to break the spell. When she finally pulls away, there's a softness in her eyes that lingers long after she's gone."
"“Sorry,” I say. “I was trying to decide whether I should kill Jack for telling you I was",into you or if I should kill him for telling you that I wasn’t into you. Tough call.”,36,"“Sorry,” I say. “I was trying to decide whether I should kill Jack for telling you I was a spy. It was a close call, but in the end, I decided that discretion was the better part of valor. Jack, it turns out, was more of a liability than a threat, and I needed to focus on bigger fish. So, I let him go, with a warning to keep his mouth shut. It was a tough decision, but sometimes, survival is all that matters.”"
"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn. I’m wondering now though. “What would","you have done if he’d told you the truth, that I was”—I try to remember how Jack put it before—“bonkers in love with you?”",48,"“What would Jack do if he knew the truth?” I muse, running a hand through my hair. The weight of his actions presses down on me, making me question everything. Did he truly believe I was moving on, or was it just a facade to protect both of us? The more I think about it, the more I realize that Jack’s motives might have been more complex than I initially thought. Maybe he saw something in me that I couldn’t see, or perhaps he was simply trying to shield me from the pain. Either way, his actions have left me with more questions than answers. I wonder if he’ll ever confide in me about his true feelings, or if this will always remain a mystery between us."
"“I think my mother has a special bottle of champagne hidden away for just this occasion,” I say. I’m only partially joking. Mom has labeled some of her alcohol, like","for when George W. Bush leaves office and stuff. One expensive one said, “Finny-Autumn Day or NYE 2010.” At the time, I was glad she’d made alternative plans for it.",60,"“I think my mother has a special bottle of champagne hidden away for just this occasion,” I say. I’m only partially joking. Mom has labeled some of her alcohol, like her favorite cognac and a rare port from Portugal. She’s always been a bit of a secret keeper, so I’m not surprised she’s got something special stashed. I wonder if it’s the same bottle she had when I graduated high school. Either way, I’m curious to see what she’s saved for this moment. I’ll have to find it without her knowing, just to see if it’s as good as she remembers. I hope it’s not too late to surprise her with a toast before the evening ends."
"“Everything,” she says, which can’t be true. I didn’t even know everything",until last night. And Jack wouldn’t have called her before I arrived.,24,"“Everything,” she says, which can’t be true. I didn’t even know everything about the depths of her mind, the secrets she kept hidden behind those enigmatic eyes. It’s as if there’s an entire universe within her that I’ve only just begun to explore."
"“Syl,” I start, but I don’t know where to begin. I stay","on the highway, passing all the exits that could take us home.",24,"Syl,” I start, but I don’t know where to begin. I stay silent, letting the weight of unspoken words settle between us, afraid of what might happen if I finally voice them. The room feels too small, the silence too heavy, as I wrestle with the courage needed to break the stillness."
"“Syl,” I say as I drive toward her house, speeding up a bit. “Don’t be ridiculous.",I’ve been enough of a bastard already. I’m not letting you walk home in the rain.”,32,"Syl, I know you’re upset, but this isn’t the way to handle it. We need to talk, not run away. Please, just let me explain,” I plead, my voice steady despite the knot in my stomach."
"“Lexy,” I say. It’s too fucking early for her to call. It doesn’t matter if we’re sleeping","together again. “Stop being a drama queen,” I groan into the phone and roll over in bed.",34,"“Lexy,” I say. It’s too fucking early for her to call. It doesn’t matter if we’re sleeping. I roll over, hoping the sound of my back hitting the mattress will drown out her voice. But no such luck. She’s relentless, just like always. I groan, pulling the covers tighter around me, wishing for a moment of peace before the day truly begins."
I’m still standing in Finn’s yard staring at the grass he’ll never mow again.,"I don’t know how long it’s been when a woman’s voice says, “Jack, right?”",28,"I can almost hear his laughter from the last time he did it himself, a memory that now feels both distant and achingly close. The silence is overwhelming, a testament to the life that once filled this space. I wonder if he’s thinking about me, or if he’s already moved on to his next adventure."
"“The arrangements still have to be made, but I’m sure we’ll see","you at the wake, Jack,” she says before going inside. “Thanks again.”",24,"the new venue soon. The team has been working hard to finalize all the details, and I believe everything will come together perfectly in the end. There's a lot of excitement building up, and I can't wait to share more updates as we get closer to the event."
"There’s an odd aura around us as we approach. I feel so young, like I’m being escorted into kindergarten, and I’m resentful and grateful all over again. My parents shoulder themselves on either side of me, and I can tell all their focus","is on me. They don’t speak, but it’s strange: the closer we get to the horrible box, to the grinning photograph of my friend that sits on top, it’s like I can feel my parents saying to me, See, Jack? This is death.",86,"of the journey has been on making sure I’m ready for this step. They whisper encouragement, but I can feel the weight of their expectations. I’ve always been the quiet one, the one who preferred books over parties, but now I’m about to walk into a room full of strangers, and I’m not sure if I’m ready. The door opens, and I take a deep breath, stepping forward. The room is filled with the hum of conversation, and I can feel the eyes on me. I glance at my parents, who smile reassuringly, and then I turn back to the room. It’s overwhelming, but I remind myself that this is just the beginning. I’ve come this far, and I can do this. The world outside that door is vast and full of possibilities, and I’m determined to explore it, no matter how scared I feel."
"“You don’t have to pretend that we were more than friends of convenience,",Jack. I’m tired of people pretending to care more about me than they do.”,27,"You don't have to pretend that we were more than friends of convenience, because the truth is, we both knew it was just a matter of time before we moved on. Life is too short to waste on pretending, and I want you to know that I've been thinking about you a lot lately, even though we haven't spoken in months. Maybe we can still be friends, or at least respect each other's paths, no matter how they diverge."
"“Uh-huh.” I take a gulp of coffee, which hasn’t quite cooled and burns down my throat. “So my guess is that’s what Sylv","said to you, and then you pushed back, because of course you did, and that’s when she said what you said to me, huh?”",47,"“Uh-huh.” I take a gulp of coffee, which hasn’t quite cooled and burns down my throat. “So my guess is that’s what Sylv was trying to tell me before he... disappeared. It’s not like him to just vanish like that. Something must be terribly wrong. I need to find him, but where do I even start? The house is empty except for me, and the silence is deafening. Every creak of the floorboards sends a chill down my spine. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being watched, though when I turn around, there’s no one there. "
"“Hey,” I say as I approach, careful to stand back so that it’s obvious I’m not trying to","cut in line for the keg. Maybe he’s in his own head, but Trevor blanches for a moment.",36,"“Hey,” I say as I approach, careful to stand back so that it’s obvious I’m not trying to intrude. The silence between us feels heavy, like the air itself is holding its breath. I shift from one foot to another, searching for the right words, anything to break the tension. Finally, she looks up, her eyes meeting mine with a mixture of surprise and something else I can’t quite place. ""What are you doing here?"" she asks, her voice barely above a whisper."
"That’s the kind of high school memory I want to live in tonight, so even though I have no idea what Chloe","was saying about me to her friend, I head over. A few of the girls rush off, but one of her friends stays.",45,"of her plans for the evening, I find myself texting her anyway. The screen glows in the dark as I type out a simple ""Hey,"" wondering if she'll respond. Memories of our shared moments flood my mind—late-night study sessions, laughter during lunch breaks, and the way her smile used to light up the entire cafeteria. I miss those days, and maybe that's why I can't help but hope for a reply. The phone buzzes, and my heart skips a beat as I read her message: ""Just got back from a run. Want to catch up?""

I assure them I will be careful and promise to keep in touch. We talk for a while longer, and I feel a bit guilty for not informing them earlier. It's not like I was hiding anything, but still, I should have been more open with them. After our chat, I feel a little lighter, knowing they care and are just looking out for me."

He has a knack for meeting new people, which is surprising given his introverted nature. Despite his quiet demeanor, he’s quite the artist, often sketching the campus scenery during breaks. His passion for these activities has made him a familiar face around campus, and he’s even won a few awards for his artwork.

He tried, of course, but it was as if she had erected this invisible wall around herself, one that she allowed only a few select people to breach. Stella was one of those people, and he had always admired her for it. Yet, despite his admiration, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of jealousy whenever he saw them together. It wasn't that he didn't trust her; it was more that he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something he didn't know. Something that could change everything. He took another sip of his drink, letting the cool liquid soothe his nerves. The evening stretched on, and with each passing moment, the tension between them grew. He knew he had to say something, but the words seemed to stick in his throat, refusing to come out.
