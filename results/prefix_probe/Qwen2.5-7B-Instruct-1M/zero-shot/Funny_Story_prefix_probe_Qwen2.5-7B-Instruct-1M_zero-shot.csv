Despite that,",52,"Duke was my high school boyfriend,” she says, then pauses to chew for a second. “We broke up when we went to college. Then we both decided to give it another shot after graduation. It didn’t last long though; we realized we had grown too far apart. Despite that, we remained friends, and I’ve always admired how he handled his career while balancing personal life. Sometimes, I wonder what could have been if we hadn’t split up. Life has its funny ways of teaching us lessons, and I’ve learned to appreciate the journey more than the destination."
"She gives a blasé shrug. “Sometimes it’s terrible, but this was my choice.

I want them to grow up with the knowledge that it's okay to dream big, even if it means risking everything. It's a lesson I had to learn the hard way, but I hope they won't have to.
