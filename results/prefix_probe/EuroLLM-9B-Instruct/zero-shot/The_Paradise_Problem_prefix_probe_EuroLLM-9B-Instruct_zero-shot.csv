"“I think I’m all set here,” he says, and lol of course he isn’t going","to kiss me. “But if I forgot anything, you can have Jake come pick it up.”",31,completion
"Jake: younger brother to West (and only slightly less good-looking) and that type of college friend who knows everything about my life at UCLA but has never met my father, who lives only an hour away.","Jake introduced me to West; now Jake will be my sole remaining connection to West. The thought makes me a little sad, but then I remember I have the couch and T-virus zombies waiting for me inside.",73,completion
"“You, too.” West smiles that eye-crinkling smile again, and","damn, I really wish I’d seen it more. “Bye, Anna.”",19,completion
"I feel her attention move from the empty apartment to the side of my face, and when I smile","over at her, her blue eyes are round with worry. “Holy shit, Anna, I had no idea. Are you okay?”",39,completion
"“That is wonderful news, sweetheart! Oh, I’m so thrilled! Why don’t you fly down to John Wayne the night","before, stay at the house, and we’ll all take the plane over together? The flight to Singapore is a bear.”",39,completion>
"“Anna?” he says, like he’s not entirely sure, and then does a full top-to-bottom sweep of my body, which recalls the lack of pants.","When he digs his hand into his luscious head of hair, I forget to be embarrassed again, because it all comes back to me.",48,completion
The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna. You look… great?”,40,completion
"Stepping aside, I let him pass, and he pulls up short at what’s on the television screen. Conan is",enthusiastically fucking a witch in a cave. We both clear our throats and look up at the ceiling instead.,38,completion
"He adjusts his posture on the sofa, turning slightly to face me. Oh, right. He came here to","ask me for help. I sit up, too, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. Focus, Anna.",37,completion
"“I knew what Jake ordered for lunch and what kinds of stupid movies would make him laugh, and I could predict all his pickup lines","at parties, but we didn’t ever, like, sit down and do backstory. He didn’t even mention he had a brother until he suggested I marry you.”",51,completion
"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house. All basketball shorts, all the time. You drove a Honda! West, you’re incognito rich!","No wonder Jake never told me anything about his family! I would have made him pay for Jersey Mike’s every fucking time! Wait. Why did you need to live on campus? If you’re the grandson of the founder of Weston’s, you could probably buy an entire apartment building on Sunset.”",100,completion
"That lands in a puddle of silence, and it hits me after a couple of seconds filled only",with the sound of Conan kicking someone’s ass on TV that West expects me to catch his meaning.,36,completion
“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation. The rest of my family was disappointed that,"I didn’t let them throw me a big wedding, but I guess they weren’t all that surprised. I’ve always been private.”",42,completion
"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”",52,completion
"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs. I’d always been fascinated with the perfect beauty mark just above her lip. Unfortunately, right now she looks like","she’s fallen out of a tree and crawled through a field of tangly briers to get back to her apartment. This is probably the closest I’ve ever seen to her natural hair color because the pink has grown out a good inch, leaving a stripe of brown at her roots. Her makeup is, I presume, from yesterday; shadows of mascara carve dark circles beneath her eyes. Despite the old makeup and frazzled appearance, there’s still something striking about her. Her eyes are enormous and bright, framed with dark lashes, her steady gaze entirely without artifice.",189,completion
"Though I am nearly certain her mind has wandered to something other than the topic at hand, I let her stare at the wall",a little longer so I can stare at her and reconcile this version of Anna with the one I lived with for two years.,48,completion
"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity. Anna was reasonably tidy and paid her half of the rent when it was due, but she’d never struck me as the organized, driven, premed type. The one time we talked about it, she","said something about medicine being the most palatable of the “real job” options, but she seemed overwhelmed a lot, studying late into the night and painting to decompress in what little free time she had. That she ultimately switched her major to fine art makes a certain amount of sense, but I want to punch myself for not realizing she wasn’t studying medicine at all anymore.",132,completion
"Anna squints at me. “You said ‘small,’ but I think you meant","‘private.’ Your sister is getting married on a private island, isn’t she?”",24,completion
"“Yes.” I work to not let my gaze do another sweep of her apartment. I’ve never been to Pulau Jingga, but my mom has been sending me info that I’ve mostly ignored for months. I know the basic idea—a luxury resort and conservation area set in the Indonesian archipelago—and it’s about","as far from this dark, cramped living room as I can imagine. Right now, I need Anna to believe she can do this. Yes, she may be at rock bottom, but I need her to think she is just one fairy godmother moment away from sliding gracefully into the world she’s imagining.",103,completion
"Anna looks down at herself and I follow her attention to the front of her shirt, where a Froot Loop adheres to the cotton over her left breast.",She plucks it off and pops it into her mouth. “Why not just find someone who can pretend to be me and who knows how to behave around societay?”,57,completion
“I have the one of you and Jake hiking the Hills in a frame in my living room. It,"looks enough like me from the back.” I pause, scratching my jaw. “And… I’ve had a few others digitally photoshopped.”",39,completion
"“That it’s small, upturned. She described it as ‘the nose Jenny Nelson",wanted and didn’t get.’ She’d notice if it was someone else’s nose.”,24,completion
"I don’t love the implication that I don’t work, that I’m trying to breeze through life on my inheritance, but I understand why she sees it that way. The truth behind everything isn’t important right now, and if this goes the way I hope it","will, this will be an easy twelve days together and then we’ll never have to see each other again. “Anna, are you available to do this? Please. I will pay all your expenses. I will even give you some money if you need to buy clothes.”",91,completion
"Anna points at me again. “Okay, I see that look, and so",let me ask: what manner of clothes are required on this trip?”,24,completion
"“No, no, no.” Anna sits up and runs her fingers under her eyes, clearing away much of the mascara there. She pulls her ponytail free and reties it. Both actions do wonders for how chaotic she looks.",“This is much more demanding. I’ll have to act. I’ll have to learn about everyone I’ll be meeting. I’ll have to manage your complete lack of humor. I’ll have to hobnob. This is an entirely new skill set.”,75,completion
"“Babe, babe,” she says, cupping my cheeks. “There is",no downside here. Are you kidding? This is life-altering good.”,19,completion
"“Insurance,” she says. “These people insure everything.” While I continue to stare at the rock, she returns to the list and laughs. “Get","this: ‘Anna, please feel free to schedule any hair, nails, spa, or grooming appointments and use the card to pay for those.’ ”",46,completion>
There are two kinds of airport people: those who like to get to the,"airport three hours before departure to sit within eyesight of the gate, and Anna Green.",29,completion>
"My eyes go wide, meeting Anna’s just as she stumbles,","ankle twisting awkwardly on the skinny, murder-sharp heel of her shoe.",21,completion
"I can’t entirely refute this idea. I’ve been out of my parents’ circle long enough to understand how disorienting it will be for Anna to step into it. She bends her fingers, turning her hand and looking at them from another angle. Frankly, they’re so pointy I’m worried she’ll scratch her own cornea.","“But I asked the woman at the spa what the really rich ladies get, and she said it’s this fancy hard gel. I think I get the urge to have fake nails. I feel like a badass.” Twisting in her seat, she deposits her purse in my lap. “Watch this for a sec?”",106,completion
"“Okay, okay. I’m on my way.” Slinging her purse over my shoulder and collecting our carry-ons, I make my way to the ladies’ room, where","Anna peeks out into the hallway. As soon as she sees me, she reaches forward, grabbing the front of my shirt and jerking me inside.",50,completion
Apologizing over her shoulder to a woman washing her hands at the sink—“I swear we,aren’t going to have sex in here!”—Anna pulls me into a stall and flips the lock.,31,"completed the task of cleaning the kitchen, and now I'm just trying to get a drink of water before we head out to the park. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I really need to refill my water bottle. Would you mind if I just quickly grab it from the fridge?"
"“I need you there,” I clarify. “And I need you to look like you’re comfortable with me, comfortable","being married to me. But I don’t need you to pretend to not be Anna Green, Muppet-human hybrid.”",36,"comfortable with me, comfortable with the fact that I'm here, and comfortable with the fact that we're going to be spending time together.

Her eyes go round. “The fam—” Anna shakes her head. “You know what? Never mind. Of,"course you have a plane.” Straightening, she asks, “So, why was I in Cambodia? Photography? Fabric design?”",33,completion
"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay. When she got home, she made a point of thanking me for the help. Apparently, the trip itself was fine, but the highlight for her had been flying on an airplane.",102,completion
"“That person deserves jail time.” She brings the glass to her lips, taking a tiny","sip. “Mmmmm.” Anna turns to meet my eyes. “And by the way, it’s anything over ninety-nine.”",31,completion
Anna’s smiling at me like I amuse her. “I meant more as,"in, is she nice? Does she have hobbies or a favorite band?”",24,"a joke, but I can see that you are not laughing.

“Oh. Power. I like it. I’m not sure how to wield,"it, but I like it. And you have three siblings, including Jake?”",23,completion>
I feel her looking at me for a quiet beat. “I think you’re joking. I’m,not sure.” Anna downs the rest of her prosecco. “A hint of danger. I like it.”,31,completion
“Is now a good time to discuss how you looked at me like I was lobotomized when I thought,your name was West Weston and yet a man named Kellan McKellan actually exists and will soon be your relative?”,39,completion
I can feel her staring a beat longer before she turns away to hand her,"empty flute to the flight attendant. Anna returns her focus to me. “Okay, what else?”",30,completion
"West looks at me with unmasked concern. “Please, Anna,” he","says gently like I’m very, very naive. “Just follow my lead.”",21,completion
"He smiles stiffly, and Gede continues. “Hot water and electricity are generated by solar and wind power; waste is recycled and reused. Meals are all locally sourced, and our restaurants are Michelin-starred. Everything is inclusive, including meals, spa treatments, and activities. We offer kayaking, paddleboarding, and snorkeling. You may also take a paddleboat to any","of the nearby islands to fish. Snorkeling equipment is available in the boathouse just there,” he says, pointing, “and there are two shipwrecks nearby to explore. The interior of the island is thickly forested, and there are marked trails to follow if the mood strikes. Or, you may do absolutely nothing while you are here.”",110,completion>
"Janet steps close, her hair in a perfect white-blond chignon, her collarbones so defined they’re like hangers holding up her delicate","yellow sundress. I have to assume she has an extremely deft plastic surgeon, because she somehow looks like a twenty-five-year-old sixty-year-old.",42,completion
"“Anna, darling!” The woman I need to remember is my actual mother-in-law air-kisses","both of my cheeks. “My goodness, in person your hair is so pink!”",26,completion
“Okay. Well. That’s nice.” Janet pats his hand in hers. “Don’t forget about the cocktail party at six.”,"She leans in, kissing her son’s cheek again. “Can’t wait to get some time with you all to myself.”",37,completion
"“Anna,” he says finally, very gently. “The truth is, you could just smile on my arm and be okay. I promise",I’m not trying to leave you unprepared. The sad reality is that my parents are unlikely to pay you much attention regardless.”,43,completion
"I walk back inside, realizing I’d been so focused on the sleeping situation, I haven’t properly flailed over the sheer bliss that is our bungalow. In fact, I’m pretty sure the only thing in here I could afford is the roll of eco-friendly toilet paper I can clearly see from where I stand. And even that looks pretty fancy. There’s a real Isle Esme feel to the decor (if you know, you know), with carved bamboo, recycled teak, jellyfish light fixtures, and a massive canopy bed. Wide windows and the open entrance","bring the outside in and allow me to glance over at West, who seems to be mid–mental spiral, managing to look even more morose than he did thirty seconds ago. Isle Esme vibes or not, there will be no headboard breaking here. Near one wall is a chest with our names stamped into the top, a pair of towels folded to look like stingrays, and a jar of chocolate chip cookies that are probably made with the world’s most expensive chocolate but hey, Gede did say it was all-inclusive. I help myself.",184,completion
"I have a lot of faults. I drink milk from the carton, I never make my bed, I am slothful, and sometimes I’ll just set the new roll of toilet paper on top of the empty roll instead of changing it.

And that’s why I go back for seconds right now. But karma is Team West: his eyes open just as I glance again. They widen and he reaches down to cup his Goddamn before he turns, facing away. “Anna,” he says, his voice spluttering in the water’s spray. “Are you peeking?”",125,completion
"He was right. Focus was always a challenge, and apparently it didn’t end with baseball. I came here with the knowledge that all I need to do is limp this lie to September, and I can finally exhale, but we’re less than an hour into this farce and I’m already off track:","I peeked, and it was a huge mistake.

"I smile at her and cup a hand to the side of my mouth, whispering, “It’s okay.” Truthfully, I love that she thinks about this. I love that she’s","horrified by that price. I’m horrified, too. It’s a good thing Anna isn’t my real wife; I would constantly worry that my proximity to this world would destroy her.",58,completion
"Her hand falls away. “That’s Anna motherfucking Green-hyphen-Weston to you.” She lets out a happy squeal, jogging over",to hug him as well as she can without spilling the shots on either of them. “You look amazing!”,37,completion
"The two of them walk back to me, and Jake looks over",his shoulder to make sure we’re alone. “How are my favorite liars doing?”,25,completion
"“Describe her,” Jake says, leaning in, his hair falling over his forehead in thick waves.

"Anna barks out a bawdy laugh before covering her mouth with her hand. “Sorry,” she says",from behind it. The diamond on her ring flashes in the flickering light. “That surprised me.”,32,completion
"“Good. Anna has no poker face. How’s she taking everything?” he asks, and","I know what he’s referring to: the planes, the island, the money. The family.",27,completion
"With a laugh, Jake rids himself of our shot glasses and snags two tumblers of whiskey off a passing tray. He","hands me one before lifting his own. “Well, whatever. To the final few months: if you pull this off, you’re free.”",42,completion
"He looks past me at the party, and I take stock of how he seems from the outside. He’s got Dad’s dark wavy hair and light brown eyes, but like me, he got his height from our mother, who","is almost six feet tall without the benefit of heels. Jake is good-looking, charismatic, and always up for some (mostly) good-hearted shit-stirring. My stomach sours with guilt for what I’m keeping from him. What I could potentially fuck up.",78,completion
"She laughs, angling her wrist so the diamond catches the lights overhead. “I know, right? For six months I just walked",around taking photos where I had to casually point at something with my left hand.” She scans the crowd. “Where’s Anna?”,42,completion>
"I look up, too, searching the room again. She’s over by the dance floor, jumping around with little Nixon’s hands in hers.","The band is playing covers of pop hits, and Anna is entirely in her element: laughing, dancing, blissfully forgetting where she is.",44,completion
"Janet smiles tightly. “Exactly.” Welp, there it is. She turns her",laser focus to me. “How do your professors react to your hair?”,23,completion
"“It’s unlikely,” I say, and every head turns my way. “Everyone needs seven to nine hours of sleep a night.

"“And what’s the deal with Alex? Based on the way you talked about him on the plane, I expected you","two to jovially poke at each other, but that was like dragging a proverbial sword through each other with your eyeballs.”",41,completion
"“Well, mostly because he’s an asshole. But also, kids growing up in a normal family get to be themselves, whoever that may be. But in families like","ours, one where everything basically revolves around keeping a single person happy—my dad—everybody has a role.

"“Like in The Wizard of Oz? Alex was my dad’s willing henchman, doing everything he said, kissing his ass, stirring up","shit just to turn us all in, then sit back and look like the good guy. He’s never grown out of it.”",43,completion>
"“What does that mean?” I ask. If Alex knew enough, he wouldn’t try",to take West down? Is this about the mysterious loophole in the trust?,26,completion
West sits on the bench and pulls a shoe off. I set my clutch down on a shelf in the open closet. “I’m thinking Alex will take a keen,"interest in exactly how happy we seem.” I narrow my eyes, staring into the distance. “West… this assignment is no longer just ‘show up and wear a wedding ring.’ ”",59,completion>
"I woke up around two this morning to find Anna wrapped around me. Despite what she’d told me about sleeping in one place all night, at some point she’d migrated across the massive bed to throw a","leg over my hip, send an arm over my torso, and press her face to my neck. It took monumental focus to not go hard against her inner thigh, and because of it, I’d slept like absolute shit.",75,completion
"My father’s question penetrates my fog, finally, and I straighten, pushing my salt-water-and-sweat damp hair off my forehead. The sun has only","just come up and it’s already sweltering. I bet Anna has already kicked off the blankets, letting the air cool her overheated skin.",45,completion
"“JESUS CHRIST,” I BLURT, the second I turn at the corner of our bridge and step onto the deck of our bungalow. Anna is curled up in","a papasan, with a sketch pad in her seemingly bare lap. Honestly, from the first glimpse I get, I think she might be naked. “What are you doing?”",55,completion
"Anna follows me. She’s loosely made the bed, but it still looks rumpled.",Slept in. By both of us. I squeeze my eyes shut against the reminder.,27,completion
I sigh. I know she’s right but I’m already sleep-deprived and functioning on less than full brain power today.,I’m not sure I’m capable of dealing with both my family and Anna in this suit after last night. “Fine.”,39,completion
“Oh!” Anna jerks a hand over her eyes. “Your Goddamn! Right there!” She turns away. “Sorry! I just—spaced,out—on your—God. And you’re not even harrrrrrr—Fuck me.” She coughs. “Okay. I’ll just meet you down at the restaurant.”,37,completion
"I can feel Anna’s eyes on the side of my face. This is how it always starts with Alex, and whatever suspicion he has about my marriage will only make it","worse. I know it’s irrational and a remnant of how we used to one-up each other for our dad’s approval when we were kids, but I want to beat him. At everything.",63,completion
"Anna slams the brakes on this line of thinking by putting an arm around my back, resting the other hand on my stomach","and gently scratching, just like she unconsciously did last night. I work to suppress a shiver. Turning, she looks at him over her shoulder.",47,completion
"Eko goes through the basics of paddling, giving us tips about what areas of the",reef to avoid as we approach. “Is everyone comfortable with the basics of kayaking?” she asks.,31,completion>

"Alex snorts, looking at her derisively, like she’s an idiot. In a hot","flush, my hackles are up, and every rational thought goes out the window.",26,completion
"“Course you are, sweetheart,” I say, steadying my voice and looking down at Anna.",“I went running without you this morning and you really let me have it.”,28,completion
"“We work out together every morning.” I’m speaking to Alex but holding Anna’s gaze. Maybe it’s the pent-up frustration from last night, or maybe my brother just","brings out the worst in me and the best way to drag him is through his wife’s dissatisfaction, but I keep going. “Gets the blood flowing, doesn’t it?”",55,completion
"And that much is immediately apparent. She trips as she tries to climb in.

"“He and I have never been close,” I say quickly, suddenly and deeply uninterested in spending the morning anywhere but right","here with Anna. “I think from the moment he was born, the only thing he cared about was impressing our father.”",42,completion

"Gingerly, Anna lifts the ice, gasping at the small wound there.","She sets the ice back down, flushed, and nods decisively. “You’ll live.”",23,completion
"Anna scowls at him, and with the circle of people watching, crouches down, setting","two fingers on his leg. She immediately jerks her arm back. “Wow, it’s hot.”",28,completion
"Anna laughs. “Well, technically the twelfth, but the fifth was when he wrote me a song and got on his knees to","sing it to me, so that’s the night I see as our actual marriage.” She looks up at me, eyes soft. “He cried.”",45,completion
I’m out of town but will make sure my roommate is there to,"meet the courier. This is so exciting! The price sounds perfect. Thank you, Mel!",27,completion
"But because this is a Weston Party™, it doesn’t end there. Clustered down the center of each table are vases bursting with white orchids and sprays of spiky green palms. The plates are bone china, and they look old, rich old, vintage, with","about seventeen matching smaller plates and crystal champagne flutes at each place setting. I wonder idly if Janet had these brought over from her own collection, and then I realize she’d be more likely to just buy an entirely new set of priceless china.",87,completion
"“So how’s it going with your dad?” I say, standing and stretching. West was pretty shaken up after Ray",blindsided him in front of the Forbes editor. I can’t imagine what it’s like wanting to avoid your own father.,39,completion
“What I don’t understand is why he has such a boner for you being CEO when,you clearly don’t want the job. Let him give it to Alex. He clearly wants it.”,32,completion

"“I was only fifteen when Grandpa died. We were all at the reading of the will, but you can imagine in a situation like that, especially for kids, a lot of the details sort of go over your head. The reading took hours. I understood,","basically, that he was leaving us each a very large sum of money. I understood that it was contingent on us being married. At the time, it didn’t seem so weird that he would want that. Kids sort of take those adult directives as law.”",90,completion
"“Really.” I turn my face to the sun and feel its warmth spread through me. Residual panic drains away and I feel only contentment. I have money from West, I have the","start of a potential—maybe, let’s hope—career as an artist. I might be falling in… I cut the thought off. “Mel just called me. Tell Dad I can cover it, absolutely no problem.”",64,completion>
