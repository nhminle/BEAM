"It may be the first time I’m meeting the people gathered around the table, people who Ryan has known since childhood, but it hasn’t escaped anyone’s attention that I’m already fully embedded in his life. It’s the small touches","a woman brings to a man’s home, like the matching throw pillows on the couch or the faint whiff of jasmine from the diffuser on the bookshelf, that every other woman notices the second she walks through the front door.",completion,79,completion
The smile on Ryan’s face tells me he knows how I feel about being asked,"this and he’ll step in again to answer for me, but I shake him off.",completion,30,completion
"Ryan would have given them more than they deserve, and that’s why I stopped him. I don’t mention it was at the truck stop on the outskirts of town where I worked in the","small restaurant bar making sure no drink went empty. And I don’t mention that while they are familiar with lots of acronyms from MBA to MRS, the only one I’m acquainted with is GED.",output>completion>,68,<output>completion>
"I told Ryan I was afraid of how they would judge me once they found out my background was so different from theirs. He assured me he didn’t care what they thought, but he does. The fact that he caved","and invited them all here and spent the week helping me get the menu just right tells me more than the whispers in the dark that he likes how different I am, different from the girls he grew up with.",completion,80,completion
I watch Ryan. I’ve whittled down our entire meeting to one,"sentence, and so far, he’s let me get away with it.",completion,22,completion
"I smile and laugh, not too loud and not too long, to show that I,","too, am amused at the thought that Ryan would go to such extremes to meet me.",completion,31,completion
"“I totally nailed it,” I say, as I dip the last dinner plate into the sink full of soapy water. Ryan moves in behind me, his arms skimming my hips","until they are wrapped around my waist. His chin settles on my shoulder, and his lips press against that spot on my neck in a way he knows I adore.",completion,60,completion
"Ever since Ryan asked me to move in with him five days ago and I said yes, he’s been impatient for it to happen. I woke up","the morning after the dinner party to him on the phone with a moving company, scheduling their services for later that day, thanks to a last-minute cancellation.",completion,54,completion
"Ryan looks down at the tie, straightening it even though it’s already straight but needing something","to do. He hasn’t touched me this morning and barely looked at me. Yep, total baby.",completion,32,completion
"Twenty minutes after Ryan’s Tahoe pulls out of the driveway, I’m doing the same in my ten-year-old 4Runner. Lake Forbing is a medium-size town in north Louisiana that is known for its fertile farmlands and deep pockets of natural gas. There","is a lot of money in this area, but it’s the quiet kind. It takes fifteen minutes to get to Lake View Apartments from Ryan’s house, and from what I can tell it’s nowhere near the lake this town was named after.",completion,83,completion
Pat follows me up the stairs while his helper opens the back of the large box truck.,"Stopping in front of the door, I pull a key out of my bag. “This is me.”",completion,34,completion
"I eye the first stack of boxes, each filled with the items I’ve spent the last four days picking out. Things Pat has been storing for me in that box truck",until I was ready for him to bring them here. Things that I will move to Ryan’s house on Saturday. Things I will say I’ve owned for years rather than days.,completion,62,completion
"In the kitchen area, I unzip the black bag and remove four menus from nearby restaurants and three pictures I printed from the kiosk at CVS of Ryan and me, plus seven magnets to hold each item in place on the refrigerator. Next, I grab the assortment of condiments and pour half of each one down the sink drain before lining them in the door of the refrigerator. Moving to the bathroom, black bag in tow, I pull out the shampoo and conditioner then pour half of each down the drain like I did with the condiments, before putting the bottles on the edge of","the tub. Unwrapping a bar of Lever 2000 soap, I set it on top of the drain in the sink and turn the water on, rotating it every few minutes until the logo is gone and the edges are dulled, then drop it into the small built-in space on the shower wall. Toothpaste is last. Starting from the bottom, I squeeze a portion out but leave a glob or two on the rim of the sink, just like I do at Ryan’s house, even though I know he’ll fuss about it. Leaving the cap off, I drop the tube on the counter near the faucet.",completion,210,completion
"I slide my hands into my front pockets and lean back against the wall next to the kitchen counter, crossing one ankle in front of the other. My movements are slow but calculated. It worries me she’s here, checking on me, and that she’ll feel the same","need to do so on Saturday, when Ryan is here moving me out. I picked a place where neighbors don’t bother to get to know one another, and the rent includes utilities since units can be leased by the week. And one week was all I needed.",completion,94,completion
"It must have piqued her interest when I rented one of the few unfurnished units. Usually if someone goes to the trouble of moving furniture in, they plan on staying longer than seven days, but I didn’t want Ryan to think my","life was so transient that I didn’t even have my own couch so the furnished unit wasn’t an option. And here we are on day four and there’s nothing to show for my stay except eight boxes, strategically placed around the room.",output>completion>,84,<output>completion>
"She clucks her tongue against the roof of her mouth, then turns to leave. It takes everything in me not to throw the bolt closed","behind her. But I’m almost finished here, and there’s still more to be done before Ryan crosses the Louisiana state line at five thirty this afternoon.",completion,51,completion
"From the way Ryan tells it, one day he dropped by to check on his grandfather, only to find he had died peacefully in his sleep, and then a week later Ryan was moving in.","The only possessions he brought with him were his clothes, toiletries, and a new mattress for the bedroom. Ryan probably would have made room for an ugly second-hand couch . . . if I had one.",completion,71,completion
"But it’s too big for Ryan. It’s two stories with a wide front porch and big backyard, white with dark green shutters, manicured flower beds, and a brick path that leads to the front",door. It would take several minutes to walk through if you needed to check every room—big enough that someone could come in the carport door and you wouldn’t hear it from the main bedroom.,completion,68,completion
They are silent spectators as I unload box after box. Ryan is pulling into the driveway just as I,grab the last one. He jogs over the second he’s out of his car to relieve me of it.,completion,38,completion
"Mrs. Rogers stands up and walks to the edge of the porch, putting her as close as",she can get without falling into her azalea bushes. “Y’all look busy over there!” she hollers back.,completion,34,completion
Ryan laughs. “It’s been a while since I’ve had one of your Old Fashioneds. I’m looking forward,to it.” Then he knocks his shoulder lightly against mine to get me moving toward the house.,output>completion>,34,<output>completion>
Ryan is always tight lipped about what he does on Thursdays. And while,"he joked this morning about skipping work today, we both know he never would.",completion,27,completion
Ryan follows me back to the apartment in his Tahoe. I’m glad I’m not in the car with him when,"he realizes where we’re going, but at least the idea that I was embarrassed about where I live rings true.",completion,40,completion
"The lock gives a bit easier this time, and the second the door swings open Ryan has us inside and the door shut behind us. He paces the apartment with","his hands on his hips. I hate to admit I like his growling prowl of the room, and the protective instinct vibrating through him is as foreign as it is welcome.",completion,61,completion
"Ryan moves to the counter and picks up the closest perfume bottle. Holding it up, he inspects it from","top to bottom, then does the same to the other three lined up next to it. “Do you collect these?”",completion,39,completion
"There is no mention that his mother collects perfume bottles as well, or the fact that I have something in common with her, and I won’t analyze how it makes me feel that he doesn’t let me know this is something we share. Ryan sets the bottle back down and begins opening drawers in the kitchen and then staring at the fridge. He plucks off one of the pictures","of us and studies it. It’s a selfie we took not long after we met. It was cold outside and we’re both bundled up in front of the small fire pit in his backyard. I had brought over ingredients to make s’mores and we had bits of marshmallow and chocolate on our faces. In the picture, I am sitting in his lap and we are smiling big, cheek to cheek.",completion,139,completion
"I hear him gathering the containers, then opening the cabinet under the sink where the trash can hides. He dumps them on top of some take-out boxes and other items","I found in one of the outdoor trash containers. Ryan pulls the can out and says, “Anything else need to go in here before I take it to the dumpster?”",completion,60,completion
I’m late for lunch with the girls. Sara and I texted back and forth over the course of the last few days trying to find a day that,"worked for everyone, and while adding me to their group message would have saved a lot of time, it will take more than one dinner party for that invitation.",completion,57,completion
"While I might be willing to be interrogated by the women Ryan considers friends, I’m not opening myself up to",anyone else. Not yet. Not until I’m sure I know more about them than they will ever know about me.,completion,40,completion
"It’s a little awkward that the reason we’ve never met was because she wasn’t invited to Ryan’s for dinner, but that was his call. He tossed her name around but ultimately","decided to exclude her because, as he put it, sometimes she can get on his “ever last fucking nerve.” Plus, she’s single and that threw off the numbers at the table.",completion,62,completion
"Just as I’m stashing my purse on the floor by my chair, I feel",the vibration of an incoming text. A quick glance tells me it’s from Ryan:,completion,28,completion
Ryan leans against the open door of the small workroom in the basement of the gallery.,"Lunch ended less than two hours ago, so I’m impressed with how fast word got to him.",completion,33,completion
"“But you shouldn’t have to handle that.” His hand reaches for mine, then he’s pulling me into his lap. I glance at the open door, hoping no one","catches us like this. I’ve only had this job a couple of weeks, and everyone knows I only got it as a favor to Ryan and nothing more.",completion,56,completion
"Ryan wraps an arm around me, anchoring me to him. His finger traces the top","edge of my thin tee. “This is killing me right now, just so you know.”",completion,30,completion
The muffled sound of his phone vibrating has him checking his watch to see who’s calling. Ryan groans as he stands up from his chair,"and digs his device out of his back pocket. “Give me a second,” he says as he steps into the hall to answer the call.",completion,50,completion
“Anything else come up?” he asks. His shoulders stiffen while he listens to whoever is on the other line. I’m prepared for the glance Ryan gives me over his shoulder and all he sees is my attention firmly on the seating chart in front of me. Then,"he takes one step farther away from me. The pitch of his voice drops lower. I can’t make out the words, but he’s clearly unhappy and letting it be known. He’s all but growling into the phone. This is not a side of him I have seen before.",completion,95,completion
“About the same.” Ryan gives me one last kiss then gets up. He’s almost,"to the door when he adds, “You know you can tell me anything, right?”",completion,28,completion
"She’s picking apart my story, looking for the truth behind my words. And from my research, she’s good at what she does. Something","isn’t sitting right with her, and she’s trying to decide if digging into my background is worth the possibility of losing Ryan’s friendship.",completion,46,completion
"Ryan turns the SUV onto a long gravel road, passing an open ornate gate with the words hidden hills farm in",metal letters stretched out across the top. He spares me a quick glance. “Yours won’t even be the biggest hat there.”,completion,42,completion
"Moving in with Ryan has upped his romance game: simple touches, sweet words and gestures, going out of his way to make sure I’m happy. When he’s not at work, we’re together. I can tell from his one-sided conversations with","his friends that they are not pleased that I am monopolizing his time. A good girlfriend would insist he see his friends, make sure he didn’t lose touch with the people he’s closest to—but I am not a good girlfriend.",completion,80,completion
"We surf the crowd and Ryan speaks to almost every person we pass, introducing",me to them as his girlfriend while his arm anchors me to his side.,completion,28,completion
"Before long, she wanders off to deliver more hugs, and Ryan gets into a deep conversation with a local judge about an upcoming election, so I take a moment to look around. This place is beautiful. The winding driveway was long enough that you can’t see the main road or hear any traffic from the house, making it feel like this party is hidden from the rest of the world—just as its name suggests. The red","wooden barn sits on top of a hill and the pasture slopes down in all directions around it like a sea of green lined with white fences. There is a large movie theater–size screen attached to the side of the barn, while smaller screens are scattered in between white linen tables that will show the race. Servers roam the crowd bearing silver trays of mini Hot Browns, individual portions of cheese grits, and delicate tea sandwiches.",completion,152,completion
“Ryan!” the man says while flinging his arm around Ryan’s neck and pulling him in tight. The two hug it out while I study the woman,"with him. She’s tall, close to my height, with long light-brown hair. She’s slender but muscular, and I can’t help but notice how physically similar we are.",completion,53,completion
"I place my hand in his and he shakes it enthusiastically. James is tall and thin, with the look of someone who struggles with substances. It’s in the hollow places in his cheeks and the smudge of dark under his eyes. The tremor in his hands and the clothes that are a tad too big. Nice dress clothes","he probably dug out from the back of some closet just for today. His companion looks to be in better shape, and not just her clothes but her general well-being. Her dress is a cream sleeveless shift that hits midthigh, the shoes are Italian and expensive, and the jewelry is simple but classy. They are a mismatched pair.",completion,116,completion
"Ryan and I share a look. It’s not like we’re engaged, so this hearty congratulations seems a bit much. “Thanks,” Ryan says as he wraps",his arm around me. We both look at the woman standing next to him and Ryan nods in her direction. “Introduce us to your friend.”,completion,50,completion
"She notices my inspection and does one of her own. I feel her stare, as it starts at my feet and runs straight",up to the big ridiculous hat. Is she surprised by how much we resemble each other? “Have you been to Eden?” she asks.,completion,46,completion
"“Hey, honey! Who won the game?” Mama asks from her bedroom. My light-brown hair is free of the wig cap and",my face is scrubbed clean of makeup. The black hoodie has been replaced with one depicting my high school’s name and mascot.,completion,43,completion
"“One day soon you’ll be all grown.” She lets out a laugh and adds, “What am I saying, you’re already there. Taking care of me and everything else. I want so much for you,",Lucca. A home and a family of your own one day. I want you to have that house we’ve always dreamed of. Maybe you can build it in that fancy new neighborhood near the lake.”,completion,69,completion
"I head straight for the tiny room at the front of our trailer that is nothing more than a large closet, but it’s like stepping into another world when I pass through the door. Before cancer ravaged her body, Mama spent every day in this room behind her sewing machine and craft table. Mothers came from all over North Carolina to have her make","pageant dresses, prom dresses, and even the occasional wedding dress for their daughters. When I was little, I’d sit at Mama’s feet and watch these plain girls walk in and then somehow be transformed once she got her hands on them. It was in that moment that I learned you can become someone else with the right hair, the right dress, and the right accessories.",completion,129,completion
"When Mama first got sick, I took over her orders. I’d been helping her in this room for as long as I can remember, so it wasn’t a big leap. But pageant",dresses and custom-made costume jewelry didn’t bring in enough money to get Mama the treatments she needed or pay for all the medication she was on. So I had to get creative.,completion,64,completion
Ryan is scanning the crowd for a sign of me when I leave the bathroom. He’s still in the same,"place I left him, probably thinking that it would make it easier for me to find him if he stayed put.",completion,41,completion
"Ryan pulls me close the second I reach him, his arm",sliding around my waist. “Are you okay?” he asks. “You look pale.”,completion,23,completion
He seems relieved that my predicament has an easy remedy and pulls me to the buffet table and loads a plate of food for me. Ryan,"finds two open spots at a white-linen-covered table and sets the plate between us. “If you don’t feel better after eating some of this, we can leave.”",completion,53,completion
"Once everyone is settled, Beth leans in and says, “I would be so pissed if I showed up wearing the same hat as three other women here.” She must be talking",about the one with the peacock feathers shooting out of the top and falling like a curtain down the back until they almost touch the ground. I’ve seen three of those already.,completion,63,completion
"But now that it seems like James and the woman are gone, I’m ready to leave too.","The sooner I can get out of here, the sooner I can figure out what is going on.",completion,35,completion
"“Lucca,” he says, and that single word punctures my lungs, making it hard to drag in a breath. My hand on the","steering wheel grips tight, and it’s the only thing that stops this car from flying off the road and landing in the ditch.",completion,45,completion
"Before my brain can come up with any words, he says, “That girl with James.” His eyes are",still closed so he doesn’t witness my silent hysteria. “She said something weird after you went to the bathroom.”,completion,37,completion
"“Just before they walked away, she said James was hoping to reconnect with me but",said it so he wouldn’t hear her. Said she’d love to get to know you too.”,completion,31,completion
"“The last time I saw him, things were . . . strained. I’ve learned to be cautious","where James is concerned,” he says with a grumble. “She seems nice enough, though. Too good for him.”",completion,35,completion
"Matt flips a pen and catches it, over and over, while he studies me. “I","have to say, we’ve been impressed at the places you’ve gotten in and out of.”",completion,30,completion
He gives me a smirk as if he thinks I’m cute. His phone chimes and he slides it,"off his desk. Matt’s thumbs move across the screen at an amazing speed, his attention firmly on his phone.",completion,37,completion
"Matt rests his elbows on the arm of his chair and kicks his feet up on his desk, the phone forgotten for a moment. “You’d be doing what you’re good at. We’ll drop you in a situation",and you’ll get us what we need. Without anyone being the wiser. You won’t believe the difference it will make with us behind you. I’ll give you the details as soon as you tell me you’re in.”,output>completion>,74,<output>completion>
"My mind splits, showing two different paths; this is definitely a crossroads moment. Taking the job Matt offers moves me deeper into this world but comes with the support that would make the feel of those cuffs biting into","my wrists a distant memory. The other path requires me to go straight. To get out before I’m in any real trouble. Because as Saturday night proved, it will only be a matter of time before something else goes wrong.",completion,79,completion
There was even a picture of James and her at the Derby party in the “People and Places” section of,the tiny local newspaper; her hat was looking even more dainty and refined in print than it did in real life.,completion,41,completion
He heads inside and I sit back and stare at the sky. It’s been a few days since I spied on him at the warehouse and the mailbox is still empty. There was,"another sighting of James and that woman last night. According to social media, they were at a local craft brewery listening to a popular local band. They have hit every hot spot in town.",completion,67,completion
"Greg opens the door immediately, as if he has been waiting for me to arrive. He’s wearing a gray suit with a darker gray tie,","and his hair looks like it hasn’t changed since he was a young boy. Short and combed to the side, not a strand out of place.",completion,51,completion
He nods and gestures for me to come inside. He checks his watch for the second time since,"he’s opened the door, then yells toward the wraparound stairs that curve up the foyer wall. “Jenny! She’s here!”",completion,37,completion
"“Right, okay, I’ve got to get to the office,” Greg says, then turns to me. “You are in charge of Miles. His schedule is written out and taped",to the fridge; my number is on the bottom. He can give you a tour of the house and show you where everything is. I’ll be home by six.”,completion,57,completion
I open drawers and rummage through every part of the room. It’s big enough that there’s a sitting area tucked in a corner near,"the door that leads to the bathroom. Inching into that space, I stay perfectly quiet while I listen to Jenny sing off-key in the tub.",completion,49,completion
"Staring at the ten-number keypad, I start to sweat. There are a lot of things I can do, but",cracking safes is not one of them. I pull out the phone that Matt gave me for emergencies only.,completion,38,completion

"The next time there’s a knock on the door, I know what to expect. A bellhop, not the uniformed George, pushes a luggage cart into the room then unloads three large boxes.
