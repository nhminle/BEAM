RG: She’s used to it. With Mum there’s drama 24/7. How often,did you speak to your dad when you were away at uni?,24,"completion: She’s grown accustomed to the constant chaos, but sometimes she wishes for a moment of peace and quiet. The drama that comes with having a mother like that can be overwhelming, and she often finds herself wishing for a simpler life. However, she knows that she can’t escape it, and that she’s lucky to have her mother by her side, even if it’s a bit of a rollercoaster ride."
RG: Why am I the last one to find out that Eden isn’t coming to Hawaii? I find it hard to believe,that you wouldn’t want her beside you on your special day. Shall I talk to Mum? Happy to take the heat on this.,45,completion
"They approached the altar positioned at the edge of the cliff and gazed out at the dramatic view of the Kona coastline just as the sun was dipping into the ocean. Gopal Das (Brimmer and May/Groton/Williams/UC Berkeley/Four Winds Shaman School), a tall, lanky Caucasian",man in his midforties with shoulder-length strawberry-blond hair and a matching beard stretched out his densely freckled arms in a godlike manner. “Let us welcome this blessed sunset. I’ve never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at a moment like this.”,89,completion
"Gopal Das tucked the tight white tee that showed off his sinewy pecs into his camo-green cargo shorts and said, “Close your eyes. Now breathe","in deeply…. Let your first chakra connect with the ground, rooting in the earth, connecting with Gaia, connecting with spirit. Now, what do you feel?”",50,completion
"“Not likely. You’d be quite dead if that were the case,” Thomas said,[*5] looking down at the",machine. “You know your arm needs to be level with your heart when you take a reading.”,34,completion
"Arabella bolted up from the chaise, her cashmere eye pillow falling to the floor. “Spectacular? Seeing that almost killed me! That lava you",see is a volcanic fissure that opened up earlier today—right in the middle of the garden where Augusta’s wedding ceremony is supposed to be!”,47,completion>
*3 Although “cottage” could be rather misleading for the spacious four-bedroom house with a thatched roof,"that was decomposing so perfectly, Thomas was constantly finding DIY influencers taking selfies by the garden gate.",33,completion
"*4 Though Arabella was raised speaking the Queen’s English in what was then the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong and spoke with the poshest of accents, whenever she came into contact with other Asians—particularly","family members and service people—her accent would take on the inflections and sentence structuring that were peculiar to upper-crust Hong Kongers. Linguistic experts call this phenomenon code-switching, while others might call it snobby tai tai syndrome.",71,completion>
"“That’s because I’m the only one around here who eats carbs,” Eden said as she took","a bite of her chocolate croissant, still warm from the oven. “You really ought to try one.”",33,completion
"Suddenly Arabella’s eyes lit up and she seemed to recover slightly. “Yes, she will be good","for OS, won’t she? Eden, you’ll offer your assistance, won’t you, in our time of need?”",32,completion
*5 Arabella pronounces her daughter’s name in the Italian,"way, Be-ah-TREE-chey, not because she’s Italian but because she’s pretentious.",19,completion
"“The older woman said, ‘Excuse me, do you speak English?’ I was used to this question, so I simply nodded. The younger woman said, ‘We see you here every day. You’re so good with the baby. She clearly adores you.’ ‘Thank you,’ I replied. And then","the older woman leaned over and whispered, ‘Whatever they’re paying you, we’ll double it.’ I was so confused, and then it hit me: These women think I’m the nanny! Because I’m Chinese, and my half-British daughter doesn’t look like me!” Lady Arabella recalls with a laugh.",92,completion
"Arabella credits her own mother for her confidence to upend centuries of tradition. “My mother grew up in Shanghai, which was the Paris of the East, so for her, Asian Fusion wasn’t a fad, it was a way of life.” Arabella’s barrister father","hailed from one of Hong Kong’s most respected legal families. “People are constantly surprised to learn that I didn’t grow up in a rice paddy. My grandfather and father both went to Oxford, and we had a house in Kowloon Tong with five servants.”",87,completion
"The countess never imagined that her modern spin on Marco Polo would spawn her own design and hospitality empire, but after a famously finicky Qatari prince spent the weekend and was wowed by the countess’s hospitality, he commanded her to design a hotel in London “for people who can only bear to stay in palaces when they travel,” promising to book out","the entire place every year for the London Season. Arabella quickly conceived of Bella’s, the gemlike London oasis that has set the standard for boutique establishments everywhere. Then came the Bella outposts in Hong Kong, Antwerp, and the Maldives, all of which possess the perfect alchemy of understated glamour, exquisite service, and discretion that have made them de rigueur destinations for the cognoscenti.",125,completion
Dr. Thomas Tong was in the midst of enjoying a cup of tea,in the break room when his flatmate peeked his head through the open door.,27,completion
"Eden awoke to the sound of unfamiliar chirps. The chorus of birds outside sounded more spirited than anything she’d heard before, and they had been at it all night. Having arrived very late the previous","evening to a house at the end of a pitch-black road, she had no inkling of what lay outside. She rose from the bed lazily, flung open the louvered plantation doors, and almost gasped in disbelief.",71,completion
“Watch your step!” came a shout behind her. Eden looked down and saw the large gray rock,she was about to step on suddenly move. It was a sea turtle basking in the sun.,34,completion
"“Oh my god!” Eden exclaimed, backing off. She turned around to see",a woman in her late twenties sitting on a sun-bleached tree trunk.,24,completion
"“I should put on some proper clothes first,” Eden said, realizing she was still",in her sleeping clothes—an old pair of cotton jersey shorts and a skinny tee.,28,completion
“Why? Are you going to the Wolseley? Look how I’m dressed.” Rufus gestured to his tattered board shorts and bare feet as they cut through a wooded path that led from the beach to a road that to Eden seemed straight out of a dream. Tall coconut,"palms, fragrant hibiscus bushes, and mango trees lined the winding lane of relaxed old bungalows and wooden beach cottages next door to the occasional sprawling mansion. Rufus reached up into one of the low-hanging branches as they walked past and plucked two ripe mangoes. “For breakfast.” He grinned.",95,completion
"“Puako Beach Road is one of the only places left on the entire island that still has these original cottages from the sixties right on the beach,” Rufus","explained. “It’s a real neighborhood, as opposed to some poncy resort. You love hunting down the local hangouts whenever you travel, so I thought you’d prefer it over here.”",57,completion
Rufus gestured outside. On one end of the back deck was an outdoor shower nestled between thick tropical bushes and a,wall of stacked volcanic rocks. Rufus pointed to a galvanized steel cistern on the roof. “That tank collects rainwater for the shower.”,43,completion
"“Now, you and I both know that Rufus is wasting his life away",in Hawaii. It’s high time Rufus settled down and did something with his life…”,27,completion
Arabella nodded. “She is one of the hottest emerging artists around. She already has important galleries in,"London, Paris, and LA, and everyone’s flipping her work, so she can satisfy all of Rufus’s artistic pretensions.”",35,completion>
"“Not only is she to the manor born, she is to the hotel born too!” Bea jumped in. “The de Courcys own a fabulous crop of hotels all over",France and the French Caribbean. That’s why it’s a match made in heaven—she already knows what it feels like to be constantly harassed by friends angling for room upgrades!”,58,completion>
They went outside to the wooden deck and sat down on a pair of canvas butterfly chairs. Eden,"inhaled the steam from her coffee mug, which was infused with a sweet scent. “Did you add vanilla?”",36,completion
"“Mmm. Love it.” Eden smiled as she took a long, slow sip, closed her eyes, and eased into her chair. The sun on her face","felt so lovely, she could hardly believe that it was the middle of winter back in Britain. “Now I feel like I’m truly on holiday.”",50,completion
“I think this is our last moment of peace before guests start,flooding the island. Ready for the craziest wedding weekend ever?” Rufus asked.,24,completion
"No you’re not, Eden thought to herself as she sipped on her coffee, taking in the sounds of the waves","pounding onto the lava rocks and the ecstatic screech of birds. “I’ve never heard birds quite like this before,” she said.",41,completion
Rufus laughed. “Because they aren’t birds. That’s the sound of the,coqui frog. They’re everywhere on the island. That’s their mating call.”,22,completion
Bea was just fastening the labradorite-bead[*1] necklace around her sister Augusta’s,neck when there was a series of quick raps on the door.,23,completion
"“Yes! I had nothing to wear for this evening and they came to my rescue. This just arrived an hour ago from New York,” Bea replied of her strapless gown","with its dramatic purple bodice bow sash and painted anemones on the skirt. Unlike her sister, she had no issues with looking like she had just stepped off a fashion catwalk.",61,completion
"“It looks like she found it on the clearance rack at Mango,” Arabella replied curtly","as the first guests appeared at the top of the steps, and Augusta burst into tears.",31,completion
"“How can you say such a thing, Countess? I have known Eden since my very first visit to Greshamsbury Hall three years ago, and the girls and I even went camping in the Outer Hebrides","last year. When someone has seen you empty your bowels into a hole you have just dug in the sand with your bare hands, I don’t think they have to call you ‘Serene Highness’ anymore.”",70,completion
"Rufus gave a bashful grin. “I thought, why not turn bad luck into good? It’s not","every day that an eruption occurs at a wedding site, so let’s have everyone enjoy the experience!”",33,completion>
"“Mind if I stop? The text goes on and on and I’m feeling a bit sick reading off your phone.” Eden closed her eyes, trying to enjoy the feel of the sun on her face and the cool breeze in her hair, but it","wasn’t working. She felt miserably hungover from the previous evening. After sunset cocktails at the lava-viewing platform, the party had moved into a magnificent inner courtyard with four reflecting pools where an eight-course banquet commenced, and Eden had fallen victim to the exquisite wine pairings.",89,completion
“Change of plans. When Freddy realized we were going whale watching on a fishing,"boat, he insisted that we take his Walrus or whatever that thing is called.”",28,completion>completion
"No sooner had Rufus said this than a now-familiar roar filled the air and Freddy’s fantastical boat pulled up to the dock. As everyone climbed on board, a pair of dark-tinted glass doors automatically opened, revealing a sleek, Zenlike interior cabin where Freddy (CEE/Crossroads/NYU/Pepperdine), dressed in a pale beige cashmere sweater over a white","linen shirt and pleated linen trousers, lounged like a pasha on plush white cashmere cushions. Beside him sat a brunette with a mass of pretty curls in a chic vintage floral-print maxi dress, and arrayed before them on the Ipe wood floor was a massive clamshell piled high with tropical fruits, champagne, oysters, and caviar.",109,completion
"Laurel (Balboa/Thacher/Cornell/MIT) winced. “We’re not hunting whales, Mr. Farman-Farmihian. Not today or any other day. We’re going to observe",these magnificent creatures that have traveled three thousand miles from Alaska to spend the winter in our tropical waters.”,38,completion
Solène reflexively brushed the tiny black eggs off with her hand,but immediately smeared them all over her linen skirt. “Merde!” she cursed.,23,completion
"“It’s a good thing we slowed down. We’re coming to the whales’ winter feeding grounds,","and we don’t want to cause too much of a disturbance around them,” Laurel said.",30,completion
“I don’t think we’re going to scare any whales today. I think a young,"calf could probably capsize this boat with a flick of its tail,” Rufus laughed.",28,completion
"Solène nodded. “Yes, it is part of my latest series. It’s my examination","of toxic masculinity, based on actual words my exes would say to me.”",26,completion
"The waves from the whale’s breaching rocked the boat violently, and Eden could feel herself turning green.","She sat down in a corner, taking deep breaths as she tried to hold it all in.",34,completion
Dr. Tong arrived at a modest wooden building painted bright blue with white trim and walked up,a little slope toward the queue of customers standing in the blazing sun by the outdoor counter.,34,completion
Thomas removed the lid of his bento box to reveal delicious-looking grilled mahi mahi,along with a heaping portion of wasabi pistachio poke and crab salad over rice.,28,completion
“How in the world did you find this spot?” Thomas said as he dug into,the deliciously spicy poke while looking out at the view of the ocean in the distance.,31,completion
“Stumbled on it a few years ago when I was hunting for a quiet beach. Now,it’s become my go-to hideaway—it’s the last place on earth Arabella would ever look for me.”,32,completion
"“Can’t picture her here,” Thomas chuckled as an inquisitive hen wandered under the table and began pecking at",something by his feet. “Especially after the remarkable feat she pulled off last night at the welcome party.”,36,completion
"“That’s an idea! The Norwegians are a generous bunch, aren’t they? Perhaps Max’s",parents will take pity on me now that we’re going to be kin.”,26,completion
"“That’s Pu‘ukohola Heiau, the temple built by King Kamehameha.","It’s a very sacred place for Hawaiians,” the driver replied.",19,completion
"“I’ll try my best not to.” Thomas headed into the visitor’s center to get a quick lay of the land before walking up the hill to the temple. He strolled around the perimeter,",marveling at the meticulously arranged stones used to create the structure. There was something about the place that reminded him of the ancient stone circles that could be found throughout the countryside in Devon.,67,completion
"His mind suddenly wandered back to Rene Tan, the man who had battled his own demons and","conquered the global construction industry, but who was now in the battle of his life, quite literally.",34,completion
"The dream was always the same. She was six, maybe seven years old. Her mother, dressed in a white Lacoste piqué polo and a flared tennis skirt, would come into the room and ask her, “I’m going to the supermarket. Do you want to come on a walk with me?” Eden would shake her head. Minutes after her mother had left the house, Eden would miss her terribly","and decide to run after her. She would run out the door of the redbrick house and down a long hill, chasing the figure in white at the end of the road. But for some reason she could never catch up with her mother. She would run and run, her heart pounding so fast she could barely breathe, but the figure in white only got smaller and smaller.",136,completion
Thomas placed a hand on her cheek to feel her temperature. “You could,have had heatstroke. Most people don’t realize they have heatstroke until it’s too late.”,27,completion
"“Hmm. I don’t recall her having either, but she could have played tennis in her younger days. Or maybe badminton, which was quite","popular in Hong Kong in the early nineties,” Thomas mused as he slid open the wooden slatted doors to reveal a large balcony.",46,completion>
“So this is how the other half live. Whose room are we in?” Eden asked as she wandered onto the,balcony and took in the view of the infinity pool surrounded by white tented cabanas and the pristine beach beyond.,40,completion
"Eden fetched the bulky garment bag and unzipped it, staring at its contents in confusion. There was a",shimmering ice-blue evening gown complemented by a turquoise faux-fur coat. “A fur coat? Bea’s out of her mind…”,36,completion
"“From what I understand, you’re going to need that tonight,” Thomas said. “We’re",about to go from sea level to an altitude of fourteen thousand feet!”[*],26,completion
"“Arabella must be furious to be outdone!” said the grand duchess, the",dangling pearls on her tiara shaking back and forth as she giggled.,24,completion>
"“We’re so high up that you can see the curve of the horizon!” Eden exclaimed, glancing at her",father and noticing that he suddenly appeared a bit pale. “Dad! Are you all right?” she said in alarm.,37,completion
"Just as Eden was about to continue protesting, the sound of heraldic trumpets echoed through the great hall. A dozen trumpeters dressed in full regalia entered, and then from both ends of the hall, hundreds","of Nordic men in traditional folk costumes and ice skates glided around an ice track along the outer perimeter of the space, each bearing silver trays laden with glasses. The crowd clapped merrily in approval.",70,completion
"“Sure looks like it,” Eden said as one of the floppy-haired waiters skated up and placed a tall fluted glass filled with a frothy dark liquid","in front of her. She took a sip of the warm, rich broth and realized it was the first course—wild foraged mushroom cappuccino with white truffle froth.",53,completion
"Rufus sighed. “A fairy tale? Everything about this is wrong. This ice palace was supposed to be half the size and built at the resort, not up here. Its",presence here is an insult to Hawaiians and to all the activists who have been fighting so hard to block the construction of a new telescope on the mountain.”,58,completion
"Arabella continued eagerly, “I can’t help picturing how our grandchildren will look. They will","be so stunning, and of course they will speak fluent French, English, and Chinese.”",28,"completing their own journeys of self-discovery, embracing the beauty of their diverse heritage, and carrying forward the legacy of their ancestors, who have always been a source of strength and inspiration for our family."
"Eden stood under the shower on Rufus’s back deck, feeling the spray of hot water stream down her neck and shoulders and letting the warmth soak through her entire body. The shower was separated from the rest of the deck by a","stacked wall of volcanic rocks and a thicket of tall bamboo, and the smooth ocean pebbles on the ground only added to the tranquility of the space. Staring up through the steam at the stars in the night sky, Eden felt completely blissful.",85,completion
Eden giggled as she felt around for the bottle. “It’s pitch-black in here!,You could be showering next to me and I wouldn’t even see you.”,26,completion
"Rufus lay back onto the bench, staring up at",the stars himself. “You don’t think she seems a bit…self-involved?”,19,completion
Eden came out onto the deck with a towel wrapped around her. “If,"we’re going surfing tomorrow, I really need to get some sleep. I’m absolutely knackered!”",27,completion
"Rufus opened a nearby cupboard and gestured to the neat stacks of pouches inside. “Voilà! My stash of airline pajamas. Take your pick, we’ve","got Hawaiian Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Etihad, these fun kangaroo ones from Qantas. Oh, these ones are from Emirates—they actually hydrate you while you sleep.”[*]",48,completion>
"Freddy nodded in agreement. “It’s Middle Earth! I feel like any minute,",a dragon could come flying out from behind one of those cliffs.”,24,completion
"“I wish you could see what I see,” Rufus said. “You look like the fair maiden of",the castle. Don’t you wish you could go back in time and see how life was back then?”,35,completion>
"“WOO HOO! THIS IS FUCKING AMAZING!” Freddy shouted, his arms outstretched as he ran along the black-sand beach joyously like a little kid. Stopping right in front","of Eden, he said breathlessly, “Isn’t this one of the most incredible beaches you’ve ever seen? It’s right up there with the Amalfi Coast. You ever been?”",54,completion
“Great idea. Just don’t wander off the trail. There are ancient burial sites deeper in the valley,"that are very sacred to the locals, so it’s best to keep a respectful distance,” Rufus answered.",34,completion
*3 Sharp ears might recognize this song as the main theme to The,Crown. Of course Arabella would select this particular tune to make her entrance.,26,"completion> The 1980s television series ""The A-Team."" This iconic theme song, composed by Mike Post, has become synonymous with the show's adventurous spirit and memorable characters. Its catchy melody and upbeat tempo have made it a staple in the world of television and popular culture, often evoking memories of the show's thrilling episodes and the team's daring exploits. The song's enduring popularity is a testament to its ability to capture the essence of the show and leave a lasting impression on audiences of all ages. As a result, it remains a beloved classic, continuing to inspire new generations of fans and cementing its place in the annals of television history. "
“Next season? Do you think we’re living in a television series? Let me make this very simple for you: Solène,"de Courcy is a very nice girl, but it’s never going to happen in a million years. She’s not my type.”",41,completion
"Rufus grabbed her by the hand and led her down a pathway, cutting through a thicket of bushes until","they found a quiet clearing in the forest. A warm crimson glow filtered through the trees, making everything seem otherworldly.",39,completion
"Rufus suddenly felt very foolish. “Oh god, I’m sorry. I’ve gotten everything all wrong, haven’t I?","I was sure he fancied you, and I thought that you were trying to make me jealous.”",33,completion
"“Now, hasn’t your son, Rufus, become an artist as well? No",doubt he’s been inspired by what’s on the walls of his home.”,23,completion
“What other Eden do we know? Don’t pretend you didn’t hear Rufus on the sound system.,"We all did. She was shagging our son in the rain forest, right under our very noses!”",33,completion
"“Precisely what I told her! I think Mummy was just shocked when Rufus’s voice came booming out of nowhere in the jungle, declaring his",undying love for you. We were all shocked. And then the mic cutting out didn’t help things. Mummy’s imagination ran wild in the silence.”,48,completion
"“Of course I was! But I also know your brother much better than he knows himself. He’s such a romantic, and we were in the midst of","the most wildly magical week. Between the sunset beach ceremony and the rain forest dinner, Rufus got swept up in the moment and…you know…confused about his own feelings.”",55,completion>
"“Ah, you’ve been here before, then,” the docent said, looking pleased that this lady knew about the remarkable feature of the Picture Room. Sir John Soane, the architect and collector who had built this house for himself in 1808, designed special “picture planes”—ingenious wall panels","that moved and flipped open—allowing him to double his hanging space and fill the small thirteen-by-twelve-foot room with over a hundred of his favorite paintings. The docent released a catch, opening the wall like a secret cupboard door to reveal an interior panel chock-full of art.",91,completion
"“You must. I personally have nothing against the girl, but it’s out of the question for",Rufus to be involved with her. It would be such a waste of those bedroom eyes.”,32,completion
"“Don’t try to deny it. Now, what you need to do is exploit","Rufus properly, and all your problems will be solved. Rufus must marry money!”",26,completion
"Mary Gao stared into her bowl of wonton noodles, the faint hint of pink in a",curled prawn wrapped in delicate wonton skin reminding her of the tiny baby growing within her.,32,completion
"“Oh, don’t mind him,” John said, lowering his voice. “I don’t think he was too worried that you’re not investing in his start-up. He was just trying",to get Phineas’s attention. Now he can really get his rocks off sitting next to him.” John gestured covertly toward the Chinese man in the dark glasses.,54,completion
"“They get to pitch the big boss directly,” John said, tilting his head",toward the table of honor by the pool. “Sitting next to the bride.”,26,completion
“The last thing we wanted was to be trapped in a pitch meeting with some,"tech desperado while we’re a thousand feet in the air,” Martha (Diocesan Girls’/Geelong Grammar/Griffith) chimed in.",31,"commercial venture, but the prospect of a lucrative deal had us all on edge. As we sat around the conference table, the air was thick with tension, and the silence was palpable. The room was filled with the hum of fluorescent lights and the faint scent of freshly brewed coffee, but it was the weight of our collective uncertainty that truly dominated the atmosphere. We were all aware that the fate of our company hung in the balance, and the pressure was mounting. The pitch meeting had been a long and grueling process, but we had finally reached the moment of truth. With bated breath, we waited for the decision that would determine our future. The clock ticked away, each second stretching out like an eternity, until finally, the words we had all been waiting for were spoken. The deal was off, and we were left to pick up the pieces and reassess our strategy. The experience had been a sobering reminder of the risks and uncertainties that came with pursuing our dreams, but it had also taught us valuable lessons about perseverance and resilience. As we filed out of the meeting room, we couldn't help but wonder what the future held, but we were determined to face it head-on, armed with the knowledge and experience we had gained from this pivotal moment in our company's history."
"“Listen, Martha’s already confessed to being obsessed with you since she was a",young woman! Now she’s just waiting for you to sweep her off her feet.”,27,completed the task of writing a continuation of the passage. Here is the continuation:
"“Are you joking? We don’t have that kind of money available! Everything we have is pledged to the Leung Family Foundation! We are very cash poor, and don’t forget, we are in the autumn of our lives. You know your poor auntie’s fifty-seven, I’m going to qualify for a free Oyster card soon.[*1] I’ve stopped buying French wineries, your uncle’s stopped buying Rothkos, we’re finished with acquiring! Your","uncle is determined to die penniless—he plans for all his billions to go to the foundation.[*2] Martha, on the other hand, is still young and has billions to spare. Do you know how much MD Capital generates? Every time she farts she makes a billion! I’m telling you, Martha is the answer to your problems. There’s no easier way to save your family from being thrown into the gutter.”",137,completion>
"“Martha’s surrounded all day long by these brilliant guys who, as you yourself","put it, invent entire industries. I’m not marriage material compared to any of them.”",27,"completed the task with ease, their expertise and dedication were truly inspiring. Martha couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and gratitude for their unwavering support and guidance. As she watched them work, she realized that their brilliance was not just about their technical skills, but also about their ability to collaborate and communicate effectively. Martha's surrounded all day long by these brilliant guys who, as you yourself would say, were a true asset to the team. Their passion and commitment to their work were contagious, and Martha found herself feeling more motivated and inspired than ever before."
"“Now, the most charming thing about you is that you don’t seem to be aware of the effect you have on people, and you don’t use your looks like a weapon. But your looks, however much you choose","to deny it, are the key to your securing your fortune and the welfare of your entire family for generations to come. How many Gresham earls over the centuries made marriages for financial gain? Quite a few, I bet.”",77,completion
"“Do you have any juice? Actually, I’ll get it myself.” He left","Rene’s room and headed toward the kitchen, thinking it would clear his head.",25,completion
“There are no cameras in this room and that’s not a chalkboard—it’s a Cy Twombly! We are being one hundred percent serious. You’re only,twenty-three and you’ve already had acute pancreatitis twice and almost overdosed numerous times. Your father has been so concerned for your welfare—” Jane began.,48,completion
"“Martha Dung is the right kind. She has an aristocratic bearing, she’s","not too dark, she’s not too short, and she is well educated.”",24,"completed her studies at a prestigious university, and her poise and elegance are unmatched. She is a true lady, with a heart of gold and a sharp mind. Her intelligence and wit make her a pleasure to be around, and her kindness and generosity have earned her many friends. Despite her refined demeanor, she is not afraid to speak her mind and stand up for what she believes in. Martha Dung is a shining example of grace and strength, and her presence is always a welcome sight."
"“I was joking, I only want one kid to terrorize and ruin. Tell","you what—if you marry me, I won’t force the Greshams out of their house.”",27,completion>
“I figured. Where’s our invitation to the wedding in Venice? Peter will be very hurt,if he doesn’t get an invitation even though he is far too busy to attend.”,30,completion
"“I see where your eyes are. Don’t you dare touch that fettucine, Putter. It will clog your arteries in","an instant and you shall drop dead in a country that doesn’t accept Medicare Part B,” his wife, Penelope, said.",39,completion>
"Putter quickly scooped three stalks onto his plate as he hovered over the truffle risotto longingly. His wife looked across the crowded room, shaking her head. “Who are these people?","Wid said he was marrying a proper English girl, and all these people look so…international. Look at that lady with those terribly vulgar mothball-sized pearls. There’s no way those are real.”",61,completion
