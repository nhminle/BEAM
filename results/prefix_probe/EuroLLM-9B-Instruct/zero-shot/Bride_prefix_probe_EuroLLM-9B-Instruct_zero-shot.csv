"Not quite the stuff of childhood dreams. Then again, I’m no dreamer. I only ever contemplated marriage once, back in the gloomy days of my childhood. Following a few too-harsh punishments and a","poorly executed assassination attempt, Serena and I concocted plans for a grand escape, which was going to involve pyrotechnics-based diversions, stealing our math tutor’s car, and flipping off our caregivers in the rearview mirror.",67,completion>
"That was fourteen years ago, though, and Serena never married me. In fact, she’s long gone. I’m here alone, with a giant heap of","expensive wedding favors that’ll hopefully fool guests into overlooking the lack of love, genetic compatibility, or even previous acquaintance between me and the groom.",48,completion
I did try to arrange a meeting. Suggested to my people that they suggest to his people that we could grab lunch the week before the ceremony. Coffee the previous day. A glass of tap water the morning of—anything to avoid a “How do you do?” in front of the officiant. My request,"was escalated to the Vampyre council, and resulted in a phone call from one of the members’ aides. His tone managed to be polite while heavily implying that I was a cuckoo nutbird. “He’s a Were. A very powerful and dangerous Were. Just the logistics of providing security for such a meeting would be—”",107,completion
"One of the agents stops us in front of the double doors that lead into the courtyard. “Councilman Lark, Miss Lark, one minute. They’re not quite ready for you.” We","wait side by side for a handful of uncomfortable moments, then Father turns to me. In my stylist-mandated heels, I nearly reach his height, and his eyes easily catch mine.",60,completion
"“But they found a replacement,” Cal adds, sliding a manila folder on the",counter. “Everything’s in here. They want to know if she has your approval.”,26,completion>
"The first things I notice are the two walls of windows, which is exactly what Father wants. Every Human I’ve talked with assumes that Vampyres hate light and relish darkness, but they couldn’t be more wrong. The sun may be forbidden to us, toxic always and deathly in large quantities, but that’s precisely why","we covet it with such intensity. Windows are a luxury, because they need to be treated with absurdly expensive materials that filter everything that might harm us. And windows this large are the most bombastic of status symbols, in a full display of dynastic power and obscene wealth. And beyond them . . .",108,completion
"“Whose? Yours? Are you going to . . .” I don’t bother finishing the sentence—the sheer thought is ludicrous. It’s not just weddings that have gone out of fashion hundreds of years ago, but the entire idea","of long-term relationships. As it turns out, when your species sucks at producing children, encouraging sexual walkabouts and the search for reproductively compatible partners takes precedence over romance. I doubt Vampyres were ever particularly romantic, anyway. “Whose?”",74,completion
“And your take on her . . . ?” He must have one. Father’s collaboration,with Governor Davenport is the driving force behind the amicable relationship between our two people.,30,completion
"“However, I am still tasked with guaranteeing the safety of my people. And once Governor Davenport is gone, in addition to","the Were threat that we constantly face at the southern border, there might be one at the north. From the Humans.”",42,completion
"“You hold a Human child as a deterrent for ten years, with the mutual understanding that if the Humans","violate the terms of our alliance, the Vampyres will instantly murder the child. That seems crude and simplistic, too.”",38,completion>
"He nods. “A little more than a week ago, her little brother, Abel, turned fifteen. That night, he and three friends were out partying, and found themselves near the river. Emboldened","by their youth and feeble-mindedness, they challenged each other to swim across it, touch the riverbank that belongs to Were territory, and then swim back. A show of bravery, if you will.”",63,completion
“Their succession of power is not particularly sophisticated. Weres are most,"closely related to dogs, after all. Suffice to say, Roscoe is dead.”",23,"completed by a process of natural selection, where the strongest and most resilient individuals within the pack are more likely to survive and reproduce, thereby passing on their desirable traits to the next generation. This gradual evolution allows the pack to adapt to changing environments and challenges, ensuring their continued dominance in the wild. However, this process can be influenced by various factors, such as human intervention, climate change, and the presence of other predators, which can impact the pack's ability to maintain their position of power."
"“He is young, you see. Around your age and built of a different stock. As savage as Roscoe, perhaps, but",more open-minded. He believes that peace in the region is possible. That alliances among all three species should be cultivated.”,40,completion
"“The other children knew that I’d be the one sent to the Humans, and they started calling me fangless traitor as soon as they could form full sentences. Or have you forgotten when I was seven, and the sons and daughters of your fellow councilmen stole my clothes and pushed me out in the sun right before midday? And those same people spat on me and mocked me when","I returned from ten years serving as their Collateral, so I’m not—” I exhale slowly, and remind myself that this is fine. I am fine. Untouchable. I’m twenty-five and I have my fake Human IDs, my apartment, my cat (fuck you, Serena), my . . . Okay, I probably don’t have a job right now, but I’ll find another soon, with 100 percent fewer Pierces. I have friends—a friend. Probably.",139,completion>
"“They see a wedding between a Vampyre and an Alpha that was supposed to broker peace, but ended in death. The Weres are animals, and always will be, but we are on","the road to extinction, and the good of the most must be considered. If we let the Humans and Weres form an alliance that excludes us, they could completely wipe us out—”",64,completion>
"I only ever laughed out loud with Serena, which means that it must have been well over a month since I last did","it. My brain nearly hiccups, startled at these newfangled, mysterious sounds my voice box is producing. “Did you drink rotten blood? Because you’re unhinged.”",47,completion
"“Vampyres cannot.” I shoot to my feet and begin pacing away from him,",massaging my temple. “Why are you asking me? I cannot be your first choice.”,27,completion
"“You aren’t,” he says flatly. He has plenty of faults, but lack of honesty was never among them. “Nor our second. The council is","in agreement that we must act, and several members have offered their relatives. Originally, Councilman Essen’s daughter agreed. But she had a change of heart—”",49,completion
"And yet, here I am. With Governor Davenport. Leaning on my elbows over the balcony",that overlooks the courtyard where I just got married. Biting back a sigh before explaining:,30,completion
"Gauging intoxication levels in Humans is always a struggle, but I’m fairly sure the governor",is not not drunk. “You asked who gave me my name. It was the Vampyre council.”,31,completion
"Serena was like that, too, when I first met her. “So crucifixes burn you?” she asked me a couple of weeks","into our cohabitation, after I failed to convince her that the viscous red liquid I kept in my fridge was tomato juice.",43,completion
"“Shit,” I mutter softly, rubbing the bridge of my nose. Was Moreland married before? If that’s the case, I cannot comprehend how pissed he must be","at the prospect of being shackled to me while his wife is far away, first in line to the slaughter. Maybe that’s why he flipped earlier?",52,completion
"Moreland presses his lips together. His jaw clenches and he says something, but his voice","is deeper, lower than his companions’. I cannot make out the words over the background noises.",31,completion
"A short distance away, two children are bawling. They are toddlers, one with dark skin and lilac eyes, the other pale and blue-eyed. A Vampyre and a Were. Between them lies a dark blue superhero action figure, broken in two at the waist. And next to them, clutching their respective sons,","are a Vampyre father and a Were mother. Who, for reasons I cannot divine, thought that bringing children here would be a good idea, and now are showing their fangs at each other. Growling. Drawing the attention of the other guests, who start to gather around them protectively. Or maybe aggressively.",102,completion
"“It’s all good,” Moreland says. Calm. Reassuring. Not to the father, but to","the child. As he holds out the intact action figure—not broken, after all.",26,completion
"“Anything you’d like to say?” Moreland asks, this time to the Were child.",The boy blinks several times before looking at the ground with a pout.,26,completion
"“Make sure it doesn’t happen again. Tell the others, too,” he quietly orders the ginger and the older Were, who nod and leave","to mix with the guests. Moreland sighs, and I wait for a handful of seconds, hoping he’ll join them and clear my way.",46,completion
"“I know you’re there,” he says, not looking at anyone in particular. I","have no idea who he’s addressing until he adds, “Come down, Miss Lark.”",26,completion
"No, we Vampyres don’t pulverize in the sun like glitter bombs. Sunlight burns us and it hurts, but it won’t kill us unless the exposure is unfiltered and prolonged. However, we are pretty useless in the middle of the day, even inside.","Lethargic and weak and crawly and headachy, especially during late spring and summer, when the rays hit at that pesky steep angle. “This crepuscularity of yours is really cramping my brunch lifestyle,” Serena used to say. “Also, the fact that you don’t eat.”",85,completion
"Ana sighs, and rolls her eyes, and pouts like she was asked to file a tax return, but eventually she does","leave, sneaking me an impish smile. My sleep-addled brain briefly considers returning it, then recalls that I let my fangs regrow.",42,completion
"“It will be different here.” Her eyes move from mine and trace the contours of the room, still a mess of moving boxes and piles of clothes. Her gaze hiccups on the bare mattress, now stripped of the sheets and blankets that I dragged inside the closet, then stops on the only thing I put up on the wall: a Polaroid of me and Serena","looking away from the camera during that sunset lake tour we did two years ago. Some guy took it without asking, while we were dangling our feet in the water. Then he showed it to us and said he’d only return it if one of us gave him our number. We did the only logical thing: caught him in a headlock and forcibly took the photo.",131,completion
"No shit. “And I don’t know you enough to make a judgment. Your jeans are cool,","though.” Riveting conversation, but I’m about to pass out. Thankfully, with one last withering look, Juno leaves.",33,completion>
"The corner of my eye catches a hint of movement. I turn, half expecting Ana to make","a comeback, but it’s just Serena’s goddamned fucking cat, stretching his way out from under the bed.",34,"completing her sentence, but instead, I see a figure emerging from the shadows. The dim light of the streetlamp casts an eerie glow on the wet pavement, making it difficult to discern any defining features. My heart skips a beat as I try to make out the shape of the person, wondering if it's Ana or someone else entirely. The air is heavy with anticipation, and I can feel the weight of the unknown pressing down on me, making my skin prickle with unease. I take a step back, trying to appear nonchalant, but my eyes remain fixed on the mysterious figure, my mind racing with possibilities."
"Growing up collecting attempted murders like milk teeth tempered me and taught me to be calm under pressure. And yet I still remember it, that first churning twist in my stomach when Serena didn’t","turn up to my place for laundry night. Didn’t reply to my texts. Didn’t pick up the phone. Didn’t call in sick to work, and simply stopped showing up. It felt a lot like fear.",69,completion
"“A few days? She still wouldn’t let the little asshole starve,” I hurried to add, but the officer had already dropped his pen. And even though I went back to the station three times that week, and eventually managed to get a missing person report filed, no one did anything","to find Serena. The hazard, I guess, of being alone in the world: no one to care that she was safe, and healthy, and alive. No one but me, and I didn’t count. I shouldn’t have been surprised, and I wasn’t. But apparently I still had the capacity to feel hurt.",101,completion
"Because no one cared whether I was safe, or healthy, or alive. No one but Serena. The sister of my heart,","if not of my blood. And even though I’d been plenty alone, I’d never felt so lonely as after she was gone.",43,completion
"I had the keys, after all. Because the key to everything is but a line of code. I was able to rifle through her bank statements, IP addresses, cell phone locations. Herald emails, metadata, app usage. Serena was a journalist, one who","wrote about delicate financial stuff, and the most likely option was that she’d gotten embroiled in something fishy while working on a story, but I wasn’t going to exclude other possibilities. So I went through everything, and found . . . nothing.",84,completion>
"And that’s when I did it: I kneeled in front of Serena’s damn fucking cat. He was playing like he always did after dinner, pawing at a crumpled receipt in a corner of the living room, but managed to squeeze a couple of hisses into his busy schedule just for me. “Listen.” I swallowed. Rubbed my","hand on my chest and then even slapped it, trying to dull the ache. “I know you only knew her for a few days, but I really, really . . .” I scrunched my eyes shut. Oh fuck, this was hard. “I don’t know how it happened, but I think that Serena might be . . .”",113,completion>
"The receipt, which wasn’t a balled-up receipt at all. It was a piece of paper","torn from a journal, or perhaps a notebook, or—no. A planner. Serena’s incredibly outdated planner.",30,completion
"Or maybe not quite. A distant bell rang, reminding me of a game Serena and I used to play as kids, a primitive substitution cipher we made up to gossip freely in front of our caregivers. We’d named it the butterfly alphabet, and","it mostly consisted of adding b- and f- syllables to normal words. Nothing complicated: even rusty as I was, it took my brain only a few seconds to untangle it. And once I was done, I had something. I had three whole words:",86,completion
"I didn’t scream, or cry, or attack that old hag. I was paralyzed, unable to function properly for the rest of the night, and only started processing what had happened when I","got home and told Serena, who was furious on my behalf and demanded a promise from the caregiver on shift: that I would never be forced to attend a similar function again.",64,completion
"“Yes, thank you.” He nearly slumps in relief. “And, um, there are","no blood banks that cater to Vampyres in the area, because, well—”",24,completion
"“Are you one of his seconds?” I ask Alex, turning away","from the waves lapping at the pier. “More— Lowe’s, I mean.”",22,completion
"Alex mulls it. “Yes and no. There are some instincts that take over in that form, more than they otherwise would. The impulse to hunt,","for instance, is very powerful. To chase a scent, track down an enemy. That’s why you maybe shouldn’t venture out alone to . . .”",50,completion
Alex lets out a startled laugh. “He is the most powerful Were I’ve,ever seen. And that my grandfather has ever seen—and he’s seen many Alphas.”,26,completion>
Serena’s face flashes through my head. She’s rolling her eyes because I’m wearing a galaxy T-shirt I,"got for free when I bought a lava lamp. Who wears this, Misery? No—who buys a lava lamp?",35,completion
"“Except, now I live here.” I play with my silver wedding band—a habit I’ve picked up in less than twenty-four hours. I’ve never been much for jewelry, but maybe I’ll",keep it when I find Serena and this is over. Or buy one of those mood rings that think Vampyres are always sad because our body temperature is low. “Why?”,60,completion
"The first time I searched online for L. E. Moreland, I found two things: a","semi-defunct GeoCities website promoting a wholly defunct real estate agent, and the infinite vastness of nothing.",31,completion
"Deep in a Human server with ties to the governor’s office, hidden in a memo locked behind a bewildering number of passwords, I",discovered a communication regarding a summit that had occurred a couple of weeks earlier. Around the time Serena hadn’t shown up for laundry night.,47,completion
"“What’s the plan?” Serena would ask if she were here, even though the little schemes she hatched never worked out. She liked the vibe of organizing","more than the actual job of it, and my usually impervious heart clenches a little at the thought that I cannot call her out on it.",52,completion
"“I didn’t think Vampyres could be beautiful.” There’s nothing complimentary about his words. He’s neither hitting on me, nor attempting to creep me out. Just stating a","simple fact, followed by another step toward me, and I’m suddenly very conscious that I’m at the end of a hallway. He stands between me and the exit.",55,completion>
"“I doubt it.” I want to put a door between myself and Max, but the only one I can reach","is Lowe’s office—locked. I glance around for another escape route, but all I find is a giraffe painting of questionable quality.",41,completion
"“Remember what your people have taken from him. It’s almost as much as they’ve taken from me. And yet he’s making alliances with them like a common traitor. He married you, and said that","you’re not to be harmed.” Max runs a hand over his dark hair, and then shakes his head in what looks like disbelief. He looks so deeply lost, I forget my unease and ask:",68,completion
"A pair of hands a million times stronger than Max’s yanks me away. What happens next is too blurry to parse, but a moment later, I’m the","one sandwiched against the opposing wall. My back digs into the frame of the giraffe painting, and my front presses against something just as unyielding, but warm.",54,completion
"“Max came over, saw me, decided to indulge in some light afternoon","murder.” I shrug. “That, I’m used to. It’s the subsequent lying that—”",24,completion
“Leave us.” Lowe’s sharp voice reminds us that we’re not alone in the room.,We turn at once. And we’re equally shocked to see that he’s addressing Juno.,28,completion
"This situation is a problem. The Collateral is supposed to be a nonplayable character in a video game. For the next year,","I need to be invisible, unobtrusive as I search for Serena. Not the kind of nuisance who gets caught murdering a young Were.",45,completion
His eyebrow lifts. “I’m sure you have some excellent advice on where else I should house the,"daughter of the most powerful Vampyre in the council, who’s apparently a fearsome fighter in her own right.”",35,"completion>completion of my project. I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I'm eager to hear your suggestions. Perhaps we could explore some unconventional locations that might offer the unique atmosphere I'm looking for. I've been considering a few options, but I'm open to any ideas you might have. What do you think about repurposing an old warehouse or a historic building? Or maybe we could look into renting a space in a trendy neighborhood? I'm really interested in your thoughts on this. What are your recommendations?"
"It’s amusing to me, the idea that someone who has skimmed a synopsis of my life would assume I’ve had any sort","of romantic entanglement. With whom? A Vampyre, when they only see me as a traitor? A Human, who would consider me a monster?",45,completion>
"There might be something stunted about me. After the Collateral term was over, Serena and I were free to venture into the outside world, to be with people who weren’t our tutors or our caregivers, to fall in love and make friends. Serena jumped right into that, but I could","never bring myself to. Partly because the closer I’d let someone get to me, the harder it’d be to hide who I was. Or maybe spending the first eighteen years of my life becoming acquainted with the cruelty of all species didn’t quite set me up for a bright future.",100,completion
"“But then you’d get mad because Father and I weren’t paying attention to you, and wander off on your own, grumbling about",the oddest things. Let me know if that changes. Have you been talking with the Were Collateral? Has she mentioned anything about Loyals?”,45,completion
"“That’s a bad word,” Ana says, giggling in a delighted, tickled way that",has me feeling like an improv genius. She’s flattering company. “What’s your name?”,26,completion
It feels like the middle of the night when Ana yawns and decides it’s,"time to go back to her room. “My cat is waiting for me, anyway.”",28,completion
"I follow her progress, terrified, wondering if this is motherhood: anxiously picturing your child with her skull cracked open. But Ana knows exactly what she’s","doing, and when she has hoisted herself on top of the roof and disappeared from my view, I’m left alone with two separate pieces of knowledge:",51,completion>
"It’s a barbecue, or a potluck, or a cookout—I never quite got the difference, despite Serena’s explanations on the nuances of Human social get-togethers. Vampyres don’t really build community this way,","by assembling without an agenda. Our friendships are alliances. I didn’t encounter the concept of hanging out, of spending time with someone for the sake of it, until my Collateral years.",62,completion
"He’s separate from the rest of the crowd, on the outskirts of the beach, where the sand first turns into shrubs, then thickens with forest trees. At first glance, I don’t think much of it: unlike most of the","partygoers, he’s wearing a long-sleeved shirt and jeans, but hey. I’ve been a self-conscious teen before, trying to hide with clothes the way I’d shot up about six inches in three months. And melanoma is evil, according to Serena.",78,completion
"Except. Something pulls me back to the window. I don’t like it. The way he’s talking to Ana, pointing at","someplace I cannot see, someplace between the trees. Ana shakes her head—no. But he seems to insist, and . . .",41,completion
"He’s probably in the restroom, and I consider looking for him there. Then decide there’s no time. A couple of stray neural cells lurch awake to point out that","this is the perfect time for me to break into Lowe’s office and search for intel on Serena. The remaining 99 percent of my brain, sadly, is focused on Ana.",59,completion
"“Let me go,” Max whines. Like me, he’s sitting on a couch. Unlike me, his hands are tied behind his back, and",he’s being watched by several guards with the kind of icy treatment one would reserve for someone who tried to kidnap a child.,45,completion
"I’m not quite sure what he wants to know, so I go for what feels right. “Ana has been visiting,” I say, matching his tone. “She keeps me company, and even","though she’s terrible at pronouncing my name and clearly doesn’t know whether she’s six or seven . . .” I swallow. “I’d rather she doesn’t get, you know. Kidnapped and trafficked.”",62,completion
"I let his words churn around me for several minutes after he leaves, wondering whether he’s right. When","they grind to a stop, I know he isn’t: I did have a home, and her name was Serena.",37,completion
"The sun is setting, but I don’t turn on the lights. Lowe’s desk is given away","by Ana’s grinning picture. I tiptoe there, kneel in front of the keyboard, and start messing around.",33,completion
And this wolf’s . . . This wolf’s fangs could win contests. Rule civilizations. Get their owner,"engaged, married, and very much laid at any Vampyre party. And they could shred me into M&M’s.",34,completion
"“Come in,” he orders, and I cannot comprehend how I didn’t notice Alex idling by the","door. Too busy contemplating my imminent demise, probably. “Can you figure out what she was doing?”",32,completion
"“She—very astutely, I must say, and with only very primitive tools at","her disposal—hacked into our servers,” Alex announces. A little admiringly, which is flattering.",25,completion>
“Yup. I’m the leader of our security team.” He sounds distracted as he combs through,my code. Whatever fear he had when we were alone doesn’t hold if his Alpha’s present.,31,completion
"“Nice job.” Weird, how I’m having a conversation with Alex but staring",up into Lowe’s eyes. About an inch from mine. “It’s pretty impenetrable.”,24,completion
“I have to consider this as an act of aggression on behalf of your father and the rest of the Vampyre council. They sent a,"plant into Were territory under the guise of Collateral.” His jaw hardens. “And your scent—they tampered with it, didn’t they? They knew it would distract me—”",51,completion>
"Ana stamps a kiss on Lowe’s cheek, mutters something delighted about how prickly it is, and then slips out in a","flurry of blue and pink fabric. My eyes stay with her, and then on the ajar door, long after she disappears.",42,completion
"“You thought I had a martyrdom complex?” I hug my legs to my chest, watching his lips as they close around the rim","of his mug. “I have no allegiance to the Vampyres. Or the Humans, with a single exception. And I’m going to find her.”",46,completion
"Serena loved berries, and I tried memorizing their names, but they’re so counterintuitive. Blueberries? Not blue. Blackberries? Not","black. Strawberries? Straw free. Raspberries?

"He takes out two slices of bread. His forearms are strong, large muscles interrupted by the occasional white scar. “If Were","business is involved, you might not know what you’re looking for. I’ll have you talk with Alex and hand them over to—”",43,completion>
“I can only protect Ana if I know where the threats against her are coming from.” He leans forward across,"the table. The scent of his blood is like a wave lapping at my skin. “I’m not like your father, Misery.”",41,completion
"I know what Vampyres smell like, what their needs and limitations are.",And Ana is not one of us. Which leaves one single other possibility.,25,completion
"“I was living in Europe when my mother was injured, but immediately flew back. When it","became obvious that she might not make a recovery, she told me about Ana’s biological father.”",32,completion
"His mouth curves infinitesimally, like he’s tempted to do just that, and I smile, too. Our",eyes hold for a beat before he continues: “Ana doesn’t know who her real father is.”,32,completion
"“Or of a chicken coop, if you ask me.” I","bite my lower lip, mulling it over. “Who is Ana’s father?”",21,completion
"“My mother never told me. My impression is that he already had a family,","and that when she attempted to mention Ana to him, he . . .”",28,completion
"“And here I was, thinking we were firmly in the reluctant alliance stage of our marriage.” I don’t mind the supervision. It’s more that Alex appears","to be as good a hacker as I am—the one area in which I allow myself to be competitive. “Okay. Thanks,” I add, a bit sullen.",52,completion
"I’m at the bottom of the stairs when Ana comes racing down the steps, almost crashing into me. Her eyes are full of tears, and my","heart clenches. “Are you okay?” I ask, but she runs past me, straight toward her brother. She’s babbling something about bad dreams and waking up scared.",52,completion
"And yet, I carry on. Even after overhearing Alex say, “Please, please, don’t let me die until I","turn twenty-five or I get to visit the the Spy Museum, whatever comes first.” Yeah. He prays a lot.",37,completion>
"“I cannot begin to imagine how traumatizing it must have been for Ana, seeing her",only parent be hurt by the single Were whose authority she’d been raised to never question.”,31,completion
"“ ’Cause I’m a Vampyre.” She accepts the explanation. Probably because she accepts me. Like Serena used to, and no one","else ever. I turn the page, and we’re silent for three more minutes, her breath hot and humid against my cheek.",42,completion
"“As it’s not hemoglobin or peanut based, nothing. So.” I clap my hands. The cicadas quiet, then resume their singing after a disoriented pause. “Tell me if I got it right: You’ll use your meeting with Emery as an excuse to plant some spyware or interceptor that will allow you to monitor her communications","and gain proof that she’s leading the Loyals.

"I can’t imagine. Or can I? Those first few days after Serena was gone, and I was so frantically preoccupied with",looking for her that it didn’t occur to me to bathe or feed until my head pounded and my body was feverish.,43,completion
"“It’s just . . .” I’m not sure what’s so concerning about the idea of him seeing them. Maybe I’m just remembering being nine, and the way my Human caregivers always stopped smiling the second I","began. A driver, making the sign of the cross.

"The sharks gnaw at the inner walls of my skull, and I won’t be able to make them stop until I find Serena, but in the","meantime, I can distract them. “Anyway.” I sit up with a smile. “Since I so selflessly opened my heart to you, will you tell me something?”",52,completion
"“No.” He stares at the moonlit water. “When we were young, I was there when Koen’s sister met her mate. We were on a run. She smelled her, suddenly went real still",in the middle of the field.

He nods. “I need to send Emery and her people the message that you’re part,of my pack and no violence against you will be tolerated. Not just the verbal message.”,31,completion>

He seems","to have distinct preferences, strong opinions, and little interest in keeping either to himself.",28,"completely oblivious to the chaos he creates, often leaving a trail of laughter and confusion in his wake. His antics are a constant source of amusement for those around him, and his infectious enthusiasm is impossible to resist.
