I [29m] have been friends with Chad [32m] since we were born. Our moms are best friends and we grew,"up together and were roommates for the last 10 years, up until the incident that set our current situation into motion.",41,completion
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.",76,completion
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me. Now I have to find a way to cover his rent until the lease is up.,72,completion
"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend. If you’re reading this, you’re dead to me, human Chad. (Not really, I still love the guy.) But I tag him in the captions of every Chad the Dog Instagram post with “Look, a loyal Chad!”",138,completion>
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers. Maddy,"didn’t look happy, but she took the picture with my phone, then handed it back to me.",34,completion
"“That dog trusts him,” Maddy said. “And that’s a rescue dog, so that means something. They’re usually all","skittish and freaked out.” She went quiet again looking at his wall. “Go down further,” Maddy said. “The billboard.”",37,completion
That night after work Maddy made dinner. Grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf. I did,"the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, then took a shower and blew out my hair.",30,completion
"“Sorry, I had to give Brad his dewormer. I brought some for",you too. Faith said you’ve been dragging your ass on the carpet?”,24,completion>
My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out. Actually, I missed a lot of things now that Brad had moved out. Like having another human to talk to, even if it was this one.",62,completion
"“This is true,” Brad said, looking at his phone. “We are",assholes. But only to each other. It’s the foundation of our friendship.”,23,completion
"Brad nodded at me. “You know, if she’s got the same thing you do,","if you guys date each other, you’ll both find your soulmates when you break up.”",29,completion
They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t. Not alone.",39,completion
Brad took a swallow of his drink. “Ask that nurse out. Go,"wherever she is. Pitch the idea to her, she might be into it.”",25,completion
"“Yeah,” Brad said. “She dates you, you guys break up, and she rides happily into the sunset too. It’s a win-win. Seriously. This is your chance.",If you don’t do something you’re gonna spend the rest of your life sending women on to their forever families and never getting one for you.”,52,completion
Brad looked me in the eye. “You will never find someone as long as all the women you date aren’t actually meant for you. You’re not their,soulmate. Their soulmate is the person they meet after you. It’s decided the minute it starts. They are literally fated not to be The One. Think about it.”,55,completion>
"I had actually thought about her. I’d checked once or twice to see if she’d messaged me again. She hadn’t. The last message was me telling her it was nice chatting with her, three days ago. Trying to keep talking to her was a dead end if she","lived somewhere else. But I don’t know. Maybe Brad had a point. What could it hurt to try? Worst-case scenario, I’d spend some time and money and have no connection with her. What was new? I was already doing that with every date that didn’t pan out anyway.",96,completion
I already knew what he did for a living because Maddy had cyberstalked,"him. Of course I couldn’t tell him that, so I had to ask questions.",27,completion
Me: Not sure yet. I live with my best friend Maddy and we alternate who chooses,"where we’ll go next. She picked Hawaii, and I haven’t decided where to go after that.",32,completion
"For a moment I debated calling from a blocked number. He was nice, but I still didn’t know him. But I figured it",was just as easy to block him later if he got creepy. I dialed and he picked up on the first ring. “Emma.”,46,completion
“But what if it isn’t? I’m just playing devil’s advocate here. What if it isn’t? Brad said that everyone I’m serious enough to date more than twice is cosmically destined for someone else.” He went quiet for,"a beat. “Does nobody feel right to you? Like, there’s just enough there to give it a little go, but then the bottom falls out? Is that just me? Or is it like that for you also?”",74,completion
"“Look,” he said. “I know the idea’s a little out there. But if this is actually a thing, we’re in a pretty low-risk/high-reward situation. We’d just have to hang out a few times and","then stop. That’s it. If what Brad said is true and we can’t find our person because everyone we’re interested in is meant for someone else, I would actually really like it if it stopped.”",69,completion
"I nodded and put up a finger. “I’ve got to go,”",I said into the phone. “Maddy wants to watch a movie.”,22,completion
"Maddy looked annoyed. “Probably didn’t pay the bill. You know, for someone who asks you for as","much money as she does, she sure ends up in collections a lot. God, I hate her.”",34,completion
I looked away from her. My relationship with my mother was complicated. It,"wasn’t complicated for Maddy though, she knew exactly how she felt about it.",26,"completed the sentence with a thoughtful pause, reflecting on the complexities of our bond. I couldn't help but think about the countless times we had disagreed, the moments of silence that had stretched between us, and the unspoken words that had left a lingering sense of unresolved tension. As I stood there, I realized that our relationship was a delicate dance, with each step carefully considered to avoid stepping on the other's toes. I wondered if there was a way to bridge the gap between us, to find common ground and rebuild the connection that had been lost over the years. The thought of it was both exhilarating and terrifying, leaving me with a sense of uncertainty about what the future held for our relationship. "
"I’d stopped calling jails and hospitals years ago when this kind of thing happened. Filing a missing person’s report was a waste of time. Amber moved too fast, was too impulsive. She’d go to",a concert and climb onto a tour bus and end up across the US. Or she’d meet a guy at a bar and get invited to live on his boat for four months in Florida.,69,completion>
"“I don’t understand how that woman made this,” Maddy said, going on,",waving a hand over my face. “A fully functional member of society.”,24,completion
This is where we always landed with Mom. Maddy being furious on my,behalf and me reminding her that Mom wasn’t all bad. Sometimes she was wonderful.,27,completion>
"When my mother was at her best, you could meet her and walk away thinking you’d been in","the presence of a Muse or an angel. This witty, enchanting woman who made you feel interesting and special.",37,completion>
"Maddy’s moms were my foster parents. They’d wanted to be my real parents, but it just never felt right. I had a mom. And I was fourteen when they got me. The imprinting didn’t take. That’s all I could say about it, it just didn’t take. I cared about them.",I called on their birthdays and came back with Maddy for Christmas when we could get it off. They just weren’t… mine. And Maddy knew it. It bothered her. She couldn’t wrap her brain around it and I couldn’t explain it to her in any way that she found acceptable.,100,completion
"Maddy hadn’t come back last night, as promised, and I guess the date went well because he was taking her to breakfast",and then some art exhibit. She wouldn’t be home until dinner. I was off and had nothing to do and nowhere to be.,45,completion
"“Yeah, it had rope bridges and everything. We were on a quick two-week assignment","to Atlanta. Maddy and I had to share a bed, but it was so cool.”",29,completion
“Not today. But when I had lunch with them yesterday we talked about the Reddit thread. I told them about,"you, obviously,” he said. “That’s when Brad gave me his prophecy about you and I being able to break the curse.”",41,completion
“That is exactly what I was telling Maddy a few weeks ago. Some guy proposed,in front of a whole stadium at this game we went to—and the girl said no.”,31,completion
I pulled up to the high school pickup line and put the car,"in park, then grabbed my phone to look at the picture of Emma. Again.",27,completion
"A bell rang and kids started pouring out. The last day of summer school. When I saw my brother, Alex, walking with a","group of his friends toward the buses, I rolled down the passenger side window and leaned across the seat. “Hey! Need a ride?”",46,completion
"I got up. “I gotta get going,” I said flatly. “Want me to run",this up to Sarah?” I nodded at the bag of food for my sister.,28,completion
"I came in and looked around. “This is new,” I said. She had red LED string lights along",the walls. The whole bedroom was bathed in red. It was sort of depressing. “I got you McDonald’s.”,36,completion
Maddy looked up. Then her eyes dropped to the laptop I was holding and she somehow immediately,"knew what was about to happen. “No.” She shook her head. “No. No, no, no, no, no. NO.”",35,completion
"As we started pulling our bags from the trunk, a brown-haired middle-aged woman came out of",the side of the three-car garage. “Are you Emma?” she said in a thick Mexican accent.,32,completion
"Maddy scoffed quietly. “Yeah, I don’t think we’re going to",lose the house. They can probably see it from space.”,20,completion
Maddy must have been thinking the same thing I was. “Does it rain a,"lot in Minnesota?” she asked, raising her voice over the sound of the old motor.",29,"completion: Does it rain a lot here? I mean, I've never seen such a beautiful day with the sky so clear and blue. But at the same time, I've heard stories about how unpredictable the weather can be in this region. I guess it's always good to be prepared for anything, especially when you're planning a trip to a new place. Maddy must have been thinking the same thing I was. “Does it rain a lot here?

I guess it's always good to be prepared for anything, especially when you're planning a trip to a new place."
We lugged our bags up the stairs and were sweating by the time we made it to the door. We came in through a screened-in porch that overlooked the lake. Maddy and,I shared a glance. It was adorable. White wicker rocking chairs and a small matching loveseat with thick floral cushions. A cute coffee table and plastic ferns in wrought-iron planters and hanging baskets.,65,completion
"The bedrooms were off the living room on either side of a short hallway with a single bathroom shared in the middle. The bathroom had a white claw-foot tub, pale blue","tile, and an old pedestal sink. I took the room with the cushioned reading nook in the window and Maddy picked the one with the hanging swing chair in the corner.",62,completion
"Four hours later, Maddy and I were back at the cottage sitting in the screened-in porch.",We’d had dinner in town and then boated back. The fridge was stocked up and we’d unpacked.,33,completion
She looked away from me. “Emma…” Her eyes came back to mine. “Please. Please do it.,Do it now before you lose the chance to meet them altogether. People don’t live forever.”,32,completion
"“How about this,” Maddy said. “Run your DNA and make your account private. We’ll change your privacy settings for a few minutes, poke around. If you have any","relatives out there, we’ll screenshot it and go back to private. Then I’ll go and find them online and tell you if they seem like people worth knowing.”",56,completion
We prioritized power for the coffee maker first and we brewed a pot while I sat in the kitchen with,"a towel wrapped around my head. When it was done, Maddy poured me a cup and handed it to me.",40,completion
The snail’s-pace speed the pontoon put out somehow seemed faster with the beach approaching. Maddy threw it in reverse. The engine,"downshifted miserably, but we started to slow. Then to my horror we began to move backward, motor first, right into the dock.",43,completion
"When we were safely away from anything we could crash into, Maddy killed the engine and slumped in the captain’s","seat. “If we’d been on the other side of the dock, we could have hit the yacht,” she said, looking shaken.",41,completion>
"I lined the nose of the boat up with the side of the dock and started for it again, only this time I killed the thrust earlier. We",coasted along the side and I put us into reverse to slow us down while Maddy grabbed one of the dock poles and we came to a stop.,56,completion
"Her phone rang. “Oh, hold on. I have to leave my ringer on in case Maddy gets in trouble trying to get back.” She looked at it. “It’s her.” She swiped and put the",phone to her ear. “Maddy? Are you okay?” She listened for a second and then glanced at me. “Okay.” Then she hung up. She nodded over her shoulder. “Can we go down there really quick?”,69,completion
I hadn’t really cared too much that Benny might not be here today. He wasn’t the point of this visit. But all that,had changed in the last ten minutes. Now I wanted my friends to meet her so I had someone to talk to about her.,47,completion
Jane led us through their living room and down a hall and stopped,by a closed door. “Everything’s ready. You guys can go in when you want.”,27,completion
"Her phone rang and she picked it up and looked at it. “Oh, hold on, it’s Maddy. Hello?” She listened for a moment. Then she sucked","air through her teeth. “That’s what the bumpers are for. Well I’m glad you made it, I was worried. Okay. Okay. I will. Bye.” She hung up.",53,completion
“I hope so. It’s been a little stressful.” She picked up Murder Mittens. “I don’t think I really thought this island thing through. It,"sounded like a good idea at the time but it’s kind of inconvenient. Anyway, it’s only for six weeks and Maddy likes the cottage, so…”",49,completion
The woman’s eyes moved back and forth over the mouth of her open,Coach bag. Emma took her gently by the elbow. “I’m Emma. What’s your name?”,27,completion
Maddy was already off the pontoon and running toward me across the beach. She skidded to,"a halt in front of me, still catching her breath from the sprint. “This bitch,” she managed.",33,completion
"Amber was in a flowing white-and-peach chiffon summer dress with a slit up the thigh. Her long brown hair was down, she had on a floppy wide-brimmed hat and huge sunglasses. She was carrying","a bottle of champagne in one hand and her sandals in the other, dangling off the tips of her fingers. She was beaming, running toward us across the beach, kicking up sand. “Emma!” She laughed.",69,completion
"“Emma, you won’t believe my day,” she said, looking back at me. “So I wanted to surprise you. I flew all the way over here on","a red-eye, got an Uber, and came out to the address you gave me, but when I knocked on the door this handsome man answered instead.”",52,completion
“Are you kidding me with this?” Maddy hissed as soon as they were out,of earshot. “She’s here for what? Six hours? And she’s already hypnotized our landlord?”,28,completion
Maddy crossed her arms. “What she always does? Show up and leave a path of,"destruction in her wake? She’s not staying with us,” she said in her end-of-discussion voice.",30,"completion> destruction in her wake. It was as if she had a personal vendetta against the environment, leaving behind a trail of litter and broken dreams. Her actions were a stark contrast to the carefree nature of the other children who played in the park, their laughter and joy a stark reminder of the beauty that could be lost in the face of such recklessness. Maddy's behavior was a mystery, a puzzle that the other children couldn't quite solve, and it left them wondering what drove her to act in such a way. As she walked away, leaving a trail of trash in her wake, the other children couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness and frustration, knowing that they would have to clean up after her and deal with the consequences of her actions."
Maddy rolled her eyes in the way that I knew meant she was aware. “Please tell me I don’t have to stay and watch,you eat crustaceans with that woman. Let’s just go back to the island and you see her tomorrow or something when she’s done with what’s-his-face.”,49,completion
I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships. Especially relationships.",35,completion
I felt relieved the instant he said he would stay with me because it let Maddy off the hook. She would walk through hell for,me—and this cookout was her hell. I was glad she didn’t have to be here. Sometimes her reaction to Mom was more stressful than Mom herself.,51,completion
"“Thanks.” I looked back at the lake, at Maddy fading into",the distance on the pontoon. “And thanks for pushing her off.”,22,completion
"Maddy had been right about his height. He was probably about six-one. He was on the leaner side, but",toned. I’d had to put sunblock on him and there was not a single part of that that I disliked.,39,completion
"“He’ll probably completely forget we even exist,” she mumbled, resting her head on","the cushion. “Amber has a way of making people do that,” she said tiredly.",27,completion
"Now I blew out a long breath. “Well, she’s funny. Hardworking. She reads any book she can get her hands on and she remembers everything she reads, even years later. She had me really","young. Same age Amber had you, actually. She’s a good mom, always shows up for us—school stuff, birthdays. She makes these Italian cookies every Christmas and Easter that make me think of my childhood.”",68,completion>
"When I got back to the cottage an hour later, Maddy was in the screened-in porch, reading. She","wore shorts and flip-flops, and she was drinking a beer. She set down her book when I came in.",37,completion
"“Yup. The things you cared about. The stuff you’d take in a fire,",or if Amber showed up to get you. You never once unpacked. Not really.”,27,completion
"I swear to God, I smell like rust,” Maddy whispered, sniffing her arm.",“Do I smell like rust? That water at the cottage is so gross.”,26,completion
He grinned back and forth between us. “Maybe we can get together for dinner later this,"week, once you’ve gotten settled in,” he said. “Amber and I would love to have you.”",32,completion>
It was never going to happen. I knew this. But Maddy wouldn’t let it go unless,"I tried—and really, I should try. Maddy was right, this whole situation was a ticking time bomb.",33,completion
"I paused, not sure how much I wanted to share. I decided on all of it. Emma was going to","be here when it all hit the fan anyway, so there was no point in keeping her in the dark.",40,completion
"I studied the woman sitting next to me. Imagine someone who went through what she did, turning out the way she had. Able to give",grace to someone who’d let her down so badly. Emma was a better person than I was. And my life had been gentler than hers too.,51,completion
I might kiss her tonight. I almost did the other night at the,"dock, but then Amber showed up. I was looking forward to the do-over.",26,completion>completion
I’d tried to be softer with her the last few days. The energy shift I’d had over Mom after my talk with Emma,"was almost as bad as being mad at her. At least when I was mad, I didn’t feel the guilt I was feeling now.",47,completion
"This was another thing I was trying not to think about—her leaving. I should be happy that she came at all, that she wasn’t in Hawaii. We still had three more dates, maybe more if I could convince her. I’d already gotten a freebie the other night at","Mom’s. But I dreaded the clock running out. Emma was the only good thing happening to me at the moment and when she was gone, not only would I lose her, I’d be left sitting in my new reality. Dad gone, Mom in prison. Me with all the children.",97,completion
"“Yeah,” I said. “Thank you. There’s actually something else you can help me with too,” I","said, looking at them. “I need help making sure I can still see Emma until she goes.”",33,completion
Emma pulled two Ziploc bags from her purse. They had Wheat Thins and celery in them. Probably her,"work snacks. “I trust this zipper seal with my life,” she said, turning to hand them to our passengers.",37,completion
"I think I would have been embarrassed if I’d been on a date with anyone else. My mother, sobbing drunk the night before",she left for prison. But I knew Emma didn’t judge. That’s just not how she was. She judged this situation less than I did.,47,completion
"When she finished handing out Kleenex, Emma stayed turned in her seat.","“You know,” she said, “I worked for three months in a women’s prison.”",25,completion
It was funny that two pivotal moments in my life were happening at the exact same time and at complete odds with each,other. I didn’t know how to balance what was going on with my family and what was going on with my feelings for Emma.,47,completion>
"What did I have to offer her? I had nothing but baggage. Emotionally damaged, traumatized children that had been catapulted from one tragedy to the next, and me, barely keeping my head above water. Would I even have the time or the bandwidth to be any kind of partner while I was helping my",siblings navigate this situation? What was the point in even hoping for anything to be different between Emma and me? To what? Pull her from her glamorous jet-setting life to ground her with me in this fucking mess? I’d feel like apologizing every day. There was no way I could ever be worth it.,108,completion>
Sarah gave him a look. “Maybe for you. Hanging out with my brother,isn’t my idea of a good time. I’ll be outside. I want to go.”,27,completion
"“Emma, go meet him at the door, or I will lose my shit. I didn’t push a clunky car stroller around the universe’s largest mall for five hours so you could shake hands","with this guy on the way out. As soon as he shows up, I’m going to park around the front at the lobby to give you some privacy. Go get your damn forehead kiss.”",67,completion
“So he would come home and see you there. Or because she was bored,"and lonely. FYI, Amber only ever calls you when it serves Amber,” she said.",28,completion
"I always thought it was a proximity thing. She traveled a lot, she changed jobs all the time, she was busy, she","was dealing with whatever Amber dealt with. But now I couldn’t rationalize why nothing was different, even though she was right here.",44,completion
He nodded over his shoulder. “I should probably let you get back to work. I have to go pick,"up Alex and take him to a doctor’s appointment.” He paused. “Am I allowed to hug you goodbye, or…?”",38,completion>
"“The whole house has it. I probably have it,” I added. “Sarah’s having a",panic attack. I have to go help. I can’t leave them there infested with bugs.”,29,completion>
I took her hand and did my best to make my face straight. People were already stopping to watch. I made,"my voice low so only she could hear it. “Emma, would you do me the honor of delousing my family with me?”",43,completion
"“She’ll be home one day, Sarah. It’ll come faster than you think. You can visit her and write to her and call her.","You can stay close to her—you just have to try. I know this is hard, but good things can still come out of it.”",47,completion
Sarah was practically bouncing. “I can’t believe he said yes. Mom never,lets me do anything. She won’t even let me get my ears pierced.”,25,completion
"In that moment, maybe for the first time ever for me, she looked like a little",girl. She was a little girl. I recognized the mask Sarah wore for what it was.,32,completion
"After we finished with the lice, I set up the blanket in the backyard. With the landscaping Mom did, it was pretty nice back there with its hanging lights, citronella candles, and magnolia trees. I ordered a","pizza, connected my phone to a Bluetooth speaker, and poured the wine I brought, and Emma and I hung out and talked. Mom had a giant Jenga and we set that up and played a few rounds.",74,completion
"“I’m a surgeon, Amber. I don’t have a nine-to-five, I stay until","it’s done, I can’t answer the phone in the middle of an appendectomy—”",25,completion>
"Amber drew her arm back and threw the large glass thing again, only this","time it bounced off the car’s hood, hit the concrete, and broke in half.",28,completion
"“I have the van,” he said, his hands wandering. “Alex can’t drive it yet, so",it’s just sitting there. Uber the next time you come over and take my car home.”,31,completion
He slipped a hand into my underwear and I sucked in a breath of air. “What time does,"Alex get up for the bus?” I whispered, tipping my head back as he nibbled on my ear.",36,completion
"I came downstairs still in my pajamas, following the smell of bacon, glad I was actually in the right headspace to eat with everyone. When the stair creaked","as I made my way to the kitchen, Sarah poked her head out the door and saw me coming. “She’s here!” She darted back the way she came.",56,completion
