"Peter said this felt like an invitation. Laughed, almost self-deprecatingly,","as he added, “I’d never believed in fate before that.”",completion,20,completion
"My hat landed atop a pile of discarded lo mein, the lip of the can smashed into","my rib cage, and I did a wheezing pratfall into the grass. Peter described this as “adorably clumsy.”",completion,35,completion
“I fell in love with Daphne the moment I looked up from,"her hat,” he’d say, no mention of the trash-noodles in my hair.",completion,24,completion
"Over the last three years, Peter dusted off Our Story every chance he got.",I was sure he’d work it into both our vows and his wedding reception speech.,completion,29,completion
“Could you just turn it down?” I say. “All the plates are rattling,in the cabinets and Mr. Dorner’s trying to bust down the living room wall.”,completion,27,completion
"Petra is also a stoner without a college degree, but I guess it’s different when you’re a perfect",ten with a picturesque family and well-padded bank account. Then you’re not a stoner; you’re a free spirit.,completion,36,completion
"When I jolted awake at the click of the front door, it was full","bright in the living room, so I could see Peter’s surprise at finding me there.",completion,29,completion
"“No!” he said. “I mean, it wasn’t like that. We’re . . . She told me she’s in","love with me, Daphne. And I realized I am too. In love. With her. Fuck, I’m so sorry.”",completion,36,completion
"“Are you fucking kidding me, Peter?” I jumped up. I didn’t",feel hurt then. That would come later. First it was all rage.,completion,23,completion
"“Of course she fucking meant for this to happen, Peter! She had twenty-five",years to tell you she was in love with you and chose last night!”,completion,27,completion
"“I’m really sorry, Daph,” he said, and leaned in to kiss my forehead","like some benevolent father figure, regretfully shipping off for war to do his duty.",completion,27,completion
"I stayed there watching the road for probably ten minutes. Then I went back inside and cried so hard it might’ve made me vomit, if I hadn’t completely forgotten to eat the","night before. I wasn’t much of a cook, and besides that, Peter was extremely careful with his diet. Low carbs, high protein. I dug around our understocked cabinets and started making Easy Mac.",completion,65,completion
"Fool that I am, my only guess was that Peter had come back. That he’d made",it to the airport only for a burst of clarity to send him racing home to me.,completion,33,completion
"Then Peter and I moved into the Waning Bay house, with its wraparound porch. That day, he scooped me","into his arms, carried me over the threshold, and said three magic words that changed my little minimalist heart forever.",completion,39,completion
"Somehow, the kids manage even more enthusiasm for tacos than they did for dragons. When I ask if they already knew that dragons","love tacos, their shrieks of delight are earsplitting. Arham jumps up, the heels of his sneakers flashing red as he shouts, “Dragons eat people!”",completion,47,completion
"Just as I predicted, the energy that greeted me has fizzled, the kids mostly settling into pleasant sleepiness in time to pack it in and head home, except","for one of the Fontana triplets, who’s tired enough to devolve into a minor meltdown as her mom is trying to get her and her siblings out the door.",completion,57,completion
"Hell, I’m old enough to have a daughter named Renesmee on one of those U-5 soccer teams where","the kids take turns kicking the ball the wrong way, then sitting down midfield to take off their shoes.",completion,37,completion
"By the time I climb the stairs and reach the front door, I’m clammy with sweat, and inside I drop my tote and wrestle out of my cardigan before toeing off my loafers. Then I check my phone calendar","against the whiteboard. The only thing that’s changed since last night is, I agreed to host the Thrills and Kills book club on Thursday while Landon, the patron services assistant who usually runs it, recovers from his root canal.",completion,78,completion
"The worst part is, even after all this, I’m not positive I don’t love him. I mean, not this version of him, but the part that remembered every important date,","who brought home flowers just because he happened to be walking past a cart selling them, the Peter who had my favorite soup delivered to me every time I got sick.",completion,61,completion
"“We know how hard this must be for you,” he’s saying, and just like that, he snaps back into the other Peter.","The one I hate. “And I just . . . I hate to think of you there, on your own . . .”",completion,45,completion
"I face the window and pantomime a scream, one hand dragging down the side",of my face. I wonder if this exact scenario inspired Edvard Munch’s The Scream.,completion,28,completion
The weighty silence tells me Peter is doing invisible calculus now. Only he’s got the brain for,it. “You can’t mean . . .” His voice slides past disbelief straight into incredulity. “You’re with Miles?”,completion,35,completion
I need to get off the phone before I involuntarily spring,"a fictional pregnancy on him. “I’ve got to go, Peter. Take care.”",completion,23,completion
"“Did you call Peter drunk?” he says, unwrapping his sandwich, flipping","it open, and absolutely slathering the egg and avocado inside with sriracha.",completion,23,completion
"Basically, she’s me at twelve years old, if I’d been nine hundred times cooler. Right down to the fact of being the only child of an overworked but lovely single mother with a","penchant for eighties British goth rock. During the school year, Maya walks the short distance from the junior high to the library, and her mom picks her up when she finishes her paralegal shift.",completion>,67,completion>
"The new hardcover fantasy I handpicked for her is the most expensive book on the list, but I can’t bear to cut it. Ordinarily, I talk this kind of thing","over with Harvey, the branch manager, but he left early for his youngest daughter’s med school graduation (the other two are already doctors; he’s apparently created an army of high achievers).",completion,61,completion
"I personally hate beer. Obviously Petra loves it. She’s a walking fantasy, and",I’m a librarian who actually does wear a lot of buttons and tweed.,completion,26,completion
There is absolutely no way I can go to Chill Coast. Waning Bay,is small enough without me wandering directly into the heart of the Peterverse.,completion,26,completion
"“Is that the one with the hot drug-dealer bartender, or the one","down the road from that one, where they only play Tom Petty?”",completion,24,completion
"I haven’t worn it since, which is stupid, because it cost way",more than I would ordinarily spend (Peter bought it) and it’s extremely flattering.,completion,25,completion
"In my defense, Landon is nineteen years old and nearly always listening to shoegaze in his AirPods at","the decibel of a launching rocket, so it’s not like there have been loads of opportunities to bond.",completion,36,completion
"Then again, maybe in five years, he still would’ve left me for Petra. Maybe they’re every bit as destined as he’s","convinced. I’m nauseated by the thought that maybe she belongs there, in that home I’d thought was mine, while I belong nowhere.",completion,43,completion
"She nods thoughtfully. “Fair. But for what it’s worth, I’m always late because I have a kid. So I’d like","to think my friends can rely on me, but if it comes down to it, yeah, I choose Mulder every time.”",completion,41,completion
"“It was terrible!” she agrees. “Every day I’d wake up and have, like, one second of peace. Then I’d remember, Oh, shit, I’m someone’s mom. I was a wreck,","for like six months. But it did convince me to go back to school to become a librarian, and Mulder’s pretty much my best friend, so all worth it.”",completion,58,completion
"“Well, I don’t,” I say. “Now there’s no good way to get out of it.","I mean, when we ‘break up,’ Peter will get to feel smug and superior about that.”",completion,31,completion
"“Soulmates?” She laughs. “No. I’m saying your ex is the little boy looking over someone else’s shoulder, trying to figure out if the kid next to him has a better lunch. Only,","the lunch box is shut, so even though he knows what his parents packed for him is pretty good, he’d still trade it just to open up that rusty little Batman lunch box.”",completion,65,completion
"“See, Daphne,” he says, meeting my heckling with over-the-top sobriety, “the Chardonnay grapes themselves are pretty neutral. That’s why they can take on too much oak for a lot","of wine drinkers’ tastes. But ours has a nice peach nose, and this pinch of lemon zest, and a faint, warm oakiness, but not so much that the wine’s overpowered.”",completion>,59,completion>
"“It was bound to happen eventually! Get home safe, lovebirds.” She’s already on her way",back to Greg-Craig. He slips a hand through hers and waves as she steers him outside.,completion,31,completion
He manually unlocks the passenger door. “That’s a Get in the,"car, Daphne; I’m not going to dignify that with an answer.”",completion>,22,completion>
"“Daphne,” he says. “The first piece of advice anyone is going to give you for improving your",situation is going to Big Louie’s. How is it possible you’ve lived here for . . .”,completion,34,completion
"“Well, that explains why I’ve never had them,” I say. “Peter",isn’t a big slatherer. He’s more of a wheatgrass-shot-and-lean-meat-after-leg-day kind of guy.”,completion,23,completion
"On our second date, he’d made me dinner. Salmon and asparagus and a keto-friendly pasta salad. I would’ve been less impressed to learn he was an Olympian. Cooking was the one thing Mom didn’t do while","I was growing up. We lived on takeout, and weekly nacho nights. But Peter started every day with a green smoothie, and made dinner from scratch most nights. Peak domesticity, as far as I was concerned.",completion,72,completion
"We did. It was one of very few silver linings to our relationship ending that I no longer felt any guilt about not going. Peter was into pretty much every form of physical exercise, but I was slower and less coordinated","than him, so the few times we’d tried hiking or biking, it was more frustrating than rewarding. At the gym, we could do our own things, but still spend time together. With how busy his job kept him, that time was valuable.",completion,83,completion
"I stare at him, trying to work out if he actually believes this,",or if he thinks I’m hilariously boring. Maybe Peter thought it was boring too.,completion,27,completion
"“I’m not a huge relationship guy,” he says, a little bashful. “Petra was the exception, not the rule, for me. So","if she wanted to get back together? I don’t know. But it’s not worth thinking about, since she’s engaged to your ex-boyfriend.”",completion,43,completion
"As a devoted fan of control, I never had a big weed phase, but annoyingly the voice in my head reminding me",of that isn’t my own; it’s Peter’s. And I don’t want it there. It has no right to keep echoing through my skull.,completion,45,completion
"“That’s what I’m realizing, though,” I tell him, wrapping the sweatshirt more tightly around me. “It wasn’t ever my home. When","you take Peter off the schedule, there isn’t really much left. Waning Bay doesn’t belong to me, like it does to him.”",completion,43,completion
"Like it was a basketball game, and she and Cooper had decided not to make posters or sit in a specific","section of bleachers. Like things needed to play out, and then someone would simply have won and someone else would have lost.",completion,43,completion
"But honestly, I didn’t want it to even feel like a choice. I wanted her to know where","she stood. The problem was, she wasn’t my best friend anymore. She and Cooper were our best friends.",completion,36,completion
"And in those days when I was mourning in a puddle, Peter was doing damage control. So","if our breakup wasn’t a basketball game, maybe it was a race, and I was too slow.",completion,34,completion
"“And there’s this girl Maya, who comes in once a week. Twelve or thirteen. Perfect little weirdo. She reads everything—goes through like five books a week. And we have an informal book club, where I pick something out I think she’ll like, and it goes in the","stack, and then she comes back a week later and we just talk about it for an hour while I’m doing admin stuff. She’s supersmart. Has a hard time at school, but you can just tell she’s going to be some great novelist or, like, film director someday.”",completion>,95,completion>
"I think about the tense call I overheard behind his bedroom door, wonder if","it’s possible he was talking to her, and what Peter would make of that.",completion,28,completion
"“Okay, not exactly,” I admit. “But it makes me mad that she, like, thinks you need her approval to move on, or something. If she was so in love with Peter, she never should’ve strung you along like that, but","she did, and she dumped you in the worst possible way, and then for her to just insist that you view her kindly—to try to make you not mad, instead of just letting you move on . . . it’s selfish.",completion,81,completion
"“So maybe it’s immature and stupid. But it does make me feel a little better, to think that maybe she’ll see these pictures and remember that, even if she’s not overall an asshole, she was the asshole in this scenario, and","she didn’t appreciate you, and she should have. Even if all that meant was letting you go before telling my boyfriend she was in love with him, instead of keeping you on the back burner in case Peter turned her down.",completion>,82,completion>
"At work, I help Harvey swap out the programming corkboard for the week. Waning Bay Public Library is a","small enough operation that it’s usually all hands on deck. You do whatever needs doing, regardless of job title.",completion,38,completion
"He bears more than a passing resemblance to Morgan Freeman, and his voice, although raspier and not quite","so low, has the same kind of gravitas. It’s a voice that makes you want to do him proud.",completion,37,completion
"“We’re lucky to have you,” Harvey goes on, hanging the sign-up sheet for Friday’s Dungeons",& Dragons tournament. “Just keep bringing your whole heart in for those kids. That’s all.”,completion,30,completion
"He sets his forearms atop the door. “Well, Daphne, I’m less sure",how I feel about it since that snarky Big Bad Wolf comment.”,completion,24,completion
"“Is that so?” The smaller of the two women, Barb, perks up. She",starts rustling through the crates. “Let me find you the best of the best.”,completion,27,completion
"“No, no, of course not,” the other woman, a head taller than the first, says, “but Barb does have","a knack for picking the best, and we want our first-timers to come back, so let her work her magic.”",completion,39,completion
"“It means our chef, Martín, makes a few different menus every season, and I get the best stuff I can","find for him. So I go to the butcher, and the farm stands, and the olive oil store, and the cheesemonger—”",completion,41,completion
"Clarence can’t be more than five years older than either of us, soft-spoken with curly red hair. He isn’t a farmer himself,",just the attendant for the little shop in the whitewashed cottage beyond the rows of vibrant purple flowers heavily populated by bumblebees.,completion,44,completion
“Do you know why he moved here?” he says. “Do you know his whole family doesn’t,"even talk to him? That guy is such a loser, Daphne. You can do way better.”",completion,32,completion
"On the one hand, it feels like maybe I just had a very vivid sex dream","about him and need to act normal until a salacious dream about, like, Santa Claus overshadows it.",completion,33,completion
Miles’s head cocks on a knowing smirk. “It’s not about me. It’s you. He wants,"you both. He’s with Petra, but he still wants you to be in love with him.”",completion,31,completion
"He turns toward me, my hands skating over his back, coming to rest on his shoulders. He catches my wrists in light, loose circles, his gaze falling. “Sorry, I’m",. . .” He takes a breath. “I guess I’m surprised Petra told him that. I just . . . I barely even talked about that stuff with her.”,completion,58,completion
"My chest pinches. “Sort of. I mean, maybe not close. But they were always really nice. His mom came wedding dress shopping with me and my mom. And she got a monogrammed Christmas stocking made for me to match his and his brother’s. They’re the kind of family with a million traditions. Certain plates and specific desserts for each of their birthdays. Every single thing","in their house was some kind of heirloom with some great story, and he and his brother, Ben, would argue over who’d inherit what someday, but in this jokey way. The whole extended family always comes here for New Year’s Eve and they do a white elephant gift exchange, and it’s all very . . . I don’t know. I just really wanted . . .”",completion>,131,completion>
"“Too busy. When I was a kid, she worked a lot to make ends meet, and she always said she’d rather spend her free time with me. I figured once I went to college, she’d give it a try. Instead she got","really into CrossFit and made a ton of friends. She’s always basically either exercising with a lady named Pam or taking art classes with a woman named Jan, or drinking smoothies with both of them. She’s really happy, though. That’s what matters.”",completion,84,completion
The serious one who gives good eyebrow and the wisecracking sidekick who is absolutely,always Ryan Reynolds or someone nearly indistinguishable from Ryan Reynolds when you close your eyes.,completion,29,completion
"I lean into the pressure, pitching my weight forward into my hands on either side of him. His palms scrape down me, and we rock together in slow, heavy waves. He pulls the open center of","my shirt to one side so half of my chest is bared. “God, Daphne,” he says, dragging the open neckline back the other way, lifting himself enough to catch bare skin in his mouth this time.",completion,72,completion
"It was probably too honest for a stupid get-to-know-you game, but","when it was my turn I said, “Unfortunately, I’m probably Charlotte Lucas.”",completion,23,completion
"“Hi!” she says brightly, hurling—actually throwing—her duffel bag in the general","direction of the living room. “You must be the roommate, Daphne.”",completion,22,completion
"He swats her hand out of the way. “Jules, inside",voice. Our crotchety neighbor is going to come yell at us.”,completion,21,completion
"She spins toward me, face alight, a more extreme version of Miles’s lit-from-within,","delighted-by-everything grin. “I’ll give you twenty bucks if you tell me the truth, Daphne.”",completion,27,completion
He leans forward and peers around the cupboard to see the oven clock. “Shit.” He passes me one of the thermoses. “I gave myself an,"extra fifteen minutes, and there was no line, but then I got caught up talking to the barista and . . . anyway, I’m sorry, Daphne.”",completion,51,completion
"I’m not buying it, though: the last time I wore a skirt at","work, Handsy Stanley told me I was going to give him a heart attack.",completion,27,completion
"“Enjoy it,” he says. “I don’t plan on getting up this","early ever again. I hate to admit it, but Petra was right.”",completion,23,completion
"“Yes, Daphne, if something changes, and I need to escape a freshwater","shark, I’ll paddle my little heart out and leave you for dead.”",completion,24,completion
"He swims toward me, loops an arm around my back, my stomach lifting into my chest at the feeling of his skin on mine, his weight pulling","us downward as my heart buoys into the back of my throat. “Your physics are off, Daphne,” he says against my ear as we start to sink.",completion,54,completion
"Looking at his mouth, I forget what we were just talking about. I swallow",a thorny knot and touch the scratchy corner of his jaw. “Beard’s almost back.”,completion,28,completion
"His hand circles my wrist lightly, an electric frisson leaping from him to me.","“Petra hated it too,” he says, his voice a buzz, half heard through the music.",completion,29,completion
"“Can I ask . . .” I trail off, trying to decide how to phrase",it. “Is it too soon for me to ask what happened? Between you and Duke?”,completion,30,completion
"“Duke was my high school boyfriend,” she says, then pauses to chew for a second. “We broke up when we went to college. Then we both","ended up back here. Eventually, we ran into each other at the YMCA, then met up at his car in the parking lot, as I mentioned.”",completion,52,completion
"She gives a blasé shrug. “Sometimes it’s terrible, but this was my choice. I think a lot of my friends thought I was a selfish idiot, giving up a pretty good thing just for the hope of a really good thing. But how can I teach my kid not to settle","if I’m not willing to fight for the life I want? I tried so hard to love the one I had, and if Duke had tried too, I would’ve held on. But he’s just one of those guys who doesn’t believe in sharing his ‘business’ with a stranger, so therapy’s out.",completion,102,completion
"I must take too long to go on, because a slight smile tugs at his mouth,","his eyes sparking with humor. “There’s no pressure, Daphne,” he says. “If you don’t want to—”",completion,32,completion
"The tiny woman with her, arms wrapped around Petra, both of them",beaming in front of decimated plates of chocolate waffles on an orange-checked tablecloth.,completion,25,completion
"Harvey snorts. “I know I’ve got a youthful glow, but I wasn’t born","yesterday. Come in, come in. Shoes off. Everyone’s back in the breakfast nook.”",completion,26,completion
"I slip my loafers off next to Ashleigh’s knee-high boots and we follow Harvey down a narrow, wood-paneled wall toward the sound of smooth jazz and the potent smell of cigar smoke. Every inch of","the walls is devoted to at least three generations of family photos, ranging from recent shots of his granddaughters’ soccer tournaments all the way back to time-faded wedding portraits of him and his late wife.",completion,70,completion
"Harvey moves out of the hallway, so we can slide into the breakfast nook after him.","“Look who decided to finally show up,” he says, “and she brought us a new fifth!”",completion,32,completion
They’re both wearing the same visors as when I met them. Both have matching cigars hanging out of their,mouths. Lenore yanks hers out from between her lips as she stands to greet me. “What a nice surprise!”,completion,38,completion
"He puts the pitcher back in the fridge. “Go put on something nice,",Daphne. We have to leave soon.” He squeezes past me to leave the kitchen.,completion,27,completion
"And when I’m done telling him about the fundraiser, I find myself talking about the kids, about the staff, about our desperate need for an updated stock of kid lit,","and by the end of our conversation, Lance has not only pledged ten kite-building sets for prizes but also offered to host a miniature-painting class for us in the fall.",completion,60,completion
"Slow, soft, familiar. A relief of a kiss, and over way, way too soon, though from the way","Petra is gawking at us, you’d think we’d just performed a handstanding sixty-nine in front of God and everyone.",completion,37,completion
"“She always thought I was reading too much into it,” he says. “But",I think they were worried I couldn’t give Petra everything they want for her.”,completion,27,completion
"Every night that week, we cook together—or Miles cooks, while Jules sits on the counter, curating a country playlist and singing along at top volume","into whatever utensil her brother has most recently set down. I chop whatever he puts in front of me, wash whichever dishes he’s done with.",completion,50,completion
"“Daphne,” he murmurs behind me, still tender and sweet, pulling me in,","my back to his chest, and coiling his arms around my waist.",completion,24,completion
"His smile widens. His fingers move absently to my chin, and I feel myself being drawn into","him, our stomachs connecting, his heart pattering through me. “It’s a camel, Daphne,” he says wryly. “In sunglasses.”",completion,35,completion
She groans. “A week from Saturday. Forty-three. And no to big plans. It just so happens to fall on the weekend Mulder and I get back from,"visiting my mom in Sedona, so he’ll be at his dad’s place, and I’ll be at home rotting my brain to the tune of Bravo reality TV.”",completion>,54,completion>
"“Like a room,” I say. “In your house. You said Duke never wanted you to, right? And you’re","tired of looking at the same four walls. So pick a wall color, and I’ll come help paint.”",completion,36,completion
"There isn’t much else in the room. A bed, a dresser, a side table. I wonder whether",Duke took most of the furniture with him. There’s a sadness to this space that I didn’t expect.,completion,35,completion
