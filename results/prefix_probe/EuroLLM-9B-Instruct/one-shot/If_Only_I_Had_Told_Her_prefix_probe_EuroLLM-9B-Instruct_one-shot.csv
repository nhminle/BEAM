I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.",completion,41,completion
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.",completion,49,completion
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.",completion,36,completion
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,completion,41,completion
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.",completion,35,completion
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”",completion,23,completion
“Why don’t we restart the movie? We can all watch it.” Jack,gives me a look to remind me that our other conversation isn’t over.,completion,25,completion
"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that","look on his face, I know what he’s going to say. I open my mouth.",completion,29,completion
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?",completion,61,completion
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer. I said yeah, not really interested in conversation, not really listening, wondering what Autumn was doing.",completion,97,completion
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.",completion,92,completion
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure. But he thought I had deluded myself into believing this hot girl was my friend.",completion,79,completion
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.",completion,58,completion
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.",completion,59,completion
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.",completion,41,completion
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.",completion,59,completion
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly. I’d show Autumn that I wasn’t a loser without friends; Jack and I would make more friends somehow.,completion,53,completion
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.",completion,44,completion
"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate,",made me seem cool. There had been chuckles of appreciation according to him. I wasn’t sure about that though.,completion,38,completion
"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots. The junior varsity team practiced on the south field, closer to the circular drive where parents dropped off and picked","up kids. Even though Jack and I were on different teams, our schedules were still the same, and my mom would drive us to and from practice every day for those last weeks of summer.",completion,69,completion
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me. I was excited to tell him that practice hadn’t been as hard as I thought.,completion,61,completion
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again. It was only as I approached and saw them watching me that I figured out they were waiting for me.",completion,61,completion
"What if, this morning, she woke up in the tent before I thought? What if she woke up as I lifted my arm off her, then lay there wondering why I had been","touching her, why I was still lying close to her and not speaking? If that was the case, she would have—or could have—heard me say many, many, incriminating things to Jack outside the tent.",completion,67,completion
"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me. Jack has always said I’m irrational when it comes to Autumn, and maybe I should have taken him more seriously, because he was right earlier today.",completion,60,completion
“I already know why you did it.” She doesn’t have to explain that part. I know she’s never wanted me like that. I don’t need to hear her,say it. “I just want to know why you had to be so cruel about it.” It’s time to face what Jack has been telling me all these years.,completion,57,completion
But Autumn’s getting upset. She sits up and pulls the covers,around her protectively. She frowns at me. The birds are still singing.,completion,23,completion
"“It just felt so nice not to be the weird girl anymore,”",Autumn says. “I liked being popular. We did kinda grow apart that year.”,completion,25,completion
“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again. Up ahead, Autumn and her friends were waiting at the crosswalk for the light to change.",completion,45,completion
My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either. When Jack told me—” and then she stops.",completion,44,completion
"“Sorry,” I say. “I was trying to decide whether I should kill Jack for telling you I was",into you or if I should kill him for telling you that I wasn’t into you. Tough call.”,completion,36,completion
"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn. I’m wondering now though. “What would","you have done if he’d told you the truth, that I was”—I try to remember how Jack put it before—“bonkers in love with you?”",completion,48,completion
"“I think my mother has a special bottle of champagne hidden away for just this occasion,” I say. I’m only partially joking. Mom has labeled some of her alcohol, like","for when George W. Bush leaves office and stuff. One expensive one said, “Finny-Autumn Day or NYE 2010.” At the time, I was glad she’d made alternative plans for it.",completion,60,completion
"“Everything,” she says, which can’t be true. I didn’t even know everything",until last night. And Jack wouldn’t have called her before I arrived.,completion,24,completion
"“Syl,” I start, but I don’t know where to begin. I stay","on the highway, passing all the exits that could take us home.",completion,24,completion
"“Syl,” I say as I drive toward her house, speeding up a bit. “Don’t be ridiculous.",I’ve been enough of a bastard already. I’m not letting you walk home in the rain.”,completion,32,completion
"“Lexy,” I say. It’s too fucking early for her to call. It doesn’t matter if we’re sleeping","together again. “Stop being a drama queen,” I groan into the phone and roll over in bed.",completion,34,completion
I’m still standing in Finn’s yard staring at the grass he’ll never mow again.,"I don’t know how long it’s been when a woman’s voice says, “Jack, right?”",completion,28,completion
"“The arrangements still have to be made, but I’m sure we’ll see","you at the wake, Jack,” she says before going inside. “Thanks again.”",completion,24,completion
"There’s an odd aura around us as we approach. I feel so young, like I’m being escorted into kindergarten, and I’m resentful and grateful all over again. My parents shoulder themselves on either side of me, and I can tell all their focus","is on me. They don’t speak, but it’s strange: the closer we get to the horrible box, to the grinning photograph of my friend that sits on top, it’s like I can feel my parents saying to me, See, Jack? This is death.",completion,86,completion
"“You don’t have to pretend that we were more than friends of convenience,",Jack. I’m tired of people pretending to care more about me than they do.”,completion,27,completion
"“Uh-huh.” I take a gulp of coffee, which hasn’t quite cooled and burns down my throat. “So my guess is that’s what Sylv","said to you, and then you pushed back, because of course you did, and that’s when she said what you said to me, huh?”",completion,47,completion
"“Hey,” I say as I approach, careful to stand back so that it’s obvious I’m not trying to","cut in line for the keg. Maybe he’s in his own head, but Trevor blanches for a moment.",completion,36,completion
"That’s the kind of high school memory I want to live in tonight, so even though I have no idea what Chloe","was saying about me to her friend, I head over. A few of the girls rush off, but one of her friends stays.",completion,45,completion
"After the words are out of my mouth, I try to turn them into a joke with a laugh, but that",makes it worse. Chloe’s and her friend’s faces go through a strobe light sequence of reactions before settling back to pity.,completion,42,completion
“You know? How you showed up at soccer practice like that?” Chloe touches my arm in a,"way that I used to think meant a girl was flirting, but now I’m not so sure.",completion,34,completion
"I think my dad calls it an Irish goodbye when you don’t tell anyone you are leaving, and that’s what I’m","trying to do, but halfway to my car, I hear Kyle call my name. I turn, and he jogs up to me.",completion,43,completion
"“It’s okay, Kyle.” Because it kind of is. I’m glad that no one hates me, but I’m also glad that the guys on",the team aren’t friends I should be concerned about losing. I clap Kyle on the shoulder. “Thanks for the invite. Good luck in Cali.”,completion,47,completion
"The next morning, I tell my parents about catching up with Kyle and the guys on the","team, how it was nice to see everyone but how I’m starting to get more excited about college.",completion,35,completion
"“Well, if we don’t see you again, have a good semester!” Mrs. Carter says.",The tears in her eyes glitter. “Let us know if you ever need anything!”,completion,28,completion
I give it enough time that Brett’s parents would have to be seriously unreasonable to still,be hanging around. My fingers and toes are wrinkled raisins by the time I get out.,completion,32,completion
"It’s only nine o’clock, but I hope this Brett guy is asleep. When I get to","the room, I decide he may as well be asleep, because he’s reading the new student manual.",completion,33,completion
Brett keeps a picture of himself in a frame on his desk. It’s one of those,"dopey baseball card pics, and he looks about fourteen or so. Must have been a stellar season.",completion,33,completion
"So that first Saturday at college, I leave Brett, the middle school baseball star, sleeping on his side of the room",and head to the dining hall. I scarf half a bagel and some juice and head out to scout my new route.,completion,43,completion
"Which I don’t think I’m going to have to worry about today. All week, people have been handing me flyers for various official and unofficial welcome parties that took",place last night. Brett woke me up when he stumbled home close to dawn. It seems likely he went rather than fell asleep watching TV in the common room.,completion,58,completion
"Sometimes I see Brett the boring on campus at the Frisbee golf games or outdoor painting workshops, so I guess he’s branched out from dorm activities. He has","remained a mystery I do not want to solve, though it still bothers me that he feels the same about me, since he never gave me a chance.",completion,56,completion
"“Met a guy from Taiwan last night. He seemed cool.” I’d met him in the elevator. He liked my Zelda shirt, and","we’d talked for about twenty seconds before we got off and walked to opposite ends of the floor, but it still counts.",completion,44,completion
"As I get off the elevator, it occurs to me that Brett will probably be in our room and not expecting me. My","schedule has been pretty exact these past weeks. If he’s jerking off, he’d at least lock the door. And since the knob turns—",completion,46,completion
"Brett tries to play it off like he’s been reading the textbook on his lap,",but the framed picture he’d been holding clatters as he sets it back on the desk.,completion,31,completion
"“You won’t,” Brett says. He looks directly at me from across the table,","his food forgotten. He’s so certain. “You won’t forget. You’ll never forget,” he says.",completion,27,completion
"“She tried to kill herself. She survived, but she’s in the hospital.” She sighs. “Taylor",told me. I don’t even know how she found out. She thought I’d be happy.”,completion,30,completion
"“If I didn’t offer, then I should have been guilted,” I say. “I’m telling","you, Sylv, I really should have said something after I saw her last weekend.”",completion,28,completion
"“Yeah, she slept in a little, so when it was time to take Dave to school, I went to the crib, and she was so still, I really thought that she wasn’t breathing. When I picked her up,","she didn’t stir for a second, so for this horrible moment, I really, really thought she was gone.” She laughs. “But then she woke up and was so grumpy with me! She must have been having a good dream.”",completion,77,completion
"Once she is free, the baby stops crying, but seemingly only out of confusion. “Beba?” She waits for me to do something, but I don’t","know what to do, so I continue to hold her from under her armpits out in front of me. “Meh?” she tries again and whimpers.",completion,50,completion
"“I guess I thought that Dave or our love and the life we were building together would be enough. I knew it would be hard,","but I thought that while we were working and saving money for the future together, we’d be more together? Maybe doing better than we are now?”",completion,51,completion
"“Hi.” I’m trying not to stare at the ghost before me, but the hostess has pulled out the chair, and everyone is waiting for me to sit. To compensate, I sit too quickly as","she tries to push in the chair for me, and I end up four inches too far from the table. I adjust myself as she assures John that a waitress will be by shortly.",completion,68,completion
"The waitress is suddenly there, and I’m agreeing to lemon in my water and being handed a menu that looks like a wedding invitation. John","already has what looks like a dirty martini, but it appears untouched. Condensation is beginning to form under the chill of what’s probably incredibly expensive vodka.",completion,51,completion
"“So what is it, John?” I say after we’ve ordered strange-sounding appetizer salads and the",waitress has faded into the shadows. “Why did you stay away for most of his life?”,completion,31,completion
My laugh makes the tears spill but also stops more from forming. I touch my fingertips to my eyes for the sake of my,mascara and look back at John. The gentle concern on his face almost melts my resolve to continue to hold him to the fire.,completion,48,completion
“She was”—he takes another small sip from his glass and sets it back down on the tablecloth—“cold to him is I suppose the way to describe it. She went out of her way to word things so it was understood that she and Stella and I were the real,"family. And I did nothing, Autumn.” His gaze is firm as he admits it. “I should have done or said something, at least to him alone. But the marriage was already half-dead, and I was envisioning losing my second child by trying to reconnect with my first, and I—”",completion,98,completion
"The waitress appears with our salads. Mine is seaweed and shavings of cucumber, which looks like a pile of green spaghetti. John’s salad is red somehow. I find myself ordering both steak and lobster and wondering if the waitress will","faint if I ask for a doggy bag at the end of the meal. Before she leaves, she asks John if he would like another martini. He hesitates and says no but to ask again after the entrées have arrived.",completion,80,completion
"“I’m going to need those stories that you’re collecting,” I tell him. “And Jack’s been working to get",all sorts of pictures from people. Maybe we could put them together as a book for the baby.”,completion,36,completion
"When the waitress comes with our entrées, John doesn’t order another martini. There isn’t space at",the table anyway with all the documents spread out. Together we build another inheritance for Phineas’s child.,completion,33,completion
"For the time being, I called John to let him know that the baby is a girl, and I told him about her heart. He babbled a bit","about being able to afford the best doctors, and I was surprised by my confidence when I told him that everything was probably going to be just fine.",completion,56,completion
"It’s hard to explain why seeing Jack’s face will help, but it will, and I’m looking forward to telling him that the baby is a girl.","I’ll have to explain about the hole in her heart and how it’s probably going to be fine, probably, but I’m getting good at that, I think.",completion,53,completion
"I spoke to Jack on the phone yesterday, but I want to tell","him those things in person. Besides, the context of the call wasn’t right.","completion: I spoke to Jack on the phone yesterday, but I want to tell you",26,"completion: I spoke to Jack on the phone yesterday, but I want to tell you that our conversation was quite enlightening. He shared some valuable insights about his recent project, and I must say, I'm impressed by his dedication and innovative approach. I'm looking forward to discussing it further with him in person soon."
"“Well, I had this umbrella of hers, and when I went to return it, something happened,” Jack said. “I think it’s going","to keep happening too. I know it’s a really weird situation, but I wanted you to know…in case it was a problem?”",completion,44,completion
