"They approached the altar positioned at the edge of the cliff and gazed out at the dramatic view of the Kona coastline just as the sun was dipping into the ocean. Gopal Das (Brimmer and May/Groton/Williams/UC Berkeley/Four Winds Shaman School), a tall, lanky Caucasian",man in his midforties with shoulder-length strawberry-blond hair and a matching beard stretched out his densely freckled arms in a godlike manner. “Let us welcome this blessed sunset. I’ve never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at a moment like this.”,completion,89,completion
"Gopal Das tucked the tight white tee that showed off his sinewy pecs into his camo-green cargo shorts and said, “Close your eyes. Now breathe","in deeply….

"*4 Though Arabella was raised speaking the Queen’s English in what was then the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong and spoke with the poshest of accents, whenever she came into contact with other Asians—particularly","family members and service people—her accent would take on the inflections and sentence structuring that were peculiar to upper-crust Hong Kongers. Linguistic experts call this phenomenon code-switching, while others might call it snobby tai tai syndrome.",completion,71,completion
"“That’s because I’m the only one around here who eats carbs,” Eden said as she took","a bite of her chocolate croissant, still warm from the oven. “You really ought to try one.”",completion,33,completion

"“The older woman said, ‘Excuse me, do you speak English?’ I was used to this question, so I simply nodded. The younger woman said, ‘We see you here every day. You’re so good with the baby. She clearly adores you.’ ‘Thank you,’ I replied. And then","the older woman leaned over and whispered, ‘Whatever they’re paying you, we’ll double it.’ I was so confused, and then it hit me: These women think I’m the nanny! Because I’m Chinese, and my half-British daughter doesn’t look like me!” Lady Arabella recalls with a laugh.",completion,92,completion
"Arabella credits her own mother for her confidence to upend centuries of tradition. “My mother grew up in Shanghai, which was the Paris of the East, so for her, Asian Fusion wasn’t a fad, it was a way of life.” Arabella’s barrister father","hailed from one of Hong Kong’s most respected legal families. “People are constantly surprised to learn that I didn’t grow up in a rice paddy. My grandfather and father both went to Oxford, and we had a house in Kowloon Tong with five servants.”",completion,87,completion
"The countess never imagined that her modern spin on Marco Polo would spawn her own design and hospitality empire, but after a famously finicky Qatari prince spent the weekend and was wowed by the countess’s hospitality, he commanded her to design a hotel in London “for people who can only bear to stay in palaces when they travel,” promising to book out","the entire place every year for the London Season. Arabella quickly conceived of Bella’s, the gemlike London oasis that has set the standard for boutique establishments everywhere.

"Eden awoke to the sound of unfamiliar chirps. The chorus of birds outside sounded more spirited than anything she’d heard before, and they had been at it all night. Having arrived very late the previous","evening to a house at the end of a pitch-black road, she had no inkling of what lay outside. She rose from the bed lazily, flung open the louvered plantation doors, and almost gasped in disbelief.",completion,71,completion
“Watch your step!” came a shout behind her. Eden looked down and saw the large gray rock,she was about to step on suddenly move. It was a sea turtle basking in the sun.,completion,34,completion
"“Oh my god!” Eden exclaimed, backing off. She turned around to see",a woman in her late twenties sitting on a sun-bleached tree trunk.,completion,24,completion
"“I should put on some proper clothes first,” Eden said, realizing she was still",in her sleeping clothes—an old pair of cotton jersey shorts and a skinny tee.,completion,28,completion
“Why? Are you going to the Wolseley? Look how I’m dressed.” Rufus gestured to his tattered board shorts and bare feet as they cut through a wooded path that led from the beach to a road that to Eden seemed straight out of a dream. Tall coconut,"palms, fragrant hibiscus bushes, and mango trees lined the winding lane of relaxed old bungalows and wooden beach cottages next door to the occasional sprawling mansion. Rufus reached up into one of the low-hanging branches as they walked past and plucked two ripe mangoes. “For breakfast.” He grinned.",completion,95,completion
"“Puako Beach Road is one of the only places left on the entire island that still has these original cottages from the sixties right on the beach,” Rufus","explained. “It’s a real neighborhood, as opposed to some poncy resort. You love hunting down the local hangouts whenever you travel, so I thought you’d prefer it over here.”",completion,57,completion
Rufus gestured outside. On one end of the back deck was an outdoor shower nestled between thick tropical bushes and a,wall of stacked volcanic rocks. Rufus pointed to a galvanized steel cistern on the roof. “That tank collects rainwater for the shower.”,completion,43,completion
"“Now, you and I both know that Rufus is wasting his life away",in Hawaii. It’s high time Rufus settled down and did something with his life…”,completion,27,completion

"“Not only is she to the manor born, she is to the hotel born too!” Bea jumped in. “The de Courcys own a fabulous crop of hotels all over",France and the French Caribbean. That’s why it’s a match made in heaven—she already knows what it feels like to be constantly harassed by friends angling for room upgrades!”,completion,58,completion
They went outside to the wooden deck and sat down on a pair of canvas butterfly chairs. Eden,"inhaled the steam from her coffee mug, which was infused with a sweet scent. “Did you add vanilla?”",completion,36,completion
"“Mmm. Love it.” Eden smiled as she took a long, slow sip, closed her eyes, and eased into her chair. The sun on her face","felt so lovely, she could hardly believe that it was the middle of winter back in Britain. “Now I feel like I’m truly on holiday.”",completion,50,completion
“I think this is our last moment of peace before guests start,flooding the island. Ready for the craziest wedding weekend ever?” Rufus asked.,completion,24,completion
"No you’re not, Eden thought to herself as she sipped on her coffee, taking in the sounds of the waves","pounding onto the lava rocks and the ecstatic screech of birds. “I’ve never heard birds quite like this before,” she said.",completion,41,completion
Rufus laughed. “Because they aren’t birds. That’s the sound of the,coqui frog. They’re everywhere on the island. That’s their mating call.”,completion,22,completion
Bea was just fastening the labradorite-bead[*1] necklace around her sister Augusta’s,neck when there was a series of quick raps on the door.,completion,23,completion
"“Yes! I had nothing to wear for this evening and they came to my rescue. This just arrived an hour ago from New York,” Bea replied of her strapless gown","with its dramatic purple bodice bow sash and painted anemones on the skirt. Unlike her sister, she had no issues with looking like she had just stepped off a fashion catwalk.",completion,61,completion
"“It looks like she found it on the clearance rack at Mango,” Arabella replied curtly","as the first guests appeared at the top of the steps, and Augusta burst into tears.",completion,31,completion
"“How can you say such a thing, Countess? I have known Eden since my very first visit to Greshamsbury Hall three years ago, and the girls and I even went camping in the Outer Hebrides","last year. When someone has seen you empty your bowels into a hole you have just dug in the sand with your bare hands, I don’t think they have to call you ‘Serene Highness’ anymore.”",completion,70,completion
"Rufus gave a bashful grin. “I thought, why not turn bad luck into good? It’s not","every day that an eruption occurs at a wedding site, so let’s have everyone enjoy the experience!”",completion,33,completion
"“Mind if I stop? The text goes on and on and I’m feeling a bit sick reading off your phone.” Eden closed her eyes, trying to enjoy the feel of the sun on her face and the cool breeze in her hair, but it","wasn’t working. She felt miserably hungover from the previous evening. After sunset cocktails at the lava-viewing platform, the party had moved into a magnificent inner courtyard with four reflecting pools where an eight-course banquet commenced, and Eden had fallen victim to the exquisite wine pairings.",completion,89,completion
“Change of plans. When Freddy realized we were going whale watching on a fishing,"boat, he insisted that we take his Walrus or whatever that thing is called.”",completion,28,completion
"No sooner had Rufus said this than a now-familiar roar filled the air and Freddy’s fantastical boat pulled up to the dock. As everyone climbed on board, a pair of dark-tinted glass doors automatically opened, revealing a sleek, Zenlike interior cabin where Freddy (CEE/Crossroads/NYU/Pepperdine), dressed in a pale beige cashmere sweater over a white","linen shirt and pleated linen trousers, lounged like a pasha on plush white cashmere cushions. Beside him sat a brunette with a mass of pretty curls in a chic vintage floral-print maxi dress, and arrayed before them on the Ipe wood floor was a massive clamshell piled high with tropical fruits, champagne, oysters, and caviar.",completion,109,completion
"Laurel (Balboa/Thacher/Cornell/MIT) winced. “We’re not hunting whales, Mr. Farman-Farmihian. Not today or any other day. We’re going to observe",these magnificent creatures that have traveled three thousand miles from Alaska to spend the winter in our tropical waters.”,completion,38,completion
Solène reflexively brushed the tiny black eggs off with her hand,but immediately smeared them all over her linen skirt. “Merde!” she cursed.,completion,23,completion
"“It’s a good thing we slowed down. We’re coming to the whales’ winter feeding grounds,","and we don’t want to cause too much of a disturbance around them,” Laurel said.",completion,30,completion
“I don’t think we’re going to scare any whales today. I think a young,"calf could probably capsize this boat with a flick of its tail,” Rufus laughed.",completion,28,completion
"Solène nodded. “Yes, it is part of my latest series. It’s my examination","of toxic masculinity, based on actual words my exes would say to me.”",completion,26,completion
"The waves from the whale’s breaching rocked the boat violently, and Eden could feel herself turning green.","She sat down in a corner, taking deep breaths as she tried to hold it all in.",completion,34,completion

“How in the world did you find this spot?” Thomas said as he dug into,the deliciously spicy poke while looking out at the view of the ocean in the distance.,completion,31,completion
“Stumbled on it a few years ago when I was hunting for a quiet beach. Now,it’s become my go-to hideaway—it’s the last place on earth Arabella would ever look for me.”,completion,32,completion
"“Can’t picture her here,” Thomas chuckled as an inquisitive hen wandered under the table and began pecking at",something by his feet. “Especially after the remarkable feat she pulled off last night at the welcome party.”,completion,36,completion
"“That’s an idea! The Norwegians are a generous bunch, aren’t they? Perhaps Max’s",parents will take pity on me now that we’re going to be kin.”,completion,26,completion
"“That’s Pu‘ukohola Heiau, the temple built by King Kamehameha.","It’s a very sacred place for Hawaiians,” the driver replied.",completion,19,completion
"“I’ll try my best not to.” Thomas headed into the visitor’s center to get a quick lay of the land before walking up the hill to the temple. He strolled around the perimeter,",marveling at the meticulously arranged stones used to create the structure. There was something about the place that reminded him of the ancient stone circles that could be found throughout the countryside in Devon.,completion,67,completion

"The dream was always the same. She was six, maybe seven years old. Her mother, dressed in a white Lacoste piqué polo and a flared tennis skirt, would come into the room and ask her, “I’m going to the supermarket. Do you want to come on a walk with me?” Eden would shake her head. Minutes after her mother had left the house, Eden would miss her terribly","and decide to run after her. She would run out the door of the redbrick house and down a long hill, chasing the figure in white at the end of the road. But for some reason she could never catch up with her mother. She would run and run, her heart pounding so fast she could barely breathe, but the figure in white only got smaller and smaller.",completion,136,completion
Thomas placed a hand on her cheek to feel her temperature. “You could,have had heatstroke. Most people don’t realize they have heatstroke until it’s too late.”,completion,27,completion
"“Hmm. I don’t recall her having either, but she could have played tennis in her younger days. Or maybe badminton, which was quite","popular in Hong Kong in the early nineties,” Thomas mused as he slid open the wooden slatted doors to reveal a large balcony.",completion,46,completion
“So this is how the other half live. Whose room are we in?” Eden asked as she wandered onto the,balcony and took in the view of the infinity pool surrounded by white tented cabanas and the pristine beach beyond.,completion,40,completion
"Eden fetched the bulky garment bag and unzipped it, staring at its contents in confusion. There was a",shimmering ice-blue evening gown complemented by a turquoise faux-fur coat. “A fur coat? Bea’s out of her mind…”,completion,36,completion
"“From what I understand, you’re going to need that tonight,” Thomas said. “We’re",about to go from sea level to an altitude of fourteen thousand feet!”[*],completing the mission to retrieve the ancient artifact hidden deep within,26,"completing the mission to retrieve the ancient artifact hidden deep within the ruins of the long-abandoned temple. The artifact, rumored to hold immense power, was said to be guarded by a powerful entity that would stop at nothing to protect it. As we ventured deeper into the temple, the air grew thick with an eerie silence, and the shadows seemed to move of their own accord. The artifact was said to be hidden in a chamber deep within the temple, and only by solving a series of ancient puzzles could we hope to find it. The puzzles were said to be designed by the temple's ancient architects to test the worthiness of those who sought to claim the artifact's power. With each puzzle solved, we drew closer to our goal, but the closer we got, the more we realized that we were not alone in our quest. The temple was said to be home to a group of rogue treasure hunters who would stop at nothing to claim the artifact for themselves. As we navigated the treacherous paths and solved the puzzles, we began to suspect that we were being watched, and that our pursuers were closing in. The tension was palpable, and we knew that we had to be quick if we were to succeed in our mission. With each step, we felt the weight of the artifact's power growing, and we knew that we were on the cusp of something momentous. The final puzzle was the most challenging of all, and it was said that only those who were pure of heart and true of purpose could solve it. As we stood before the puzzle, we felt a surge of determination and a sense of purpose. We knew that we had to succeed, not just for ourselves, but for the sake of the world. With a deep breath, we began to solve the puzzle, and as the pieces fell into place, we knew that we had succeeded. The artifact was ours, and we had proven ourselves worthy of its power. As we emerged from the temple, we knew that our lives would never be the same, and that we had been forever changed by our experience. The artifact's power was real, and we knew that we had been given a great responsibility. We had to be careful with it, and we had to use it for the greater good. The world was watching, and we knew that we had to be the best we could be. With the artifact in hand, we set out to make a difference, and to use its power to change the world for the better. The journey ahead would be long and difficult, but we were ready. We had faced our fears and had emerged victorious, and we knew that we could overcome any obstacle that lay ahead. The artifact's power was a double-edged sword, and we knew that we had to be careful with it. But we were determined to use it for the greater good, and to make a difference in the world.
