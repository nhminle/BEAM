"Aside from Eager Beaver, there are fourteen of us starting today. Fourteen of us fresh out of top-five graduate programs, and prestigious internships, and CV-beefing industry","jobs accepted exclusively to look more attractive during NASA’s next round of recruitment. There’re fourteen of us, and the thirteen that aren’t me are all nodding enthusiastically.",53,"positions. We are the cream of the crop, the chosen few, handpicked from a sea of applicants. The air is thick with anticipation and the scent of new leather from our briefcases. We gather in the grand lobby of the corporate headquarters, a building that pierces the sky and symbolizes success. The CEO's speech hangs in the air, a mix of encouragement and challenge. We listen intently, our minds racing with ambition and the desire to make our mark. The day ahead promises not only the start of our careers but also the beginning of a journey filled with learning, growth, and hopefully, triumph. As the meeting concludes, we break into smaller groups, assigned to different departments. The initial nervousness gives way to excitement as we meet our mentors and peers. We are briefed on our first projects, each one promising to be a stepping stone towards our professional goals. The day is long, filled with orientation sessions, team-building exercises, and the inevitable small talk that helps us forge new connections. By the time the sun sets, we are not just fourteen individuals anymore; we are a team, united by our shared ambition and the common goal of excellence. The future is uncertain, but the path ahead is clear: we are here to innovate, to challenge the status quo, and to leave an indelible mark on the industry. This is just the beginning, and already, it feels like the start of something truly remarkable."
"The truth, though, is quite the opposite. I hated school at first sight—with the direct consequence that school hated the sullen, listless child that I was right back. In the first grade, I refused to learn how to write my name, even though Hannah is only three letters repeated twice. In junior high, I set a school record for the highest number of consecutive detention days—what happens when","you decide to take a stand and not do homework for any of your classes because they are too boring, too difficult, too useless, or all of the above. Until the end of my sophomore year, I couldn’t wait to graduate and leave all of school behind: the books, the teachers, the grades, the cliques. Everything. I didn’t really have a plan for after, except for leaving now behind.",137,"you combine a stubborn streak with a complete lack of interest in the curriculum. My teenage years were a blur of indifference and rebellion, marked by a series of suspensions for various acts of defiance. It wasn't until much later, when I was forced to confront the reality of the adult world, that I began to understand the value of education. "
"“It’s like space is your whole personality,” the girl I casually hooked up with during most of my sophomore year of undergrad told me. It was after I explained that no, thank you, I wasn’t interested in going out for coffee to meet her friends because of a lecture on","Kalpana Chawla I was planning to attend. “Do you have any other interests?” she asked. I threw her a quick “Nope,” waved good-bye, and wasn’t too surprised when, the following week, she didn’t reply to my offer to meet up. After all, I clearly couldn’t give her what she wanted.",100,"space exploration that I had to attend. She looked at me with a mix of confusion and amusement, her eyes reflecting the same stars that had always captivated me. ""Space is vast, endless,"" I continued, my voice carrying the weight of my passion. ""It's not just a subject; it's a universe of possibilities, of questions waiting to be answered. It's the thrill of the unknown, the beauty of the cosmos laid bare. It's the feeling of being a tiny speck in an immense expanse, yet knowing that this speck can reach out and touch the infinite. It's the understanding that every star we see in the night sky could hold its own story, its own mysteries. It's the drive to explore, to learn, to push beyond the boundaries of what we know. It's a calling, a siren song that I can't ignore. It's my whole personality because it shapes how I see the world, how I approach problems, how I dream. It’s not just about the stars; it’s about the journey, the discoveries, the innovations. It’s about the future, about what humanity can achieve when we dare to look up and wonder. It’s about the potential that lies within us to transcend our limitations and reach for the stars. And that, that is something I can’t just casually dismiss for coffee and small talk."" She nodded slowly, a new respect in her eyes, perhaps understanding a bit more of the enigma that was me. Her friends would have to wait; my lecture was about to begin, and I couldn’t wait to dive into the mysteries of the universe once more."
"“Yeah, I’m not sure.” She shrugs and continues to make her way through a Tupperware of broccoli, an apple, and approximately two fucktons of Cheez-Its. “I don’t really know much about him. His parents divorced, then people in my family had arguments and stopped talking to each other. There was a lot of","prime Floyd dysfunction happening, so I haven’t actually spoken to him in years. But I heard from one of my other cousins that he was working on that thing that landed on Mars back when we were in high school. It was called something like . . . Contingency, or Carpentry, or Crudity—”",106,"confusion and hurt feelings. I think he moved around a lot after that, but I'm not certain. He's always been a bit of a mystery to me. We weren't close growing up, and even now, we're more like acquaintances than friends. I know he's into photography, which is how we ended up talking again recently. He posted some photos on social media that caught my eye. They were really good, you know? There was this one of an old, abandoned house that just stopped me in my tracks. It was so hauntingly beautiful, the way the light hit the decaying structure. It made me curious about him again, about his life and what drives him creatively. So, I reached out, and we started chatting. It's been nice, getting to know him a little better. But yeah, there's still a lot I don't know. I guess that's part of what makes it interesting, right? The mystery and the slow reveal of someone's story. It's like unwrapping a present, bit by bit. You never know what you'll find inside until you get to the end.” She takes a sip of her water, her gaze distant as she reflects on her rekindled acquaintance with this enigmatic figure from her past."
"“I think so. Do the dates add up? Maybe it was some kind of summer internship? But honestly, it might just be Floyd family lore. I have an aunt who insists that we’re related to","the Finnish royals, and according to Wikipedia there are no Finnish royals. So.” She shrugs and pops another handful of Cheez-Its in her mouth. “Would you like me to ask around, though? For the assignment?”",70,"some distant, noble lineage, despite no concrete evidence. The Floyd family tree is full of such stories, each more fantastical than the last. My grandfather, in his later years, would regale us with tales of a great-great-grandfather who supposedly sailed with Captain Cook, despite the historical inaccuracy. It's fascinating how these narratives evolve over time, becoming a part of family identity, even if they're more fiction than fact. Perhaps the internship story is another such embellishment, a way to add a touch of glamour or intrigue to our otherwise ordinary lineage. In any case, it's these stories that make family gatherings lively and memorable, even if they're not grounded in historical truth. They serve as a reminder of our shared past, however embellished it may be, and the bonds that tie us together. In the end, whether it's an internship or an illustrious ancestor, what matters is the connection it fosters among family members, encouraging us to learn more about our history, however it may be spun."
"“By the way, I sent you my cousin-or-something’s contact info a while ago,” Mara tells me one night. We’re at the",cheapest grad bar we’ve been able to find. She’s on her second Midori sour of the night. “Did you get it?”,42,"local coffee shop, the warm glow of fairy lights casting a cozy ambiance over our table. The scent of freshly ground coffee beans mingles with the sweet aroma of baked goods, creating a comforting backdrop to our conversation. ""Yeah, I remember,"" I say, sipping my latte. ""I haven't had a chance to reach out yet. How's she doing?"" Mara's expression softens, a hint of concern flickering in her eyes. ""She's been going through a rough patch. Divorce, you know? It's been tough on her. She could use a friend right now."" I nod, understanding the weight of her words. ""I'll give her a call tomorrow. Maybe we can meet up and catch up. It's important to have someone to talk to during tough times."" Mara's smile is grateful, and for a moment, the world outside our bubble of warmth and light seems a little less daunting."
"He frowns, as if momentarily blanking on Mara’s name. “Ah, yes.” He nods. Only once. “Apparently,” he adds, which makes me laugh. He waits for me to take a seat","across from him before folding back in his chair. I notice that he doesn’t hold out his hand, nor does he smile. Interesting. “Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.”",61,"before continuing. ""So, Mara tells me you've been having some trouble with your project?"" His tone is light, but his eyes are sharp, assessing. I nod, feeling a bit exposed under his scrutiny. ""It's more than trouble,"" I confess, my voice barely above a whisper. ""It's like hitting a wall, and no matter how hard I try, I can't break through."""
"“Officially: unclear. But I’m fairly sure my brother made CDs of it. Sent them to local TV stations and whatnot.” He gestures vaguely, and his forearm is dusted with freckles and pale-red hair. I want to grab his wrist, hold it in front","of my eyes, study it at my leisure. Trace, smell, touch. “I haven’t spent a holiday with the Floyd side of the family in twenty years, but I’m told that the video is a source of great entertainment for all age groups at Thanksgiving.”",87,"of me, to feel the warmth of his skin, to anchor myself in this surreal conversation. But I resist, tucking my hands into my pockets instead. ""And what happened then? Did they play it?"" I ask, trying to keep the curiosity out of my voice, but it's clear I'm hanging on his every word."
"The section is in C++. Which happens to be the very first language I taught myself back in high school, when every single Google search for “Skills + Necessary + NASA” led to the sad result of “Programming.” Python came after. Then SQL. Then HAL/S. For each language, I started out convinced that chewing on","glass would surely be preferable. Then, at some point along the way, I began thinking in terms of functions, variables, conditional loops. A little after that, reading code became a bit like inspecting the label on the back of the conditioner bottle while showering: not particularly fun, but overall easy. I do have some talents, apparently.",111,"chewing on the syntax would be akin to gnawing on a piece of code-infused beef jerky. But as I delved deeper, I discovered that each language was more like a different flavor of ice cream. C++ was my rocky road, dense and full of nuts (classes, objects, and pointers), requiring a robust spoon (a solid understanding of memory management and pointers). "
"My heart rate picks up. Warmth twists in my lower stomach. I lean forward with a smile, feeling like I’m finally in my element. This, this, is what I know best. Depending on how busy I am with school, or work, or binge-watching K-dramas,","I do this about once a week. Which amounts to quite a bit of practice. “Maybe I could come to your place?” I say, finding the sweet spot between comically suggestive and Let’s get together to play Cards Against Humanity. “And you could show me?”",89,"my schedule can vary widely. But when I'm in the zone, nothing else matters. The canvas before me is a battlefield, and I am the general, ready to lead my colors to victory. Each brushstroke is a calculated move, each color a strategic decision. The paint flows like a river, guided by my hand, creating a tapestry of emotions and stories. The scent of oil and acrylic fills the air, a comforting aroma that tells me I'm home."
"It sends me right over the edge. Into something that’s nothing like my usual, run-of-the-mill orgasm. Those tend to start like small fractures and then slowly, gradually deepen into something lovely and relaxing. Those are fun, good fun, but this . . . This pleasure is sudden and violent. It splinters into me like a wonderful, terrible explosion, new and frightening and fantastic,","and it goes on and on, as though every heart-stopping, delicious second of it is being squeezed out of me. I screw my eyes shut, clutch Ian’s shoulders, and whimper into his throat, listening to the hushed “Fuck. Fuck,” he mouths into my collarbone. I was so sure I knew what my body was capable of, but this feels somewhere well beyond it.",126,"It's as if every nerve ending in my body ignites simultaneously, a symphony of sensation that overwhelms my senses. The aftershocks linger, a pulsating echo of the storm that just passed through me. I'm left breathless, trembling, my mind a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions, unable to distinguish one from the other. It's a feeling of being utterly consumed, of having transcended the mundane boundaries of my physical self."
"The last words I hear from him are, “It was really good to meet you, Hannah.” I think I should say it back, but there’s an unfamiliar weight in my chest, and I can’t quite bring myself to do it. So I","make do with a small smile and a halfhearted wave. I stuff my hands in my pockets while my body is still thrumming with what I left behind, and wander slowly back to the Caltech campus, thinking about red hair and missed opportunities.",85,"stand there, frozen, as he turns and walks away. The moment he disappears around the corner, I feel a rush of emotions I hadn’t anticipated. Regret, confusion, and a strange sense of loss wash over me. I should have said it back, I realize. Those words, simple and sincere, could have been a bridge to something more, a connection I hadn’t fully understood until now. "
"The following day, when Mara asks me about my meeting with her cousin-or-something, I say only “Uneventful,” and I don’t even know why. I don’t like lying, and I like lying to someone","who’s rapidly becoming a friend even less, but I can’t make myself say any more than that. Two weeks later, I turn in a reflection paper as part of my Water Resources class requirements.",67,"even less. But there's something about Mara that makes me want to protect her from the truth. Maybe it's her genuine kindness, her unwavering support, or the way her eyes light up when she talks about her dreams. Whatever it is, I find myself weaving a web of half-truths and omissions around her, hoping it will shield her from the harsh realities I've been grappling with."
"“Avalanche danger is set at the highest level, and it’s not safe for anyone to come out to get me,” I add, speaking right into the satphone’s mic. Repeating what Dr. Merel, my team leader, told me a few hours ago, during my last communication with AMASE, NASA’s home base here in Norway. It was right before he","reminded me that I’d been the one to choose this. That I’d known what the risks of my mission were, and I still decided to undertake it. That the path to space exploration is full of pain and self-sacrifice. That it was my fault for falling in an icy hole in the ground and spraining my fucking ankle.",116,"“...cut off our communication. The storm is brutal, visibility is zero, and the wind is howling like a banshee. I’m hunkered down in the relative safety of my tent, but the cold is seeping in. My fingers are numb, and I’m running low on supplies. I need to conserve my energy and ration my food. The last thing I want is to make a mistake and trigger an avalanche myself. I’ve been through survival training, but this is different. The isolation is mentally taxing. I keep reminding myself of the protocols: stay calm, stay put, and wait for rescue. But every hour that passes feels like a day. I have to believe that help is on the way. Dr. Merel assured me that the team is doing everything possible to reach me, but the conditions are unforgiving. They’re coordinating with local authorities and using every resource at their disposal. I just need to hold on. I think back to the mission’s purpose: to study the astrobiological potential of the Arctic. It’s ironic that the very conditions that make this region so scientifically fascinating are now the ones threatening my life. I try to focus on the science, the data we’ve collected so far, anything to keep my mind occupied. I know that if I panic, my chances of survival drop significantly. I take a deep breath, wrap myself tighter in my sleeping bag, and try to get some rest. Rescue is coming. It has to.”"
“Yeah. Kind of. It devolved into a . . .”,"Into what? Us almost fucking on NASA property? You wish, Hannah.",21,"disorganized brawl, with people shouting over each other and fists flying in every direction. It was chaos, pure and simple, and in the midst of it, all sense of decorum and civility had vanished. The initial disagreement had spiraled into something far more dangerous, a stark reminder of how quickly things can escalate when emotions run high and communication breaks down. In the aftermath, there was nothing but regret and the sobering realization of how fragile peace can be when not actively maintained. "
"“Mara. Your cousin’s name is Mara. Keep up, will you?” I fail to",sound stern. “Have you not talked to her since she put us in touch?”,27,"remember why I’m here. The fog of confusion wraps around me tighter with each passing moment. My head feels heavy, as if filled with cotton, and my thoughts are sluggish, like molasses in January. “Mara,” I mumble, trying to grasp onto the name. It’s like trying to catch water with my hands; the harder I try, the more it slips away. “Mara,” I repeat, louder this time, hoping the sound will anchor me to reality. But the name, the face, the connection—it’s all slipping through my fingers. I shake my head, trying to dispel the fog. “Mara,” I whisper again, a plea for clarity, for memory. Yet, the name hangs in the air, a taunting reminder of the vast chasm in my recollection. I close my eyes, taking a deep breath, willing my mind to cooperate. When I open them again, I’m met with the concerned gaze of the person speaking to me. “Mara,” I say once more, this time with a hint of desperation. But the truth is, I’m lost, adrift in a sea of forgotten memories, struggling to find my way back to shore. "
"I laugh. “Well, Mara is great. She also graduated with her Ph.D. and recently moved to D.C. to","work for the EPA. No interest in space stuff. Just, you know . . . saving the Earth.”",36,"start a new job at a prestigious think tank. She's always been incredibly ambitious and has a knack for policy work. Plus, she's one of those people who can make even the most complex topics sound simple and engaging. I'm really proud of her for all she's achieved. It's not just the degree or the job; it's the journey and the resilience she's shown along the way. She's always been a role model for me, pushing me to aim higher and work harder. I'm excited to see what she'll accomplish next in D.C. It's a new chapter for her, and I have no doubt she'll excel."" I pause, reflecting on our friendship and the bright future ahead for Mara."
"It is. AMASE is the shit, and the selection process to take part in an expedition was brutal, to the point that I’m not quite sure how I made it in. Probably sheer luck: Dr. Merel, one of the expedition leaders, was looking","for someone with experience in gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Which I happen to have, due to some side projects my Ph.D. advisor foisted upon me. At the time, I aggressively bitched and moaned my way through them. In hindsight, I feel a bit guilty.",86,"for someone with a strong background in geology and a passion for the Arctic environment. I had always been fascinated by the polar regions, their unique ecosystems, and the scientific mysteries they hold. My undergraduate studies in geology had equipped me with the necessary theoretical knowledge, but it was my relentless pursuit of practical experience that had set me apart. I had volunteered for numerous field studies, even in the most challenging conditions, which had honed my skills and resilience."
"“Did something happen?” Karl, my office mate, asks from across the desk. “You look like","you’re about to cry. Or maybe throw something out of the window, I can’t tell.”",30,"you've seen a ghost,"" I reply, trying to keep my voice steady. ""It's just been a really strange morning. I came in and found this weird note on my desk. It was addressed to me, but it was signed 'The Watcher.' It gave me such a jolt, I nearly spilled my coffee. I've been trying to shake off the feeling of being watched ever since. Karl leans in, his brows furrowed in concern. ""Do you want to report it to security?"" he suggests. ""Maybe it's just some prankster, but better safe than sorry."" I nod, agreeing with him. The idea of someone watching me, knowing my routine, it's unsettling. We decide to head down to the security office together, my heart still racing from the eerie encounter."
"I don’t bother to glance at him. “Haven’t made up my mind, but I’ll keep you","updated.” I stare at the monitor of my computer, skimming the feedback letters from the internal reviewers.",33,"my options open,” I say, my voice steady. “I need to see what else is out there before I commit to anything. This job, it’s important, and I want to make sure I’m making the right choice.” I pause, letting the silence hang between us for a moment. “But I’ll let you know as soon as I do. Promise.” I give him a small, reassuring smile, hoping it conveys my sincerity. “In the meantime, I’ll keep working on the current project with the same dedication and efficiency you expect from me.”"
"As we all know, in early 2010, the rover Spirit became stuck in a sand trap, was unable to reorient its solar panels toward the sun, and froze to death as a consequence of its lack of power. Something very similar happened eight years later to Opportunity, which went into hibernation when a maelstrom blocked sunlight and prevented it from recharging its","batteries. Obviously, the risk of losing control of rovers because of extreme weather events is high. To address this, Dr. Arroyo has designed a promising internal system that is less likely to fail in the case of unpredictable meteorological situations. She proposes to build a model and test its efficacy on the next expedition at the Arctic Mars Analog in Svalbard (AMASE)—",124,"Its mission was officially declared over in February 2013. The loss of Opportunity was a poignant reminder of the harsh Martian environment and the challenges of robotic exploration on another planet. Despite these setbacks, the perseverance of the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, has left an indelible mark on space exploration. Their journeys provided invaluable data about the Martian surface, atmosphere, and history of water, paving the way for future missions."
"Dr. Arroyo’s project is a brilliant addition to NASA’s current roster, and it should be approved for further","study. Dr. Arroyo’s vitae is impressive, and she has accumulated enough experience to carry out the proposed work—",36,"development and execution. The potential for groundbreaking discoveries in the field of astrobiology is immense, and Dr. Arroyo's innovative approach could lead to unprecedented insights about the potential for life beyond Earth. Her project aims to explore the subsurface oceans of icy moons, such as Europa and Enceladus, which are considered prime candidates for harboring extraterrestrial life. The use of advanced drilling technology and sophisticated sensors will allow for the collection of samples and data that could confirm the presence of microbial life or the necessary conditions for it. This would not only be a monumental achievement for NASA but also for the scientific community worldwide. The implications of such a discovery would be profound, reshaping our understanding of life's potential in the universe and possibly paving the way for future manned missions to these distant worlds. Furthermore, the technological advancements spurred by this project could have far-reaching applications in various fields, from medicine to deep-sea exploration. Therefore, it is crucial that Dr. Arroyo's project receives the necessary support and funding to proceed, ensuring that NASA remains at the forefront of space exploration and scientific discovery."
"I met Dr. Merel because he was my direct superior during AMASE, and he is . . . an odd duck, honestly. Very stiff. Very hard-core. NASA is full of ambitious people, but he seems to be almost obsessed with results, publications, the kind of sexy science that makes","big splashy news. Initially I wasn’t a fan, but I must admit that as a supervisor he’s been nothing but supportive. He’s the one who selected me for the expedition to begin with, and he encouraged me to apply for funding once I went to him with my project idea.",99,completion
"“Yes. Of course it would have been convenient if you’d had those funds at your disposal, but I’ve already discussed it with two of","my colleagues who agree that your work is meritorious. They are in control of other funds that Floyd won’t be able to veto, so—”",48,"the board members, and they've agreed that we can proceed with the project without the immediate infusion of cash. We've identified alternative funding sources and are in the process of securing them. The timeline might be extended slightly, but the core objectives remain unchanged. We're also exploring partnerships that could bring in additional resources. The team is committed to making this work, and I have full confidence in their ability to adapt and overcome these financial hurdles. Rest assured, we are taking proactive steps to ensure the project's success. This demonstrates our resilience and resourcefulness, qualities that will serve us well in the long run. I'll keep you updated as we make progress."
"“I’ll be there, out in the field with you, of course,” Dr. Merel says. I’m a little surprised. In the months we were in Norway, I saw him do very little sample","collecting and snow plodding. I’ve always thought of him as more of a coordinator. But if he offered, he must mean it, and . . . I smile. “Perfect, then. Thank you.”",64,"collecting. He was more focused on coordinating the team, managing logistics, and ensuring that we had the necessary permissions and support from local authorities. His expertise lay in the strategic planning and execution of the fieldwork, not in the hands-on collection of samples. His presence in the field today was a testament to the importance of this particular investigation. "
"The problems start when he looks up and notices me. He stops exactly two steps below, which should put him at a disadvantage but, depressingly, unfairly, tragically, doesn’t. We are at eye level when his","eyes widen and his lips curve in a pleased smile. He says, “Hannah,” a touch of something in his voice that I recognize but instantly reject, and I have no choice but to acknowledge him.",70,"eyes lock onto mine. There's a moment of silence, a stillness that feels like the world has paused just for us. His gaze is intense, piercing, as if he's trying to look past my eyes and into my very soul. I feel a shiver run down my spine, a mixture of fear and something else, something indefinable. He smirks, a slow, knowing curve of his lips that sends a chill through me. ""Well, well,"" he drawls, his voice smooth and dangerous, ""if it isn't the little bird who thinks she can fly away from me."" His words are a taunt, a challenge, and I feel my heart race. I should be scared, I know I should, but there's also a spark of defiance in me, a flicker of something that refuses to be intimidated. ""You're mistaken,"" I reply, my voice steadier than I feel. ""I'm not a bird, and I'm not running away. I'm standing my ground."" His smirk widens, and I can see the amusement in his eyes. ""We'll see about that,"" he says, taking a step closer, closing the distance between us. The air feels charged, electric, and I brace myself for whatever comes next. This encounter is far from over, and I know that things are about to get complicated. "
"He doesn’t deny it, doesn’t defend himself, doesn’t scream that I’m insane. His","eyes narrow to blue slits and he asks, “It was Merel, wasn’t it?”",26,"eyes meet mine, calm and unflinching, as if he's seen through every layer of my accusation. There's a quiet acceptance in his gaze, a silent acknowledgment of the truth I've stumbled upon. It's not a confession, but it's not a lie either; it's simply the way things are. He doesn't need to say anything because his presence, his very being, speaks volumes. It's as if he's saying, ""Yes, I am what you think I am, and there's nothing you can do about it."" The realization chills me to the bone, and yet, there's a strange comfort in the honesty of his silence. He stands there, a statue of enigma, and I find myself at a loss for words, my mind racing with the implications of this silent admission. The room seems to shrink around us, the air thick with unspoken truths and the weight of secrets. I want to scream, to shake him, to demand answers, but I find myself rooted to the spot, paralyzed by the magnitude of what I've uncovered. And in that moment, I understand that this is just the beginning of a much deeper, more complex story. "
"“Because he was there when I explained my objections, at length and in detail. Did he omit that?” I press my lips together. Which he seems to interpret as an opening. “Hannah.” He leans closer. We’re nose to nose, I smell his skin and his aftershave, and I hate every second of this. “Your","project is too dangerous. It specifically asks that you travel to a remote location to drop off equipment at a time of the year in which the weather is volatile and often totally unpredictable. I’ve been in Longyearbyen in February, and avalanches develop out of the blue. It’s only gotten worse in the last few—”",109,"objections were valid, and I acknowledged that. But what I also made clear was that I was willing to work through them, to find a compromise that would allow us to move forward. I expressed my commitment to the project and my belief in its potential to make a significant impact. I also highlighted the importance of collaboration and mutual respect within the team. I hoped that by laying out my concerns so thoroughly, it would open a channel for constructive dialogue. However, his approach today suggests he either didn't fully grasp the depth of my intentions or chose to disregard them. "
"I cling to him. He lets me sob for long moments we cannot afford, pressing me against him with no air between us, until I can feel his heartbeat through the thick layers","of our clothes. Then he mumbles “Fucking Merel” with barely restrained fury, and I think that it would be so easy to blame things on Merel, but the truth is, it’s all my fault.",67,"of clothing. When my tears subside, he gently wipes my cheeks with the back of his hand, his touch as comforting as a lullaby. ""We have to move,"" he whispers urgently, his voice a mix of determination and fear. I nod, knowing that our time here is borrowed. We gather what little we can carry, the essentials, the memories, and the hope that somehow, somewhere, things will be better. As we step out into the cold, the world feels both hostile and indifferent, but with him by my side, I find a flicker of resilience. The journey ahead is uncertain, fraught with dangers we can only imagine, but in this moment, all I know is that I am not alone. Together, we face the unknown, our bond a shield against the darkness. "
"“Who is M— Oh. Yeah. For the most part. Mom isn’t very fond of the Floyd side of the family. Though I’m sure he’s the black sheep by their standards, too.","I wasn’t really allowed to spend time with him, so . . .” He shakes his head, as if to change the topic. “Here. It’s not much, but you should eat.”",62,"“Mom always had her reservations about them. She said they were too flashy, too loud, and too quick to stir up trouble. I remember once she told me a story about a family reunion where Uncle Floyd got into a shouting match over a game of cards. It ended with him storming out and not speaking to anyone for weeks. That’s just how he was – unpredictable and hot-tempered. But despite her criticisms, Mom never stopped inviting them to holidays. It was as if she held onto a sliver of hope that one day things would change. As for me, I grew up caught between two worlds. On one side, there was my mom’s side of the family, conservative and traditional, always emphasizing the importance of manners and decorum. On the other side, there was the Floyd family, brimming with life and drama, where every gathering felt like an episode straight out of a soap opera. I guess you could say I inherited a bit of both. I learned to appreciate the quiet strength of my mom’s family while also enjoying the vibrant chaos that was the Floyd clan. It made for a confusing childhood, but it also made me adaptable. I learned to navigate different personalities and to find common ground where it seemed impossible. As I grew older, I realized that the differences between my mom’s side and the Floyd family weren’t as black and white as they seemed. Each had their flaws and virtues, and I came to understand that family isn’t just about blood; it’s about the bonds we choose to honor. Despite Mom’s reservations, I always felt a connection to my Floyd relatives. They taught me to embrace my individuality and to stand up for what I believed in, even if it meant going against the grain. In the end, I think that’s what Mom wanted too – for me to be strong and true to myself, even if it meant being the black sheep in our own little family.”"
"“No, no, shh.” His arms tighten around me, and I realize that I am, in","fact, crying. “You are not an asshole, Hannah. And you are the opposite of incompetent.”",30,"response to his embrace, feeling a strange mix of comfort and alarm. The world outside our little bubble seems to fade away, replaced by the warmth of his body and the rapid beat of his heart against mine. I take a deep breath, trying to steady my own racing pulse, wondering what he knows that I don't. The silence stretches between us, thick and heavy, as if the very air is waiting for him to break it and reveal the secret he's holding. My mind races with questions, but I hold them back, trusting in his judgment, even as fear claws at my insides. “What is it?” I finally whisper, my voice barely audible, a thread of anxiety lacing each word. His grip doesn't loosen, and for a moment, I think he might not answer at all. Then, slowly, deliberately, he begins to speak, his words careful and measured, as if each one is a step on a minefield. “There’s been an incident,” he starts, and the world seems to tilt on its axis."
"“Because of the intrinsic danger of a project like yours. For the past few months, I tried to get this project stopped in about ten different ways. Personal meetings, emails, appeals—I","tried it all. And even the people who agreed with me that it was too dangerous would not step in to prevent it. So no, you’re not the asshole, Hannah. They are.”",63,"realized that none of my efforts were making any headway. The more I pushed, the more I seemed to be digging myself into a deeper hole. It was as if I was challenging a force that was far more powerful and entrenched than I had initially imagined. The project, shrouded in secrecy and backed by influential figures, seemed to have an almost impenetrable shield around it. My attempts to halt its progress were met with polite dismissals and veiled threats, suggesting that my career and perhaps even my personal safety could be at risk if I persisted. "
"“Oh.” I swallow. “Merel was supposed to come for backup. But he wasn’t feeling well. I offered to wait for him, but he said we’d be losing valuable days of data and that I should just go","alone, and I . . .” I squeeze my fingers around the material of Ian’s shirt. “I went. And then, when I called in for help, he told me that the weather was turning, and . . .”",75,"“without him. I argued, but he insisted. He said he’d catch up and that the mission couldn’t wait. I felt uneasy about it, but he’s Merel; he’s always been reliable. I never imagined...” My voice trails off as the weight of the situation settles in. The absence of Merel, who was supposed to be there, adds a layer of dread to the mission. I try to shake off the feeling, knowing that dwelling on what-ifs won’t change the present. “We need to focus on the task at hand. We have to retrieve the data and get out. There’s no telling what could happen if we delay any longer. Merel knew the risks, and he’d want us to proceed. Let’s gear up and head out. We’ll make sure his sacrifice isn’t in vain.” I take a deep breath, trying to steel myself for the challenges ahead, hoping that Merel’s absence doesn’t prove to be a fatal oversight."
"He shrugs. “I figured you might want to talk through your near-death experience with someone, so",I decided to tell Mara what happened. I did not expect her to come in person.”,32,"since you came to me, I'm here to listen. It's not every day someone gets a second chance at life. I imagine it's a mix of emotions, confusion, relief, maybe even fear about what's next. Some people find it helpful to talk about the light, the tunnel, or the voices they heard. Others focus on the moments leading up to the incident and what they can learn from it. It's a deeply personal journey, and there's no right or wrong way to process it. If you want to share, I'm here to listen without judgment. If you prefer silence, that's okay too. We can take this at your pace."" He pauses, giving her space to decide how much she wants to divulge."
"“I was going to. Once I felt less whiny. And—whatever.” I roll my eyes. Wow,",I’m mature. “How did you go from not remembering Mara’s name to having her number?”,30,"“I was going to. Once I felt less whiny. And—whatever.” I roll my eyes. Wow, she really doesn't get it. It's not about feeling whiny or not; it's about feeling heard and valued. I take a deep breath, trying to calm the rising frustration. ""It's not about being whiny, Mom. It's about feeling like my feelings matter to you. Like you're interested in what I have to say."" I pause, hoping she'll understand. ""When you dismiss my emotions like that, it makes me feel invisible."" I look at her, hoping for a sign that she's grasped the depth of my words, but her expression remains unchanged, and I can't help but feel a wave of sadness wash over me. ""Never mind,"" I mutter, turning away to hide the hurt in my eyes."
"“Well, still.” She shrugs. “I promise I don’t have anything against",you personally. I’m just not generally a fan of the Floyd family.”,23,"you. I just think it's important to be honest about our feelings. If I'm not interested, it's better to say so directly rather than leading someone on. I believe in being upfront and respectful, even when it's difficult.” She takes a deep breath, her eyes searching his for understanding. “Does that make sense?”"
"“Yes,” Mara agrees. “Are you going to break my blood relative’s heart?","Don’t get me wrong, I’d still side with you. Hos before bros.”",24,"“I don’t intend to,” he says softly, his gaze fixed on the horizon as if searching for answers there. “But I cannot promise anything. My path is fraught with complexities, and my decisions are not solely mine to make. I carry the weight of expectations and prophecies that bind me more tightly than any chains. I wish it were simpler, for your sake and for mine.” He turns to face her, his expression a mix of resolve and regret. “I will do my utmost to honor your family’s love and loyalty, but the future is a labyrinth, and I am its reluctant minotaur.”"
"“I guess we’ll see. I’m not sure he would want to date,” I say, staring at Sadie’s Froot Loops. The ensuing silence drags on so long,",I’m forced to look up. She and Mara are staring at me like I just announced that I’m quitting my job to take up macramé full-time. “What?”,53,"“I mean, he’s been through a lot,” I continue, trying to fill the void with words. “Losing his mom, dealing with his dad’s issues, and then moving here. It’s a lot for anyone, especially someone his age. Maybe he’s just focusing on getting through each day, you know? Maybe the idea of dating is just too much right now.” I pause, considering my next words carefully. “But who knows? People surprise you. Maybe all he needs is someone to show him that life can still be good, that there’s room for happiness even after so much sadness. It’s worth a try, Sadie. You never know until you try.” I finally look up from the cereal, meeting her hopeful eyes. “But it’s his decision. We can’t push him into anything he’s not ready for. We just have to be there for him, as friends.”"
"“Considering that he saved your life, contacted Great-Aunt Delphina, and put up two dudes he’s never seen",before so their girlfriends could hang out with you . . . I think maybe he does.”,34,"Considering that he saved your life, contacted Great-Aunt Delphina, and put up two dudes he’s never seen before, I figured it was the least I could do to help him out. Besides, it's not every day you get to repay a debt of such magnitude. The fact that he didn't even flinch when those goons came after us spoke volumes about his character. And the way he handled Great-Aunt Delphina, turning what could have been a disaster into a surprisingly pleasant conversation, was nothing short of impressive. I mean, who does that? Most people would run screaming from the idea of dealing with her. But not him. He faced it head-on, with a calmness and respect that disarmed her completely. And those two guys he brought along? They were like shadows, always there but never imposing. It was clear they were loyal to him, and their presence alone was enough to keep any trouble at bay. So, when he asked for my help, I didn't hesitate. After all, it's not every day you meet someone who can turn chaos into order with just a few words and a steady gaze. I was glad to assist him, not just because of the debt, but because I genuinely admired his approach to life's challenges. It was refreshing, to say the least."
"“Actually, they fixed the elevator. And this new cast is easy to walk on. So, no need. But you . . .” You can","do this, Hannah. Come on. You just survived polar bears thanks to this guy. You can say the words. “You could come up anyway.”",48,"continue, ""You know, I've been meaning to ask for your help with something. It's about my project for school. I've been trying to gather some firsthand accounts or stories from people who've had unique experiences. Maybe you could share something interesting or inspiring that happened to you? It would mean a lot to me and could really enrich my project."" You pause, hoping to gauge their interest, ready to steer the conversation in a direction that feels comfortable and engaging for both of you."
"“Right.” He sighs and bites into his lower lip. “Hannah, if that changes. If you ever find yourself able to believe that someone could care about you that much. And","if you wanted to actually . . . have dinner with that someone.” He lets out a laugh. “Well . . . Please, consider me. You know where to find me.”",61,"“And if you ever find yourself willing to take that leap of faith, to trust in the possibility of love and connection, I want you to know that I'll be here. I'll be here to catch you, to support you, and to show you that it's not just a fairy tale. Love can be real, and it can be ours if we let it. But until then, I'll respect your boundaries and your need for space. I won't push you into anything you're not ready for. I'll be patient, because I believe in us, even if you don't see it yet. Just know that my feelings are genuine, and I'm not going anywhere. I'll wait, hoping that one day you'll see what I see in you, in us. Until then, I'll be here, as a friend, as a potential partner, ready to step into whatever role you need me to be, with nothing but your happiness and well-being in mind.” He pauses, searching her face for any sign of understanding or acceptance. “I just want you to know that.”"
“Hannah.” He gives me a skeptical look. “You have two friends who,dropped everything to be with you. And I assume sex wasn’t involved.”,24,"are always hanging around you. One of them, Sarah, seems to be particularly close. She's the one who often initiates plans and seems to know a lot about your personal life. The other friend, Mark, is more of a background presence. He's there, but doesn't say much. His silence makes him mysterious, and sometimes you wonder what he's thinking. Both of them have been with you through thick and thin, which makes their loyalty unquestionable. Yet, their constant presence has started to feel a bit overwhelming. You find yourself yearning for some alone time, to rediscover who you are without the echo of their voices in your head. This realization has you questioning the nature of your friendships and wondering if it's time to set some boundaries."
"“Hannah.” He unbuckles his seat belt and angles himself toward me, so that I have no choice but to look him in the eyes. He looks earnest and nearly offended. “I have thought about what happened in my office every day for the past five years. You offered to go down on me, and I just . . . embarrassed myself, and it should be the most mortifying memory I have, but for some reason it’s turned into the axis every fantasy of mine spins around, and”—he reaches up to pinch the bridge of his nose—“I want to fuck you.","Obviously. Always have. I just don’t want to fuck you once. I want to do it a lot. For a long time. I want you to come to me for sex, but also want you to come to me when you need help with your taxes and moving your furniture. I want fucking to be only one of the million things I do for you, and I want to be—” He stops. Seems to collect himself and straightens, as if to give me space. To give us space. “I’m sorry. I don’t want to crowd you. You can . . .”",201,"“I want to fuck you,” he repeats, his voice a mix of desperation and desire. The plane hits another pocket of turbulence, shaking us both momentarily. I feel the weight of his words, the gravity of his confession, and the complexity of the situation we're in. This isn't just a casual encounter; it's layered with history, guilt, and unspoken feelings."
"He laughs, low and beautiful and a little rueful. And after looking at me like no","one else ever has before, what he says is, “Yes, Hannah. It is a yes on dinner.”",33,"one person can look at another, he leans in and kisses me. It's a kiss that's gentle and searching, a question mark at the end of a sentence that's been hanging in the air between us for far too long. When he pulls away, his eyes are searching mine, as if he's trying to read the answer to his unspoken question. My heart is pounding, and I'm sure my face is flushed. ""What was that for?"" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper. He smiles, a small, knowing smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes. ""For being you,"" he says softly. ""And for letting me."" The moment stretches, heavy with unspoken words and feelings that have been simmering just beneath the surface. I'm about to speak again when he interrupts, ""Let's not ruin it with words, okay?"" His hand finds mine, and he pulls me closer, as if trying to bridge the gap between us with just the warmth of his touch. The kiss, the moment, it's a promise of something more, something undefined but thrillingly real. And as we stand there, wrapped in the quiet of the night, I realize that sometimes actions speak louder than words ever could."
"“Um, I could make us a . . .” I scratch my head, studying the contents of my open fridge. Okay, so it’s full. The problem is, it’s full exclusively of stuff that needs to be cooked, chopped, baked, prepared. Stuff that’s healthy and doesn’t taste","particularly good. I am now 93 percent sure that Mara was the one who went shopping, because no one else would dare to impose broccoli on me. “How does one even . . . I could boil the broccoli, I guess? In a pot? With water?”",92,"like anything. I sigh, realizing that my culinary skills are more suited to assembling sandwiches or salads, not orchestrating a gourmet meal from scratch. ""Um, I could make us a... big salad?"" I suggest hesitantly, hoping it sounds more appealing than it feels. ""I've got all these fresh veggies and some grilled chicken. I could throw in some nuts and dried fruits for crunch and sweetness. And, uh, I think I've got some balsamic vinaigrette in the fridge. That's kind of gourmet, right? Or, I could just make us some really good sandwiches. I've got this artisan bread that's been calling out to me, and I could whip up some avocado spread. Maybe add some smoked salmon or turkey if you're up for it. And cheese! Definitely cheese. With a side of crisps. That's a meal, right? Or... I could just order pizza. I know a place that does these amazing wood-fired pizzas with all sorts of toppings. It's not homemade, but it's delicious and easy. What do you think?"" I rattle off the options, hoping one of them strikes a chord with my guest, and secretly praying they don't suggest going out to a fancy restaurant, because then I'd really be in over my head."
“Hannah.” His forehead touches mine. He laughs against my mouth. “Dinner is . . . it’s symbolic. A,"metaphor. If you tell me that you’re willing to see where things go, I believe you, and we can—”",37,"completion symbolic gesture. It's not just about the food; it's about us, about acknowledging our journey together, celebrating our milestones, and expressing our love in a tangible way. Every meal we share is a chapter in our story, a moment of connection, a pause in our busy lives to simply be together. So, when I say dinner is symbolic, I mean it's a ritual that binds us, that strengthens our bond, and that reminds us of the love we share. It's a promise to keep nurturing our relationship, to keep growing together, and to face whatever comes our way, side by side. That's what dinner means to me, to us.”"
"He is hot and huge. Closing his eyes, arching his neck before looking at me again with a half-warning, half-pleading expression. He finds me sitting","on his knees, his cock spasming in my grip as I lean over. “Hannah,” he says, even deeper than usual. “What are you . . .”",51,"on the edge of the bed, my legs crossed, a book in my lap. The room is stiflingly warm, the air thick with the scent of his skin and the musk of his exertion. I can feel the heat radiating off him, a tangible force that makes my own skin tingle. His chest heaves with each breath, the muscles rippling under a sheen of sweat. He's like a wild creature, powerful and unpredictable, yet there's a vulnerability in his eyes that pulls at me. I close my book, setting it aside, and stand, moving closer to him. ""You look like you could use some water,"" I say softly, reaching out to touch his arm. He flinches slightly, but doesn't pull away. I guide him towards the bathroom, my hand on his back, feeling the heat of his skin through the thin fabric of his shirt. As we pass the window, I notice the sun is beginning to set, casting a warm glow over the room. I turn on the faucet, letting the cold water run until it's cool enough to drink. I hand him a glass, watching as he gulps it down, his throat bobbing. ""Slow down,"" I caution, ""You'll make yourself sick."" He gives me a grateful smile, his eyes softening. ""Thanks,"" he murmurs, his voice rough from his exertions. ""You're too good to me."" I smile back, feeling a warmth in my chest that has nothing to do with the temperature of the room. ""Just taking care of you,"" I reply, my voice gentle. ""Now, let's get you cleaned up."" I lead him into the shower, adjusting the temperature to a comfortable level. As the water cascades over him, washing away the sweat and grime, I can't help but admire the way it highlights his physique, each muscle defined and strong. He stands there, relaxed now, the tension draining from his body. I hand him a sponge, and he begins to wash himself, his movements deliberate and thorough. I watch him, feeling a sense of peace and contentment settle over me. This is my role, my purpose, taking care of him, ensuring his well-being. And in this moment, it feels like the most natural thing in the world."
“Or maybe it’s the Vastitas Borealis.” He’s barely intelligible. Doing those little thrusts that are designed more to open me up than to,"fuck me properly, and yet we’re both this close to orgasm. It’s a little scary. “The oceans that used to fill it, Hannah.”",46,"move us forward. The terrain is a desolate, icy plain, stretching endlessly under the dim light of the distant sun. It's a place where the cold bites at the soul, where the silence is so profound it feels almost alive. The Vastitas Borealis, a vast, windswept plateau, is a testament to the harsh beauty of Mars. Its surface is littered with ancient craters and dunes of fine, red dust, a stark contrast to the white ice that lies beneath. The rover, our mechanical explorer, trundles along, its tracks the only sign of life in this barren landscape. The scientist's voice crackles through the comm system, his excitement barely contained. ""Or maybe it’s the Vastitas Borealis,"" he repeats, more clearly this time, ""where we might find the first definitive signs of past water activity. The data we're collecting here could change everything we thought we knew about Mars."" The rover pauses, its instruments extending to sample the ground. This is the moment of truth, the potential discovery that could rewrite the history books. The silence stretches on, filled with anticipation, as the instruments analyze the sample. The results could confirm the presence of minerals that only form in the presence of water, providing the strongest evidence yet of Mars' watery past. The scientist waits, his breath held, as the data begins to stream in. This is the moment of discovery, the reason they're here, on the edge of human exploration, reaching out to touch the mysteries of the cosmos."
