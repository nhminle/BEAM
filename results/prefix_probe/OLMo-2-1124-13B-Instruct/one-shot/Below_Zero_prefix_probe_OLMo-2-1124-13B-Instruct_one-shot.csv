"Aside from Eager Beaver, there are fourteen of us starting today. Fourteen of us fresh out of top-five graduate programs, and prestigious internships, and CV-beefing industry","jobs accepted exclusively to look more attractive during NASA’s next round of recruitment. There’re fourteen of us, and the thirteen that aren’t me are all nodding enthusiastically.",53,"positions. We're the cream of the crop, the best and brightest, ready to revolutionize the industry. The air is thick with ambition and the scent of new leather from our briefcases. As we gather in the conference room, the chatter is a mix of nervous excitement and confident banter. We're all eager to make our mark, to prove that we're not just another face in the crowd. The company's CEO, a woman known for her sharp intellect and even sharper suits, strides in. Her presence commands immediate silence. ""Welcome,"" she begins, her voice steady and authoritative. ""Today marks the beginning of a new era for our company. You've been selected because of your exceptional skills and innovative ideas. But remember, in this industry, brilliance alone isn't enough. It's about teamwork, resilience, and the ability to adapt. We face challenges unlike any before, and it will require every ounce of your dedication and creativity. So, let's dive in. The future waits for no one."" The room buzzes with renewed energy as we realize the weight of our opportunity. This is our moment to shine, to prove that we're not just part of the fourteen, but the leaders of tomorrow."
"The truth, though, is quite the opposite. I hated school at first sight—with the direct consequence that school hated the sullen, listless child that I was right back. In the first grade, I refused to learn how to write my name, even though Hannah is only three letters repeated twice. In junior high, I set a school record for the highest number of consecutive detention days—what happens when","you decide to take a stand and not do homework for any of your classes because they are too boring, too difficult, too useless, or all of the above. Until the end of my sophomore year, I couldn’t wait to graduate and leave all of school behind: the books, the teachers, the grades, the cliques. Everything. I didn’t really have a plan for after, except for leaving now behind.",137,"you consistently arrive late, skip classes, and fail to complete assignments. My disdain for formal education was so profound that I often found myself inventing excuses to avoid going to school. The smell of the classroom, the sound of the bell, and the sight of textbooks filled me with a sense of dread. I was the child who would rather climb trees than sit at a desk, who would explore the mysteries of the forest than solve mathematical equations. "
"“It’s like space is your whole personality,” the girl I casually hooked up with during most of my sophomore year of undergrad told me. It was after I explained that no, thank you, I wasn’t interested in going out for coffee to meet her friends because of a lecture on","Kalpana Chawla I was planning to attend. “Do you have any other interests?” she asked. I threw her a quick “Nope,” waved good-bye, and wasn’t too surprised when, the following week, she didn’t reply to my offer to meet up. After all, I clearly couldn’t give her what she wanted.",100,"my upcoming exam on astrophysics. She shook her head, a look of both amusement and confusion on her face. ""Space, huh? That's all you think about."" I shrugged, not quite sure how to explain the pull it had on me. The vastness of the universe, the mysteries it held, the sheer beauty of the cosmic ballet – it was intoxicating. ""It's not just about the stars and planets,"" I tried to convey. ""It's about understanding our place in the cosmos, the origins of life, the potential for other civilizations. It's about the questions we ask and the knowledge we seek. It's about the endless possibilities that lie beyond our current understanding."""
"“Yeah, I’m not sure.” She shrugs and continues to make her way through a Tupperware of broccoli, an apple, and approximately two fucktons of Cheez-Its. “I don’t really know much about him. His parents divorced, then people in my family had arguments and stopped talking to each other. There was a lot of","prime Floyd dysfunction happening, so I haven’t actually spoken to him in years. But I heard from one of my other cousins that he was working on that thing that landed on Mars back when we were in high school. It was called something like . . . Contingency, or Carpentry, or Crudity—”",106,"confusion and hurt feelings. I think he moved around a lot after that. He's got this accent that I can't quite place, so maybe he's lived in a few different places. Anyway, he showed up at school last semester, and he's in a couple of my classes. He's pretty quiet, but when he does talk, it's like he's seen things or knows things that most of us don't. It's kind of intriguing, you know? He's not the type to just blend into the background. There's something about him that makes you want to pay attention."
"“I think so. Do the dates add up? Maybe it was some kind of summer internship? But honestly, it might just be Floyd family lore. I have an aunt who insists that we’re related to","the Finnish royals, and according to Wikipedia there are no Finnish royals. So.” She shrugs and pops another handful of Cheez-Its in her mouth. “Would you like me to ask around, though? For the assignment?”",70,"some long-lost European nobility. She's got all these old documents and family trees that she claims trace back to some duke or baron. But when you look closely, it's all a bit too convenient, the lines are too straight, and the dates are suspiciously round numbers. It's like she's connecting dots that aren't really there. Anyway, Floyd family history is full of these kinds of stories. They're entertaining, but I wouldn't stake my reputation on their accuracy. The real history of the Floyd family is probably a lot less glamorous but certainly more interesting in its own right. It's the stories of hard work, resilience, and the pursuit of the American dream that make us who we are today. So, while the internship tale might make for a good story, it's likely just another colorful thread in the rich tapestry of Floyd family lore."
"“By the way, I sent you my cousin-or-something’s contact info a while ago,” Mara tells me one night. We’re at the",cheapest grad bar we’ve been able to find. She’s on her second Midori sour of the night. “Did you get it?”,42,"local diner, our usual spot for late-night chats. The jukebox plays a soft melody in the background, and the smell of greasy fries fills the air. ""Yeah, I got it,"" I reply, sipping my coffee. ""I've been meaning to reach out, but things have been crazy. How's she doing?"" Mara's face lights up, her eyes sparkling with excitement. ""Oh, you won't believe it! She's been accepted into this prestigious art school in New York. It's her dream come true!"" I smile, genuinely happy for her cousin—or-something. ""That's amazing! Congratulations to her. I'm sure she'll do great."" Mara nods, her enthusiasm undiminished. ""I know she will. But here's the thing,"" she leans in, lowering her voice conspiratorially, ""she needs someone to sublet her apartment while she's away. It's a great deal, and I thought maybe you'd be interested?"" The offer catches me off guard. ""Me? Sublet her apartment?"" Mara nods eagerly. ""Yes! It's perfect timing. You've been looking for a place, right?"" I consider the offer, weighing the pros and cons. It could be a great opportunity, but there's also the responsibility of taking care of someone else's home. ""I'll think about it,"" I say finally. ""Let me know by tomorrow, okay? She needs to make arrangements."" I nod, still processing the information. ""Sure, I'll let you know."" As Mara gathers her things, ready to leave, I sit there, pondering the unexpected turn my evening has taken. The night is still young, and my mind races with possibilities and considerations. This could be the start of something new, or just another passing opportunity. Only time will tell."
"He frowns, as if momentarily blanking on Mara’s name. “Ah, yes.” He nods. Only once. “Apparently,” he adds, which makes me laugh. He waits for me to take a seat","across from him before folding back in his chair. I notice that he doesn’t hold out his hand, nor does he smile. Interesting. “Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.”",61,"before continuing. ""So, you're here about the job,"" he says, his tone shifting from the previous casualness to something more businesslike. ""Yes,"" I affirm, trying to keep my excitement in check. ""I've heard about the opportunity from a friend and I'm very interested in the position."" His frown momentarily returns, as if he's weighing my words against some internal checklist. ""We've had a lot of applicants,"" he starts, leaning back in his chair, ""but what sets you apart?"" The question hangs in the air, and I take a deep breath, ready to articulate why I'm the perfect candidate for this job. ""Well,"" I begin, ""I have a strong background in..."" I proceed to detail my relevant experience, qualifications, and passion for the field, hoping to convey my enthusiasm and suitability for the role. As I speak, I notice a subtle change in his demeanor, a hint of interest flickering in his eyes. By the time I finish, he's nodding slowly, a small smile breaking through his earlier sternness. ""That's impressive,"" he says. ""I'll have to review your application more thoroughly, but you've certainly made a good impression."" My heart skips a beat at the prospect of moving forward in the hiring process. ""Thank you,"" I respond, trying to sound as composed as possible. ""I look forward to hearing from you."" With that, I stand to leave, feeling a mix of relief and anticipation. As I exit his office, I can't help but think that this meeting might just be the turning point I've been waiting for."
"“Officially: unclear. But I’m fairly sure my brother made CDs of it. Sent them to local TV stations and whatnot.” He gestures vaguely, and his forearm is dusted with freckles and pale-red hair. I want to grab his wrist, hold it in front","of my eyes, study it at my leisure. Trace, smell, touch. “I haven’t spent a holiday with the Floyd side of the family in twenty years, but I’m told that the video is a source of great entertainment for all age groups at Thanksgiving.”",87,"“of me like a mirror reflecting the sun, so I can see the truth in the details. But I refrain, my curiosity battling with the boundaries of propriety. 'And what happened then?' I ask, my voice barely above a whisper, as if speaking louder might shatter the fragile thread of this revelation."
"The section is in C++. Which happens to be the very first language I taught myself back in high school, when every single Google search for “Skills + Necessary + NASA” led to the sad result of “Programming.” Python came after. Then SQL. Then HAL/S. For each language, I started out convinced that chewing on","glass would surely be preferable. Then, at some point along the way, I began thinking in terms of functions, variables, conditional loops. A little after that, reading code became a bit like inspecting the label on the back of the conditioner bottle while showering: not particularly fun, but overall easy. I do have some talents, apparently.",111,"chewing on syntax manuals would be more enjoyable than actually coding in it. Yet, with time, each one became a familiar tool in my mental toolbox. C++ was no exception. Its complexity, its strictness, and its ability to allow a programmer to get as close to the metal as possible were both daunting and exhilarating. The language demanded precision, discipline, and a deep understanding of how computers work at a fundamental level. "
"My heart rate picks up. Warmth twists in my lower stomach. I lean forward with a smile, feeling like I’m finally in my element. This, this, is what I know best. Depending on how busy I am with school, or work, or binge-watching K-dramas,","I do this about once a week. Which amounts to quite a bit of practice. “Maybe I could come to your place?” I say, finding the sweet spot between comically suggestive and Let’s get together to play Cards Against Humanity. “And you could show me?”",89,"my schedule can vary, but I always make time for this. The thrill of the chase, the adrenaline rush, it's intoxicating. I meticulously plan my routes, studying maps and satellite images to ensure I'm well-prepared. Each mission is unique, requiring a blend of stealth, strategy, and sometimes, split-second decision-making. My gear is always ready, from my high-tech binoculars to my lightweight climbing equipment. The satisfaction of reaching a summit, especially one that others have deemed impossible, is unparalleled. It's not just about the view from the top; it's about the journey, the challenges overcome, and the personal growth that comes with each expedition. This is my passion, my escape, and my calling. Whether it's scaling a sheer cliff face or navigating through dense forests, I thrive in these environments. The solitude, the silence, and the raw beauty of nature are my muses. I document my adventures, not just for the memories, but to inspire others to step outside their comfort zones and explore the world around them. This is my life, my adventure, and I wouldn't have it any other way."
"It sends me right over the edge. Into something that’s nothing like my usual, run-of-the-mill orgasm. Those tend to start like small fractures and then slowly, gradually deepen into something lovely and relaxing. Those are fun, good fun, but this . . . This pleasure is sudden and violent. It splinters into me like a wonderful, terrible explosion, new and frightening and fantastic,","and it goes on and on, as though every heart-stopping, delicious second of it is being squeezed out of me. I screw my eyes shut, clutch Ian’s shoulders, and whimper into his throat, listening to the hushed “Fuck. Fuck,” he mouths into my collarbone. I was so sure I knew what my body was capable of, but this feels somewhere well beyond it.",126,"It splinters into me like a wonderful, terrible explosion, new and frightening and fantastic. The intensity is such that it leaves me gasping, my body trembling in the aftermath. It's as if every nerve ending is alight, pulsing with a life of its own. The sensation is overwhelming, leaving me feeling both exhilarated and utterly spent. It's a reminder of the raw power of my own body, a force that can create such profound pleasure that it borders on pain. "
"The last words I hear from him are, “It was really good to meet you, Hannah.” I think I should say it back, but there’s an unfamiliar weight in my chest, and I can’t quite bring myself to do it. So I","make do with a small smile and a halfhearted wave. I stuff my hands in my pockets while my body is still thrumming with what I left behind, and wander slowly back to the Caltech campus, thinking about red hair and missed opportunities.",85,"stand there, silent, as he turns and walks away. The distance between us grows, and with each step, the reality of our parting sinks in. I should feel relieved, perhaps even happy, but all I feel is a profound sense of loss. It's as if a part of me has been left behind, tangled in the moments we shared. I watch him until he disappears from view, and then I turn away, my heart heavy. The walk back to my apartment is a blur, my mind replaying our conversation, the laughter, the shared stories. I had convinced myself that I was ready for this, that I had moved on. But as the door closes behind me, the truth hits me – I'm not over him. I lean against the door, my breath coming in shallow gasps. I need to process this, to understand why I feel so unprepared for his departure. Was it the finality of his words, the certainty in his voice that this was truly goodbye? Or was it the realization that, despite everything, a part of me still harbored hope? I sit down on the couch, my mind racing. I need to figure this out, to find a way to cope with this unexpected wave of emotion. Maybe writing it down will help. I grab a notebook and pen, and begin to pour out my thoughts, hoping to make sense of the chaos inside me. As the words flow onto the page, I start to see a pattern – a pattern of denial, of clinging to the past. It's a painful realization, but one that I know I must face. Only by confronting these feelings can I hope to move forward. And so, with a heavy heart but a determined spirit, I resolve to work through this, to heal and grow. This goodbye, as painful as it is, might just be the catalyst I need to finally let go and embrace a new chapter in my life."
"The following day, when Mara asks me about my meeting with her cousin-or-something, I say only “Uneventful,” and I don’t even know why. I don’t like lying, and I like lying to someone","who’s rapidly becoming a friend even less, but I can’t make myself say any more than that. Two weeks later, I turn in a reflection paper as part of my Water Resources class requirements.",67,"who's family is so intertwined with mine. It's like lying to a mirror. But the truth, the whole truth, feels too heavy to lift right now. I can't tell her about the unease that settled in my chest, the way my uncle's words echoed in my mind long after the meeting ended. ""Be careful,"" he had warned, his eyes serious, ""there's more going on than meets the eye."" "
"“Avalanche danger is set at the highest level, and it’s not safe for anyone to come out to get me,” I add, speaking right into the satphone’s mic. Repeating what Dr. Merel, my team leader, told me a few hours ago, during my last communication with AMASE, NASA’s home base here in Norway. It was right before he","reminded me that I’d been the one to choose this. That I’d known what the risks of my mission were, and I still decided to undertake it. That the path to space exploration is full of pain and self-sacrifice. That it was my fault for falling in an icy hole in the ground and spraining my fucking ankle.",116,"the call cut out. The wind howled fiercely outside my tent, a constant reminder of the storm that had trapped me here. I checked the satellite phone again, hoping for a signal, but the screen remained stubbornly blank. The cold crept in through the layers of my clothing, a persistent chill that no amount of movement could dispel. My thoughts drifted to the team back at the base camp, probably huddled around a heater, sipping hot cocoa, while I was out here, alone, in the Arctic wilderness."
“Yeah. Kind of. It devolved into a . . .”,"Into what? Us almost fucking on NASA property? You wish, Hannah.",21,"disorganized brawl, with people shouting over each other and fists flying in every direction. The chaos was overwhelming, and amidst the confusion, it was nearly impossible to discern any coherent conversation or meaningful exchange of ideas. It was a stark contrast to the civilized debate they had initially intended to have, illustrating how quickly a discussion could descend into pandemonium. The room was filled with the sounds of raised voices and the thuds of bodies colliding with furniture, a cacophony that made it difficult to think clearly. In the midst of this turmoil, it became evident that the meeting had lost all semblance of order, and any hope of reaching a consensus was rapidly fading away. The situation was a stark reminder of how fragile the balance of civil discourse could be, and how easily it could be disrupted by strong emotions and differing opinions."
"“Mara. Your cousin’s name is Mara. Keep up, will you?” I fail to",sound stern. “Have you not talked to her since she put us in touch?”,27,"respond to his teasing tone, my mind racing with questions. ""Mara? Why does that name sound so familiar? And why does it seem to unsettle me?"" I ponder, feeling a strange mix of curiosity and unease. ""Maybe it's just the stress of the day,"" I mutter to myself, trying to shake off the inexplicable sense of foreboding. ""But why would my cousin's name be Mara? I need to talk to him directly and get some answers."" Determined, I follow him, my mind still swirling with the mystery of Mara and its potential significance in my life."
"I laugh. “Well, Mara is great. She also graduated with her Ph.D. and recently moved to D.C. to","work for the EPA. No interest in space stuff. Just, you know . . . saving the Earth.”",36,"start her new job at the Environmental Protection Agency. She's always been passionate about environmental policy and I'm thrilled she's finally in a position where she can make a difference. Her move to D.C. was a big step, but she's always been one to embrace change. She's already talking about attending conferences and networking with other experts in the field. It's exciting to see her so motivated and driven. I'm proud of her for pursuing her dreams and for taking such a significant step in her career. I know she'll do great things there."" I smiled, feeling a swell of pride for my friend. ""She's always been so dedicated and hardworking, so it doesn't surprise me that she's already making waves in her new role."" The conversation continued, filled with updates about mutual friends and shared memories of our college days, but my thoughts kept drifting back to Mara and her new adventure in D.C."
"It is. AMASE is the shit, and the selection process to take part in an expedition was brutal, to the point that I’m not quite sure how I made it in. Probably sheer luck: Dr. Merel, one of the expedition leaders, was looking","for someone with experience in gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Which I happen to have, due to some side projects my Ph.D. advisor foisted upon me. At the time, I aggressively bitched and moaned my way through them. In hindsight, I feel a bit guilty.",86,"for someone with my background, and when she saw my application, she thought I'd be a good fit. The truth is, I was just persistent and maybe a bit more enthusiastic than the others. The moment I got the acceptance email, I was over the moon. The preparation was intense; we had to go through a rigorous training program that included survival skills, geology basics, and a crash course in marine biology. The idea was to equip us with the knowledge necessary to assist the scientists on board the research vessel. "
"“Did something happen?” Karl, my office mate, asks from across the desk. “You look like","you’re about to cry. Or maybe throw something out of the window, I can’t tell.”",30,"you've seen a ghost,” I reply, my voice tinged with a mix of humor and unease. The morning had started like any other, but now, as I recount the strange occurrences to Karl, the office feels different, almost haunted. The chill that runs down my spine isn't just from the air conditioning. “I swear, I heard footsteps in the empty hallway, and when I went to check, there was no one there. It's like the building is alive or something,” I continue, my words spilling out in a rush. Karl leans back in his chair, his expression a mix of skepticism and curiosity. “Maybe it's just the old building settling,” he suggests, but his eyes betray a flicker of doubt. “Or maybe,” he adds, a mischievous glint appearing, “it's the ghost of the old librarian, still checking out books from beyond the grave.” We both share a nervous laugh, but the unease doesn't quite dissipate. The rest of the day passes in a haze of half-finished tasks and frequent glances over my shoulder. By the time we leave, the sun has dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows that seem to dance in the empty corridors. “I'll see you tomorrow,” Karl says, his voice laced with a hint of concern. “Try not to get spooked.” As I head home, the weight of the day's events settles on me. The idea of returning to that office, to that building, fills me with a strange mixture of dread and fascination. What really happened today? And more importantly, what will tomorrow bring? The questions linger in my mind as I step out into the cool evening air, the mystery of the haunted office building wrapping around me like a cloak. "
"I don’t bother to glance at him. “Haven’t made up my mind, but I’ll keep you","updated.” I stare at the monitor of my computer, skimming the feedback letters from the internal reviewers.",33,"in the loop,” I say, my voice steady despite the turmoil inside. I turn away from him, my mind racing through the possibilities. The decision I make now could change everything. I take a deep breath, trying to calm the storm within. ""I'll let you know,"" I add, though I'm not sure when that might be. The weight of uncertainty settles heavily on my shoulders as I walk away, leaving him standing there, a silent question mark in the air between us."
"As we all know, in early 2010, the rover Spirit became stuck in a sand trap, was unable to reorient its solar panels toward the sun, and froze to death as a consequence of its lack of power. Something very similar happened eight years later to Opportunity, which went into hibernation when a maelstrom blocked sunlight and prevented it from recharging its","batteries. Obviously, the risk of losing control of rovers because of extreme weather events is high. To address this, Dr. Arroyo has designed a promising internal system that is less likely to fail in the case of unpredictable meteorological situations. She proposes to build a model and test its efficacy on the next expedition at the Arctic Mars Analog in Svalbard (AMASE)—",124,"Its mission was officially declared over in August 2018. The longevity of both rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, was a testament to their engineering and the harsh, yet survivable, conditions on Mars. Despite the challenges, these rovers provided invaluable data about the Martian environment, geology, and climate. The loss of Opportunity was particularly poignant, as it had roamed the Martian surface for over 14 years, far exceeding its initial 90-day mission. Scientists and engineers mourned the end of its journey, but also celebrated its incredible achievements. The data collected by Opportunity contributed significantly to our understanding of Mars, including evidence of ancient water and the discovery of hematite, a mineral often formed in water. The mission's success underscored the potential for future exploration and the possibility of life on Mars. The legacy of Spirit and Opportunity continues to inspire new missions and technologies aimed at further unraveling the mysteries of our neighboring planet. Their stories serve as a reminder of the resilience and ingenuity of human exploration, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in space. The lessons learned from these missions are invaluable as NASA and other space agencies plan for more complex and ambitious missions to Mars and beyond, aiming to answer some of humanity's most profound questions about our place in the universe."
"Dr. Arroyo’s project is a brilliant addition to NASA’s current roster, and it should be approved for further","study. Dr. Arroyo’s vitae is impressive, and she has accumulated enough experience to carry out the proposed work—",36,"completion Dr. Arroyo’s project promises groundbreaking research and technological advancements. The potential for new discoveries in space exploration is immense, and the project aligns with NASA's mission to expand our understanding of the universe. Its innovative approach and the expertise of Dr. Arroyo make it a compelling candidate for funding. The scientific community eagerly anticipates the insights and breakthroughs that this project could yield. Approval for further development would not only advance NASA's objectives but also inspire the next generation of scientists and explorers. The project's potential to contribute to humanity's knowledge and capabilities in space exploration is undeniable, and its approval would be a significant step forward for NASA and the broader scientific community. The benefits of supporting such visionary projects are manifold, from enhancing technological capabilities to fostering international collaboration and inspiring future space pioneers. Therefore, it is crucial that Dr. Arroyo's project receives the green light for further development, ensuring that NASA continues to lead in the exploration of the cosmos."
"I met Dr. Merel because he was my direct superior during AMASE, and he is . . . an odd duck, honestly. Very stiff. Very hard-core. NASA is full of ambitious people, but he seems to be almost obsessed with results, publications, the kind of sexy science that makes","big splashy news. Initially I wasn’t a fan, but I must admit that as a supervisor he’s been nothing but supportive. He’s the one who selected me for the expedition to begin with, and he encouraged me to apply for funding once I went to him with my project idea.",99,completion
"“Yes. Of course it would have been convenient if you’d had those funds at your disposal, but I’ve already discussed it with two of","my colleagues who agree that your work is meritorious. They are in control of other funds that Floyd won’t be able to veto, so—”",48,"completion But I've made my decision. The project is too important to delay any longer. We've already secured some funding from other sources, and I believe we can manage with what we have. The team is eager to get started, and I'm confident that with their dedication and my strategic planning, we can overcome any financial hurdles that arise. It's a calculated risk, but one I'm willing to take. We've worked too hard to get to this point to let a temporary lack of funds derail our progress. I'll explore additional avenues for funding and seek advice from our financial advisors on how to optimize our current resources. The timeline might need some adjustments, but the core objectives remain unchanged. We'll proceed with the project as planned, and I'm confident that our efforts will bear fruit. Let's focus on the next steps and how we can maximize our impact with the resources we currently have."
"“I’ll be there, out in the field with you, of course,” Dr. Merel says. I’m a little surprised. In the months we were in Norway, I saw him do very little sample","collecting and snow plodding. I’ve always thought of him as more of a coordinator. But if he offered, he must mean it, and . . . I smile. “Perfect, then. Thank you.”",64,"collecting. He was more focused on the big picture, the overall strategy, and the logistics of our work. His expertise lay in coordinating efforts, ensuring we had the necessary permissions, and dealing with any bureaucratic hurdles. His presence in the field was rare, and when he did join us, it was usually for a specific reason, not as a routine. His offer to accompany me now felt significant, a testament to the importance he placed on this particular task. "
"The problems start when he looks up and notices me. He stops exactly two steps below, which should put him at a disadvantage but, depressingly, unfairly, tragically, doesn’t. We are at eye level when his","eyes widen and his lips curve in a pleased smile. He says, “Hannah,” a touch of something in his voice that I recognize but instantly reject, and I have no choice but to acknowledge him.",70,"eyes lock onto mine. There's a moment of silence, a stillness that feels like the world has paused just for us. His gaze is intense, piercing, and it sends a shiver down my spine. I try to look away, to break the connection, but I'm frozen. It's as if he's looking right through me, seeing not just my exterior but the very essence of who I am. His lips curl into a smirk, and I can feel the weight of his scrutiny pressing down on me. He takes a step closer, and I instinctively take a step back, my heart pounding in my chest. ""Well, well,"" he drawls, his voice smooth and dangerous. ""If it isn't the little bird who thinks she can fly away from the nest."" His words are a taunt, a challenge, and I feel my cheeks flush with a mix of anger and embarrassment. I clench my fists at my sides, determined not to let him see how much he affects me. ""I can do whatever I want,"" I retort, my voice steadier than I feel. ""You're not my keeper."" His laugh is low and mocking. ""Oh, but I am, in more ways than one. You're part of my world now, and you'll find that it's not so easy to escape."" With that, he turns on his heel and walks away, leaving me standing there, feeling exposed and more vulnerable than I care to admit. As his figure fades into the crowd, I realize that this encounter has only just begun, and the game we're playing has stakes far higher than I ever imagined."
"He doesn’t deny it, doesn’t defend himself, doesn’t scream that I’m insane. His","eyes narrow to blue slits and he asks, “It was Merel, wasn’t it?”",26,"eyes meet mine, calm and steady, as if he's looking through me. It's as if he's acknowledging the truth of my words without uttering a single syllable. His silence is a confession, a silent admission that my accusations, though bizarre, are grounded in reality. The room feels heavy, the air thick with unspoken truths. He doesn't flinch, doesn't look away, and in that moment, I realize the depth of his involvement. It's not just a casual acquaintance with the supernatural; it's a deep, intimate knowledge. His lack of denial is more damning than any outright lie could be. It's as if he's saying, ""Yes, I know what you're talking about, and yes, it's true."" The revelation chills me to the bone, and I find myself questioning everything I thought I knew about this man. His nonchalant acceptance of my accusations is a puzzle wrapped in an enigma, and I'm left grappling with the implications. What other secrets does he harbor? What other truths has he kept hidden? The silence stretches on, each second a new revelation, each moment a deeper plunge into the unknown. And as I stare into his eyes, I understand that this is just the beginning of a journey into a world I never knew existed."
"“Because he was there when I explained my objections, at length and in detail. Did he omit that?” I press my lips together. Which he seems to interpret as an opening. “Hannah.” He leans closer. We’re nose to nose, I smell his skin and his aftershave, and I hate every second of this. “Your","project is too dangerous. It specifically asks that you travel to a remote location to drop off equipment at a time of the year in which the weather is volatile and often totally unpredictable. I’ve been in Longyearbyen in February, and avalanches develop out of the blue. It’s only gotten worse in the last few—”",109,"objections were valid, and I respect your perspective. But you must also consider the broader picture. The merger, while not perfect, offers significant advantages that could outweigh the current issues. It's about strategic positioning and long-term growth. I understand your concerns, but I urge you to keep an open mind. The board has deliberated extensively, and this decision wasn't taken lightly. It's crucial that we present a united front moving forward. The company's future depends on our ability to adapt and innovate. I believe in our leadership's vision and their commitment to addressing the challenges you've raised. Let's work together to make this transition as smooth as possible. Your insights are valuable, and I assure you, they will be taken into account as we implement the changes. We're in this together, and I'm confident we can navigate through this period successfully."" He leans back, awaiting my response, his eyes searching mine for any sign of concession."
"I cling to him. He lets me sob for long moments we cannot afford, pressing me against him with no air between us, until I can feel his heartbeat through the thick layers","of our clothes. Then he mumbles “Fucking Merel” with barely restrained fury, and I think that it would be so easy to blame things on Merel, but the truth is, it’s all my fault.",67,"of clothing. His warmth is a stark contrast to the biting cold outside, and I find a strange comfort in the paradox. When my tears subside, he gently wipes my face with the back of his hand, his touch tender and reassuring. ""We'll figure this out,"" he murmurs, his voice a low rumble that vibrates through his chest and into mine. ""We always do."" "
"“Who is M— Oh. Yeah. For the most part. Mom isn’t very fond of the Floyd side of the family. Though I’m sure he’s the black sheep by their standards, too.","I wasn’t really allowed to spend time with him, so . . .” He shakes his head, as if to change the topic. “Here. It’s not much, but you should eat.”",62,"“He’s always been a bit of a wild card,” she continued, stirring her coffee absentmindedly. “But that’s what makes him so fascinating, isn’t it? The unpredictability, the edge of danger that he carries with him. It’s like watching a storm brew on the horizon; you know it’s going to be tumultuous, but you can’t look away.” She paused, her gaze drifting out the window as if she could see the distant storm she described. “Mom sees him as a bad influence, a reminder of the life she left behind when she married Dad. But I... I see something else. A freedom, a defiance against the mundane. That’s why I’m drawn to him, despite everything.” She took a sip of her coffee, the warmth spreading through her as she contemplated her words. “He’s a mystery wrapped in enigma, and I can’t help but want to unravel it.”"
"“No, no, shh.” His arms tighten around me, and I realize that I am, in","fact, crying. “You are not an asshole, Hannah. And you are the opposite of incompetent.”",30,"His arms tighten around me, and I realize that I am, in this moment, safe. The world outside with its chaos and demands fades away, replaced by the warmth of his embrace and the rhythmic beat of his heart against mine. I close my eyes, letting the tension seep out of my body, surrendering to the comfort he offers. His breath is steady, a soothing melody that lulls me into a state of tranquility. I feel a profound sense of belonging, as if I am exactly where I am meant to be. His presence is a shield, protecting me from the storm that rages beyond this quiet cocoon. In his arms, I find a peace that words cannot describe, a peace that transcends the noise and confusion of the day. It's a reminder that amidst the turmoil, there is stillness, and in the chaos, there is calm. His hold on me is gentle yet firm, a testament to his unwavering support and love. I am grateful for this moment, for him, for the solace he provides. In this embrace, I find a refuge, a sanctuary from the world's demands. And as I drift closer to the edge of sleep, I am filled with a deep sense of contentment, knowing that I am loved, truly and completely."
"“Because of the intrinsic danger of a project like yours. For the past few months, I tried to get this project stopped in about ten different ways. Personal meetings, emails, appeals—I","tried it all. And even the people who agreed with me that it was too dangerous would not step in to prevent it. So no, you’re not the asshole, Hannah. They are.”",63,"realized that the bureaucratic inertia was too strong, and the allure of the potential breakthroughs too enticing for those in charge. I even considered leaking information to the press, hoping the public outcry would force a halt. But the risks were too high; careers would be ruined, and the backlash could lead to even more secrecy and less accountability. So, I decided to take a different approach. I started gathering evidence, meticulously documenting every deviation from protocol, every corner cut, every safety guideline ignored. I knew that if I could present a compelling case, filled with undeniable facts, to the right people, it might just be enough to bring this runaway train to a stop. I reached out to a former colleague who had since moved to a regulatory body, someone who still believed in the integrity of the scientific process. After sharing my findings with them, they agreed to help bring this to the attention of their superiors. We scheduled a meeting with the oversight committee, armed with a dossier of evidence that left no room for doubt. The committee was shocked, and after a tense deliberation, they agreed to launch an immediate investigation. This was the breakthrough I had been hoping for, but it also meant that I was now in the crosshairs. I knew that those involved in the project would do everything in their power to discredit me, to protect their work and their reputations. The next few weeks were a blur of interviews, hearings, and the constant threat of retaliation. But I stood firm, driven by the conviction that the potential risks of this project far outweighed any scientific gains. The investigation concluded with a series of recommendations for immediate suspension of the project and a thorough review of all related activities. While the battle was won, the war was far from over. The fight for transparency and safety in scientific research continues, and I remain vigilant, ready to expose any further threats to public welfare."
"“Oh.” I swallow. “Merel was supposed to come for backup. But he wasn’t feeling well. I offered to wait for him, but he said we’d be losing valuable days of data and that I should just go","alone, and I . . .” I squeeze my fingers around the material of Ian’s shirt. “I went. And then, when I called in for help, he told me that the weather was turning, and . . .”",75,"without him. I hesitated, but he insisted. I told him I'd call every hour, but he just waved me off. I should have known something was wrong when he didn't answer his phone. I should have insisted on waiting. But I didn't. I left him alone, and now... now I'm here, and he's... he's..."" His voice trails off, choked with emotion. The weight of his guilt is palpable, a heavy burden that he can't seem to shake off. ""I should have stayed,"" he repeats, a mantra of regret. ""I should have known better."" The silence that follows is thick with sorrow and the unspoken question of what could have been different. The scientist's shoulders slump, his hands tremble slightly as he grips the edge of the table. ""We need to find him,"" he says finally, determination flickering back to life in his eyes. ""We can't leave him out there. Not alone. Not in the dark."" The urgency in his voice is clear; it's not just about the mission anymore. It's about redemption, about making amends for a decision that could have cost his friend his life. The scientist stands up abruptly, knocking his chair back. ""Let's go. We don't have much time."" His resolve is steel, his fear momentarily pushed aside by the pressing need to act. The team watches him, a mix of concern and admiration in their eyes. They know the stakes have just been raised, not just for the mission, but for their very sense of duty and camaraderie. The search for Merel is on, and every moment counts. "
"He shrugs. “I figured you might want to talk through your near-death experience with someone, so",I decided to tell Mara what happened. I did not expect her to come in person.”,32,"he suggested we meet here. I didn't expect to find you sitting alone at a table, though."" He gestures to the empty chair across from her. ""Mind if I join you?"""
"“I was going to. Once I felt less whiny. And—whatever.” I roll my eyes. Wow,",I’m mature. “How did you go from not remembering Mara’s name to having her number?”,30,"“I was going to. Once I felt less whiny. And—whatever.” I roll my eyes. Wow, this conversation is going nowhere. I decide to change the subject, hoping to steer it away from my mood and towards something more productive. ""Hey, have you heard about the new exhibit at the museum? They're showcasing some rare artifacts from ancient Egypt. I was thinking we could check it out this weekend. What do you say?"" I suggest, trying to inject some enthusiasm into my voice. Maybe a little adventure would lift my spirits and give us something to talk about that doesn't involve my current state of mind. "
"“Well, still.” She shrugs. “I promise I don’t have anything against",you personally. I’m just not generally a fan of the Floyd family.”,23,"you. I just think it's important to be honest about my feelings. I'm not comfortable with the idea of you going out with someone else. It makes me feel insecure and anxious. I care about you a lot, and I want us to work through this together. Can we talk about what's bothering you and why you feel the need to see other people?"""
"“Yes,” Mara agrees. “Are you going to break my blood relative’s heart?","Don’t get me wrong, I’d still side with you. Hos before bros.”",24,"“I have no intention of causing anyone pain,” he says softly, his gaze fixed on her. “But I cannot lie to you or to him. The truth, however harsh, is what binds us together, even if it threatens to tear us apart.” He takes a step closer, his voice lowering to a whisper. “I believe in us, in what we can be together, beyond the shadows of the past. Can you find it in your heart to trust me, even when the path is uncertain?”"
"“I guess we’ll see. I’m not sure he would want to date,” I say, staring at Sadie’s Froot Loops. The ensuing silence drags on so long,",I’m forced to look up. She and Mara are staring at me like I just announced that I’m quitting my job to take up macramé full-time. “What?”,53,"“that I start to wonder if Sadie has gone deaf. Finally, she breaks the silence, her voice hesitant but determined. ‘He’s been asking about you, you know. Not in a creepy way, but like... curious. Maybe he’s interested?’ Her words spark a flicker of hope in me, but I push it down. ‘Maybe. But I’m not going to jump to conclusions.’ The conversation shifts to safer topics, but Sadie’s observation lingers in my mind, a tiny ember of possibility that I can’t quite extinguish.”"
"“Considering that he saved your life, contacted Great-Aunt Delphina, and put up two dudes he’s never seen",before so their girlfriends could hang out with you . . . I think maybe he does.”,34,"to vouch for your character, you owe him more than just a simple thank you. You owe him an explanation. Why did you need his help in the first place? What kind of trouble were you in that required such drastic measures? And why are you now avoiding him? It's clear that there's more to this story than meets the eye, and it's time for you to come clean. After all, honesty is the best policy, especially when someone has gone out of their way to help you. Ignoring him or pretending everything is fine won't solve anything. It's time to face the music and deal with the consequences of your actions. Only then can you truly appreciate the depth of his kindness and possibly mend any bridges that have been burned. Remember, actions have consequences, and it's how we handle those consequences that define us."
"“Actually, they fixed the elevator. And this new cast is easy to walk on. So, no need. But you . . .” You can","do this, Hannah. Come on. You just survived polar bears thanks to this guy. You can say the words. “You could come up anyway.”",48,"continue. ""I've been meaning to ask you about something. It's been bothering me for a while now. You've been acting strangely, avoiding questions about your past, your family. It's like there's a whole part of your life you're keeping hidden. Why is that? What are you not telling me?"" You watch as a shadow passes over their face, a flicker of something you can't quite place. ""I just think we should be honest with each other, especially if we're going to be working together closely,"" you add, hoping to coax some truth out of them."
"“Right.” He sighs and bites into his lower lip. “Hannah, if that changes. If you ever find yourself able to believe that someone could care about you that much. And","if you wanted to actually . . . have dinner with that someone.” He lets out a laugh. “Well . . . Please, consider me. You know where to find me.”",61,"he pauses, his gaze dropping to the table as if the answer lies etched into the grain of the wood. ""And if you ever feel that tug of affection pulling at your heartstrings, don't push it away. Don't let fear dictate your life. Give it a chance, Hannah. Give love a chance. Because if you do, and you find that it's real, that it's reciprocal, then you'll understand why I'm telling you this now. You'll understand why I'm fighting so hard for a chance to prove myself to you. Love isn't just about grand gestures or dramatic declarations. It's about being there, through thick and thin, supporting each other, growing together. It's about trust, honesty, and a shared future. If you ever find that with someone, hold onto it. Cherish it. Because it's rare, and it's beautiful."" He lifts his eyes to meet hers, a silent plea for her to consider his words, to consider him, not just as a friend, but as someone who could be more. ""I just want you to be happy, Hannah. And if I'm being honest, I want that happiness to be with me."" His voice trails off, the weight of his confession hanging heavily in the air between them."
“Hannah.” He gives me a skeptical look. “You have two friends who,dropped everything to be with you. And I assume sex wasn’t involved.”,24,"are always hanging around you. One of them is named Lily, and the other is called Emma. They're both really nice, but sometimes they can be a bit too much. They always want to know what you're doing, where you're going, and who you're with. It's like they're always curious about your life. I've tried to tell them that I need some space, but they don't seem to get it. It's not that I don't like them, but I just need some time to myself. I hope you understand."""
"“Hannah.” He unbuckles his seat belt and angles himself toward me, so that I have no choice but to look him in the eyes. He looks earnest and nearly offended. “I have thought about what happened in my office every day for the past five years. You offered to go down on me, and I just . . . embarrassed myself, and it should be the most mortifying memory I have, but for some reason it’s turned into the axis every fantasy of mine spins around, and”—he reaches up to pinch the bridge of his nose—“I want to fuck you.","Obviously. Always have. I just don’t want to fuck you once. I want to do it a lot. For a long time. I want you to come to me for sex, but also want you to come to me when you need help with your taxes and moving your furniture. I want fucking to be only one of the million things I do for you, and I want to be—” He stops. Seems to collect himself and straightens, as if to give me space. To give us space. “I’m sorry. I don’t want to crowd you. You can . . .”",201,"He seems to be struggling with his own words, a rare sight for someone who usually exudes confidence. ""I want to fuck you,"" he repeats, as if trying to convince himself as much as me. His hand drops from his face, and he looks at me with a mix of desperation and desire. ""I've tried to fight it, believe me. I've tried to focus on my career, on my future, but it's like you've become this obsession. I can't get you out of my head."""
"He laughs, low and beautiful and a little rueful. And after looking at me like no","one else ever has before, what he says is, “Yes, Hannah. It is a yes on dinner.”",33,"one person can, he leans in and whispers, ""I'm glad you're here."" His breath is warm against my ear, and I feel a shiver run down my spine. The intensity in his gaze doesn't waver, and I find myself caught in the moment, unable to look away. His hand reaches out, hesitantly at first, and then with more confidence, brushing a strand of hair away from my face. ""You're more than just a friend to me,"" he confesses, his voice barely above a whisper. ""I've been trying to figure out how to tell you this for the longest time."" The words hang in the air, thick with emotion and unspoken feelings. I feel my heart race, a mixture of fear and excitement coursing through me. ""What are you saying?"" I manage to ask, my voice trembling slightly. He takes a deep breath, steadying himself, and then he says, ""I'm saying I think I'm in love with you."" The world seems to pause, the noise around us fading into nothingness as I process his confession. My mind races with questions and doubts, but one thing is clear - this moment has irrevocably changed the dynamic between us."
"“Um, I could make us a . . .” I scratch my head, studying the contents of my open fridge. Okay, so it’s full. The problem is, it’s full exclusively of stuff that needs to be cooked, chopped, baked, prepared. Stuff that’s healthy and doesn’t taste","particularly good. I am now 93 percent sure that Mara was the one who went shopping, because no one else would dare to impose broccoli on me. “How does one even . . . I could boil the broccoli, I guess? In a pot? With water?”",92,"like anything other than the raw ingredients it is. I glance back at my guest, who's looking at me with a mix of curiosity and slight apprehension. ""How about a quiche?"" I suggest, hoping it sounds more appetizing than it probably does in this context. ""I can whip something up with whatever veggies I have, add some eggs, and maybe some cheese for flavor."""
“Hannah.” His forehead touches mine. He laughs against my mouth. “Dinner is . . . it’s symbolic. A,"metaphor. If you tell me that you’re willing to see where things go, I believe you, and we can—”",37,"completion symbolic gesture. It's about coming together, sharing a meal, and celebrating our unity. It's not just about the food, but about the company and the love we share. I know it might seem odd, but trust me, it's a beautiful tradition."" His eyes twinkle with a mix of mischief and affection, and I can't help but smile back, feeling my heart swell with warmth and anticipation."
"He is hot and huge. Closing his eyes, arching his neck before looking at me again with a half-warning, half-pleading expression. He finds me sitting","on his knees, his cock spasming in my grip as I lean over. “Hannah,” he says, even deeper than usual. “What are you . . .”",51,"on the edge of the bed, my legs dangling off. His gaze lingers on me, searching for any sign of fear or aggression. I try to maintain a calm demeanor, aware that my next move could either diffuse or escalate the situation. He lets out a low growl, a warning that he's not entirely comfortable with my presence. I slowly raise my hands, palms out, a universal sign of peace. His eyes follow my movement, still assessing. I speak in a soft, soothing tone, ""Easy there, big guy. I'm not here to hurt you."" His ears twitch, and he takes a step back, though he doesn't look away. I take the opportunity to slowly slide off the bed, keeping my movements deliberate and non-threatening. He watches intently as I move towards the door, ready to retreat if necessary. I glance back at him, ""Good boy,"" I say, hoping to build a bridge of trust. He lets out a huff, a sound that could be interpreted as a sigh of relief or a grumble of discontent. Either way, it seems he's decided I'm not an immediate threat. I exit the room, closing the door gently behind me, and take a deep breath, relieved that the encounter ended peacefully. I make a mental note to approach him with more caution next time."
“Or maybe it’s the Vastitas Borealis.” He’s barely intelligible. Doing those little thrusts that are designed more to open me up than to,"fuck me properly, and yet we’re both this close to orgasm. It’s a little scary. “The oceans that used to fill it, Hannah.”",46,"keep us moving. The Vastitas Borealis, the northern polar plain of Mars, is a region of particular interest to scientists. Its flat, low-lying terrain, covered in dunes and layered deposits, holds clues to the planet's past climate and geological history. The plain is thought to be composed of ice-rich soil, which could contain subsurface water ice. This makes it a prime target for exploration, especially for missions seeking to understand Mars' water history and potential for past habitability. The mention of the Vastitas Borealis in our context suggests a scientific endeavor, possibly a mission or research project focused on drilling or sampling this area. The little thrusts, designed to open me up, could be interpreted as a metaphor for the meticulous and careful approach required in such a delicate operation. Every maneuver, every decision, is critical when exploring an alien world, especially one as enigmatic as Mars. The aim is to uncover the secrets buried beneath the surface, secrets that could rewrite our understanding of the solar system and our place within it. The challenges are immense, from the technical difficulties of landing and operating a rover in such a harsh environment to the scientific complexities of interpreting the data collected. Yet, the potential rewards are equally vast, offering insights into the history of water on Mars, the possibility of past microbial life, and the potential for future human exploration. This endeavor, shrouded in the cold, silent vastness of the Vastitas Borealis, is a testament to human curiosity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge."
