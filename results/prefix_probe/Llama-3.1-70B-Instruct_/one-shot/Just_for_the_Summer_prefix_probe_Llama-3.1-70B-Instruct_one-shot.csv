I [29m] have been friends with Chad [32m] since we were born. Our moms are best friends and we grew,"up together and were roommates for the last 10 years, up until the incident that set our current situation into motion.","up together, exploring the same neighborhoods, attending the same schools, and sharing countless memories that have shaped",41,"up together, exploring the same neighborhoods, attending the same schools, and sharing countless memories that have shaped us into the people we are today. As we grew older, our friendship only deepened, and we found ourselves drawn to each other in ways that went beyond a typical childhood bond. We began to share our hopes, dreams, and fears with each other, and our trust in one another grew stronger with each passing year. Chad has been more than just a friend to me; he's been a confidant, a partner in crime, and a constant source of support and encouragement. I've seen him at his best and at his worst, and through it all, our friendship has remained unshakeable. As we've entered adulthood, our lives have taken different paths, but our friendship has remained a constant, a reminder of the unbreakable bonds that we formed in our youth."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.","me up out of the blue and asks if I want to grab coffee. I'm thinking, ""Why not? We can be friends, right?"" So we meet up and it's all good. We catch up, talk about our lives, and I'm glad we can be civil. But then she drops",76,"me up out of the blue and asks if I want to grab coffee. I'm thinking, ""Why not? We can be friends, right?"" So we meet up and it's all good. We catch up, talk about our lives, and I'm glad we can be civil. But then she drops a bombshell: she's been seeing someone new, and it's my best friend, Alex. I'm taken aback, but I try to play it cool, thinking, ""Okay, that's weird, but I can handle it."" But then she tells me that Alex has been talking trash about me behind my back, saying I'm not a good person and that I'm not worthy of love. I'm shocked, hurt, and angry all at once. I try to process this information, but it's hard to wrap my head around it. I thought Alex and I were better than that. I thought we had a real friendship. Now I'm not so sure. I'm left wondering what else Alex has been saying about me, and who else he's been saying it to. I feel betrayed, and I don't know how to deal with it."
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me. Now I have to find a way to cover his rent until the lease is up.,"time.

He's been trying to find someone to take over the lease, but so far, no one has been willing to commit to the remaining six months. This has put him in a difficult financial situation, and he's been stressing about it for weeks. He's even considered subletting the apartment, but that would require our landlord's approval, which is not guaranteed. Meanwhile, Hope is getting anxious to move into their new home, and the uncertainty is causing tension in their relationship. Chad feels stuck, and I can sense his frustration every time we talk about it. I've tried to be supportive, but I'm not sure what the solution is. Perhaps we could try to find a short-term roommate to help split the costs, or maybe Chad could negotiate a lease buyout with the landlord. Whatever the solution, I hope it comes soon, for Chad's sake and ours."
"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend. If you’re reading this, you’re dead to me, human Chad. (Not really, I still love the guy.) But I tag him in the captions of every Chad the Dog Instagram post with “Look, a loyal Chad!”","ear, but he's got the biggest personality I've ever seen.

I named him Rocky, and he's been my constant companion ever since. We go on walks, play fetch, and even cuddle up on the couch. He's not the prettiest dog, but he's mine, and I love him to death. As I spend more time with Rocky, I start to notice the little things about the neighborhood that I never saw before. The way the sunlight filters through the trees, the sound of birds chirping, and the smell of freshly cut grass. It's amazing how much more vibrant the world is when you're not stuck behind a window. I start to feel a sense of freedom that I've been missing, and I owe it all to Rocky. He may be ugly, but he's the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. As the days go by, I find myself looking forward to our daily walks and adventures. I start to explore new parts of the neighborhood, and I even meet some of the locals. There's Mrs. Johnson, who always has a treat for Rocky, and Mr. Thompson, who tells me stories about the neighborhood's history. I start to feel like I'm a part of the community, and it's all thanks to my ugly little dog. I realize that I don't need Chad's approval to be happy, and that I'm capable of finding joy on my own. Rocky may have been the ugliest dog at the rescue, but he's turned out to be the best thing that's ever happened to me."
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers. Maddy,"didn’t look happy, but she took the picture with my phone, then handed it back to me.","raised an eyebrow, a small smile playing on her lips as she shook her head and mouthed",34,"raised an eyebrow, a small smile playing on her lips as she shook her head and mouthed ""five"" back at me, her eyes sparkling with amusement at our silly game of silent communication, a habit we'd developed over years of sneaking around the dorm after hours."
"“That dog trusts him,” Maddy said. “And that’s a rescue dog, so that means something. They’re usually all","skittish and freaked out.” She went quiet again looking at his wall. “Go down further,” Maddy said. “The billboard.”","skittish around people, but that one’s practically sitting on his lap.

Maddy’s eyes met mine, and I could see the same thought reflected back at me – we had to be careful, but maybe, just maybe, we had found an ally in this strange and desperate place."
That night after work Maddy made dinner. Grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf. I did,"the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, then took a shower and blew out my hair.","the dishes, and we sat down to eat together, the warm glow of the table lamp",30,"the dishes, and we sat down to eat together, the warm glow of the table lamp casting a cozy ambiance over our quiet evening routine, a sense of comfort and familiarity that I had grown to appreciate in the months we'd been living together."

My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out. Actually, I missed a lot of things now that Brad had moved out. Like having another human to talk to, even if it was this one.","that often, but I did miss the quirky employees and the samples of Speculoos Cookie Butter on a Saturday afternoon.

My friend and I were at a coffee shop, catching up on each other's lives, and I couldn't help but notice the contrast between his work attire and the hipster baristas. We talked about everything from our jobs to our personal lives, and I was grateful for the friendship that had endured despite our different career paths. As we sipped our coffee, I realized that sometimes it's the unexpected friendships that bring the most joy and comfort in life. My friend, with his Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts, was a reminder that you can find common ground with anyone, no matter how different they may seem."

They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t. Not alone.","to the mountains for a weekend, and then to the beach for a week, and they were all going to",39,"to the mountains for a weekend, and then to the beach for a week, and they were all going to start taking vacations together, which was something that Emily had always dreamed of doing with her friends. She loved the idea of having a close-knit group of friends who could share in all of life's experiences together. As they sat around the dinner table, making plans for their next adventure, Emily couldn't help but feel grateful for the friendships she had formed. They were more than just friends, they were a family, and she knew that no matter where life took them, they would always be there for each other."
Brad took a swallow of his drink. “Ask that nurse out. Go,"wherever she is. Pitch the idea to her, she might be into it.”","on a date with her, see if you two hit it off. You never know,",25,"on a date with her, see if you two hit it off. You never know, she might be the one to help you get over your past and move on with your life.

Trust me, I'm looking out for your best interests here, buddy. Now, are you going to take my advice or do I have to take matters into my own hands and ask her out for you?"
"“Yeah,” Brad said. “She dates you, you guys break up, and she rides happily into the sunset too. It’s a win-win. Seriously. This is your chance.",If you don’t do something you’re gonna spend the rest of your life sending women on to their forever families and never getting one for you.”,"to get back out there and start fresh.

It's a no-brainer, really. You'd be crazy to pass this up. Plus, who knows, you might just find someone even better waiting for you on the other side. The thought alone should be enough to get you excited. So, what do you say? Are you in?"
Brad looked me in the eye. “You will never find someone as long as all the women you date aren’t actually meant for you. You’re not their,soulmate. Their soulmate is the person they meet after you. It’s decided the minute it starts. They are literally fated not to be The One.

I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized the truth in his statement. All the relationships I'd been in, all the women I'd dated, they'd all been a distraction, a way to fill the void left by the one person I truly wanted. But who was that person? I had no idea, but Brad's words had sparked something within me, a sense of determination to find out. I took a sip of my drink, my mind racing with the possibilities, and asked Brad, ""So, how do I find someone who is my type?"""
"I had actually thought about her. I’d checked once or twice to see if she’d messaged me again. She hadn’t. The last message was me telling her it was nice chatting with her, three days ago.

I wondered what would have happened if I had been more persistent, if I had found a way to keep the conversation going. Would we have hit it off, or would it have fizzled out like so many other online connections? The not knowing was frustrating, and I found myself checking my phone again, just in case. But there was nothing. No messages, no notifications. Just silence. I sighed and rubbed my eyes, trying to refocus. It was time to move on. I had a job to do, and I couldn't let my personal life get in the way. But as I delved back into my work, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of disappointment. I had been looking forward to the possibility of connecting with someone new, and now it seemed like that possibility was gone. I pushed the thoughts aside and tried to concentrate, but my mind kept wandering back to her. Who was she, really? What was her story? And why had she stopped responding?

"For a moment I debated calling from a blocked number. He was nice, but I still didn’t know him. But I figured it",was just as easy to block him later if he got creepy.

When he finally picked up, his warm and friendly voice put me at ease, and I felt a sense of relief wash over me. ""Hey, is this a good time to talk?"" I asked, trying to sound casual despite the butterflies in my stomach. There was a brief pause on the other end of the line before he responded, ""Yeah, it's a great time. What's up?"""

This time, the silence felt heavier, the stillness more oppressive. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that Amber's disappearance was more than just another one of her impulsive escapades. I found myself wandering the empty rooms of our apartment, calling out her name, as if she might magically appear, laughing and apologetic, with some wild story to explain her absence. But the only response was the echo of my own voice, bouncing off the walls, a haunting reminder that I was truly alone. And so, I did the only thing I could think of - I started to search for her, scouring the city, retracing her steps, talking to her friends, and scouring the streets, desperate to find any clue that might lead me to her. But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was searching for a ghost, that Amber had vanished into thin air, leaving me with nothing but the memories of our time together, and the haunting fear that I might never see her again."

Alex, being the older sibling, always seemed to know exactly what he was doing, and I often found myself looking up to him for guidance. As we walked home together, the warm sun beating down on our skin, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. The carefree days of summer were coming to an end, and the structured routine of school was looming ahead. I glanced over at Alex, who was chatting with his friends, and wondered what the new school year would bring for both of us."

The walls were still painted the same off-white, but the furniture had been rearranged to create a cozy nook with a plush armchair and a floor lamp. I spotted a few new pieces of artwork on the walls, including a vibrant abstract piece above the couch. ""I like it,"" I said, trying to sound casual despite the fact that I was still reeling from our earlier conversation. She smiled, seeming to relax a little now that I was focusing on the room. ""I'm glad you do,"" she said. ""I was hoping to create a more peaceful atmosphere in here."" I nodded, taking a seat in the armchair and running my hand over the soft fabric. It was definitely more peaceful, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off."
Maddy looked up. Then her eyes dropped to the laptop I was holding and she somehow immediately,"knew what was about to happen. “No.” She shook her head. “No. No, no, no, no, no. NO.”","knew that something was wrong, her gaze lingering on the screen with a mixture of confusion",35,"knew that something was wrong, her gaze lingering on the screen with a mixture of confusion and concern, as if she could sense the weight of the news that I was about to share with her."

We lugged our bags up the stairs and were sweating by the time we made it to the door. We came in through a screened-in porch that overlooked the lake. Maddy and,I shared a glance. It was adorable. White wicker rocking chairs and a small matching loveseat with thick floral cushions.

She was a warm, friendly woman in her late fifties with a kind smile and a quick wit. She showed us to our rooms, which were cozy and comfortable, with big windows that looked out over the lake. After we dropped off our bags, we headed back downstairs to join Maddy and her mom on the porch, where Mrs. Jenkins was regaling them with stories of the lake's history and the various creatures that lived in and around it. As we sat down, she offered us glasses of lemonade and we spent the rest of the afternoon lounging in the sun, watching the boats drift lazily across the water and listening to Mrs. Jenkins' tales of the lake's secrets and surprises."
"The bedrooms were off the living room on either side of a short hallway with a single bathroom shared in the middle.

The floors creaked beneath your feet as you walked down the hallway, and the air was thick with the scent of old books and stale air. Despite its age, the house had a cozy feel to it, like it had been lived in and loved for many years. The living room was the heart of the house, with a large stone fireplace that dominated one wall, and a comfortable-looking couch and armchair arranged in front of it. There was a large bookshelf against one wall, filled with books of all shapes and sizes, and a small desk in the corner with a chair tucked in behind it. The room was filled with the warm glow of lamplight, and the sound of a clock ticking away in the corner."
"Four hours later, Maddy and I were back at the cottage sitting in the screened-in porch.",We’d had dinner in town and then boated back. The fridge was stocked up and we’d unpacked.,The warm summer air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the soothing sounds,33,"The warm summer air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the soothing sounds of chirping crickets, a stark contrast to the eerie atmosphere that had settled over us just hours before.

The tranquility of the moment was a welcome respite from the chaos that had erupted earlier, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me as I gazed out at the peaceful scene before us."
She looked away from me. “Emma…” Her eyes came back to mine. “Please. Please do it.,Do it now before you lose the chance to meet them altogether. People don’t live forever.”,"don't make me beg.

Do it for me, for us, for our friendship. Do it so we can finally move on and put the past behind us. Please, Emma, I'm begging you."
"“How about this,” Maddy said. “Run your DNA and make your account private. We’ll change your privacy settings for a few minutes, poke around. If you have any","relatives out there, we’ll screenshot it and go back to private. Then I’ll go and find them online and tell you if they seem like people worth knowing.”","relatives on the site, we can see who they are and if they've been in touch with you.

Maddy's eyes sparkled with excitement as she waited for a response, her fingers poised over the keyboard. She had always loved a good mystery, and this one was starting to get interesting. As she waited, she couldn't help but wonder what secrets might be hidden in the DNA results, and what kind of surprises they might uncover."
We prioritized power for the coffee maker first and we brewed a pot while I sat in the kitchen with,"a towel wrapped around my head.

As I waited for the coffee to finish, I took a moment to appreciate the small joys in life, like the sound of the coffee maker gurgling away in the background and the warm sunlight streaming through the kitchen window. It was moments like these that I cherished, a brief respite from the chaos that often seemed to define my life. With my coffee finally ready, I poured myself a steaming cup and took a sip, feeling the rich flavors dance on my tongue. It was just what I needed to tackle the tasks ahead, and I settled in for a productive morning, the coffee maker humming along in the background like a trusty companion."
The snail’s-pace speed the pontoon put out somehow seemed faster with the beach approaching. Maddy threw it in reverse. The engine,"downshifted miserably, but we started to slow. Then to my horror we began to move backward, motor first, right into the dock.","roared in protest, spewing forth a cloud of noxious fumes as the pontoon juddered to a stop just shy of the water's edge.

The stillness was almost palpable, broken only by the gentle lapping of the waves against the shore. As she sat there, the tension in her shoulders began to ease, replaced by a sense of trepidation. What was she doing here, really? The question echoed in her mind like the cries of the gulls wheeling overhead."

I let my head fall back against the seat, feeling the tension seep out of my muscles as the adrenaline began to wear off. We sat there for a long time, the only sound the water and our own quiet breathing, each of us lost in our own thoughts. I couldn't help but wonder what had just happened, and what lay ahead for us now that we'd made our escape. The uncertainty was almost suffocating, but for the moment, I just let it wash over me, too exhausted to try and make sense of it all."
"I lined the nose of the boat up with the side of the dock and started for it again, only this time I killed the thrust earlier. We",coasted along the side and I put us into reverse to slow us down while Maddy grabbed one of the dock poles and we came to a stop.,"coasted in, and I was able to grab the dock's edge and pull us in the rest of the way.

The sound of the water lapping against the dock and the distant calls of seagulls filled the air, and I felt my tension melt away. I turned to my companion, who was watching me with a mixture of amusement and admiration, and smiled. ""Not bad for a first try, huh?"" I said, and they chuckled in agreement. We climbed out of the boat and onto the dock, stretching our legs and taking in the sights and sounds of the marina. The smell of saltwater and fish filled the air, and I breathed deeply, feeling invigorated. As we walked along the dock, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had faced my fears and come out on top, and it felt amazing."
"Her phone rang. “Oh, hold on. I have to leave my ringer on in case Maddy gets in trouble trying to get back.” She looked at it. “It’s her.” She swiped and put the",phone to her ear. “Maddy?

Can you tell me where you are? What do you see around you?”"

It was as if the past few months had created a distance between us, a distance that I wasn't sure I knew how to bridge. I took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling, and made my way towards him, my footsteps echoing in the silence of the room."

""Okay, where are you?"" she asked, already knowing that she would have to drop everything to meet Maddy, no matter what was going on. The pause on the other end of the line seemed to stretch on forever before Maddy finally responded, her voice barely above a whisper. ""I'm at the coffee shop on Main. Can you meet me there in 20 minutes?"""
“I hope so. It’s been a little stressful.” She picked up Murder Mittens. “I don’t think I really thought this island thing through.

"“Emma, you won’t believe my day,” she said, looking back at me. “So I wanted to surprise you.

“Are you kidding me with this?” Maddy hissed as soon as they were out,of earshot. “She’s here for what? Six hours?

Maddy rolled her eyes in the way that I knew meant she was aware. “Please tell me I don’t have to stay and watch,you eat crustaceans with that woman.

I quickly scanned the room, searching for an escape route, but the restaurant was packed, and I knew we'd have to wait for the check to be settled before we could make a discreet exit. Just as I was starting to think that things couldn't get any worse, the woman at the table next to us let out a loud sob, and her date, a smarmy-looking guy with a receding hairline, stood up and stormed out of the restaurant, leaving her alone and distraught. Maddy raised an eyebrow and mouthed, ""Wow,"" and I just shook my head, feeling a mix of relief and guilt for being grateful that our own date, as disastrous as it was, wasn't quite that bad. Yet."
I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships.

I took a deep breath, feeling the weight of my worries slowly start to lift. Maybe, just maybe, we could get through this after all."
I felt relieved the instant he said he would stay with me because it let Maddy off the hook. She would walk through hell for,me—and this cookout was her hell. I was glad she didn’t have to be here.

It was a testament to her strength and resilience, and I found myself drawn to her, wanting to know more about her story and the experiences that had shaped her into the person she was today. As I continued to observe her, I noticed the way she interacted with the people around her, her kindness and compassion radiating like a beacon, touching the lives of everyone she met. It was clear that she had been through a great deal, but it was also clear that she had emerged from those trials with a depth and richness that was truly inspiring. I felt grateful to be sitting next to her, and I couldn't help but wonder what lessons she might be able to teach me about perseverance, forgiveness, and the human spirit."
I might kiss her tonight. I almost did the other night at the,"dock, but then Amber showed up. I was looking forward to the do-over.","party, but I didn't want to ruin the moment, and I was also unsure of",26,"party, but I didn't want to ruin the moment, and I was also unsure of how she would react, so I decided to wait for a more intimate setting, like tonight, when we're alone and the atmosphere is more relaxed, and I can see the way the dim light dances across her face, illuminating her features and making my heart skip a beat."
I’d tried to be softer with her the last few days. The energy shift I’d had over Mom after my talk with Emma,"was almost as bad as being mad at her. At least when I was mad, I didn’t feel the guilt I was feeling now.",had made me realize that I needed to approach her with more compassion and understanding.

I'd been so caught up in my own emotions and frustrations that I'd forgotten how to be gentle, how to be kind. But as I looked at her now, I saw the lines on her face, the tiredness in her eyes, and I knew I had to try harder. I took a deep breath and reached out, putting a hand on her arm, feeling a spark of connection as our skin touched. ""Hey, Mom,"" I said softly, ""can we talk?"""
"This was another thing I was trying not to think about—her leaving. I should be happy that she came at all, that she wasn’t in Hawaii. We still had three more dates, maybe more if I could convince her. I’d already gotten a freebie the other night at","Mom’s. But I dreaded the clock running out. Emma was the only good thing happening to me at the moment and when she was gone, not only would I lose her, I’d be left sitting in my new reality. Dad gone, Mom in prison.

It was a beautiful summer evening, perfect for a stroll, and I was determined to make the most of it. As I got ready for our date, I couldn't help but think about how much I had grown accustomed to having her around. The thought of her leaving was starting to feel like a punch to the gut, and I knew I had to push it aside if I wanted to enjoy the time we had left together. I took a deep breath, grabbed my keys, and headed out the door to pick her up, trying to focus on the present moment and not the looming goodbye that was just around the corner."
"“Yeah,” I said. “Thank you. There’s actually something else you can help me with too,” I","said, looking at them. “I need help making sure I can still see Emma until she goes.”","added, trying to sound casual despite the nervousness that was starting to creep into",33,"added, trying to sound casual despite the nervousness that was starting to creep into my voice.

Emma pulled two Ziploc bags from her purse. They had Wheat Thins and celery in them. Probably her,"work snacks. “I trust this zipper seal with my life,” she said, turning to hand them to our passengers.","snack for the road, but she offered one to Jack, who accepted it with a nod of thanks, his eyes never leaving",37,"snack for the road, but she offered one to Jack, who accepted it with a nod of thanks, his eyes never leaving the road as he steered the car through the winding highway. As they drove, the silence between them was comfortable, punctuated only by the occasional crunch of a Wheat Thin or the soft hum of the engine. Emma watched the scenery pass by, the trees and houses blurring together as they sped along, feeling a sense of contentment wash over her. She was glad to be out of the city, away from the noise and chaos, and into the peacefulness of the countryside. The fresh air and open spaces were just what she needed to clear her head and unwind."
"I think I would have been embarrassed if I’d been on a date with anyone else. My mother, sobbing drunk the night before",she left for prison. But I knew Emma didn’t judge.

I was mortified, but my fiancé, bless his heart, just laughed and handed her a cup of coffee, saying 'Well, I guess this is one way to get to know the family.' It was a moment that could have been disastrous, but somehow, it ended up being kind of endearing, and it broke the ice in a way that nothing else could have."
"When she finished handing out Kleenex, Emma stayed turned in her seat.","“You know,” she said, “I worked for three months in a women’s prison.”","She stared out the window, her eyes tracing the path of a raindrop as it",25,"She stared out the window, her eyes tracing the path of a raindrop as it slid down the glass, her mind a million miles away from the mundane routine of the classroom."
It was funny that two pivotal moments in my life were happening at the exact same time and at complete odds with each,other. I didn’t know how to balance what was going on with my family and what was going on with my feelings for Emma.,"one another.

On the other hand, my personal life was in shambles, as I was going through a messy breakup and struggling to come to terms with the end of a long-term relationship. It was as if the universe was testing my ability to balance my professional and personal life, pushing me to my limits and forcing me to confront the harsh realities of adulthood. As I navigated this tumultuous period, I couldn't help but wonder if I was truly cut out for this thing called life."
"What did I have to offer her? I had nothing but baggage. Emotionally damaged, traumatized children that had been catapulted from one tragedy to the next, and me, barely keeping my head above water. Would I even have the time or the bandwidth to be any kind of partner while I was helping my",siblings navigate this situation?

The thought of opening myself up to someone new, of being vulnerable and risking the possibility of more pain, was daunting. And yet, as I looked at her, I felt a spark of hope that I hadn't felt in a long time. Maybe, just maybe, I wasn't as broken as I thought I was. Maybe I still had the capacity to love and be loved in return. But what if I was wrong? What if I was just setting myself up for another heartbreak? The uncertainty was suffocating, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was standing at the edge of a cliff, staring into an abyss of unknowns."

I'll be right behind you, trying to corral the toddler and prevent him from making a break for the door. And please, for the love of all things good and holy, do not mention the fact that we're running on fumes and that I had to bribe the kid with an entire box of animal crackers just to get him to stop screaming.

She had a way of pushing people away, of keeping them at arm's length, and I couldn't help but wonder what had caused her to build those walls around herself. Was it a fear of intimacy, a fear of getting hurt, or something else entirely? I found myself wanting to know more, to understand what made her tick, and to see if I could somehow help her break down those barriers and let someone in."
He nodded over his shoulder. “I should probably let you get back to work.

I took her hand and did my best to make my face straight. People were already stopping to watch.

She spoke in a low, husky voice that sent shivers down my spine, and I found myself leaning in closer, my heart pounding in my chest."
"“She’ll be home one day, Sarah. It’ll come faster than you think. You can visit her and write to her and call her.","You can stay close to her—you just have to try.

"After we finished with the lice, I set up the blanket in the backyard. With the landscaping Mom did, it was pretty nice back there with its hanging lights, citronella candles, and magnolia trees. I ordered a","pizza, connected my phone to a Bluetooth speaker, and poured the wine I brought, and Emma and I hung out and talked.

As we ate, I couldn't help but think about how Mom had always wanted to create a peaceful oasis in our backyard, a place where we could escape the stresses of everyday life. And in that moment, surrounded by the soft glow of the hanging lights and the gentle hum of the crickets, I felt like she had finally succeeded. The pizzas were a welcome distraction from the events of the past few days, and we all savored the taste of the melted cheese and tangy sauce. As we finished up and I began to clear the plates, I noticed that the sky was starting to darken, the stars beginning to twinkle like diamonds scattered across the fabric of the universe. It was going to be a beautiful night, one that I hoped would bring us all a sense of peace and tranquility."

I’ve got the map right here, let me just check the route real quick. Yeah, it looks like it should take us around three hours to get there, depending on how many stops we make along the way.

I poured myself a glass of orange juice and sat down at the table, ready to join in the conversation and start the day off on a positive note."
