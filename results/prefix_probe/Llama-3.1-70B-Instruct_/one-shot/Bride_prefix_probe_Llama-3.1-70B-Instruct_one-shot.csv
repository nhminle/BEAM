"Not quite the stuff of childhood dreams. Then again, I’m no dreamer. I only ever contemplated marriage once, back in the gloomy days of my childhood. Following a few too-harsh punishments and a","poorly executed assassination attempt, Serena and I concocted plans for a grand escape, which was going to involve pyrotechnics-based diversions, stealing our math tutor’s car, and flipping off our caregivers in the rearview mirror.","particularly brutal scolding from my father, I recall lying in bed, staring up at the cracked ceiling and fantasizing about a life where I was free to make my own choices, where I could escape the suffocating grip of my family's expectations.",67,"particularly brutal scolding from my father, I recall lying in bed, staring up at the cracked ceiling and fantasizing about a life where I was free to make my own choices, where I could escape the suffocating grip of my family's expectations. In this fantasy, I was married to a kind and gentle soul, someone who would love and support me unconditionally, and together we would build a life filled with laughter, adventure, and above all, freedom. But that was just a fleeting moment of weakness, a desperate attempt to escape the bleak reality of my situation. As I grew older, I pushed such fanciful notions aside, focusing instead on the harsh realities of my world and the role I was destined to play in it. And yet, as I stood there, watching the young couple exchange their vows, I couldn't help but feel a pang of... not quite envy, perhaps, but a sense of wistfulness, a reminder that there were other paths in life, other choices that could have been made."
"That was fourteen years ago, though, and Serena never married me. In fact, she’s long gone. I’m here alone, with a giant heap of","expensive wedding favors that’ll hopefully fool guests into overlooking the lack of love, genetic compatibility, or even previous acquaintance between me and the groom.","unpaid bills, a dwindling bank account, and a worn-out couch that seems to be the only thing that still remembers her.

The memories of our time together linger, a bittersweet reminder of what could have been. I often find myself wandering the empty rooms, searching for a ghost that I know is long gone. The city outside is bustling with life, but in here, time stands still. I'm stuck in a perpetual state of limbo, unable to move on from the what-ifs and the maybes. The silence is deafening, a constant echo of the laughter, the tears, and the whispers that once filled this space. I'm left to pick up the pieces of a life that never was, and wonder what could have been if Serena had stayed."
I did try to arrange a meeting. Suggested to my people that they suggest to his people that we could grab lunch the week before the ceremony. Coffee the previous day.

I was told that he was very busy with last-minute preparations, and that it would be better for everyone involved if we just met at the ceremony and exchanged our vows in front of our friends and family. I tried to push back, to explain that this wasn't exactly what I had in mind, but my people just kept telling me that this was the way it had to be. They said that the groom was a very private person, and that he preferred to keep to himself until the big day. I wasn't sure what to make of this, but I didn't want to cause any unnecessary tension, so I reluctantly agreed to go along with the plan. As the days ticked by, I couldn't help but feel a growing sense of unease. I had never even spoken to the groom before, and the thought of marrying a complete stranger was starting to feel more and more surreal. I tried to focus on the positives – the beautiful venue, the delicious food, the fact that I would finally be able to start my new life – but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. And then, just a few days before the wedding, I received a mysterious message from an unknown number. It was a simple text, just two words: ""Don't do it."" I was taken aback, unsure of who could have sent it or what they meant. But as I read the words over and over again, I couldn't help but feel a spark of doubt. Was this some kind of warning, a message from someone who knew something I didn't? Or was it just a cruel prank, meant to unsettle me on the eve of my big day? I didn't know what to think, but I knew one thing for sure: I had to get to the bottom of it."
"One of the agents stops us in front of the double doors that lead into the courtyard. “Councilman Lark, Miss Lark, one minute. They’re not quite ready for you.” We","wait side by side for a handful of uncomfortable moments, then Father turns to me.

He's been preparing for this meeting for weeks, and any delay is likely to unsettle him. I, on the other hand, am trying to appear calm, but my mind is racing with worst-case scenarios. The agent, seemingly oblivious to our unease, steps aside and begins to inspect his comms device, his eyes scanning the small screen with an air of detachment. As we wait, I take the opportunity to glance around, taking in the opulent decorations that adorn the walls of the grand hallway. The intricate patterns and symbols etched into the stone seem to whisper secrets of the past, and I find myself wondering what stories these walls could tell if only they could speak. My father clears his throat, breaking the silence, and I turn my attention back to him, trying to offer a reassuring smile, but it feels more like a nervous twitch. The agent looks up, his expression unreadable, and says, ""Ah, sorry about the delay. They're ready for you now."" With a curt nod, he pushes open the double doors, revealing a dimly lit courtyard that seems to stretch on forever, the air thick with anticipation."

"The first things I notice are the two walls of windows, which is exactly what Father wants.

Father's design for this house is a testament to that craving, a defiant rejection of the darkness that's supposed to define us. The walls of windows are a statement, a declaration that we will not be bound by the limitations of our nature. And yet, as I gaze out at the sunlight streaming in, I feel a pang of unease. It's a reminder that we're not like the Humans, that we're forever trapped in this twilight world, caught between the light we desire and the shadows that sustain us. I push the thought aside, focusing on the rest of the house. The interior is sleek and modern, with clean lines and minimalist decor. It's a far cry from the opulent, Gothic mansions that Vampyres are supposed to inhabit, and I can sense Father's influence in every detail. He's always been drawn to the modern, the innovative, and this house is no exception. I wander through the rooms, taking in the subtle touches that make this place feel like home. There's a sunroom, filled with plants that thrive in the indirect light, and a library that's already stocked with Father's favorite books. The kitchen is sleek and high-tech, with appliances that seem to hum and whir as I approach. It's all so... Human. And yet, it's ours, a sanctuary from the world outside. I feel a sense of pride and ownership as I explore, a sense of belonging that I've never quite felt before. This house is more than just a place to live – it's a declaration of our existence, a statement that we will not be defined by the myths and legends that surround us. We are Vampyres, and this is our home."
"“Whose? Yours? Are you going to . . .” I don’t bother finishing the sentence—the sheer thought is ludicrous. It’s not just weddings that have gone out of fashion hundreds of years ago, but the entire idea","of long-term relationships. As it turns out, when your species sucks at producing children, encouraging sexual walkabouts and the search for reproductively compatible partners takes precedence over romance. I doubt Vampyres were ever particularly romantic, anyway. “Whose?”","of romantic love and commitment as we once knew it.

The air is thick with unspoken words, the weight of our past and the uncertainty of our future hanging like a challenge between us.

I was only twelve, but in that moment I felt the weight of adulthood settle onto my shoulders, the crushing responsibility of keeping secrets and telling lies, of being the strong one when everyone else was falling apart. And though I didn't know it then, that was the moment when my life began to change, when the trajectory of my future was altered forever."
"“A few days? She still wouldn’t let the little asshole starve,” I hurried to add, but the officer had already dropped his pen. And even though I went back to the station three times that week, and eventually managed to get a missing person report filed, no one did anything","to find Serena. The hazard, I guess, of being alone in the world: no one to care that she was safe, and healthy, and alive. No one but me, and I didn’t count. I shouldn’t have been surprised, and I wasn’t.

I sent her emails and messages, but they were met with silence. I was starting to lose hope, and the not knowing was eating away at me. I couldn't concentrate at work, and I found myself wandering the streets at night, looking for her in the crowds. I knew it was a long shot, but I had to do something. I started putting up my own posters around the neighborhood, with a picture of my roommate and a description of what she was last seen wearing. I also started asking around, talking to people who lived in the building and the local shopkeepers, but no one seemed to have seen her. It was as if she had vanished into thin air. I was getting desperate, and I didn't know what else to do. I felt like I was the only one who cared, and it was a heavy burden to carry. I just wanted her to come home, or at least to know that she was safe. The uncertainty was killing me, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong."

"I had the keys, after all. Because the key to everything is but a line of code. I was able to rifle through her bank statements, IP addresses, cell phone locations. Herald emails, metadata, app usage.

As I delved deeper into the digital trail, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, that the corporation's eyes were upon me, waiting for me to make my next move."
"And that’s when I did it: I kneeled in front of Serena’s damn fucking cat.

I looked up at Serena, who was watching us with a mixture of shock and amusement. ""I think I'm making progress,"" I said, trying to sound calm. The cat, whose name was Mr. Whiskers, was now rubbing against my leg, purring contentedly. I couldn't believe it. I had never been much of a cat person, but there was something about Mr. Whiskers that had won me over. Maybe it was the way he seemed to sense my nervousness and was trying to comfort me. Whatever it was, I was grateful for the distraction. As I continued to pet Mr. Whiskers, I felt my anxiety start to fade away, replaced by a sense of calm and tranquility. It was a feeling I hadn't experienced in a long time, and I was determined to hold onto it. I looked up at Serena, who was smiling at me, and felt a sense of gratitude towards her. She had been trying to get me to relax for weeks, and it seemed that her cat had finally succeeded where she had failed. I smiled back at her, feeling a sense of connection that I hadn't felt in a long time. As I sat there, surrounded by the quiet of the evening, I felt a sense of peace wash over me.

"Or maybe not quite. A distant bell rang, reminding me of a game Serena and I used to play as kids, a primitive substitution cipher we made up to gossip freely in front of our caregivers. We’d named it the butterfly alphabet, and","it mostly consisted of adding b- and f- syllables to normal words.

As I stood there, the sound of the bell brought back memories of those carefree days, and I couldn't help but wonder if Serena had ever thought about our old game. The butterfly alphabet had been more than just a simple cipher; it had been a way for us to create our own private world, a world where we could be ourselves without fear of judgment or reprisal. I smiled wistfully, remembering the countless hours we had spent perfecting our code, and the thrill of being able to communicate with each other in a way that no one else could understand. The memory was bittersweet, though, as it also reminded me of how much things had changed since then. We had grown up, and our lives had taken different paths, but the memory of our secret language remained, a reminder of the bond we had once shared."
"I didn’t scream, or cry, or attack that old hag.

I couldn't concentrate on anything, my mind kept wandering back to the old woman and her ominous warning. I felt like I was walking around in a daze, trying to make sense of what had happened, but the more I thought about it, the more questions I had. Who was she? What did she want from me? And what did she mean by those cryptic words? The not knowing was eating away at me, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that my life was about to change in ways I couldn't even imagine."

I wonder what she would say if she saw me now, standing in this empty room, feeling lost and alone. Would she tell me to snap out of it, to stop being so sentimental? Or would she listen, offering words of comfort and understanding? I'll never know, and that realization is almost too much to bear."

I think back to the conversation I had with my husband, Alex, just a few days ago. We were sitting in our old living room, surrounded by boxes and chaos, and he turned to me with a serious look on his face. ""Are you sure you're ready for this?"" he asked, his eyes searching mine for any sign of doubt. I nodded, trying to appear more confident than I felt. ""I was born ready,"" I said, forcing a smile. But now, as I stand in our new kitchen, I'm not so sure. The city is loud and overwhelming, and I miss the peace and quiet of our old life. I miss my friends and family, and the familiarity of our old routine. But I'm determined to make this work. I take a deep breath and let it out slowly, feeling a sense of resolve wash over me. I'll make this new life work, no matter what it takes."

The thread was old, but it led me to a used bookstore in the city that claimed to have a copy of the book in stock. I made a mental note to visit the store as soon as possible, and continued my search, scouring the internet for any mention of Moreland's life or work. It wasn't until I came across a blog post from a local historian, however, that I finally found what I was looking for: a brief but intriguing account of Moreland's time in the city, and a hint at the mysterious circumstances surrounding her departure."

"“That’s a bad word,” Ana says, giggling in a delighted, tickled way that",has me feeling like an improv genius. She’s flattering company. “What’s your name?”,"made her eyes sparkle with amusement, and for a moment, the tension in the room dissipated,",26,"made her eyes sparkle with amusement, and for a moment, the tension in the room dissipated, replaced by the infectious sound of her laughter, which seemed to dance in the air like a playful breeze on a summer day, bringing a sense of carefree joy to all who heard it."

The room erupts in a collective sigh of relief, and I feel a lump form in my throat as I realize that this little being is finally here, safe and sound. As I look around at the faces of the people I love, all of whom are beaming with joy, I feel a sense of gratitude wash over me. This is it, I think. This is what it means to be a family."
"It’s a barbecue, or a potluck, or a cookout—I never quite got the difference, despite Serena’s explanations on the nuances of Human social get-togethers.

I had, after all, chosen to leave my own kind behind, to walk in the daylight and feel the warmth of the sun on my skin. So I listened intently as Serena explained the rules of the gathering: bring a dish to share, don't drink too much, and for goodness' sake, don't bite anyone. I nodded and smiled, trying to appear nonchalant, but my stomach was twisting with anxiety. What if I messed up? What if I accidentally revealed my true nature? I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on the task at hand: making a dish to share. I had decided on a simple pasta salad, something I had learned to make from a cookbook. I carefully chopped the vegetables and mixed the dressing, trying to mimic the recipes I had seen on TV. As I worked, I couldn't help but think about how strange this all was. A vampyre, making a pasta salad for a human gathering. It was almost laughable. But I was determined to make it work, to prove to myself and to Serena that I could be a part of this world. I finished the salad and placed it in a bowl, covering it with plastic wrap. I took a step back and surveyed my handiwork, feeling a sense of pride. It looked...human. Now all I had to do was get through the gathering without incident."

As I continue to observe him from afar, I notice that he's not just standing still, but is actually moving slowly and deliberately, his eyes fixed on the ground as if he's searching for something. His movements are methodical and calculated, and I start to feel a sense of curiosity and intrigue. What could he be looking for? Is he a treasure hunter, a scientist, or simply a man on a mission?

It was as if I had been sleepwalking through our relationship, oblivious to the cracks that had been spreading, the fault lines that had been shifting, until the earthquake struck, and everything came crashing down."

I don't want that to happen with him. I want him to be able to be himself around me, without feeling like he has to put on a mask. But at the same time, I'm scared of what he might see. I'm scared that he'll look at me and see all the things that are wrong with me, all the things that make me different. I'm scared that he'll see the real me, and that he'll be repulsed. I'm scared that I'll lose him, that he'll walk away and never look back. And that fear is paralyzing me, making it hard for me to breathe, hard for me to think. I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff, staring down into an abyss, and I don't know if I have the courage to take the leap."

And when they finally caught up to each other, it was like the whole world had come to a standstill. They just stood there, staring at each other, and you could feel the connection between them like a palpable thing. I'd never seen anything like it. And then, just as suddenly as it had started, it was over. Koen's sister had found her mate, and nothing would ever be the same again. I remember feeling a pang of...I don't know, maybe it was jealousy, maybe it was longing. Whatever it was, it was a feeling I'd never experienced before, and it's stuck with me ever since. I've always wondered what it would be like to have that kind of connection with someone. To feel that kind of certainty and belonging.

As I prepare to set out on my mission, I can't help but wonder what other challenges and obstacles lie ahead, and whether I'm truly ready to face them head-on."
