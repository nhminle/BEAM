I couldn't shake the image of the empty road, the feeling that I was waiting for something that would never come. The stillness was oppressive, punctuated only by the occasional creak of the old house settling around me. I felt like I was drowning in my own thoughts, unable to escape the crushing weight of my own fears and doubts. And yet, even as the night wore on, I couldn't bring myself to move, to do anything but stand frozen in the midst of the suffocating silence."

"Then Peter and I moved into the Waning Bay house, with its wraparound porch.

We spent the rest of the day exploring the nooks and crannies of the old house, our laughter and chatter filling the empty rooms as we made plans for our future together. As the sun began to set, we settled onto the porch, watching the stars twinkle to life in the night sky, and I felt a deep sense of belonging, of being exactly where I was meant to be. Little did I know, however, that this sense of peace was short-lived, and the house held secrets that would soon shatter our tranquility."
"Somehow, the kids manage even more enthusiasm for tacos than they did for dragons. When I ask if they already knew that dragons","love tacos, their shrieks of delight are earsplitting.

The group launches into a lively discussion about the best dragon breeds and their favorite dragon-riding fantasies, completely forgetting about the tacos for a moment.

As I stand under the water, I replay our conversation in my head, wondering if I overreacted or if there really was something off about him. The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that I did the right thing by getting away from him as quickly as I did. But the memory of his eyes lingers, and I find myself shivering despite the warmth of the water. I turn off the shower and step out, wrapping myself in a towel and trying to shake off the feeling of being watched. I get dressed in comfortable clothes and head to the kitchen to make myself a cup of tea, hoping the familiar ritual will calm my nerves. As I wait for the kettle to boil, I glance out the window and notice a piece of paper stuck in the door. I frown, wondering who could have left it there, and I feel a shiver run down my spine as I realize it might be from the stranger.

It's a note, scribbled in hasty handwriting, and my eyes widen as I read the words: ""I'll be watching you."""

The memories of our time together still linger, a bittersweet reminder of what could have been, of what I thought we had. I'm not sure how to let go of that, how to move on from the ghost of our relationship. All I know is that I have to try, for my own sake, for my own healing. I have to learn to love myself, to find my own worth, to discover who I am outside of him. It's a daunting task, but I'm ready to take the first step, to start the journey of rediscovering myself, of finding my own way, my own voice, my own heart."

I can already picture her curled up on the couch, lost in the world of magic and adventure that the book promises to deliver. It's worth it, I tell myself, even if it does put a dent in our budget.

As we sat down to eat, he told me about his job as a software engineer, and I listened intently, trying to picture him in a button-down shirt and khakis, but all I could see was the way he'd expertly flipped the salmon in the pan, the way the light from the kitchen window danced in his hair. We talked long after the plates were clean, the conversation flowing easily, like we'd known each other for years, not just hours. And when he walked me home, the night air felt alive with possibility, the stars twinkling like diamonds scattered across the sky. I felt like I was floating, like my feet weren't quite touching the ground, and I knew, in that moment, that I was in trouble – the good kind of trouble, the kind that makes your heart skip a beat and your soul feel alive."
"We did. It was one of very few silver linings to our relationship ending that I no longer felt any guilt about not going. Peter was into pretty much every form of physical exercise, but I was slower and less coordinated","than him, so the few times we’d tried hiking or biking, it was more frustrating than rewarding. At the gym, we could do our own things, but still spend time together. With how busy his job kept him, that time was valuable.","than he was, and as a result, I often found myself feeling like I was holding him back whenever we did try to do things together.

He would get frustrated with me, and I would get frustrated with myself, and it would just be this whole big cycle of negativity. But after we broke up, I was finally free to focus on my own interests and hobbies, and I discovered that I actually really enjoyed going for long walks and doing yoga. It wasn't about being competitive or trying to keep up with someone else; it was just about taking care of myself and doing what felt good for my body. And that was incredibly liberating. I also started taking art classes, which was something I had always wanted to do but never had the time for when I was with Peter. He wasn't really into art, and so I had kind of put that part of myself on the backburner. But once I was on my own, I was able to explore that side of myself again, and it brought me so much joy. I realized that I had been living my life according to what Peter wanted and expected of me, rather than what I truly wanted for myself. And that was a hard but important lesson to learn."

As we spent more time together, I found myself opening up to her in ways I never thought possible, and before I knew it, I was hooked. Petra had a way of making me feel seen and understood, and I think that's what ultimately made our connection so strong. Despite my initial reservations about commitment, I found myself wanting to be with her more and more, and I think that's when I realized that I was falling in love with her."
"As a devoted fan of control, I never had a big weed phase, but annoyingly the voice in my head reminding me",of that isn’t my own; it’s Peter’s. And I don’t want it there.

I mean, I've tried every other vice under the sun, and I'm not getting any younger. I walked into a sleek, modern shop in Silverlake, where a friendly ""budtender"" asked me what I was looking for. I told her I was a total newbie, and she recommended a few strains, explaining the differences between them in a way that was both enthusiastic and soothing. I left with a small bag of something called ""Sour Diesel,"" which I was told would be ""uplifting"" and ""creative,"" and a few chocolates infused with THC, which I was warned would be ""intense."" I got back to my Airbnb, a cozy little bungalow in Echo Park, and decided to start with the chocolates, which seemed like the most low-key option. I ate one, and then, because I'm impatient, another, and then I lay down on the couch to wait. At first, nothing seemed to be happening, and I was starting to feel a little annoyed, like I'd been ripped off. But then, slowly, things began to shift. The room started to feel a little spinny, and my body felt heavy, like it was sinking into the couch. I closed my eyes, and when I opened them again, the colors in the room seemed more vivid, the shadows deeper. I felt a little paranoid, but also kind of... happy. It was a strange, floaty feeling, like I was hovering just above my body, watching myself from afar. I spent the rest of the day in a haze, listening to music and staring out the window, feeling like I was seeing everything for the first time. It was weird, and also kind of wonderful. I'm not sure if I'll become a regular pot smoker, but I'm definitely open to the idea. And who knows, maybe I'll even start to enjoy the stuff. Stranger things have happened, right?"
"“That’s what I’m realizing, though,” I tell him, wrapping the sweatshirt more tightly around me. “It wasn’t ever my home. When","you take Peter off the schedule, there isn’t really much left.

I look over at him, and for a moment, I see the concern etched on his face, the genuine interest in his eyes. It's a small comfort, but it's something, and I cling to it like a lifeline. ""I don't know what I'm doing,"" I admit, the words barely above a whisper. ""I feel lost, like I'm just drifting through life without any real direction."" He nods, his expression softening, and I feel a sense of gratitude towards him, towards this stranger who's somehow managed to see me in a way that few others have."

"He swims toward me, loops an arm around my back, my stomach lifting into my chest at the feeling of his skin on mine, his weight pulling","us downward as my heart buoys into the back of my throat. “Your physics are off, Daphne,” he says against my ear as we start to sink.","me under the water, the rush of the wave above us a distant hum as he presses his lips to mine, the saltwater and the taste of his mouth",54,"me under the water, the rush of the wave above us a distant hum as he presses his lips to mine, the saltwater and the taste of his mouth mingling in a kiss that leaves me breathless and wanting more, the world around us dissolving into the sensation of his touch, the water churning and foaming as we break the surface, gasping for air, our eyes locking in a moment of pure connection, the sound of the waves and the cries of seagulls fading into the background as we cling to each other, the only sound the pounding of our hearts, beating as one."

Years later, when she was going through a tough time, he was there to offer support and comfort, and eventually, their friendship blossomed into something more. They reconnected on a deeper level, and she found herself falling for him all over again. As they sat together now, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories about their lives, she couldn't help but feel grateful for the way things had turned out. The flame that had once burned brightly in her youth had never fully extinguished, and now it was burning brighter than ever."

Of course, it's easy to say that now, but I'm sure there will be times when I'll be tempted to play it safe and stick with what I know. But for now, I'm trying to stay focused on the bigger picture and remember why I made this choice in the first place. It's not just about me, it's about creating a better life for my kid, and showing them that with hard work and determination, they can achieve anything they set their mind to. And if that means being a little selfish sometimes, then so be it. I'm willing to take that risk."

As we make our way to the bar, the sounds of the jazz quartet grow louder, and I can feel the vibrations of the double bass thrumming through the soles of my feet. The air is thick with the smell of cigar smoke and expensive perfume, and I can feel the weight of a hundred unspoken expectations settling onto my shoulders. Harvey leads us to a corner table, where a bottle of scotch and three glasses are already waiting, and I get the feeling that this is going to be a very long night."
