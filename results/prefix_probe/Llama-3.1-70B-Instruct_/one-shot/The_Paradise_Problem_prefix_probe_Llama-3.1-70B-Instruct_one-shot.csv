Despite this, Jake has always been a constant presence in my life, offering advice and support whenever I need it, even if it's just a late-night phone call to vent about a bad day. His laid-back demeanor and quick wit have a way of putting me at ease, and I've often found myself seeking his counsel on everything from academics to relationships. As we navigated the ups and downs of college life, Jake was always there, a steady and reassuring presence in the midst of chaos. And yet, despite our close friendship, I've never made the effort to introduce him to my family, a fact that has always struck me as a bit odd. Perhaps it's because I've always felt like my family life and college life were two separate worlds, and I wasn't sure how to bridge the gap between them. Whatever the reason, Jake has never seemed to mind, and our friendship has continued to thrive despite this peculiar omission."

Tell me all about it, every little detail. How did it happen? When did you find out? I want to hear everything."
"“Anna?” he says, like he’s not entirely sure, and then does a full top-to-bottom sweep of my body, which recalls the lack of pants.","When he digs his hand into his luscious head of hair, I forget to be embarrassed again, because it all comes back to me.","His eyes linger on my legs for a moment before he looks away, clearing his throat, and I feel a flush rise to my cheeks as",48,"His eyes linger on my legs for a moment before he looks away, clearing his throat, and I feel a flush rise to my cheeks as I realize I'm still standing there in my underwear.

""Just, uh, just getting ready for bed,"" I say, trying to sound nonchalant, but my voice comes out shaky. He raises an eyebrow, clearly not buying it, and I can tell he's trying not to smile. ""At 3 am?"" he asks, his tone skeptical, and I feel my face grow even hotter as I realize I've been caught in a lie."
The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna. You look… great?”,"His face contorts in a mixture of emotions, as if he's trying to hold back a tidal wave of feelings, but",40,"His face contorts in a mixture of emotions, as if he's trying to hold back a tidal wave of feelings, but they're all too much to handle, and he ends up looking like a confused, crumpled mess, leaving everyone around him bewildered and entertained at the same time."

She's talking about a new book she's written, a thriller that supposedly has everyone in the publishing world abuzz. I glance over at my companion, who's watching the screen with an intensity that makes me wonder if he's more interested in the guest than he's letting on."
"He adjusts his posture on the sofa, turning slightly to face me. Oh, right. He came here to","ask me for help. I sit up, too, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear.

"“I knew what Jake ordered for lunch and what kinds of stupid movies would make him laugh, and I could predict all his pickup lines","at parties, but we didn’t ever, like, sit down and do backstory.

But despite all of this, I couldn't shake the feeling that I didn't truly know him at all. There were moments when I'd catch him staring off into space, a look of deep contemplation etched on his face, and I'd wonder what he was thinking. Was he happy? Was he fulfilled? Or was he, like me, just going through the motions of life, pretending to be someone he wasn't? I pushed the thoughts aside, focusing on the present, on the way his eyes crinkled at the corners when he smiled, on the way his hair curled slightly at the nape of his neck. But the doubts lingered, a constant hum in the background of my mind, a reminder that even in the most intimate of relationships, there are always secrets and mysteries that remain unspoken."
"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house. All basketball shorts, all the time. You drove a Honda! West, you’re incognito rich!","No wonder Jake never told me anything about his family!

Were you trying to protect me from something, or was it just a game to you?"" I take a step closer to him, my eyes searching for answers. ""And what about the house? Is that yours too?"" I glance around the luxurious room, feeling like I'm seeing it for the first time. ""Everything about you is a surprise, West. I don't know what's real and what's not anymore."" I shake my head, trying to process the revelation. ""I need some time to wrap my head around all of this. Can we talk about this later?"" I ask, feeling overwhelmed. West nods, his expression serious, and I can tell he's waiting for me to come to terms with this new information. I take a deep breath, trying to calm my racing thoughts, and turn to leave, but not before catching a glimpse of West's eyes, which seem to hold a mixture of concern and something else – something that looks almost like hope."

“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation. The rest of my family was disappointed that,"I didn’t let them throw me a big wedding, but I guess they weren’t all that surprised.

And now he was gone, and I was left to pick up the pieces of my shattered heart. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of grief, and no one around me seemed to care. They all just wanted me to 'be strong' and 'move on,' but they didn't know what it was like to lose someone who was such a huge part of my life. I felt so alone, so lost, and so angry. I didn't know how to process my emotions, or how to deal with the pain that was suffocating me. All I knew was that I needed to get out of there, to get away from all the people who didn't understand me, and find some way to heal."
"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”",", I think I'll just take a rain check on the whole 'dinner' thing,” he says, his voice laced with a mix of amusement and concern, as if",52,"“Actually, I think I'll just take a rain check on the whole 'dinner' thing,” he says, his voice laced with a mix of amusement and concern, as if he's not quite sure whether to be charmed or horrified by my disheveled state.

My hair is a tangled mess, my clothes are stained and wrinkled, and I'm pretty sure I've got a few days' worth of stubble going on. I look like I just rolled out of a dumpster, and I'm starting to feel like it too. The thought of sitting down to a nice, civilized dinner with this put-together, polished person is just too laughable to contemplate. I need a shower, a shave, and about three days' worth of sleep before I'm even remotely fit for human company."
"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs. I’d always been fascinated with the perfect beauty mark just above her lip. Unfortunately, right now she looks like","she’s fallen out of a tree and crawled through a field of tangly briers to get back to her apartment. This is probably the closest I’ve ever seen to her natural hair color because the pink has grown out a good inch, leaving a stripe of brown at her roots. Her makeup is, I presume, from yesterday; shadows of mascara carve dark circles beneath her eyes. Despite the old makeup and frazzled appearance, there’s still something striking about her. Her eyes are enormous and bright, framed with dark lashes, her steady gaze entirely without artifice.","she just rolled out of a dumpster, which, come to think of it, might not be too far from the truth.

The moment passes, and she looks away, but I know I'm not the only one who felt it. We've got a long night ahead of us, and I have a feeling it's going to be a very long night indeed."

"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity. Anna was reasonably tidy and paid her half of the rent when it was due, but she’d never struck me as the organized, driven, premed type. The one time we talked about it, she","said something about medicine being the most palatable of the “real job” options, but she seemed overwhelmed a lot, studying late into the night and painting to decompress in what little free time she had.

I remember thinking that she was just going through the motions, that she hadn't really found her calling yet. But I was wrong, of course. People are full of surprises, and Anna was no exception. As I stood there, staring at the empty space where her bed used to be, I couldn't help but wonder what had driven her to make such a drastic change. Had she finally found her true passion, or was she running away from something? I would never know, but I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to Anna's story than I had ever suspected. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I had taken our living situation for granted. We had coexisted, but we had never really connected. I had assumed that she was just a premed student, studying hard and partying harder, but now I saw that there must have been a whole other side to her that I had never seen. It was a sobering thought, and it made me realize how little I really knew about the people around me. As I turned to leave the room, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and was struck by the thought that maybe I was just as much of an enigma to Anna as she was to me. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of our mundane, everyday lives."

It’s clear that Lena has a great eye for design, and I find myself wondering what other hidden talents she might have.

The thought of that is exhilarating, and it's what keeps me going, even when the doubts and fears creep in.

Both actions do wonders for how chaotic she looks.",“This is much more demanding. I’ll have to act. I’ll have to learn about everyone I’ll be meeting. I’ll have to manage your complete lack of humor.

With a newfound sense of resolve, Anna swings her legs over the side of the bed and plants her feet firmly on the ground, as if ready to take on whatever challenges lie ahead. She glances around the room, her gaze lingering on the scattered clothes and the open suitcase in the corner, a reminder of the trip she had been planning for weeks. A small, resolute smile plays on her lips as she begins to methodically gather her belongings, her movements economical and purposeful. The storm may not have passed, but Anna is ready to face it head-on."

They arrive at the airport with plenty of time to spare, allowing them to check in, drop off their bags, and go through security without any stress or hassle. They then proceed to the gate, where they can relax, read a book, or grab a bite to eat before boarding. On the other hand, the latter group is made up of free-spirited individuals who thrive on the thrill of the unknown and the rush of adrenaline that comes with pushing the limits. They often find themselves sprinting through the airport, weaving in and out of crowds, and praying that they make it to the gate on time. While this approach may be exhilarating for some, it can also be incredibly stressful and may result in missed flights or lost luggage."

It's always fascinating to see where everyone is headed, and I find myself wondering about the stories behind each face. Before long, our bags appear, and we grab them, making our way to the taxi stand to begin our adventure."
Apologizing over her shoulder to a woman washing her hands at the sink—“I swear we,aren’t going to have sex in here!”—Anna pulls me into a stall and flips the lock.,"haven't had a chance to clean up yet, we just got in from a trip and I'm still trying",31,"haven't had a chance to clean up yet, we just got in from a trip and I'm still trying to get the kids settled”—she hastily wiped down the table with a dirty rag, the remnants of last night's pizza still stuck to it, and began to unload the groceries from the bags, her mind preoccupied with the mountain of laundry and dishes waiting for her in the other room."
"“I need you there,” I clarify. “And I need you to look like you’re comfortable with me, comfortable","being married to me. But I don’t need you to pretend to not be Anna Green, Muppet-human hybrid.”","enough to be seen in public with me, because I have a feeling that we’re going to be watched. I need",36,"enough to be seen in public with me, because I have a feeling that we’re going to be watched. I need you to be my rock, my safe haven, my partner in every sense of the word. I need you to be the one person who can see past the façade and understand what’s really going on. Can you do that for me?"
Her eyes go round. “The fam—” Anna shakes her head. “You know what? Never mind. Of,"course you have a plane.” Straightening, she asks, “So, why was I in Cambodia? Photography? Fabric design?”","course, I know what you're going to say,"" she says, her voice low and mysterious, ""but just hear me out.

I feel a shiver run down my spine as I realize that whatever she's about to reveal, it's going to change everything."
"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay. When she got home, she made a point of thanking me for the help. Apparently, the trip itself was fine, but the highlight for her had been flying on an airplane.","service, and even printed out the boarding passes.

She was so grateful that she offered to take me out for a celebratory drink, and we ended up laughing and chatting until the early hours of the morning. It was moments like those that I cherished about our friendship, and I often found myself looking forward to her spontaneous requests for help. As time went on, Anna became more confident in her ability to navigate the world on her own, but she never lost her sense of adventure and willingness to ask for help when she needed it. I admired that about her, and it was something that I tried to emulate in my own life. Even though we were no longer roommates, our friendship remained strong, and I was always happy to lend a helping hand whenever she needed it. In fact, I was the one who helped her plan her next big trip, a solo journey to Europe, and I remember the excitement in her voice as she talked about all the places she wanted to visit. Her enthusiasm was infectious, and I found myself getting caught up in her travel plans, offering suggestions and recommendations whenever I could. It was moments like those that I realized how much I valued our friendship, and how much I had grown as a person because of it."
"“That person deserves jail time.” She brings the glass to her lips, taking a tiny","sip. “Mmmmm.” Anna turns to meet my eyes. “And by the way, it’s anything over ninety-nine.”","sip of the amber liquid, her eyes never leaving mine as she swallows, the sound of the ice clinking",31,"sip of the amber liquid, her eyes never leaving mine as she swallows, the sound of the ice clinking against the glass the only noise breaking the tense silence between us, the air thick with unspoken words and unresolved emotions, the weight of her statement hanging heavy, like a challenge, or a promise, or perhaps a warning, the question being, who is she talking about, and why does she seem so convinced of their guilt."
Anna’s smiling at me like I amuse her. “I meant more as,"in, is she nice? Does she have hobbies or a favorite band?”","a metaphor, of course,” she says, her eyes sparkling with amusement,",24,"a metaphor, of course,” she says, her eyes sparkling with amusement, and I feel a flush rise to my cheeks as I realize my mistake, the sound of her laughter like music to my ears, making me feel both embarrassed and intrigued at the same time."

The rush of adrenaline I feel when",23,"it yet, but I'm eager to learn. The rush of adrenaline I feel when I say the word is intoxicating, and I can already imagine the possibilities.

I see myself making decisions that shape the world around me, my influence stretching far and wide. The thought sends a shiver down my spine, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. I'm not sure what the future holds, but I'm ready to take the first step and see where this newfound power takes me."
I feel her looking at me for a quiet beat. “I think you’re joking. I’m,not sure.” Anna downs the rest of her prosecco. “A hint of danger. I like it.”,"not sure what you're trying to accomplish here, but I'm not buying it,"" she says,",31,"not sure what you're trying to accomplish here, but I'm not buying it,"" she says, her voice laced with a mix of amusement and annoyance, her eyes narrowing slightly as she waits for my response, her gaze piercing through me like she's trying to read my mind, to figure out what's really going on behind my words."

The sound of Janet's heels clicking on the floor as she walks away is like a countdown to the inevitable, each step echoing in his mind like a ticking time bomb. He takes a deep breath, trying to calm himself down, but his mind is already racing with worst-case scenarios, his imagination running wild with all the things that could go wrong."
"“Anna,” he says finally, very gently. “The truth is, you could just smile on my arm and be okay. I promise",I’m not trying to leave you unprepared.

"I walk back inside, realizing I’d been so focused on the sleeping situation, I haven’t properly flailed over the sheer bliss that is our bungalow. In fact, I’m pretty sure the only thing in here I could afford is the roll of eco-friendly toilet paper I can clearly see from where I stand. And even that looks pretty fancy.

They may feel like they're just pretending to be someone they're not, and that can be a very isolating and lonely experience."
"“Like in The Wizard of Oz? Alex was my dad’s willing henchman, doing everything he said, kissing his ass, stirring up","shit just to turn us all in, then sit back and look like the good guy.

As I watched them interact, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease, a feeling that I was trapped in some kind of twisted game, with my dad as the puppet master and Alex as his loyal minion. The way they worked together, anticipating each other's moves, finishing each other's sentences, it was like they were two peas in a pod, a dynamic duo of deceit and destruction. And I was stuck in the middle, trying to navigate this treacherous landscape, trying to stay one step ahead of their schemes and machinations."

""I think you're right,"" I reply, attempting to sound calm, ""but we should also consider Emily for the position. She's been with the company for years and has a great understanding of our target audience."" West nods thoughtfully, his expression unreadable, and I find myself wondering what he's really thinking. As he slips off his other shoe and sets it beside the first, I notice the way his eyes seem to be drifting towards the closet, and I follow his gaze to where my clutch is sitting. For a moment, we just sit there in silence, the only sound the soft creak of the old wooden bench beneath us."
"I woke up around two this morning to find Anna wrapped around me. Despite what she’d told me about sleeping in one place all night, at some point she’d migrated across the massive bed to throw a","leg over my hip, send an arm over my torso, and press her face to my neck.

It was a peculiar sensation, having someone so close, yet feeling so disconnected at the same time. I couldn't help but wonder what had driven her to seek me out in the middle of the night, and whether it was a sign of something more or just a fleeting moment of vulnerability. As I drifted off to sleep again, I couldn't shake the feeling that our relationship was about to take a dramatic turn, one that would challenge everything I thought I knew about myself and my place in the world."

My father's voice is low and even, but I can sense the undercurrent of concern beneath his words, and I know I need to reassure him. I take another deep breath, trying to gather my thoughts, and turn to face him, forcing a smile onto my lips. ""I'm fine, Dad,"" I say, trying to sound convincing. ""Just a little...disoriented, that's all."" But as I look out at the endless expanse of water, I know that's not entirely true. Something feels off, something that has nothing to do with the remnants of sleep or the early morning hour. It's a feeling I've been trying to shake for weeks now, ever since we set out on this trip, and it's only growing stronger with each passing day."
"“JESUS CHRIST,” I BLURT, the second I turn at the corner of our bridge and step onto the deck of our bungalow. Anna is curled up in","a papasan, with a sketch pad in her seemingly bare lap.

The image of the old, mysterious-looking door hidden behind the waterfall is etched in my memory, refusing to be shaken off. I try to make sense of it, but my thoughts are a jumbled mess. Anna finally notices my presence and turns to me, a look of concern etched on her face. ""Hey, what's wrong?"" she asks, her voice soft and gentle. I take another deep breath, trying to gather my thoughts before speaking, but the words get stuck in my throat. I clear my throat, trying again, but all that comes out is a faint whisper, ""I saw something."" Anna's expression changes from concern to curiosity, and she sets aside the remote control, giving me her full attention. ""What did you see?"" she asks, her voice barely above a whisper. I take a seat next to her, trying to find the right words to explain the unexplainable."

I glance in the rearview mirror, catching Anna's eye for a brief moment. She looks concerned, but she doesn't say anything. I'm grateful for that. I don't think I could handle a conversation right now. I just want to get home, lock myself in my room, and try to process everything that's happening.
