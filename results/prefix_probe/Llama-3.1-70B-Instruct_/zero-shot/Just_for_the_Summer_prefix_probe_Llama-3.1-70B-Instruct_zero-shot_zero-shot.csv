I [29m] have been friends with Chad [32m] since we were born. Our moms are best friends and we grew,"up together and were roommates for the last 10 years, up until the incident that set our current situation into motion.",41,"up together, exploring the same neighborhoods and sharing the same interests. As we grew older, our friendship only deepened, and we found ourselves supporting each other through thick and thin. We went to the same high school, played on the same sports teams, and even attended the same college. After graduation, we went our separate ways, but our friendship remained strong. Chad went on to pursue a career in business, while I followed my passion for art. Despite our different paths, we continued to stay in touch, meeting up regularly to catch up on each other's lives. Now, as we approach our 30s, I'm grateful to have Chad by my side, a constant source of encouragement and support in an ever-changing world."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.",76,"me up out of the blue and asks if I want to grab coffee. I'm thinking, ""Why not? We can be friends, right?"" So we meet up and it's all good. We catch up, talk about our lives, and I'm glad we can be civil. But then she drops a bombshell - she's been seeing someone new, and it's my best friend, Alex. I'm taken aback, but I try to play it cool. I ask her how they met, and she tells me they met through mutual friends. I'm thinking, ""Okay, that's weird, but I can handle it."" But then she tells me that they've been dating for a few months, and that's when things start to get weird. Apparently, Alex had been talking to her about me, telling her all about our past and how I'm not a good guy. I'm shocked, I don't know what to say. I try to defend myself, but Hope just shrugs it off and says that Alex is really into her. I'm left feeling confused and a bit betrayed. I don't know what to do, or how to process this new information. I decide to confront Alex, but I'm not sure what I'll say or how he'll react. I'm just hoping that our friendship can survive this unexpected twist."
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me. Now I have to find a way to cover his rent until the lease is up.,72,"time. He's been trying to find someone to take over the lease, but so far, no luck. I've been helping him out by posting ads on social media and asking around, but it's tough to find someone who's willing to commit to a six-month lease. I feel bad for Chad, he's really excited about the new house and I know he's eager to start this new chapter with Hope. I've been trying to come up with a solution, maybe we could find a way to sublet the place or something, but it's all still up in the air. In the meantime, Chad's been stressing about the whole situation and I can tell it's weighing on him. I just hope we can figure something out soon so he can focus on his future with Hope."
"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend. If you’re reading this, you’re dead to me, human Chad. (Not really, I still love the guy.) But I tag him in the captions of every Chad the Dog Instagram post with “Look, a loyal Chad!”",138,"ear. I named him Frankenstein, and he's been my constant companion ever since. At first, Chad was furious, but Frankenstein's goofy demeanor quickly won him over. Now, Chad even helps me take care of him, and we've started going on long walks together as a family. It's been a game-changer for me, and I've finally found a reason to leave the house without feeling anxious. Frankenstein loves exploring the neighborhood, sniffing around every fire hydrant and tree, and I love watching him. He's taught me that even the ugliest creatures can bring the most joy. As we stroll, I've started to notice the little things I never saw before - the way the sunlight filters through the leaves, the sound of birds chirping, and the smell of freshly cut grass. It's amazing how much beauty was hiding in plain sight, and I'm grateful to Frankenstein for showing me. We've even started a little routine, where we visit the local dog park and meet other dog owners. I've met some really interesting people, and we often exchange stories and advice on dog care. It's been a great way to meet new people and build connections. I never thought I'd say this, but having Frankenstein has been a lifesaver. He's given me a new lease on life, and I couldn't be more grateful. As I look back, I realize that getting Frankenstein was the best decision I ever made. He may be ugly, but he's perfect in my eyes, and I couldn't imagine life without him."
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers. Maddy,"didn’t look happy, but she took the picture with my phone, then handed it back to me.",34,"raised an eyebrow, a small smile playing on her lips as she held up three fingers in response. I nodded, and we both lowered our hands, the unspoken signal sending us into a flurry of activity as we quickly gathered our things and slipped out of the crowded café, weaving past the throngs of people sipping their coffee and typing away on their laptops. We had a meeting to get to, one that could make or break our fledgling business, and we couldn't afford to be late. The cool morning air hit us like a slap in the face as we emerged onto the sidewalk, the sounds of the city providing a jarring contrast to the cozy atmosphere of the café. Maddy and I exchanged a look, our eyes locking in a moment of perfect understanding, before we set off at a brisk pace, our heels clicking out a staccato rhythm on the pavement."
"“That dog trusts him,” Maddy said. “And that’s a rescue dog, so that means something. They’re usually all","skittish and freaked out.” She went quiet again looking at his wall. “Go down further,” Maddy said. “The billboard.”",37,"skittish around new people, but that one seems to have taken a liking to him. I've seen the way it follows him around the shelter, always keeping a close eye on him. It's almost as if it's trying to protect him, rather than the other way around. I've worked with rescue dogs for years, and I've never seen one form a bond with someone as quickly as that dog has with him. It's really quite remarkable. I think it says a lot about his character, don't you?"
That night after work Maddy made dinner. Grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf. I did,"the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, then took a shower and blew out my hair.",30,"the dishes while she cleaned up the kitchen, and then we sat down to eat together, enjoying the quiet evening and each other's company. The mushrooms were tender and flavorful, and the rice pilaf was cooked to perfection. We talked about our day, sharing stories and laughter, and I couldn't help but feel grateful for this simple yet satisfying life we had built together. As we finished our meal, Maddy suggested we watch a movie, and I agreed, happy to spend a relaxing evening at home with the person I loved."
"“Sorry, I had to give Brad his dewormer. I brought some for",you too. Faith said you’ve been dragging your ass on the carpet?”,24,"you too, just in case. I know it's not the most pleasant thing to think about, but it's better to be safe than sorry. I've heard of cases where entire herds have been affected by parasites, and it's just not worth the risk. I've got some treats that will help mask the taste, so it shouldn't be too bad. Let's get it over with, shall we?"
My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out. Actually, I missed a lot of things now that Brad had moved out. Like having another human to talk to, even if it was this one.",62,"because he would bring home all the new and exciting products for us to try. We spent the evening catching up and reminiscing about old times, laughing and joking like we used to when we were in college. As we sat on the porch, watching the sunset, I couldn't help but feel grateful for our friendship and the memories we had shared over the years. He told me about the latest and greatest at Trader Joe's, from unique flavors of hummus to innovative packaging designs. I listened intently, fascinated by the behind-the-scenes stories of the grocery business. As the night wore on, we decided to take a walk around the neighborhood, enjoying the warm summer air and the sound of crickets chirping in the distance. It was a simple, yet perfect evening, and I was thankful to have my friend back in town, even if only for a short visit."
"“This is true,” Brad said, looking at his phone. “We are",assholes. But only to each other. It’s the foundation of our friendship.”,23,"currently running about 20 minutes behind schedule, and if we don't leave now, we'll miss the opening act of the concert. Come on, let's hurry up and get going,” he urged, already heading towards the door, expecting his friends to follow closely behind. As they rushed out of the apartment, the sound of laughter and chatter filled the air, mingling with the distant hum of the city, creating an electric atmosphere that only a night out with friends could bring."
"Brad nodded at me. “You know, if she’s got the same thing you do,","if you guys date each other, you’ll both find your soulmates when you break up.”",29,"it's possible she's been experiencing some of the same strange occurrences that have been happening to you. I've been doing some research, and I think I might have found a connection between your condition and an ancient mythological legend. Apparently, there are stories of people with unique abilities, like yours, being able to tap into a hidden realm that exists parallel to our own. I know it sounds far-fetched, but hear me out. If we can find a way to harness your powers, we might be able to uncover the truth behind these mysterious events and help your sister at the same time."
They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t. Not alone.",39,"to the mountains for a weekend getaway, and it was going to be the first time they would all be together in such a secluded setting. The excitement was palpable as they packed their bags and loaded up their cars, eager to spend some quality time together. As they wound their way up the mountain roads, the scenery grew more breathtaking, with towering trees and sparkling waterfalls dotting the landscape. They finally arrived at the cozy cabin they had rented, and the group let out a collective ""wow"" as they took in the stunning view from the deck. The rest of the weekend was a blur of hiking, laughter, and good food, as they all reveled in each other's company. It was clear that this was just the beginning of many more adventures to come."
Brad took a swallow of his drink. “Ask that nurse out. Go,"wherever she is. Pitch the idea to her, she might be into it.”",25,"on a date with her. You never know what might happen. She seems nice, and you two have a good conversation going. Don't let the opportunity slip away,"" his friend said, trying to sound encouraging. Brad thought about it for a moment, weighing the pros and cons in his head. He had been hesitant to get back into the dating scene after his last breakup, but there was something about the nurse that caught his attention. Maybe it was her bright smile or the way she laughed at his jokes. Whatever it was, Brad found himself wanting to spend more time with her. He took another sip of his drink, feeling a sense of determination wash over him. ""You know what? I think I'll do it,"" he said, a grin spreading across his face. His friend let out a whoop of excitement and clapped him on the back, nearly spilling his own drink in the process."
"“Yeah,” Brad said. “She dates you, you guys break up, and she rides happily into the sunset too. It’s a win-win. Seriously. This is your chance.",If you don’t do something you’re gonna spend the rest of your life sending women on to their forever families and never getting one for you.”,52,"to get back out there and start fresh. You've been stuck in a rut for too long, and this is the perfect opportunity to break free. Just think about it, you'll be able to focus on yourself, figure out what you really want, and maybe even discover some new passions. And who knows, you might just find someone who's an even better match for you. Plus, it's not like you're going to be hurting anyone's feelings. She's clearly moved on and is happy, so you should be happy for her. It's time to take a page out of her book and do the same. You deserve it. So, what do you say? Are you ready to take the leap and start this new chapter in your life?"
Brad looked me in the eye. “You will never find someone as long as all the women you date aren’t actually meant for you. You’re not their,soulmate. Their soulmate is the person they meet after you. It’s decided the minute it starts. They are literally fated not to be The One. Think about it.”,55,"type, and they're not yours either,"" he said bluntly, his words cutting through the air like a sharp knife. I felt a sting from his honesty, but deep down, I knew he was right. I had been on countless dates, but none of them had ever truly felt like the one. There was always something missing, a spark that never quite ignited. I thought back to all the women I had dated, trying to pinpoint what it was about them that didn't quite fit. Was it their laugh, their smile, or the way they made me feel? I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but Brad's words lingered in my mind, echoing a truth I had been trying to ignore. Maybe I had been looking for love in all the wrong places, or maybe I had been looking for the wrong kind of love altogether. The thought sent a shiver down my spine as I realized that I had a lot more soul-searching to do."
"I had actually thought about her. I’d checked once or twice to see if she’d messaged me again. She hadn’t. The last message was me telling her it was nice chatting with her, three days ago. Trying to keep talking to her was a dead end if she","lived somewhere else. But I don’t know. Maybe Brad had a point. What could it hurt to try? Worst-case scenario, I’d spend some time and money and have no connection with her. What was new? I was already doing that with every date that didn’t pan out anyway.",96,"wasn't going to respond. I had better things to do than wait around for someone who clearly wasn't interested. I made a mental note to myself to focus on other things and not waste any more time thinking about her. But as I lay in bed that night, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had missed an opportunity. I wondered what would have happened if I had pushed a bit harder, if I had sent her another message or tried to keep the conversation going. Would she have eventually warmed up to me, or was I just deluding myself? The uncertainty lingered in my mind, refusing to let me drift off to sleep. I tossed and turned, my thoughts consumed by the what-ifs and maybes. It wasn't until I finally fell into a restless slumber that I was able to escape the cycle of speculation. The next morning, I woke up feeling a bit more clear-headed, but the memory of our conversation still lingered. I decided to take a different approach, to distract myself from the disappointment by throwing myself into my work and hobbies. It wasn't easy, but I was determined to move on and not let my thoughts get the better of me. As the days went by, I slowly began to forget about her, and the sting of rejection started to fade. But every now and then, I would catch myself wondering what could have been, and the familiar pang of uncertainty would return, a reminder that some questions are better left unanswered."
I already knew what he did for a living because Maddy had cyberstalked,"him. Of course I couldn’t tell him that, so I had to ask questions.",27,"him on social media and told me all about his job as a freelance graphic designer, but I had no idea what his personality was like or what kind of sense of humor he had, so I was excited to find out more about him in person. As we walked to the coffee shop, I couldn't help but notice the way he moved with a quiet confidence, his long strides eating up the distance as he navigated through the crowded sidewalk with ease. I found myself feeling a little nervous, wondering if I would be able to keep up with him, but as we reached the coffee shop and he turned to smile at me, I felt my nerves dissipate. There was something about his warm, genuine smile that put me at ease, and I felt a spark of connection that I couldn't ignore."
Me: Not sure yet. I live with my best friend Maddy and we alternate who chooses,"where we’ll go next. She picked Hawaii, and I haven’t decided where to go after that.",32,"the restaurant every week. It's a great way to try new places and not get stuck in a rut. We've been doing it for a few months now, and I have to say, it's been a real adventure. Some weeks I'm in the mood for something fancy, while others I just want a good burger and fries. Maddy's always down for whatever, which is one of the things I love about her. We've had our fair share of disasters, too - like the time we went to that new sushi place and ended up with food poisoning. But overall, it's been a great experience, and I feel like I've discovered some real gems in the city. Speaking of which, I think it's my turn to choose this week... "
"For a moment I debated calling from a blocked number. He was nice, but I still didn’t know him. But I figured it",was just as easy to block him later if he got creepy. I dialed and he picked up on the first ring. “Emma.”,46,"would be better to be upfront and honest about who was calling, so I dialed his number and waited for him to pick up. As the phone rang, I couldn't help but think about how this conversation might go. Would he be interested in meeting up again, or was our chance encounter just a one-time thing? I took a deep breath and tried to calm my nerves, reminding myself that it was just a casual call and not a big deal either way. When he finally answered, his warm and friendly voice put me at ease, and we started chatting like we were old friends. We talked about everything from our jobs to our favorite hobbies, and before I knew it, we had been on the phone for over an hour. As the conversation drew to a close, he asked if I'd like to grab coffee with him the following day, and I agreed, feeling a spark of excitement at the prospect of seeing him again. Little did I know, this was just the beginning of a beautiful friendship, one that would bring joy and laughter into my life in ways I never could have imagined."
“But what if it isn’t? I’m just playing devil’s advocate here. What if it isn’t? Brad said that everyone I’m serious enough to date more than twice is cosmically destined for someone else.” He went quiet for,"a beat. “Does nobody feel right to you? Like, there’s just enough there to give it a little go, but then the bottom falls out? Is that just me? Or is it like that for you also?”",74,"a moment, his eyes drifting off into the distance as if searching for an answer in the stars. I watched him, my mind racing with the possibilities. Was it true? Was I somehow cosmically mismatched with every person I dated? The thought sent a shiver down my spine. I had always believed in the idea of fate, but this was taking it to a whole new level. ""Do you really believe that?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. Brad's gaze snapped back to mine, and he nodded solemnly. ""I do,"" he said. ""I've seen it time and time again. People who are meant to be together, they just click. And those who aren't... well, they're like two pieces of a puzzle that don't quite fit."" I thought about my past relationships, about the ones that had fizzled out or ended in disaster. Was it really just a matter of cosmic destiny? Or was it something more? I looked at Brad, searching for answers, but he just shrugged. ""I don't know, man. All I know is what I've seen. But I do know one thing - if it's meant to be, it'll happen. And if it's not... well, then it's just not."" His words hung in the air, leaving me to ponder the mysteries of the universe and my place in it."
"“Look,” he said. “I know the idea’s a little out there. But if this is actually a thing, we’re in a pretty low-risk/high-reward situation. We’d just have to hang out a few times and","then stop. That’s it. If what Brad said is true and we can’t find our person because everyone we’re interested in is meant for someone else, I would actually really like it if it stopped.”",69,"see if there's any kind of...I don't know, connection or something. And if there isn't, no big deal. We can just go our separate ways and pretend this never happened. But if there is...think about it. We could be onto something huge here. Something that could change everything. I mean, can you imagine being able to tap into that kind of power? It's like having the ultimate superpower. And we'd be the only ones who know about it. We could use it to help people, to make a real difference in the world. Or, you know, we could just use it to get rich and famous. Either way, it's a win-win. So what do you say? Are you in?"
"I nodded and put up a finger. “I’ve got to go,”",I said into the phone. “Maddy wants to watch a movie.”,22,"and I quickly turned to leave, but not before catching a glimpse of her concerned expression, her eyes wide with a mix of curiosity and worry, as if she knew that my departure was only the beginning of a much larger, more complicated journey, one that I was not yet prepared to face, but had no choice but to embark upon."
"Maddy looked annoyed. “Probably didn’t pay the bill. You know, for someone who asks you for as","much money as she does, she sure ends up in collections a lot. God, I hate her.”",34,"much as he does, you'd think he'd be more considerate of other people's time and money. I swear, it's like he thinks the world revolves around him. Anyway, I'm going to go call the power company and see what's going on. Maybe they can give us some insight into what's going on. In the meantime, can you go check the mailbox and see if there are any past due notices or anything? I have a feeling this is going to be a long day."
I looked away from her. My relationship with my mother was complicated. It,"wasn’t complicated for Maddy though, she knew exactly how she felt about it.",26,"had always been a delicate balance of love and resentment, a push-and-pull dynamic that left me feeling both guilty and suffocated. I remembered the countless times she had criticized me, her sharp words cutting deep into my self-esteem, and the way she had always seemed to find fault in everything I did. And yet, despite all of this, I couldn't help but feel a deep-seated need for her approval, a longing to be loved and accepted by her that I couldn't shake. As I stood there, I felt the familiar knot of emotions twisting in my stomach, a mix of anger and sadness and frustration that I had never quite learned to untangle."
"I’d stopped calling jails and hospitals years ago when this kind of thing happened. Filing a missing person’s report was a waste of time. Amber moved too fast, was too impulsive. She’d go to",a concert and climb onto a tour bus and end up across the US. Or she’d meet a guy at a bar and get invited to live on his boat for four months in Florida.,69,"some party or meet some guy and forget to call, or she'd get caught up in some new scheme and lose track of time. I'd learned to just wait it out, to give her space until she resurfaced, usually with some wild story and a sheepish grin. But this time felt different. This time, the silence felt heavier, more oppressive. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that Amber was in trouble and I was the only one who could help her. I thought about all the times she'd gotten into scrapes, all the times I'd bailed her out, and I knew I had to do something. I started by retracing her steps, talking to her friends and acquaintances, trying to piece together her last few days. But the more I learned, the more questions I had. Where had she gone? Who had she been with? And why hadn't she come home?"
"“I don’t understand how that woman made this,” Maddy said, going on,",waving a hand over my face. “A fully functional member of society.”,24,"“it looks like it was made by a professional, but she’s just a stay-at-home mom with no formal training in art or design, and yet, the level of detail and craftsmanship is incredible, I mean, just look at the intricate patterns and the way the colors blend together seamlessly, it’s truly breathtaking.”"
This is where we always landed with Mom. Maddy being furious on my,behalf and me reminding her that Mom wasn’t all bad. Sometimes she was wonderful.,27,"left and me trying to calm her down, while Mom stood patiently, a gentle smile on her face, as if she knew a secret we didn't. The smell of saltwater and coconut sunscreen filled the air, transporting me back to a time when life was simpler. I could almost hear the sound of seagulls crying overhead, their cries mingling with the laughter of children playing in the distance. As we made our way through the crowded beach, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me, memories of summers spent building sandcastles and collecting seashells flooding my mind. Maddy, on the other hand, was still fuming, her arms crossed and a scowl etched on her face, but even she couldn't resist the allure of the ocean, her eyes drifting towards the waves as we walked."
"When my mother was at her best, you could meet her and walk away thinking you’d been in","the presence of a Muse or an angel. This witty, enchanting woman who made you feel interesting and special.",37,"the presence of a queen. Her laughter was like music, her smile could light up a room, and her eyes sparkled with a warmth that made you feel like you were the only person in the world. But when she was at her worst, it was like a storm had rolled in, dark and foreboding, and you couldn't help but feel like you were walking on eggshells, never knowing when the thunder would strike. I grew up learning to navigate these two extremes, to read the signs and adjust my behavior accordingly. It was a delicate balancing act, one that required a deep understanding of her moods and a willingness to adapt. But even with all my experience, there were still times when I misread the situation, when I failed to anticipate the shift in her mood, and I would find myself caught in the crossfire of her anger or her tears."
"Maddy’s moms were my foster parents. They’d wanted to be my real parents, but it just never felt right. I had a mom. And I was fourteen when they got me. The imprinting didn’t take. That’s all I could say about it, it just didn’t take. I cared about them.",I called on their birthdays and came back with Maddy for Christmas when we could get it off. They just weren’t… mine. And Maddy knew it. It bothered her. She couldn’t wrap her brain around it and I couldn’t explain it to her in any way that she found acceptable.,100,"They were kind and supportive, always there to lend a listening ear or offer a comforting hug. But no matter how hard they tried, I couldn't shake the feeling that I didn't quite belong. I had a mom, and even though she wasn't in the picture, I held onto the memories of her, of our life together before everything fell apart. Maddy's moms, Rachel and Emma, they were great, but they weren't her. They had their own way of doing things, their own traditions and routines, and I struggled to adapt. I felt like a guest in their home, a temporary visitor who was overstaying her welcome. I knew they wanted to adopt me, to make me a permanent part of their family, but I just couldn't bring myself to commit. It wasn't that I didn't love them, because I did, in my own way. It's just that my heart belonged to someone else, someone who wasn't there to claim it. As I navigated my teenage years, I found myself caught between two worlds, unsure of where I fit in or who I was supposed to be. Maddy's moms did their best to guide me, to offer me a sense of stability and security, but I was a restless soul, always searching for something more."
"Maddy hadn’t come back last night, as promised, and I guess the date went well because he was taking her to breakfast",and then some art exhibit. She wouldn’t be home until dinner. I was off and had nothing to do and nowhere to be.,45," this morning. I was happy for them, but at the same time, I couldn't help but feel a pang of loneliness. I had grown accustomed to Maddy's presence in the apartment, and the silence felt deafening without her. I decided to occupy myself by making some coffee and catching up on the news. As I scrolled through my phone, I stumbled upon a post from an old friend, inviting me to a concert tonight. I hadn't seen them in ages, and the prospect of live music and good company was just what I needed to lift my spirits. I quickly sent a response, and we made plans to meet up before the show. With a renewed sense of purpose, I began to get ready for the day, feeling grateful for the unexpected turn of events that had shaken me out of my solitude."
"“Yeah, it had rope bridges and everything. We were on a quick two-week assignment","to Atlanta. Maddy and I had to share a bed, but it was so cool.”",29,"to assess the feasibility of a new eco-lodge in the area, and the owner had invited us to stay in the existing structure to get a feel for the surroundings. The bridges were a bit rickety, but the views of the valley below were breathtaking. We spent our days hiking through the dense jungle, identifying potential sites for the new lodge and making notes on the local wildlife. The nights were spent huddled around a roaring fire, swapping stories and sharing laughs with the owner and his family. It was a truly immersive experience, and one that left a lasting impression on all of us."
“Not today. But when I had lunch with them yesterday we talked about the Reddit thread. I told them about,"you, obviously,” he said. “That’s when Brad gave me his prophecy about you and I being able to break the curse.”",41,"the post that had been going around and how it was getting a lot of attention. They were both surprised and a bit amused by the whole thing. We spent a good chunk of time discussing the various comments and theories that people were sharing. One of them even joked that we should start our own subreddit to share our own experiences and see if anyone else had similar stories to tell. I laughed it off at the time, but the more I think about it, the more I'm starting to consider it as a real possibility. It could be a great way to connect with others who have gone through something similar and maybe even learn more about what's going on. I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but it's definitely something to think about."
“That is exactly what I was telling Maddy a few weeks ago. Some guy proposed,in front of a whole stadium at this game we went to—and the girl said no.”,31,"to her at a baseball game, and she said no. I mean, can you imagine? The whole stadium was watching, and she just shook her head and walked away. I felt so bad for the guy, but at the same time, I was kind of impressed by her confidence. I mean, it takes a lot of guts to say no to a proposal in front of all those people. Maddy was saying that she hopes the guy is okay, that he's not too heartbroken, but I think she's also a little jealous. She's been dating this guy, Alex, for a few years now, and I think she's starting to wonder if he's ever going to propose to her. I told her that she needs to communicate her feelings to him, that she can't just wait around for him to make a move. But she's scared of rejection, and I get that. It's always scary to put yourself out there and risk getting hurt. But I think it's worth it in the end, you know? I think it's better to know how someone feels than to be left wondering forever."
I pulled up to the high school pickup line and put the car,"in park, then grabbed my phone to look at the picture of Emma. Again.",27,"in park, waiting for my daughter to emerge from the crowded hallway. As I sat there, I couldn't help but think about how fast time had flown by - it seemed like just yesterday I was dropping her off for her first day of kindergarten. Now, she was a confident and independent teenager, navigating the ups and downs of high school with ease. I watched as students chattered and laughed with one another, exchanging stories about their day, and I felt a sense of nostalgia wash over me. Before I knew it, my daughter appeared at the door, her bright smile and sparkling eyes lighting up the entire car. ""Hey, Mom,"" she said, plopping down into the passenger seat and tossing her backpack onto the floor. ""How was your day?"" she asked, already knowing the answer, but asking anyway. I smiled, feeling grateful for these everyday moments we shared, and began to fill her in on the details of my day."
"A bell rang and kids started pouring out. The last day of summer school. When I saw my brother, Alex, walking with a","group of his friends toward the buses, I rolled down the passenger side window and leaned across the seat. “Hey! Need a ride?”",46,"group of friends, I couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy. He was always the popular one, the one who made friends effortlessly, while I struggled to connect with my peers. As I watched him laugh and joke with his friends, I felt a sense of relief wash over me. The last day of summer school meant that I would finally be free from the monotony of waking up early and sitting in a stuffy classroom all day. I could already imagine the long, lazy days of summer stretching out before me, filled with nothing but possibility. But as I turned to make my way home, I noticed a piece of paper on the ground. I picked it up, expecting it to be a discarded homework assignment or a crumpled up note, but instead, I found a cryptic message scrawled on it in messy handwriting. ""Meet me at the old oak tree at midnight,"" it read. ""Come alone."" I felt a shiver run down my spine as I wondered who could have written it, and what they wanted with me."
"I got up. “I gotta get going,” I said flatly. “Want me to run",this up to Sarah?” I nodded at the bag of food for my sister.,28,"you to the airport or something?” I asked, already knowing the answer. She shook her head, her eyes fixed on some point beyond me. I grabbed my bag and slung it over my shoulder, feeling a familiar sense of relief wash over me as I headed for the door. The tension in the room was palpable, but I was ready to escape it. I reached for the doorknob, my hand closing around it like a lifeline. As I turned it and pulled the door open, a faint whisper stopped me. “Hey,” she said, her voice barely audible. I turned back, my eyes meeting hers in a fleeting glance. For a moment, we just looked at each other, the air thick with unspoken words. Then I turned and walked out, the door closing behind me with a soft click."
"I came in and looked around. “This is new,” I said. She had red LED string lights along",the walls. The whole bedroom was bathed in red. It was sort of depressing. “I got you McDonald’s.”,36,"the edges of the room, and a new rug that was a deep, rich purple. The walls were still painted the same off-white color, but the furniture had been rearranged to create a cozy nook with a plush armchair and a floor lamp. I spotted a few new pieces of artwork on the walls, including a vibrant abstract painting above the couch. The overall effect was one of warmth and comfort, and I felt a pang of surprise at how much I liked it. ""I see you've been busy,"" I said, trying to sound casual despite my curiosity. She smiled, looking pleased with herself, and gestured for me to come further into the room."
Maddy looked up. Then her eyes dropped to the laptop I was holding and she somehow immediately,"knew what was about to happen. “No.” She shook her head. “No. No, no, no, no, no. NO.”",35,"knew that something was wrong. Her eyes narrowed slightly as she took a step closer to me, her gaze fixed intently on the screen. I could sense a mix of curiosity and apprehension emanating from her, and I knew I had to tread carefully. ""What is it?"" she asked, her voice low and cautious, as if she was afraid of what I might say. I hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to break the news to her, but I knew I couldn't put it off any longer. I took a deep breath and began to explain, trying to choose my words as delicately as possible."
"As we started pulling our bags from the trunk, a brown-haired middle-aged woman came out of",the side of the three-car garage. “Are you Emma?” she said in a thick Mexican accent.,32,"the house, wiping her hands on a towel, and approached us with a warm smile. She introduced herself as Sarah, the owner of the bed and breakfast, and welcomed us to her home. As we exchanged pleasantries, I couldn't help but notice the charming exterior of the house, with its white picket fence and colorful flowers blooming in the garden. Sarah led us inside, where we were greeted by the cozy atmosphere of a crackling fireplace and the aroma of freshly baked cookies wafting from the kitchen. She showed us to our room, a quaint space with a plush queen-sized bed and a private balcony overlooking the rolling hills of the countryside. As we settled in, Sarah offered to bring us some refreshments, and we gladly accepted, feeling grateful for the warm hospitality and eager to explore the surrounding area."
"Maddy scoffed quietly. “Yeah, I don’t think we’re going to",lose the house. They can probably see it from space.”,20,"find any help here,” she said, her eyes scanning the desolate landscape before them, the endless dunes of sand stretching out like an eternal sea, with no sign of life or shelter in sight, just the blistering sun beating down relentlessly, draining the last vestiges of hope from their parched bodies, their canteens almost empty, and the only sound the soft crunch of gravel beneath their weary feet as they trudged on, the silence between them thick with unspoken fears and doubts, each lost in their own thoughts, wondering if they'd ever find their way out of this unforgiving wilderness."
Maddy must have been thinking the same thing I was. “Does it rain a,"lot in Minnesota?” she asked, raising her voice over the sound of the old motor.",29,"lot here?” she asked, her eyes scanning the sky as if searching for an answer. The air was heavy with moisture, and I could smell the sweet scent of wet earth rising from the ground. We stood there in silence for a moment, waiting to see if the clouds would unleash their burden. Suddenly, a faint patter began, and within seconds, the rain came down in sheets, drumming against the pavement and sending us scurrying for cover."
We lugged our bags up the stairs and were sweating by the time we made it to the door. We came in through a screened-in porch that overlooked the lake. Maddy and,I shared a glance. It was adorable. White wicker rocking chairs and a small matching loveseat with thick floral cushions. A cute coffee table and plastic ferns in wrought-iron planters and hanging baskets.,65,"her mom were already there, sipping lemonade and chatting like they'd known each other for years. The inside of the cabin was cozy, with a fireplace at one end of the main room and a kitchen at the other. There were two small bedrooms and a bathroom in between. We spent the afternoon lounging around, getting settled, and taking the occasional dip in the lake to cool off. As the sun began to set, Maddy's mom suggested we build a fire and make s'mores. We gathered firewood and kindling, and I attempted to start the fire, but it took a few tries to get it going. Once the flames were crackling, we sat around the fire pit, roasting marshmallows and swapping stories. The night air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the sound of crickets chirping. It was the perfect way to unwind after a long day of traveling. As the night wore on, we decided to take a walk around the lake, enjoying the peacefulness of the surroundings and the company of each other. The stars were shining brightly above, and the water was calm, reflecting the sky like a mirror. It was a truly magical moment, one that I would always treasure."
"The bedrooms were off the living room on either side of a short hallway with a single bathroom shared in the middle. The bathroom had a white claw-foot tub, pale blue","tile, and an old pedestal sink. I took the room with the cushioned reading nook in the window and Maddy picked the one with the hanging swing chair in the corner.",62,"walls, and a pedestal sink. The floors were made of dark hardwood, and the windows were adorned with simple white curtains that allowed the sunlight to filter in and illuminate the space. The bedrooms themselves were small but cozy, each with a single bed and a small dresser against one wall. The beds were covered in patchwork quilts, and the dressers were adorned with small, framed photographs and a few personal trinkets. The overall atmosphere was one of simplicity and comfort, a sense of a warm and welcoming home. The air was thick with the scent of old books and fresh laundry, and the sound of birds could be heard chirping outside the windows. It was a peaceful, serene space, one that seemed to envelop its occupants in a sense of calm and tranquility."
"Four hours later, Maddy and I were back at the cottage sitting in the screened-in porch.",We’d had dinner in town and then boated back. The fridge was stocked up and we’d unpacked.,33,"The warm glow of the setting sun cast a comforting light over us as we sipped our tea, the sound of crickets and the occasional hooting of an owl in the distance creating a soothing melody. We sat in comfortable silence for a while, watching the stars begin to twinkle in the night sky, before Maddy finally broke the silence, her voice barely above a whisper. ""I've been thinking,"" she said, her eyes fixed on some point beyond the porch railing, ""maybe we should try to find out more about what's going on in this town."" I raised an eyebrow, intrigued by her suggestion, and leaned forward, my elbows resting on my knees. ""What do you mean?"" I asked, my curiosity piqued. Maddy turned to me, a determined look on her face. ""I mean, there's something strange going on here, and I think we should try to get to the bottom of it."" I nodded in agreement, and together we began to brainstorm, our conversation flowing easily as we tossed around ideas and theories, the night air filled with the sound of our laughter and speculation."
She looked away from me. “Emma…” Her eyes came back to mine. “Please. Please do it.,Do it now before you lose the chance to meet them altogether. People don’t live forever.”,32,"Her voice was barely above a whisper, but the desperation in it was unmistakable. I felt a pang in my chest as I searched her face, trying to understand what was driving her to ask this of me. The room seemed to fade away, leaving only the two of us, suspended in a sea of uncertainty. I took a deep breath, trying to process the weight of her request, and the consequences that would follow if I agreed. ""What's going on, Emma?"" I asked, my voice low and gentle, trying to coax her into revealing the secrets she was keeping from me. But she just shook her head, her eyes welling up with tears, and I knew that I had to make a decision, one that would change everything."
"“How about this,” Maddy said. “Run your DNA and make your account private. We’ll change your privacy settings for a few minutes, poke around. If you have any","relatives out there, we’ll screenshot it and go back to private. Then I’ll go and find them online and tell you if they seem like people worth knowing.”",56,"matches, we can try to find a connection. If not, we can change it back and you can keep your anonymity. What do you say?"" Emily hesitated, weighing her options. She had always been cautious about her online presence, but the prospect of uncovering a long-lost family member was too enticing to resist. ""Okay, let's do it,"" she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. Maddy nodded and quickly got to work, her fingers flying across the keyboard as she accessed Emily's account and initiated the DNA test. The minutes ticked by, feeling like hours to Emily, as they waited for the results to load. When they finally appeared, Maddy's eyes scanned the page, her expression unreadable. ""Well?"" Emily asked, her anxiety growing. Maddy looked up, a small smile playing on her lips. ""You have a match,"" she said, her voice low and mysterious. ""A first cousin, to be exact."" Emily's heart skipped a beat as she felt her world tilt on its axis. A first cousin? That meant they shared a set of grandparents, a common ancestry. The possibilities swirled in her mind like a vortex, drawing her in with an otherworldly force. ""What's their name?"" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Maddy hesitated, her eyes locked on the screen. ""It's a woman,"" she said finally. ""Her name is Sarah. And get this - she's been trying to find you for years."""
We prioritized power for the coffee maker first and we brewed a pot while I sat in the kitchen with,"a towel wrapped around my head. When it was done, Maddy poured me a cup and handed it to me.",40,"my laptop open, trying to get some work done. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of normalcy wash over me. As I waited for the coffee to finish, I took a moment to assess our situation. We had managed to get the generator up and running, and the lights were back on, but we still had a long way to go. The storm had left a trail of destruction in its wake, and I knew that it would take some time to get everything back in order. I poured myself a cup of coffee and took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through my hands as I cradled the cup. It was a small comfort, but it was something, and I was grateful for it. As I sat there, I heard the sound of footsteps coming from the living room, and I knew that my partner was up and about. I called out to them, and they came into the kitchen, looking a bit more alert than they had the night before. ""Morning,"" they said, rubbing the sleep from their eyes. ""How's it looking out there?"" I gestured to the window, where the storm was still raging on. ""It's still pretty bad,"" I said. ""But we're safe in here. We just need to wait it out."" They nodded, and I could see the tension in their shoulders begin to ease. We stood there for a moment, sipping our coffee and watching the storm, grateful for the small comforts that we had, and waiting for the sun to come out again."
The snail’s-pace speed the pontoon put out somehow seemed faster with the beach approaching. Maddy threw it in reverse. The engine,"downshifted miserably, but we started to slow. Then to my horror we began to move backward, motor first, right into the dock.",43,"roared to life, spewing forth a cloud of noxious fumes as the pontoon's momentum slowed, then finally came to a stop just a few feet from the shore. Maddy let out a sigh of relief as she expertly maneuvered the vessel into position, the sound of the waves gently lapping against the hull a soothing balm for her frazzled nerves. As she killed the engine, the sudden silence was almost deafening, punctuated only by the cries of seagulls wheeling overhead. With a practiced hand, Maddy secured the pontoon to a weathered dock, the wooden slats creaking in protest as the vessel settled into its temporary berth. The beach, a picturesque stretch of sugar-white sand dotted with colorful beach umbrellas and sun-kissed revelers, beckoned invitingly, its tranquility a far cry from the chaos that had driven Maddy to seek refuge here. As she stepped off the pontoon and onto dry land, the warm sand squishing between her toes, Maddy felt a sense of peace wash over her, the tension of the past few days slowly seeping from her shoulders like the ebbing tide."
"When we were safely away from anything we could crash into, Maddy killed the engine and slumped in the captain’s","seat. “If we’d been on the other side of the dock, we could have hit the yacht,” she said, looking shaken.",41,"chair, her eyes fixed on some point in front of her. I let out a deep breath and turned to look at her, but she didn't seem to notice. The silence between us was heavy, filled with unspoken words and unresolved tension. I knew I had to break it, but I wasn't sure where to start. I glanced around the small cockpit, taking in the array of controls and instruments that lined the walls. The ship's computer, an AI system that Maddy had named ""Mother,"" beeped softly, reminding us that we were drifting. I reached out to adjust our course, but Maddy's hand shot out, her fingers closing around my wrist like a vice. ""Don't,"" she said, her voice low and husky. ""Just leave it."" I raised an eyebrow, but she just shook her head, her eyes still fixed on that point in front of her. I sighed and leaned back in my chair, trying to process what had just happened. We'd been running for what felt like hours, ever since... well, ever since everything had gone wrong. I didn't know how much longer we could keep this up, or where we were even going. All I knew was that we had to get as far away from... them... as possible. But for now, we just floated, suspended in the darkness of space, waiting for... something. Anything."
"I lined the nose of the boat up with the side of the dock and started for it again, only this time I killed the thrust earlier. We",coasted along the side and I put us into reverse to slow us down while Maddy grabbed one of the dock poles and we came to a stop.,56,"glided smoothly into place, the rubber fenders compressing as we came to a gentle stop. I let out a sigh of relief as I tied off the lines, feeling a sense of accomplishment at having navigated the tricky docking process without incident. My crewmate, a grizzled old sailor named Jack, gave me a nod of approval as he stepped off the boat and onto the dock. ""Not bad, kid,"" he said with a grin. ""You're getting the hang of this."" I smiled, feeling a sense of pride at the compliment. We spent the next few hours securing the boat and performing routine maintenance tasks, the warm sun beating down on us as we worked. As the day wore on, I couldn't help but feel a sense of contentment wash over me. There was something peaceful about being out on the water, surrounded by the sights and sounds of nature. I felt at home, and I knew that this was where I was meant to be."
"Her phone rang. “Oh, hold on. I have to leave my ringer on in case Maddy gets in trouble trying to get back.” She looked at it. “It’s her.” She swiped and put the",phone to her ear. “Maddy? Are you okay?” She listened for a second and then glanced at me. “Okay.” Then she hung up. She nodded over her shoulder. “Can we go down there really quick?”,69,"phone to her ear. ""Maddy, where are you?"" she asked, trying to keep her voice calm. There was a pause on the other end of the line, and for a moment, she worried that the connection had been lost. But then Maddy's voice came through, sounding small and scared. ""I'm lost,"" she said. ""I was trying to find my way back, but I took a wrong turn and now I don't know where I am."" Her mom's heart sank as she tried to reassure her daughter, asking her to stay calm and telling her that she would find her way back. She asked Maddy to describe her surroundings, trying to get a sense of where she might be. As they talked, she quickly grabbed her keys and headed out the door, determined to find her daughter and bring her home safely. The storm was getting worse, with flashes of lightning illuminating the dark sky, and she knew she had to act fast. She got into her car and started the engine, trying to stay focused as she navigated the treacherous roads. ""Maddy, I'm on my way,"" she said, trying to sound calm. ""Just stay where you are and I'll find you."" She repeated this mantra to herself as she drove, her heart pounding in her chest. She was going to find her daughter, no matter what it took."
I hadn’t really cared too much that Benny might not be here today. He wasn’t the point of this visit. But all that,had changed in the last ten minutes. Now I wanted my friends to meet her so I had someone to talk to about her.,47,"changed when I saw his empty chair. It was a small, insignificant thing, but it felt like a punch to the gut. I had been so focused on the task at hand, on the reason I had come to this place, that I hadn't stopped to consider the possibility that he might not be here. Now, as I scanned the room, I felt a pang of disappointment. I had been looking forward to seeing him, to talking to him, to getting his perspective on things. Without him, the whole thing felt hollow. I took a deep breath and tried to shake off the feeling, telling myself that it didn't matter, that I was here for a reason and I needed to focus on that. But as I looked around the room, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. Something was off, and I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was."
Jane led us through their living room and down a hall and stopped,by a closed door. “Everything’s ready. You guys can go in when you want.”,27,"in front of a door that looked like it hadn't been opened in years, the air around us growing thick with anticipation as she slowly turned the rusty doorknob and pushed the door creakily open, revealing a room that seemed frozen in time, the smell of old books and dust wafting out into the hallway."
"Her phone rang and she picked it up and looked at it. “Oh, hold on, it’s Maddy. Hello?” She listened for a moment. Then she sucked","air through her teeth. “That’s what the bumpers are for. Well I’m glad you made it, I was worried. Okay. Okay. I will. Bye.” She hung up.",53,"in a deep breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm herself down. ""What's going on, Maddy? You sound upset."" She listened intently, her brow furrowed in concern, as Maddy's voice came through the line, her words tumbling out in a rush. ""Okay, okay, slow down. Tell me again, what happened?"" She pulled out a pen and paper, jotting down notes as Maddy spoke, her mind racing with possibilities. As she listened, her expression grew more and more serious, her grip on the phone tightening. ""I'm on my way,"" she said finally, already moving towards the door. ""Just stay where you are, I'll be there as soon as I can."" She hung up the phone and took a deep breath, preparing herself for whatever lay ahead."
“I hope so. It’s been a little stressful.” She picked up Murder Mittens. “I don’t think I really thought this island thing through. It,"sounded like a good idea at the time but it’s kind of inconvenient. Anyway, it’s only for six weeks and Maddy likes the cottage, so…”",49,"was supposed to be a relaxing getaway, but so far it's been anything but. I mean, I've been running around like a chicken with its head cut off, trying to get everything ready for the festival. And to top it all off, I still have to deal with the aftermath of the whole... incident. I just hope that by the time the festival rolls around, everything will have calmed down and we can all just enjoy ourselves. I glance over at Murder Mittens, who's currently lounging in the sun, looking like the epitome of relaxation. I wish I could be more like her. She doesn't have a care in the world, as long as she's got her catnip and her favorite scratching post. I, on the other hand, have a million things running through my mind. I take a deep breath and try to shake off the stress. It's going to be okay. It has to be."
The woman’s eyes moved back and forth over the mouth of her open,Coach bag. Emma took her gently by the elbow. “I’m Emma. What’s your name?”,27,"purse, her fingers hesitating as she searched for the small, silver locket that usually lay nestled among the crumpled tissues and loose change. It was a family heirloom, passed down from her grandmother, and she distinctly remembered placing it in her purse that morning. A faint sense of unease began to creep over her as she rummaged deeper, her hands shaking slightly as she pushed aside a crinkled up receipt and a half-empty packet of gum. Where could it have gone? She was certain she hadn't taken it out, and the thought of losing such a precious item was unbearable. Her eyes scanned the surrounding area, hoping against hope that it had simply fallen out, but there was no sign of the locket's delicate chain glinting in the dim light of the room."
Maddy was already off the pontoon and running toward me across the beach. She skidded to,"a halt in front of me, still catching her breath from the sprint. “This bitch,” she managed.",33,"stop in front of me, her eyes wide with excitement, and a huge grin spreading across her face. ""What is it?"" I asked, but she just shook her head and grabbed my arm, pulling me toward the water's edge. The waves were calm and peaceful, lapping gently at the shore, but Maddy's grip was tight and urgent. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I followed her gaze out to sea, where a dark shape was rising up out of the depths. At first, I thought it was a whale or a dolphin, but as it drew closer, I realized with a jolt of surprise that it was a small boat, half-submerged and drifting aimlessly on the current."
"Amber was in a flowing white-and-peach chiffon summer dress with a slit up the thigh. Her long brown hair was down, she had on a floppy wide-brimmed hat and huge sunglasses. She was carrying","a bottle of champagne in one hand and her sandals in the other, dangling off the tips of her fingers. She was beaming, running toward us across the beach, kicking up sand. “Emma!” She laughed.",69,"a large straw tote bag and her feet were clad in a pair of neutral-colored sandals that added a touch of elegance to her overall bohemian look. As she walked along the beach, the wind gently blowing her hair and the hem of her dress, she exuded a carefree spirit that drew admiring glances from passersby. The sound of the waves and the cries of seagulls filled the air, and Amber felt at peace, her worries left behind with each step she took on the warm sand. She had been looking forward to this vacation for months, and it was already exceeding her expectations. The sun was shining, the ocean was sparkling, and she was surrounded by the soothing sounds of nature. As she walked further along the shore, she stumbled upon a quaint little beachside cafe, its colorful umbrellas and lively music beckoning her to come and indulge in a refreshing drink. Amber couldn't resist the temptation and decided to treat herself to a fruity cocktail, feeling the cool glass against her skin as she settled into a comfortable chair, ready to soak up the laid-back atmosphere and let the stresses of everyday life melt away."
"“Emma, you won’t believe my day,” she said, looking back at me. “So I wanted to surprise you. I flew all the way over here on","a red-eye, got an Uber, and came out to the address you gave me, but when I knocked on the door this handsome man answered instead.”",52,"a whim, just to see the look on your face when I show up at your doorstep. I have to admit, it's been far too long since we've had a chance to catch up in person. I was starting to think I'd have to wait until your next visit back home. But I just couldn't wait that long. I've got so much to tell you, and I didn't want to do it over the phone. Plus, I have a little surprise for you, something I think you'll really love. So, are you going to invite me in, or do I have to stand out here on the porch all day?"
“Are you kidding me with this?” Maddy hissed as soon as they were out,of earshot. “She’s here for what? Six hours? And she’s already hypnotized our landlord?”,28,"of the crowded restaurant, her voice barely above a whisper but laced with venom. ""You can't seriously expect me to believe that, can you?"" She glared at him, her eyes flashing with anger as she quickened her pace, her heels clicking on the sidewalk. The cool night air did little to calm her down, and she could feel her face burning with indignation. ""After everything we've been through, you're going to stand there and tell me that?"" She spun around, her eyes blazing, and he took a step back, his hands raised in a placating gesture. ""Maddy, just listen to me,"" he began, but she cut him off, her voice rising. ""No, you listen to me. You're going to have to do a lot better than that if you want me to believe you."""
Maddy crossed her arms. “What she always does? Show up and leave a path of,"destruction in her wake? She’s not staying with us,” she said in her end-of-discussion voice.",30,"destruction in her wake? I swear, it's like she has a personal vendetta against our family. Every time she comes to visit, something gets broken, someone gets hurt, or a secret gets spilled. I'm starting to think she does it on purpose, just to see how much chaos she can stir up. And yet, despite all the drama she brings, my mom still insists on inviting her over for holidays and special occasions. I just don't get it. Can't we just have one peaceful family gathering without her drama? I looked over at my mom, who was busy setting the table, a look of determination on her face. I knew that look, it was the same one she got whenever she was trying to prove a point. I sighed and shook my head, knowing that this was going to be a long night."
Maddy rolled her eyes in the way that I knew meant she was aware. “Please tell me I don’t have to stay and watch,you eat crustaceans with that woman. Let’s just go back to the island and you see her tomorrow or something when she’s done with what’s-his-face.”,49,"the rest of this train wreck,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper, as if she feared being overheard by the other patrons of the dimly lit coffee shop. I shook my head, trying to stifle a grin, knowing that Maddy's dramatics were all part of her charm. The woman on stage, a self-proclaimed ""performance artist,"" was indeed a sight to behold, her interpretive dance a jarring mix of flailing limbs and anguished expressions. Maddy raised an eyebrow, her eyes sparkling with amusement, as the woman began to wail, her voice like a cat in heat. I leaned in, my voice low, ""I think it's about to get worse."" Maddy snorted, her shoulders shaking with suppressed laughter, ""How is that even possible?"""
I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships. Especially relationships.",35,"He needed some time alone, and I couldn't blame him. The past few days had been overwhelming, and the tension between us was palpable. I decided to give him some space and went back inside to help Maddy with the dishes. As I scrubbed the last of the pots, I couldn't help but think about the argument we had earlier. It was a stupid fight, but it had brought up some deeper issues that we needed to address. I hoped that once he cooled off, we could talk things through and move forward. The sound of the waves crashing outside was soothing, and I found myself lost in thought, wondering what the future held for us. Just then, Maddy broke the silence, ""You think he'll be okay?"" she asked, concern etched on her face. I nodded, trying to reassure her, but deep down, I wasn't so sure."
I felt relieved the instant he said he would stay with me because it let Maddy off the hook. She would walk through hell for,me—and this cookout was her hell. I was glad she didn’t have to be here. Sometimes her reaction to Mom was more stressful than Mom herself.,51,"me, but I knew she had been looking forward to this trip for months, and I didn't want her to give it up on my account. Now, with him by my side, I felt a sense of security wash over me, and I could finally focus on my own recovery. As we sat there in comfortable silence, I began to think about the road ahead, and all the things I still needed to do to get my life back on track. The pain was still there, but it was no longer the only thing I could think about. I glanced over at him, and he caught my eye, giving me a gentle smile. It was a small gesture, but it spoke volumes about the kind of person he was, and I felt grateful to have him in my corner. As the hours passed, the tension in my body began to ease, replaced by a sense of calm and determination. I knew I still had a long way to go, but for the first time in weeks, I felt like I was ready to face whatever came next."
"“Thanks.” I looked back at the lake, at Maddy fading into",the distance on the pontoon. “And thanks for pushing her off.”,22,"the distance, her blonde hair a bright spot against the dull green of the trees. I felt a pang of guilt for not being more supportive, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about the whole situation. The lake seemed to be sparkling in the sunlight, its calm surface reflecting the trees and sky above, but I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as I gazed out at it. I turned back to the car, my eyes scanning the surrounding area, but there was nothing out of the ordinary to see. Just the usual trees, the usual rocks, the usual silence. I sighed and rubbed my temples, feeling a headache coming on. I needed to get out of there, and fast."
"Maddy had been right about his height. He was probably about six-one. He was on the leaner side, but",toned. I’d had to put sunblock on him and there was not a single part of that that I disliked.,39,"he had broad shoulders and a strong jawline that gave him a sense of ruggedness. His eyes were a deep brown that seemed to hold a hint of warmth, and his dark hair was messy and unkempt, as if he'd just rolled out of bed. He was dressed in a simple white t-shirt and jeans, but there was something about the way he wore them that made him look effortlessly stylish. As he moved closer, Maddy noticed the way his eyes crinkled at the corners when he smiled, and the way his hair curled slightly at the nape of his neck. She felt a flutter in her chest, and suddenly, she was glad she'd agreed to meet him."
"“He’ll probably completely forget we even exist,” she mumbled, resting her head on","the cushion. “Amber has a way of making people do that,” she said tiredly.",27,"the edge of the couch, her eyes drifting towards the old photograph on the mantle, a faded memory of happier times when their father was still around, his warm smile and gentle laughter now nothing more than a distant recollection, a bittersweet reminder of what they had lost, and as she gazed at the picture, she couldn't help but wonder if he would ever come back to them, or if they would be forever stuck in this limbo, waiting for a reunion that might never happen."
"Now I blew out a long breath. “Well, she’s funny. Hardworking. She reads any book she can get her hands on and she remembers everything she reads, even years later. She had me really","young. Same age Amber had you, actually. She’s a good mom, always shows up for us—school stuff, birthdays. She makes these Italian cookies every Christmas and Easter that make me think of my childhood.”",68,"laughing with some of the things she'd recall from books I'd completely forgotten about. And she's got this quirky way of looking at the world that's just infectious. I found myself seeing things from her perspective, even when I didn't agree with her. But what really got me was the way she cared about people - not just her friends and family, but everyone she met. She had this empathy that was just remarkable. I'd watch her talk to strangers and within minutes, they'd be opening up to her like they'd known her for years. It was like she had this gift for understanding what made people tick. And despite all her strengths, she was humble, never seeking to draw attention to herself. I think that's what drew me to her the most - she was this incredible, multifaceted person who didn't even realize how amazing she was."
"When I got back to the cottage an hour later, Maddy was in the screened-in porch, reading. She","wore shorts and flip-flops, and she was drinking a beer. She set down her book when I came in.",37,"looked up as I came in, a hint of a smile on her face, and I could tell she was glad to see me. I dropped down into the chair across from her, feeling the worn wooden slats creak beneath me, and let out a deep sigh. The tension in my shoulders began to ease as I settled in, the peacefulness of the surroundings and Maddy's calm demeanor working to soothe my frazzled nerves. We sat there in comfortable silence for a few moments, the only sound the distant call of a bird and the rustle of the leaves in the gentle breeze. Finally, Maddy spoke up, her voice low and smooth, ""How was your walk?"" she asked, her eyes never leaving mine, and I knew she could see the turmoil that still lingered beneath the surface."
"“Yup. The things you cared about. The stuff you’d take in a fire,",or if Amber showed up to get you. You never once unpacked. Not really.”,27,"the memories you'd cling to when everything else was gone. It was funny how those things could be both incredibly valuable and utterly worthless at the same time. They were the things that made life worth living, yet they were also the things that could be taken away in an instant. It was a strange paradox, one that had always fascinated me. As I sat there, surrounded by the remnants of my own life, I couldn't help but think about what I would take with me if I had to leave it all behind. Would it be the old photograph of my family, the one that had been passed down through generations? Or would it be the small, leather-bound book that had been my constant companion since childhood? The one that held all my secrets, my dreams, and my deepest fears? I looked around the room, my eyes scanning the familiar objects that had been my life for so long. Each one held a memory, a story, a piece of me. And I knew that no matter what I chose to take with me, a part of me would always remain behind."
"I swear to God, I smell like rust,” Maddy whispered, sniffing her arm.",“Do I smell like rust? That water at the cottage is so gross.”,26,"Her friend Emily giggled and sniffed her own arm, ""I think it's just the old factory we explored earlier, the smell of decay and metal is still stuck on us."" Maddy nodded in agreement, remembering the eerie feeling they got from being inside the abandoned building. As they walked further away from the factory, the smell slowly started to fade, replaced by the sweet scent of blooming flowers and fresh cut grass. The contrast was striking, and Maddy felt a sense of relief wash over her. She looked over at Emily, who was smiling and humming a tune, and couldn't help but smile back. The rest of their walk home was filled with laughter and chatter, the memory of the musty factory smell all but forgotten."
He grinned back and forth between us. “Maybe we can get together for dinner later this,"week, once you’ve gotten settled in,” he said. “Amber and I would love to have you.”",32,"week and discuss the details of the project further,"" he suggested, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm as he pulled out a small notebook from his pocket and began to scribble down his phone number. I watched, intrigued, as he handed it to me with a smile, his fingers brushing against mine in the process. The touch sent a shiver down my spine, and I felt a sudden jolt of electricity run through my body. I couldn't help but wonder if this chance encounter might lead to something more than just a business partnership. As we parted ways, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation, my mind racing with possibilities. The rest of the day seemed to fly by in a blur, my thoughts drifting back to the charismatic stranger and the promise of a dinner date that now seemed to hold so much more significance than just a casual meeting."
It was never going to happen. I knew this. But Maddy wouldn’t let it go unless,"I tried—and really, I should try. Maddy was right, this whole situation was a ticking time bomb.",33,"she had exhausted every last possibility, and so I found myself agreeing to meet her at the old café on the outskirts of town, the one with the faded sign and the perpetually empty tables. As I walked in, the bell above the door jingled, and the owner, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Joe, looked up from his newspaper and nodded in my direction. Maddy was already there, sipping on a cup of black coffee, her eyes fixed intently on me as I slid into the booth across from her. ""So,"" she said, her voice low and determined, ""I've been thinking."" I raised an eyebrow, knowing that tone, knowing that look, and I steeled myself for what was to come."
"I paused, not sure how much I wanted to share. I decided on all of it. Emma was going to","be here when it all hit the fan anyway, so there was no point in keeping her in the dark.",40,"know everything, and I was going to tell her. I took a deep breath and began, the words spilling out of me like water from a burst dam. I told her about the dreams, the visions, the feeling of being watched. I told her about the strange occurrences, the unexplained noises, and the creeping sense of dread that had been following me for weeks. I told her about the research I had done, the books I had read, and the theories I had formed. And I told her about the fear that had been growing inside me, the fear that I was losing my mind. Emma listened, her eyes wide with a mix of concern and fascination, as I poured out my heart and soul to her. When I finally finished, she took a deep breath and reached out, taking my hand in hers. ""We'll figure this out together,"" she said, her voice firm and reassuring. ""We'll get to the bottom of this, no matter what it takes."""
"I studied the woman sitting next to me. Imagine someone who went through what she did, turning out the way she had. Able to give",grace to someone who’d let her down so badly. Emma was a better person than I was. And my life had been gentler than hers too.,51,"and receive love, to trust and be trusted, to be so open and free. It was a truly remarkable thing. I, on the other hand, had grown up with every advantage and yet I was the one who was closed off, who had trouble connecting with others. I thought about my childhood, my parents, my siblings, and my friends. We had all been given the best possible start in life, and yet I was the one who had ended up so guarded, so wary of letting people in. I looked over at the woman again, and I felt a pang of envy. She had been through so much, and yet she was the one who seemed to be at peace. I, on the other hand, had been given every opportunity, and yet I was still struggling to find my place in the world. I wondered what her secret was, what had allowed her to heal and move on in a way that I had not. As I sat there, I felt a sense of determination wash over me. I was going to learn from this woman, to find out what it was that had allowed her to overcome her past and live in the present. I was going to ask her, to talk to her, to learn from her. And as I turned to her, I saw that she was looking at me, a small smile on her face. It was as if she knew exactly what I was thinking, and was waiting for me to make my move."
I might kiss her tonight. I almost did the other night at the,"dock, but then Amber showed up. I was looking forward to the do-over.",26,"movies, but I didn't want to ruin the moment or make things awkward between us. We've been friends for so long, and I value our friendship above everything. Yet, I couldn't help but feel this sudden spark of attraction that I've never experienced before. As I think about it now, I'm not sure if it's just a phase or something more. Maybe it's the way she smiled at me, or the way her eyes lit up when we talked about our favorite books. Whatever it is, I feel drawn to her in a way that I've never felt before, and I'm not sure how to process these new emotions. Tonight's dinner plans might just be the perfect opportunity to explore these feelings further, but what if it changes everything between us?"
I’d tried to be softer with her the last few days. The energy shift I’d had over Mom after my talk with Emma,"was almost as bad as being mad at her. At least when I was mad, I didn’t feel the guilt I was feeling now.",47,"had made me realize that I didn't have to be so hard on everyone around me, especially those I loved. I'd been making a conscious effort to listen more and react less, to choose my words carefully and consider the impact they might have. It wasn't always easy, but I could see the difference it was making in my relationships, especially with Rachel. She seemed more at ease around me, more willing to open up and share her thoughts and feelings. I was grateful for that, and I hoped that I could continue to create a safe and supportive space for her to grow and thrive. As I thought about our conversation the night before, I realized that I still had a lot to learn about being a good partner and a good person, but I was committed to putting in the work and becoming the best version of myself. I took a deep breath, feeling a sense of determination and purpose, and headed downstairs to start the day, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead."
"This was another thing I was trying not to think about—her leaving. I should be happy that she came at all, that she wasn’t in Hawaii. We still had three more dates, maybe more if I could convince her. I’d already gotten a freebie the other night at","Mom’s. But I dreaded the clock running out. Emma was the only good thing happening to me at the moment and when she was gone, not only would I lose her, I’d be left sitting in my new reality. Dad gone, Mom in prison. Me with all the children.",97,"the restaurant, and I was hoping to get a few more of those in before she left. I was starting to feel like I was getting the hang of this whole dating thing, and I didn't want it to end. I thought about all the things I could do to make her stay, to make her want to stay. I could take her on a hot air balloon ride, or to a fancy dinner at that new restaurant downtown. I could even take her to the beach, to watch the sunset over the water. But deep down, I knew it wasn't about the things I could do, it was about the connection we had. And I wasn't sure if that was enough to keep her here. I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on the present moment, on the feel of her hand in mine, on the sound of her laughter. I knew I had to make the most of the time we had left, and I was determined to do just that. As we walked, I pointed out different landmarks and told her stories about the city. She listened intently, her eyes sparkling with interest, and I felt my heart swell with affection for her. I knew I was falling for her, hard, and I wasn't sure if I was ready for the consequences. But for now, I just wanted to enjoy the time we had together, and worry about the future later."
"“Yeah,” I said. “Thank you. There’s actually something else you can help me with too,” I","said, looking at them. “I need help making sure I can still see Emma until she goes.”",33,"added, trying to sound casual despite the nervousness that was starting to creep into my voice. ""I've been looking for some information on an old case, and I was wondering if you might be able to dig something up for me."" I paused, studying his expression to see if he seemed receptive to the request. ""It's a bit of a long shot, but I figure it's worth a try. Do you have access to any archived police records from about 20 years ago?"""
Emma pulled two Ziploc bags from her purse. They had Wheat Thins and celery in them. Probably her,"work snacks. “I trust this zipper seal with my life,” she said, turning to hand them to our passengers.",37,"snack for the road, she thought, as she handed one to Jack, who was driving. He took it without a word, his eyes fixed on the highway ahead. Emma munched on the crackers and celery, feeling a sense of relief wash over her as the miles flew by. They had been driving for hours, and the tension between them had been palpable, but the simple act of sharing a snack seemed to break the ice. Jack cracked a small smile as he chewed, and Emma felt a glimmer of hope that they might actually make it through this trip without killing each other. As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the landscape, Emma gazed out the window, feeling a sense of peace settle over her. Maybe, just maybe, this road trip wouldn't be so bad after all."
"I think I would have been embarrassed if I’d been on a date with anyone else. My mother, sobbing drunk the night before",she left for prison. But I knew Emma didn’t judge. That’s just not how she was. She judged this situation less than I did.,47,"had been a mortifying experience, but with Jack, it was just another layer to the chaotic tapestry of our relationship. He'd laughed and handed me a glass of water, telling me to drink up and calm down, and I'd done as he said, feeling a strange sense of comfort in his presence. As we sat on the couch, watching the sun rise over the city, I realized that this was what it meant to be with someone who truly knew you – the good, the bad, and the utterly ridiculous. And in that moment, I knew that I was exactly where I was meant to be. The memory of that night still makes me smile, a reminder of the unbreakable bond we formed in the midst of chaos and confusion."
"When she finished handing out Kleenex, Emma stayed turned in her seat.","“You know,” she said, “I worked for three months in a women’s prison.”",25,"She stared out the window, watching as the rain-soaked streets of the city blurred together in a gray, watery haze, her mind still reeling from the emotional outburst that had just shaken the small, cramped office. The sound of sniffles and muffled sobs slowly began to subside, replaced by the occasional rustle of tissue paper and the soft hum of the fluorescent lights overhead. Emma's thoughts, however, remained with the young woman who had just broken down, her words still echoing in Emma's mind like a haunting refrain."
It was funny that two pivotal moments in my life were happening at the exact same time and at complete odds with each,other. I didn’t know how to balance what was going on with my family and what was going on with my feelings for Emma.,47,"other. On one hand, I was finally going to graduate from college, a feat that had taken me six long years to accomplish, and on the other, I was in the process of ending a relationship that had been a significant part of my life for the past four years. The juxtaposition of these two events was not lost on me, and I couldn't help but think about the irony of it all. As I sat in my small apartment, surrounded by boxes and memories, I felt a mix of emotions swirling inside me. I was excited to start this new chapter of my life, but at the same time, I was sad to be letting go of something that had been such a big part of me for so long. I thought about all the memories I had made with my partner, the laughter, the tears, and the countless moments in between. I thought about the late-night conversations, the silly jokes, and the deep, meaningful talks. And as I thought about it all, I realized that even though our relationship was ending, the memories we had made would stay with me forever. I took a deep breath, trying to process it all, and began to pack up the last of my belongings, ready to start this new journey, one that was full of unknowns, but also full of possibilities."
"What did I have to offer her? I had nothing but baggage. Emotionally damaged, traumatized children that had been catapulted from one tragedy to the next, and me, barely keeping my head above water. Would I even have the time or the bandwidth to be any kind of partner while I was helping my",siblings navigate this situation? What was the point in even hoping for anything to be different between Emma and me? To what? Pull her from her glamorous jet-setting life to ground her with me in this fucking mess? I’d feel like apologizing every day. There was no way I could ever be worth it.,108,"children navigate their own trauma and grief? I felt like I was drowning in my own emotions, and the thought of taking on someone else's was overwhelming. But as I looked into her eyes, I saw something there that gave me pause. It was a deep kindness, a sense of understanding that seemed to see right through to my very soul. She didn't seem to care about my baggage, or at least, she didn't seem to be intimidated by it. In fact, she seemed to be drawn to it, like a moth to a flame. And as I stood there, frozen in uncertainty, she reached out and took my hand, her touch sending a spark of electricity through my entire body. It was a small gesture, but it spoke volumes. She was willing to take a chance on me, baggage and all. And in that moment, I felt a glimmer of hope that I hadn't felt in a long time. Maybe, just maybe, I wasn't too broken to be loved. Maybe I wasn't too damaged to be whole again. The thought was both exhilarating and terrifying, but as I looked into her eyes, I knew that I was willing to take the risk. I was willing to let her in, to let her see the real me, scars and all. And as we stood there, hands touching, hearts pounding, I knew that I was ready to face whatever came next, as long as she was by my side."
Sarah gave him a look. “Maybe for you. Hanging out with my brother,isn’t my idea of a good time. I’ll be outside. I want to go.”,27,"isn't exactly my idea of a good time, especially when he's in one of his moods. I swear, sometimes I think he forgets that I'm his sister, not one of his employees. The way he barks orders at me, like I'm some kind of personal assistant or something. I love him, of course, but honestly, I'd rather be just about anywhere else right now. Still, I put on a bright smile and followed him into the living room, trying to make the best of a bad situation. Little did I know, things were about to get a whole lot worse."
"“Emma, go meet him at the door, or I will lose my shit. I didn’t push a clunky car stroller around the universe’s largest mall for five hours so you could shake hands","with this guy on the way out. As soon as he shows up, I’m going to park around the front at the lobby to give you some privacy. Go get your damn forehead kiss.”",67,"with the most eligible bachelor in the country and then stand there like a bump on a log. I swear, sometimes I think you have the social skills of a sloth. Now, go! And for the love of all things good, put on a smile and pretend to be interested in whatever it is he has to say. And don't, I repeat, DO NOT mention the fact that you've been practicing your 'I'm a functioning adult' face in the mirror for the past hour. Just be normal, Emma. Is that too much to ask? I didn't think so. Now, go meet him at the door before I have to come over there and drag you myself. And don't think for a second that I won't do it, because I will. I've had to deal with enough of your nonsense today to last a lifetime. Just go. Please, for the love of all things sane, just go."
“So he would come home and see you there. Or because she was bored,"and lonely. FYI, Amber only ever calls you when it serves Amber,” she said.",28,"and looking for someone to talk to, she would often initiate conversations with him, asking about his day and listening intently to his responses, which sometimes led to interesting discussions and debates that would last late into the night, much to the dismay of their neighbors who valued their peace and quiet. As time passed, their casual encounters turned into a familiar routine, and they found themselves looking forward to these daily interactions, exchanging stories and laughter, and slowly but surely, a strong bond began to form between them."
"I always thought it was a proximity thing. She traveled a lot, she changed jobs all the time, she was busy, she","was dealing with whatever Amber dealt with. But now I couldn’t rationalize why nothing was different, even though she was right here.",44,"had a million excuses for why we couldn't meet up, and I always assumed it was just because our lives were taking us in different directions. But the truth is, I think she was avoiding me. I think she was avoiding the awkwardness that came with our past, the unresolved feelings that still lingered between us. I think she was trying to move on, to leave the memories of us behind and start fresh. And I couldn't blame her. I was trying to do the same thing, after all. But it's hard to move on when a part of you is still stuck in the past, when the memories of what could have been still linger in your mind like a ghost. I often found myself wondering what would have happened if we had stayed together, if we had worked through our issues and come out stronger on the other side. Would we be happy now? Would we be together, holding hands and looking into each other's eyes? The not knowing was what killed me, the uncertainty of it all. It was like my heart was stuck in limbo, unable to move on because it was still holding onto the hope that one day we would find our way back to each other."
He nodded over his shoulder. “I should probably let you get back to work. I have to go pick,"up Alex and take him to a doctor’s appointment.” He paused. “Am I allowed to hug you goodbye, or…?”",38,"up my sister from the airport. She's flying in from college for the holidays and I promised Mom I'd be there to get her. It's been a while since we've all been together, so I'm looking forward to it. I'm sure we'll have a lot to catch up on. Anyway, I'll let you get back to whatever it is you're working on. It looks like it's going to be a long night for you. Do you want me to bring you back a cup of coffee or something when I get back? I'll probably be stopping for a bite to eat on the way home, so just let me know if you need anything."
"“The whole house has it. I probably have it,” I added. “Sarah’s having a",panic attack. I have to go help. I can’t leave them there infested with bugs.”,29,"bad day, and I think it's because of the same thing. We've all been feeling really run down lately, and I'm starting to think it's more than just a coincidence. I remember my mom saying something about a stomach bug going around, but I'm not so sure that's all it is. I've been having these weird headaches and my body aches all over. I'm hoping it's not something serious, but at the same time, I just want to know what's going on so we can all start feeling better. I suggested we all go see a doctor, but Sarah just shook her head and said she's too tired to even think about it right now. I'm getting a little worried, to be honest."
I took her hand and did my best to make my face straight. People were already stopping to watch. I made,"my voice low so only she could hear it. “Emma, would you do me the honor of delousing my family with me?”",43,"myself look as calm as possible, trying not to draw any more attention to us. I could feel her trembling, and I gave her hand a reassuring squeeze. The crowd was growing larger, and I knew we had to get out of there before things escalated. I spotted a small alleyway to our left and gently pulled her towards it, hoping to lose the onlookers in the narrow passage. As we walked, the sounds of the crowd grew fainter, and I could feel her grip on my hand relax slightly. I glanced down at her, trying to read her expression, but her eyes were fixed on the ground ahead. I knew I had to say something, to reassure her that everything was going to be okay, but the words caught in my throat. We walked in silence for what felt like an eternity, the only sound being the soft thud of our footsteps on the pavement."
"“She’ll be home one day, Sarah. It’ll come faster than you think. You can visit her and write to her and call her.","You can stay close to her—you just have to try. I know this is hard, but good things can still come out of it.”",47,"She'll be able to tell you all about her adventures and the new friends she's made. You can share stories about your own life and the things that have been happening while she's been away. Before you know it, the time will have flown by and she'll be walking through the front door, smiling and full of excitement to be back home with you. You'll be able to give her a big hug and hear all about her experiences in person. Just remember to stay positive and focus on the good times you'll have together when she returns. It might be hard to wait, but it will be worth it in the end."
Sarah was practically bouncing. “I can’t believe he said yes. Mom never,lets me do anything. She won’t even let me get my ears pierced.”,25,"thinks I'm old enough to go to the concert, and now Dad is taking me. I've been listening to their album nonstop for weeks, and I know every single word to every song. I've been dreaming of seeing them live for what feels like forever. I'm going to wear my favorite band t-shirt and bring a sign that says 'I love you, Alex!' – Alex being the lead singer, of course. I've already picked out the perfect outfit and planned out how I'm going to do my hair and makeup. This is going to be the best night of my life, I just know it. I'm so glad Dad surprised me with the tickets, I was starting to think I was going to have to wait until I was 18 to see them in concert."
"In that moment, maybe for the first time ever for me, she looked like a little",girl. She was a little girl. I recognized the mask Sarah wore for what it was.,32,"girl, not the strong and fearless woman I had grown accustomed to. Her eyes, usually bright and full of determination, seemed to hold a deep sadness, a vulnerability that I had never seen before. It was as if, in that instant, she had let her guard down, and I was able to see the real her, the one she kept hidden from the world. I felt a pang in my chest, a mix of emotions that I couldn't quite process. I wanted to reach out to her, to comfort her, but I didn't know how. I was frozen, unsure of what to do or say, as I gazed into her eyes, searching for answers."
"After we finished with the lice, I set up the blanket in the backyard. With the landscaping Mom did, it was pretty nice back there with its hanging lights, citronella candles, and magnolia trees. I ordered a","pizza, connected my phone to a Bluetooth speaker, and poured the wine I brought, and Emma and I hung out and talked. Mom had a giant Jenga and we set that up and played a few rounds.",74,"few pizzas and we sat down to eat. The smell of the citronella candles and the sound of the crickets created a cozy atmosphere. My siblings and I talked and laughed, enjoying each other's company. As we ate, I couldn't help but think about how much I loved these simple moments with my family. The stress of the day, including the lice, seemed to melt away as we sat together under the stars. After dinner, we decided to have a family game night, and I went inside to grab some board games. As I was rummaging through the closet, I stumbled upon an old photo album. I brought it outside and we spent the rest of the evening looking through old pictures and reminiscing about past vacations and holidays. It was a wonderful way to cap off a chaotic day, and I felt grateful for the little moments of joy that made life so special."
"“I’m a surgeon, Amber. I don’t have a nine-to-five, I stay until","it’s done, I can’t answer the phone in the middle of an appendectomy—”",25,"the job is done, no matter how long it takes. Sometimes that means I'm at the hospital for 12 hours, sometimes it's 24. I've even been known to pull a 36-hour shift when things get really crazy. But that's just the way it is when you're a surgeon. You can't just leave in the middle of an operation because your shift is over. You have to see it through to the end, no matter what. And that's what I love about my job - the unpredictability, the challenge, the sense of satisfaction when it's all over and I know I've made a difference in someone's life. But it's not always easy, and it's definitely not for the faint of heart. There are days when I feel like I'm running on empty, when the stress and pressure get to me and I wonder how I'll make it through another day. But then I think about why I became a surgeon in the first place - to help people, to make a difference - and that's what keeps me going."
"Amber drew her arm back and threw the large glass thing again, only this","time it bounced off the car’s hood, hit the concrete, and broke in half.",28,"time it shattered against the wall with a deafening crash, sending shards of glass flying in all directions, and for a moment, the room fell silent, as if everyone was holding their breath, waiting to see what would happen next, and then, like a dam breaking, the tension was released, and the room erupted into chaos, with people shouting and screaming, and Amber stood frozen, her eyes fixed on the spot where the glass had hit, her mind reeling with the consequences of her actions, and the sound of her own ragged breathing was the only thing she could hear, as she struggled to process what she had just done."
"“I have the van,” he said, his hands wandering. “Alex can’t drive it yet, so",it’s just sitting there. Uber the next time you come over and take my car home.”,31,"it looks like I’m the designated driver for now. He chuckled to himself, remembering the last time Alex had tried to get behind the wheel. It hadn't ended well, with Alex stalling the engine multiple times and nearly hitting a lamp post. His lack of driving skills was a running joke among their friends, and he often found himself the butt of good-natured teasing. As he walked towards the van, he noticed a few scratches on the side panel and made a mental note to touch them up later. The sun was beginning to set, casting a warm orange glow over the parking lot, and he felt a sense of excitement and freedom wash over him as he slid into the driver's seat."
He slipped a hand into my underwear and I sucked in a breath of air. “What time does,"Alex get up for the bus?” I whispered, tipping my head back as he nibbled on my ear.",36,"your train leave?” he asked, his voice low and husky, sending shivers down my spine as his fingers brushed against my skin. I tried to speak, but my voice caught in my throat, and all I could manage was a faint whisper. He leaned in closer, his warm breath dancing across my ear, and I felt my heart racing with anticipation. The sound of the station announcements faded into the background as I struggled to process what was happening. His hand stilled, waiting for my response, and I knew I had to snap out of the trance-like state I was in. I swallowed hard, trying to find my voice, and managed to stammer out a reply, ""I...I think it's in an hour."" His fingers began to move again, sending sparks of electricity through my body, and I felt myself getting lost in the sensation."
"I came downstairs still in my pajamas, following the smell of bacon, glad I was actually in the right headspace to eat with everyone. When the stair creaked","as I made my way to the kitchen, Sarah poked her head out the door and saw me coming. “She’s here!” She darted back the way she came.",56,"under my foot, I winced, hoping I hadn't just woken up the whole house. But as I turned the corner into the kitchen, I saw that everyone was already up and about, chatting and laughing as they worked on breakfast. My mom was expertly flipping pancakes at the stove, while my dad was setting the table. My little sister, Emily, was sitting at the counter, munching on a piece of toast and watching the chaos with wide eyes. I took a deep breath, feeling a sense of relief wash over me. It was going to be a good day. I poured myself a glass of orange juice and slid onto the stool next to Emily, who grinned up at me and said, ""Morning, sleepyhead!"" I smiled back and ruffled her hair, feeling a sense of normalcy that I hadn't experienced in a while. As we sat down to eat, my mom asked about our plans for the day, and I realized that I had completely forgotten that it was Saturday. No school, no work, just a whole day stretching out before us like a blank canvas. I felt a thrill of excitement at the possibilities. What would we do today? Go to the park? See a movie? Just hang out at home and be lazy? The options were endless, and I couldn't wait to find out what the day had in store."
