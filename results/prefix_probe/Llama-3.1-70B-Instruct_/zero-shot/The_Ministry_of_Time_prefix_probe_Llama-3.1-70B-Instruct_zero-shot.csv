"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.","the remaining five had been left with varying degrees of physical and mental trauma.

Graham's own memories of the procedure were hazy, but the pain and disorientation that followed were all too real. As he slowly regained his strength, he found himself struggling to adjust to the unfamiliar surroundings and customs of the 21st century. Simple tasks, like using a smartphone or navigating the internet, became daunting challenges that left him feeling like a relic from another era. Despite the difficulties, Graham was determined to make the most of his new life and find a way to contribute to this strange and bewildering world. He threw himself into his rehabilitation, working tirelessly to regain his physical strength and learn the skills he needed to survive in this brave new world. As he progressed, he began to form tentative bonds with the people around him, including his assigned handler, a no-nonsense woman named Rachel who seemed to be the only one who truly understood what he was going through. Together, they worked to unravel the mysteries of Graham's past and find a way to make him a valuable asset in this strange new world. But as Graham delved deeper into his new life, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, that there were those who didn't want him to succeed. And then, there were the strange visions that plagued his dreams, echoes of a life left behind that refused to be silenced."
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties.

The house had been modified over the years, with a small extension added to the back and a loft conversion that had been done in the 1980s. Despite its age, the house still had a lot of character, with high ceilings, large windows, and a beautiful wooden staircase. The Ministry had furnished it with a mix of old and new pieces, creating a comfortable and functional living space. Gore had been given a small garden to tend to, which he had taken great pride in, growing his own vegetables and herbs. The neighborhood was quiet, with a mix of young families and retired couples, and Gore had quickly become a familiar face on the street. He would often be seen walking to the local shops or chatting with his neighbors over the garden fence. Despite the challenges he had faced, Gore had found a sense of peace and belonging in this small community, and he was grateful to the Ministry for providing him with a place to call home."

He was too engrossed in his thoughts, staring blankly at the wall as he took long, slow drags on his cigarette. The smoke curled up towards the ceiling, adding to the haze that already filled the small bathroom. Outside, the sound of birds chirping and the distant hum of traffic could be heard, but Gore seemed oblivious to it all, lost in his own little world. His eyes were red-rimmed, and his skin looked pale, as if he hadn't slept in days. The cigarette dangled from his lips, and every so often, he would absently flick the ash onto the floor, where it would land with a faint crunch on the tile. The air was thick with tension, and it seemed as though Gore was waiting for something, or someone, but he didn't seem to know what, or who, it was."
"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale.

As he waited for the plumber to arrive, he tried to distract himself by going over his presentation in his head, but his mind kept wandering back to the mess in front of him. The sound of dripping water and the smell of mildew were not exactly the most inspiring things to deal with on an already stressful morning. Just as he was starting to get really frustrated, he heard a knock at the door - the plumber had finally arrived."
"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant.

His expertise lay in the realm of navigation, where the position of the stars and the movement of the tides were his primary concerns. The thought of him tinkering with the inner workings of a chronometer or attempting to grasp the principles of electromagnetic induction would have been almost laughable. And yet, as I delved deeper into the mystery, I began to suspect that Gore's lack of technical expertise might have been a deliberate ruse, a clever disguise for a mind that was far more inquisitive and ingenious than anyone had given him credit for. It was as if he had been hiding in plain sight, waiting for the perfect moment to reveal his true nature. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was on the cusp of uncovering a long-buried secret, one that would challenge everything I thought I knew about Gore and his place in the annals of history."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry.

He had a particular fondness for the works of Shakespeare and could often be found reciting monologues from memory. His love for nature was evident in the way he spoke about the landscapes he had encountered during his travels, and his eyes would light up when describing the majestic beauty of the mountains or the serenity of a quiet forest glade. Despite his many accomplishments, Gore remained humble and kind, always willing to lend a listening ear or offer a helping hand. As I spent more time with him, I found myself drawn to his warm and gentle spirit, and I began to see the world through his eyes, appreciating the beauty in the everyday moments and the people that filled his life. His presence was a reminder that true fulfillment comes not from external achievements, but from living a life rich in experience, connection, and passion."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea.

This detachment gave him a unique perspective, allowing him to comment on the world around him with a mix of fascination and disapproval. He would often remark on the rapid changes he saw, from the rise of industrialization to the shifting social norms, with a sense of wonder and dismay. It was as if he had been transported through time and was struggling to make sense of the unfamiliar world he found himself in. His observations were often laced with a sense of nostalgia for a bygone era, and yet, he was also drawn to the possibilities and promise of the modern age. This tension between past and present was a defining characteristic of his worldview, and it informed his thoughts on everything from politics to art. Despite his somewhat antiquated demeanor, he was a man of strong convictions and was not afraid to speak his mind, even if it meant challenging the status quo. His words were often laced with a dry wit and a sharp insight, making him a compelling and thought-provoking companion. As I got to know him better, I began to appreciate the complexity of his character and the depth of his understanding, and I found myself drawn into his unique perspective on the world."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake. Another person’s unguardedness in that moment can be very useful, interpersonally, as long as you don’t soften.

My sister might use these terms, or she might call me a fraud.","he inevitably would, given the way these things usually go—I'd have to decide whether to be relieved or annoyed that he'd been so thoroughly duped.

For now, though, I just let it ride, enjoying the novelty of being seen as something I wasn't. It was a strange kind of freedom, one that I wasn't sure I was comfortable with, but was determined to explore nonetheless. As we walked through the city, Gore pointing out landmarks and sharing stories about the local history, I found myself playing along, adopting the persona he'd assigned to me with an ease that was almost unsettling. It was as if I'd been waiting for someone to give me permission to be this person, to shed my own skin and try on a new one. And yet, with every step, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was living a lie, that I was just one misstep away from being found out. The tension between these two selves was exhilarating, but also exhausting. I wasn't sure how much longer I could keep up the charade, or what would happen when the truth finally came to light."
Gore lifts his hand. He’s left a smear on the table the color of tamarind flesh.,"There is a sour, steady pain in his palm that he briefly misunderstands as a taste.","His eyes flicker to the stain, and for a moment, he seems to be somewhere else, lost",32,"His eyes flicker to the stain, and for a moment, he seems to be somewhere else, lost in a memory that makes his jaw clench. The air in the room grows heavier, as if the weight of his thoughts is palpable. The others at the table exchange uneasy glances, their faces a mixture of concern and curiosity. One of them, a woman with a kind face, reaches out to touch Gore's arm, but he jerks away, his eyes snapping back to the present. The sound of his chair scraping against the floor breaks the silence, and he stands, his movements stiff and mechanical. ""I need some air,"" he mutters, already turning to leave, the stain on the table a vivid reminder of the turmoil brewing inside him."
"Gore considers the weight of the sack he’d carried, which had felt so meaningful. “Three partridges,”","he says, “and a boatswain gull too far off to hit. Nothing else. Not even tracks.”","he says, shaking his head in a mixture of amazement and amusement. ""Three partridges,",32,"he says, shaking his head in a mixture of amazement and amusement. ""Three partridges, a few scraps of stale bread, and a flask of water. That's all I had to show for my troubles. I remember thinking to myself, 'Is this really all there is to life?' The weight of that sack had felt like the weight of the world on my shoulders, but now it just seems...insignificant. I've been on so many journeys since then, seen so many incredible things, and yet that sack remains etched in my memory like a scar. I suppose it's funny how the smallest, most mundane things can leave the deepest impressions on us."" Gore pauses, lost in thought, as the fire crackles and spits in the silence."

I nod, feeling a surge of determination. I know what's at stake, and I'm ready to do whatever it takes to save the company. But as I glance around the room, I notice something that makes my heart skip a beat. A familiar face, one that I never expected to see again, is standing in the corner, watching me with an intensity that makes my skin crawl."

His eyes narrowed as he tried to recall the events leading up to the incident, but his memories were hazy and unclear. The only thing he remembered was the sound of shattering glass and the feeling of weightlessness before he hit the ground. Now, as he stood in his dimly lit apartment, he couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had settled in the pit of his stomach. He looked around the room, his gaze drifting from the scattered papers on his desk to the half-empty bottle of whiskey on the coffee table. The pain in his palm throbbed in sync with his racing thoughts, a nagging voice that refused to be silenced."
The ice outside shifts—the Arctic stammering its jaws as a cat does when it sees a bird. The ship’s cat died in convulsions during,"their second winter. Gore had liked that cat.

The ship creaks and groans, protesting the change in direction, and the sound is like a living thing, a beast awakened from a deep slumber. The ice stretches out before them, a vast and unforgiving expanse of white that seems to glow with an otherworldly light. The crew knows that they are being drawn into its heart, and that once they are trapped, there may be no escape. The captain's eyes narrow, his gaze fixed on some point beyond the horizon, as if he can see the very fate that awaits them.

"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats. I was expecting he’d","go through a group therapy session, but Gore was in a sunny mood, so he must have been envisaging something closer to a salon.","be whisked away to some high-level meeting, but instead, he was led to a nondescript conference room filled with an assortment",47,"be whisked away to some high-level meeting, but instead, he was led to a nondescript conference room filled with an assortment of people who looked like they'd been plucked from a United Nations gathering.

Gore was greeted warmly by a tall, slender woman with a kind smile, who introduced herself as Ambassador Rachel Morse. As he began to mingle, I noticed a peculiar individual lingering at the edge of the room, eyeing Gore with an intensity that made me uneasy. He was a tall, imposing figure with a chiseled jawline and piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into Gore's very soul.

He turned, his eyes locking onto mine with a piercing intensity that made me feel like an insect under a microscope. ""What is it, Eli?"" he asked, his voice low and even, but with a hint of a growl beneath the surface. I hesitated, unsure of how to broach the subject that had brought me to this place. The lobby, with its soaring ceilings and ornate chandeliers, seemed to fade into the background as I struggled to find the right words. Gore's eyes never left mine, his expression unreadable, as he waited for me to speak."

He would often speak of the great chefs of the past, of Escoffier and Bocuse, and the reverence with which they were regarded. I, on the other hand, was more familiar with the likes of Jamie Oliver and Nigella Lawson, whose emphasis on simplicity and accessibility had revolutionized the way people thought about cooking. Despite our differences, however, we quickly developed a rapport, bonding over our shared passion for good food and good company. As we sat down at our table, Gore immediately began to peruse the menu, his eyes scanning the options with a discerning gaze. I, meanwhile, took a moment to look around the bistro, taking in the cozy atmosphere and the soft hum of conversation from the other diners. The decor was classic French, with dark wood paneling and crisp white tablecloths, and the aroma of freshly baked bread wafted from the kitchen, making my stomach growl with anticipation. Gore, meanwhile, had already made his decision, and was signaling to the waiter to come and take our order. ""I'll have the duck l'orange,"" he said, his voice firm and decisive. ""And you, my dear?"" he asked, turning to me with a raised eyebrow. I hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to choose, but Gore's enthusiasm was infectious, and I soon found myself ordering the same dish, eager to see how the chef would interpret this classic French recipe."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house.

As I walked back to my village, I noticed that the trees seemed to be watching me, their branches tangling together in a way that seemed almost sinister. I quickened my pace, my heart pounding in my chest. Suddenly, I heard a rustling in the underbrush and turned to see a figure emerging from the shadows. It was the stranger, his eyes gleaming with an otherworldly intensity. ""I see you're taking me up on my offer,"" he said, his voice low and husky.

As we sipped our drinks, the conversation flowed easily, and I found myself opening up to Gore in ways I hadn't expected. He was easy to talk to, and I discovered that we shared a love of literature and music. The hours slipped by unnoticed, and before I knew it, the sun had dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the pub. Gore glanced at his watch and suggested we head back to the house, but I was reluctant to end the evening just yet. I proposed we take a walk along the nearby river, enjoying the peacefulness of the night air. Gore agreed, and we strolled along the riverbank, the sound of the water lapping against the shore creating a soothing melody. As we walked, our conversation turned to our pasts, and I found myself sharing stories I had never told anyone before. Gore listened intently, his eyes filled with a deep understanding, and I felt a sense of connection with him that I couldn't quite explain.

He looked taken aback, but then a look of understanding crossed his face. “Oh, I see. I didn’t know that. I guess I’m a bit out of touch,” he said with a chuckle. I forced a smile, trying to put him at ease. “It’s okay, it can be hard to keep up with the latest terminology. But it’s always good to learn and grow, right?” I added, trying to sound encouraging. He nodded, and we continued the conversation, but I couldn’t shake off the feeling of discomfort that lingered inside me."
"Graham used other words too, not wrong, exactly, but not right, like “your people,” or “your culture.” When I said, in a wincingly tight voice, that we had the same people and culture, he replied, mildly, “But I don’t think that we do.” Then came the image searches about Cambodia, on food and dress","and customs. I had to do those for him, in the early days, because he still didn’t know how, and the English-language internet was not on my side. Exotic, friendly, conservative, resilient. The way he couched his questions, too, was imperfect. I had to correct “ancestor” for “grandparent,” “sacred” for “polite,” “tribal leaders” for “farmers.”","and customs, which only served to further highlight our differences.

I tried to explain to him that just because our families had different cultural backgrounds, it didn't mean that we couldn't share a common identity. But he just smiled and said, ""I'm just trying to understand where you're coming from."" I realized then that Graham's words, though well-intentioned, were rooted in a deep-seated assumption that our differences were more significant than our similarities. This realization sparked a sense of unease within me, and I began to wonder if our friendship was strong enough to overcome the subtle, yet pervasive, biases that seemed to be lurking beneath the surface. As we continued to talk, I found myself becoming increasingly withdrawn, unsure of how to bridge the gap that seemed to be growing between us. The image searches, which had started out as a harmless exercise, had inadvertently exposed a fault line in our relationship, one that I wasn't sure could be easily repaired."
"He smiled, dimples curving. “I think, as we are ‘housemates,’","and also, I hope, friends, that you should call me Graham.”","we should at least try to be civil to one another, don't you",21,"we should at least try to be civil to one another, don't you think?” He said this with a mischievous glint in his eye, as if daring me to disagree. I felt a flutter in my chest, which I quickly suppressed, reminding myself that I was not going to let his charming smile get the better of me. I raised an eyebrow, trying to appear nonchalant, and replied, “I suppose that's a reasonable expectation, considering we'll be living together for the foreseeable future.”"
"“After you returned home yesterday, the Brigadier came back to see Arthur. They had a conversation","about television, which Arthur seems to think is a wonderful invention.

I tried to ask him what was wrong, but he just brushed it off, saying it was nothing. I knew better than to press the issue, but I couldn't help but wonder what the Brigadier had said to him. The rest of the evening was spent in an uncomfortable silence, with Arthur lost in thought and me trying to make sense of the situation. It wasn't until later that night, when we were getting ready for bed, that Arthur finally opened up to me about what had transpired. He told me that the Brigadier had brought some disturbing news, something that could potentially change everything we thought we knew. I listened intently as Arthur recounted the conversation, my mind racing with possibilities and worst-case scenarios."
"This old wound, formerly healed, he’d received in Australia with Captain Stokes. A gun had exploded in his hands. They were rowing up a river in the captain’s gig, charting its","course.

The captain had been standing beside him, shouting orders to the men, as they navigated through the dense, uncharted waters of the Australian wilderness. The sound of the explosion still echoed in his mind, a stark reminder of the dangers that lurked in the unexplored territories they had ventured into. The wound had left a deep scar, a constant reminder of the risks he had taken, and the price he had paid for his curiosity. As he stood on the deck, the salty sea air whipping his hair into a frenzy, he couldn't help but think of the captain, and the bond they had formed in the face of adversity. The memories came flooding back, of the long, arduous journey, of the struggles they had faced, and the triumphs they had achieved. He felt a sense of nostalgia wash over him, a longing for the thrill of discovery, and the camaraderie of the crew. The sea, it seemed, had a way of stirring up the past, of reminding him of the experiences that had shaped him into the person he was today."
"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC. I thought it was a form of juvenilia, drawn in","his earliest years as a modern man, something to remind him of on a significant anniversary of his arrival here; and not, as it would turn out to be, a red letter from another era.","a moment of boredom or distraction, a doodle that would be forgotten as soon as the next project came along.

But the image lingered, haunting the edges of my consciousness like a ghostly presence. I found myself returning to it again and again, studying the intricate lines and curves, the way the light seemed to dance across its surface. And then, one night, I had an epiphany - what if this wasn't just a joke, but a blueprint for something real? I felt a shiver run down my spine as I contemplated the possibilities. Could it be that Graham, in his innocence, had stumbled upon something revolutionary? I knew I had to investigate further, to see if there was any truth to this wild idea. I began to dig deeper, pouring over theories and research papers, talking to experts in the field. And the more I learned, the more I became convinced that Graham's drawing was more than just a joke - it was a key to unlocking a whole new world of possibilities."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and",went for a run. He would sometimes wake me up with a juicy smoker’s wheeze on his return to the house.

He'd sit at the table, sipping his coffee and reading the newspaper, a ritual he'd adopted from the locals. I'd often find him chatting with the neighbors, exchanging stories and laughter, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in how seamlessly he'd integrated into our little community. As the summer solstice approached, Graham began to take on more responsibilities, helping out with the local harvest and even offering to assist with the town's annual summer fair. His dedication and work ethic earned him the respect of the townspeople, and soon he was being invited to family gatherings and barbecues. I watched with a mix of amazement and curiosity as Graham continued to evolve, his transformation from a fish-out-of-water to a beloved member of the community nothing short of remarkable."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.","the way he would often dismiss the modern world, as if it was somehow less authentic than the one he had grown up in.

But at the same time, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of admiration for his unwavering commitment to his values and his way of life. It was as if he was a relic from another era, a reminder of a time when things were simpler, more straightforward. And yet, despite his gruff exterior, I knew that he was a complex and multifaceted person, full of contradictions and surprises. I had seen glimpses of a dry sense of humor, a quick wit, and a deep sense of loyalty, and I was determined to get to know him better, to understand what made him tick. But it wasn't going to be easy, I could tell that much already."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly.

The researchers soon realized that they needed to create a more neutral environment to elicit genuine reactions from the expats. They decided to conduct the tests in a mock living room setting, complete with comfortable furniture and calming colors. The expats were instructed to sit on a couch and watch a series of videos designed to evoke different emotions. The videos ranged from heartwarming scenes of family reunions to disturbing footage of natural disasters. The researchers observed the expats' reactions, taking note of their facial expressions, body language, and physiological responses. They also conducted interviews with the expats after each test to gather more insight into their emotional states. As the tests progressed, the researchers began to notice some interesting patterns. Graham, for instance, consistently showed a strong empathetic response to videos featuring children, while others, like Maria, seemed to be more affected by scenes of destruction and chaos. The researchers were fascinated by these findings and began to analyze the data in more depth. They were determined to understand the underlying mechanisms that drove the expats' emotional responses and how they could be influenced. The study was yielding some surprising results, and the researchers were eager to see where their findings would lead. As they delved deeper into the data, they started to uncover some unexpected correlations between the expats' emotional responses and their cultural backgrounds. It seemed that certain cultural norms and values were influencing the way the expats processed and expressed emotions. The researchers were excited by this discovery and began to explore its implications. They realized that their study could have significant implications for fields such as psychology, sociology, and even diplomacy. The potential applications were vast, and the researchers were eager to share their findings with the world. But as they prepared to publish their results, they couldn't shake off the feeling that they were only scratching the surface of something much bigger. They knew that they had stumbled upon something significant, but they weren't quite sure what it was yet. The study had raised more questions than answers, and the researchers were determined to continue exploring the complex and fascinating world of human emotions."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm.

Meanwhile, the expats were left to process their emotions and try to make sense of the disturbing images they had been shown. Nineteen-sixteen, still recovering from the sedation, was particularly withdrawn, and the others tried to be supportive, but it was clear that the experience had left a lasting impact on all of them. As the days went by, the expats began to open up about their feelings, sharing their thoughts and emotions with each other in a way they never had before. It was a difficult but ultimately cathartic experience, and it brought them closer together as a group. However, it also raised questions about the ethics of the research and the true cost of playing with the human psyche."
"Adela was always present at the honesty exams, often intervening in them.

I tried to brush off the feeling of unease that settled in the pit of my stomach every time she appeared, but it was no use. Her eyes seemed to bore into my very soul, as if she could see right through me. I began to feel like I was living in some kind of twisted reality TV show, where the rules were constantly changing and the stakes were higher than I could have ever imagined. And Adela was the puppet master, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was just a pawn in her game, and that my fate was already sealed. As the exams drew to a close, I couldn't help but wonder what the final outcome would be. Would I emerge victorious, or would Adela's meddling prove to be my downfall? Only time would tell."

"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder.

The conversation was lively, with discussions ranging from the latest Ministry gossip to our personal lives outside of work. I felt a sense of belonging, being among people who understood the unique challenges and quirks of our line of work. As we dug into the meal, Rachel raised her glass in a toast, ""To new beginnings and a successful mission!"" The room erupted in cheers and clinking glasses, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and purpose. Little did I know, this dinner would be the start of a journey that would change everything."
"She put a glass down in front of me—ice, water, an oily suggestion of cordial, and,","sure enough, some fussy edible garnishes.

But the memory was fleeting, and I was back in the dimly lit room, the woman's gaze still fixed on me, her expression unreadable."
"Graham said, “Hm!” and pulled hard on his cigarette.

He sat down at a table outside, ordered a coffee, and watched as the sailboats bobbed gently in the harbor. A group of seagulls flew overhead, their cries punctuating the sound of the waves, and Graham felt a sense of peace wash over him. He took a sip of his coffee, closed his eyes, and let the warmth of the sun soak into his skin, feeling the tension of the day melt away. As he sat there, he began to think about his conversation with the woman, and wondered what she had meant by her enigmatic words. He couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to her story than she had let on, and he found himself wanting to know more."

I can only hope that you will stand by me, and together we can ensure the continuation of our people's legacy."
The Brigadier drifted closer. He did look hungry. He looked like I did as a student when I ate nothing but buttered,toast and apples.

I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end, my heart pounding in my chest like a drum. The Brigadier's eyes locked onto mine, and I felt like a rabbit caught in the headlights of an oncoming car. I was frozen, unable to move or speak, as he took another step closer. His voice was low and husky, sending shivers down my spine as he spoke. ""You're a hard man to find,"" he said, his words dripping with menace. I swallowed hard, trying to find my voice, but it caught in my throat. The Brigadier took another step closer, his eyes never leaving mine.

As a result, our residence became a unique blend of standard-issue government housing and personalized touches that reflected our individuality. Looking back, I realize that these experiences taught me the value of adaptability and resourcefulness, skills that have served me well in many areas of my life."
"Movement was anathema. I slept, mostly, naked and poaching in my sweat. The water ration forced Graham to switch finally to thirty-second showers. I didn’t see him for the whole of the heat wave.",We left our bedroom doors open with the intention of letting the air circulate—though the air hung like an executed corpse—and said lackluster things about making a salad to each other from our separate cells.,"The air was heavy with the smell of stagnation, and the only sound was the constant hum of the air conditioner, which seemed to be working overtime to keep our small apartment from turning into a sauna.

Graham's absence was a welcome relief, as I didn't have to worry about making small talk or pretending to be interested in anything other than my own misery. My world had shrunk to the size of my bed, and I was content to stay there, surrounded by the damp sheets and the faint scent of sweat. Occasionally, I would rouse myself to grab a glass of water from the kitchen, but even that seemed like too much effort. The heat had sucked the energy out of me, leaving me a limp, lifeless thing. I felt like I was slowly melting into the mattress, becoming one with the sweat-soaked fabric. It was a strange, disorienting feeling, as if I was losing my sense of self, my identity dissolving in the heat. And yet, at the same time, it was almost... liberating. I didn't have to worry about anything, didn't have to think or feel or do anything. I could just exist, a passive, inert lump, at the mercy of the heat. It was a strange kind of freedom, one that I wasn't sure I wanted to give up."
"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest.

She had a way of commanding attention without ever raising her voice, and we'd all lean in, our eyes fixed on her, as she laid out the day's agenda. The soundproof room was a necessity, given the sensitive nature of our discussions, and Adela was always mindful of the need for discretion. She'd glance around the table, her eyes locking onto each of us in turn, as if daring us to betray the trust that had been placed in us. And then, with a subtle nod, she'd launch into the meat of the meeting, her words painting a picture of the complex web of intrigue that lay before us."
Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold,"water. She looked unwell, but God alone knows how her plastic surgeon thought she was supposed to look.","water, feeling the refreshing liquid wash away the sweat and grime of the day.

The sound of the water was almost musical, a gentle melody that seemed to wash away her worries and concerns. As she stood there, she felt a sense of freedom that she rarely experienced, a sense of release from the constant scrutiny and control. But as the water continued to flow, she knew she couldn't indulge in this small pleasure for much longer, not without risking detection and punishment. She slowly turned off the faucet, the sudden silence a harsh reminder of the reality she lived in. Adela took a deep breath, dried her hands, and turned to face the rest of her day, the brief moment of rebellion already a distant memory."
"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery. She didn’t enjoy the prestige, as the Secretary did, and she seemed bizarrely overworked for the proxy boss of a project in its pilot stage.","remained a mystery to everyone in the office.

It was as if she had declared war on our very presence, and we were all just collateral damage. Despite her frosty demeanor, Adela was a master of manipulation, always managing to make us feel like we were the ones who were somehow failing her. Her favorite phrase, ""I don't have time for this,"" became a constant refrain, a reminder that our time was worthless compared to hers. As a result, our interactions with her were always tense and brief, with us trying to get in and out as quickly as possible, like patients visiting a particularly unpleasant doctor. The rest of the office staff had learned to avoid her as much as possible, but as her direct subordinates, we had no such luxury. We were stuck dealing with her on a daily basis, and it was taking a toll on our collective sanity."
"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him.

I looked away, breaking the spell, and busied myself with the remnants of our breakfast, trying to shake off the feeling of being seen. But I couldn't shake the sense that Graham was struggling to find his place in this new reality, and I wondered what had brought him to this point. Was it the loss of a loved one, the end of a relationship, or something else entirely? Whatever it was, I knew that I wanted to help him find his way, to be a steady presence in his life as he navigated the ups and downs of this new chapter. As I poured myself another cup of coffee, I caught him watching me, a small smile playing on his lips, and I felt a flutter in my chest. It was a feeling I hadn't experienced in a long time, and I wasn't sure what to make of it. But as I met his gaze once again, I knew that I was willing to take a chance, to see where this newfound connection might lead us."

I'd considered calling for an ambulance, but something about the scene stayed my hand. It was as if Graham had simply... stopped. His chest rose and fell with each breath, but there was a stillness to him, a sense of suspension, that was unnerving. I'd pulled up a chair beside him, watching and waiting, but the minutes ticked by with no change. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the distant hum of insects, a peaceful atmosphere that seemed at odds with the unease growing inside me. As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, I finally stirred, deciding to fetch a blanket to cover him, wondering if the chill of the evening air might rouse him from his strange, motionless reverie."
"So I was anxious about Graham’s disdain for the twenty-first century, because never mind that I felt rejected by it, I was worried that the universe would feel the atemporal sting of his contempt and take","him away.

I know it sounds irrational, but I couldn't shake the feeling that Graham's negativity was contagious, that it could seep into my pores and infect me with its toxic energy. As I walked alongside him, I found myself glancing nervously at the people we passed on the street, half-expecting them to turn and sneer at me, to sense the darkness that lurked beneath my surface. It was a ridiculous fear, I knew, but it was one that I couldn't shake. And so I quickened my pace, trying to put some distance between myself and Graham's corrosive influence, even as I felt a part of me drawn to his intensity, his unapologetic rejection of the world around him. I was torn, caught between my desire to escape his toxic orbit and my fascination with the raw, unbridled energy that seemed to drive him. As we walked, the city seemed to grow darker, the shadows deepening and twisting around us like living things. I felt like I was trapped in a waking nightmare, with Graham as my guide and the universe itself as our twisted playground."
"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test.

The day of the test arrived, and Graham headed to the Ministry, looking calm and focused. I waited anxiously for his return, wondering how he had done. When he finally walked through the door, a huge smile spread across his face, and I knew that he had passed. We celebrated with a cup of coffee, and Graham told me all about the test, from the tricky questions to the sense of relief he had felt when it was all over. His success was a huge weight off my mind, and I was grateful that I had been able to help him prepare. With the test behind him, Graham was now one step closer to achieving his goal, and I was proud to have played a part in his journey."

Whatever her motives, I couldn't shake the feeling that she was trouble, and that her presence would bring us nothing but problems. As I watched, she pushed her way through the crowd, her eyes fixed intently on me. I felt a shiver run down my spine as she approached, her expression unyielding. ""What do you want?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. She didn't answer, at least not right away. Instead, she reached into her pocket and pulled out a small piece of paper, which she handed to me with a curt gesture. I took it, feeling a sense of trepidation as I unfolded it and read the message scrawled on it. It was a single sentence, written in hasty handwriting: ""Meet me outside. We need to talk."" I looked up to see her already turning away, disappearing into the crowd as quickly as she had appeared. I was left standing there, feeling confused and more than a little concerned. What did she want to talk about? And why the secrecy? I glanced around, wondering if anyone else had noticed our little exchange, but everyone seemed oblivious. I was on my own.

"When I brought the glass up—stoppering the rest of the bottle for dinner—I could hear Graham singing “I love to steal awhile away,” occasionally muffled by his drags on a cigarette.

"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century.

As he experimented with different recipes and techniques, he began to appreciate the science behind cooking, the way a slight variation in temperature or timing could dramatically alter the final product. His kitchen, once a sterile and intimidating space, had become a sanctuary, a place where he could escape the stresses of his new life and lose himself in the creative process. The aromas that wafted from the stove were a far cry from the salted meats and stale biscuits of his naval days, and Graham found himself looking forward to each new culinary adventure. He had even started a small garden on the rooftop, where he grew his own herbs and vegetables, further fueling his passion for cooking. As he chopped, sautéed, and seasoned his way through the day, Graham felt a sense of contentment wash over him, a feeling that had eluded him for far too long."

I watched as she listened intently, her hands clasped tightly together in her lap, her gaze fixed on some point beyond the present moment. The men, oblivious to the turmoil brewing within her, continued to talk, their words painting vivid pictures of a world that was both familiar and foreign to her. As the evening wore on, Margaret's expression grew more introspective, her thoughts consumed by the possibilities that had been denied to her. I could almost see the wheels turning in her mind, as she weighed the choices she had made and the opportunities she had let slip away.

As we delved deeper into the conversation, I found myself wondering about the science behind it all. What exactly happened in the brain when you smoked weed? And how did it affect different people in different ways? My friend, noticing my curiosity, pulled out his phone and started reading out articles about the various compounds found in cannabis, and how they interacted with the human body.

This process allows the musician's emotions, skills, and experiences to be imprinted onto a crystal orb, which is then placed inside the music box. When the box is wound up, the crystal orb begins to glow, and the musician's music is brought to life, filling the air with enchanting melodies and harmonies. As a result, music has become more accessible than ever, and people can enjoy their favorite songs in the comfort of their own homes, without the need for live performances. However, some argue that this technology has also led to the decline of traditional music-making, as many musicians struggle to make a living in a world where their skills are no longer in demand. Despite this, the music boxes remain a beloved part of modern life, and their popularity continues to grow with each passing day."

She asked me to apply it to her own face, and as I did, she couldn't help but exclaim over the way it evened out her complexion. I was happy to oblige, and soon we were both chatting and laughing like old friends, the initial awkwardness of our meeting forgotten in the face of our shared fascination with the power of makeup. As we talked, I realized that despite the vastly different times we came from, we were connected by a common thread - a desire to present ourselves to the world in the best possible light. And as I looked at Margaret, her face now radiant with a subtle glow, I knew that this was a bond that transcended centuries."

The dim fluorescent lights overhead seemed to flicker in sync with my racing heart as I took in the figure standing in the doorway. It was a woman, her features obscured by the shadows that danced across her face. She didn't seem to notice me, her gaze fixed intently on Margaret, who was still snoring softly. The woman's presence was unnerving, and I felt a shiver run down my spine as she took a step closer, her eyes never leaving Margaret's peaceful form. I tried to speak, to ask her who she was and what she wanted, but my voice caught in my throat. The woman's gaze finally shifted, and our eyes met in a jarring collision. For a moment, we just stared at each other, the only sound the soft hum of the fluorescent lights and Margaret's gentle snores. Then, without a word, the woman turned and disappeared into the darkness beyond the doorway, leaving me feeling shaken and bewildered."
"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century. I was therefore unsurprised when, about half an hour after their plane landed, I got a call from Arthur’s phone.","months he had been in the country, and each time it had been to call the Ministry's emergency number, which he had been assured was not tapped.

The rest of the time, the phone had stayed in his desk drawer, a constant reminder of the Ministry's all-pervasive presence in their lives. Graham had tried to convince himself that it was just a precaution, that the Ministry was only trying to keep them safe, but he couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched, that every move they made was being monitored and recorded. He had heard rumors of expats who had tried to use their phones to contact the outside world, only to be caught and deported. Graham didn't know if he believed the rumors, but he wasn't willing to take the risk. He had too much to lose. As he sat at his desk, staring blankly at the phone, he wondered how much longer he could keep living like this, in a state of constant surveillance and suspicion. The Ministry's slogan, ""Safety through Vigilance,"" echoed in his mind, but to Graham, it sounded more like a threat than a promise."
"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece,","but then again, so did Pimlico.

As he walked, the sounds of the city faded into the background, replaced by the steady thrum of his own thoughts. The world around him melted away, leaving only the soft rustle of his jacket and the creak of his shoes on the pavement. He was a man out of time, a relic from a bygone era, and yet he moved with a sense of urgency that belied his old-fashioned appearance. His destination was a mystery, but one thing was certain: he would not be deterred."
"It paid off in the early autumn. When I came down for breakfast one morning, I found","Graham at the counter with a dictionary and a tin of protein powder, performing exegesis on the label.","my mother sitting at the kitchen table, a look of quiet satisfaction on her face as she gazed out the window",35,"my mother sitting at the kitchen table, a look of quiet satisfaction on her face as she gazed out the window at the garden.

I poured myself a bowl of cereal and sat down beside her, feeling a sense of contentment wash over me. It was moments like these that I cherished, the simple, peaceful moments that made all the hard work worth it. As I ate, I noticed a small, neatly wrapped package on the table in front of my mother. ""What's that?"" I asked, curiosity getting the better of me. My mother smiled and pushed the package towards me. ""Open it,"" she said, her eyes sparkling with excitement. I unwrapped the paper to reveal a small, leather-bound book. I opened it, and my eyes widened in amazement as I saw that it was filled with beautiful, hand-drawn illustrations of the garden, each one meticulously labeled and dated. It was a record of our progress, a testament to the hard work and dedication that had gone into creating this little oasis. I looked up at my mother, feeling a surge of gratitude and love. ""It's beautiful,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. My mother smiled and put her arm around me, pulling me close. ""I'm glad you like it,"" she said. ""I made it for you, to remind you of all that we've accomplished together."""

The local hospital was a last resort, a place where only the desperate and the dying ended up. Adela had heard the horror stories from her fellow expats about the long waiting times, the unsanitary conditions, and the doctors who seemed more interested in their mobile phones than their patients. She had always been skeptical of the local healthcare system, and now, as she lay in bed with a raging fever and a pounding headache, she was determined to avoid it at all costs. She would ride this out on her own, just as she always had. But as the days passed and her condition only worsened, Adela began to realize that she might not have a choice. Her body was weakening, and she knew that she needed help. The question was, where would she find it?"
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky. But then again, I knew enough about his biography to know that he was very, very lucky.","of the transcript of that session, which I'd obtained through a Freedom of Information request.

At one point, Graham had compared modern sex to a 'rococo excess', and the analyst had noted, in the margin, 'possible reference to latent Puritanism?' I wasn't sure what to make of it, but it seemed clear that Graham's views on sex were, at the very least, unconventional. As I pondered this, I couldn't help but wonder what he would make of my own sex life, such as it was. I had always been a bit of a solitary creature, content to keep to myself, but there had been a few... entanglements, over the years. Nothing too serious, nothing too lasting. But still, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of anxiety at the thought of Graham's judgment. Not that he would ever express it, of course. He was far too polite for that. But still, I couldn't shake the feeling that he was watching me, waiting for me to slip up so that he could pounce. It was a strange, unsettling feeling, and one that I couldn't quite explain. As the days passed, things between us slowly returned to normal. We went back to our usual routine, with Graham making his usual wry comments and me responding with my usual eye-rolling. But the tension between us was still there, lurking just beneath the surface. I couldn't help but wonder what would happen if it ever boiled over."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory.

I found myself wanting to be the one to share those stories, to impart my own knowledge and watch as her eyes lit up with understanding. But I knew I had to be careful not to overwhelm her, to let her discover things for herself and form her own opinions. It was a delicate balance, one that I wasn't always sure I was getting right. As we walked through the crowded streets, I pointed out landmarks and shared bits of history, trying to gauge her interest and adjust my pace accordingly. Margaret listened intently, her eyes wide with wonder, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and responsibility. I was her guide, her mentor, and her friend, all rolled into one. And as the days turned into weeks, I found myself growing more and more attached to her, enjoying her company and valuing her unique perspective on the world. But I knew that our time together was limited, that eventually she would leave and I would be left to wonder if I had made a lasting impact on her life. The thought was bittersweet, a reminder that all things must come to an end, but also a motivation to make the most of the time we had together."

"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right?

I keep thinking there must be some other explanation, some other reason why she would do such a thing. But the evidence is mounting, and I'm starting to realize that I may have been blind to the truth all along. I think back to all the times we talked, all the times she seemed so sincere, so genuine. Was it all just an act? Was she playing me from the very beginning? I feel a wave of anger wash over me as I think about it. How could she do this to me? How could she use me like this? But then I think about the prisoners, about the people she's hurt, and my anger turns to shame. I should have seen it coming. I should have been more careful. I should have been more suspicious. But I wasn't, and now it's too late. The damage is done, and all I can do is try to make it right."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.","that a man could be so utterly convinced of his own genius, yet so catastrophically wrong.

I sighed inwardly, wondering how someone so intelligent could be so blind to his own flaws. He was like a force of nature, unstoppable and unyielding, and I had a feeling that he would stop at nothing to prove his theory, no matter how misguided it was. I just hoped that he wouldn't take the rest of us down with him."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.","his lips, a look of deep contemplation on his face.

Graham looked up as I approached, a hint of a smile on his face, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of warmth and comfort wash over me. ""Hey, how was your day?"" he asked, his voice low and soothing, and I felt my tension melt away as I began to recount the events of my day. As we talked, the sounds of sizzling and simmering filled the air, and the smell of food wafted through the room, making my mouth water in anticipation of the feast to come. The atmosphere was cozy and intimate, and I felt grateful for this quiet evening at home with Graham, away from the hustle and bustle of the outside world."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice.

As the days passed, our conversations about food grew more in-depth, and I found myself opening up to him about my childhood, about the smell of sambal and the sound of the wok on the stovetop. Graham listened intently, his eyes lighting up with curiosity, and I could sense his creative wheels turning as he thought about how to capture the essence of these experiences on paper. One evening, as we sat on the couch, he pulled out his sketchbook and began to draw the shapes of Indonesian dishes, the lines and curves flowing effortlessly from his pencil. I watched, mesmerized, as the pages filled with the vibrant colors and textures of my mother's cooking. It was as if Graham had unlocked a new language, one that spoke directly to my heart. And in that moment, I knew that our collaboration was only just beginning."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself.

I wanted him to be a part of our daily lives, not just a periodic visitor. I knew that if he rejoined the navy, I would be a single parent for most of the year, and I wasn't sure I was ready for that. So, I encouraged him to explore other options, to find a job that would allow him to be home with us, to be a part of our daily routine. He was hesitant at first, but eventually, he started to see the benefits of having a more traditional job. He began to apply to various positions, and after a few months of searching, he landed a job at a local company. It wasn't the navy, but it was a job that would allow him to be home with us, and that's all that mattered. As he settled into his new role, I could see the tension in his body begin to ease, and a sense of calm wash over him. He was finally starting to feel like he was a part of our community, like he was building a life here. And as I watched him thrive in his new job, I knew that we had made the right decision. We were finally starting to feel like a family again, like we were all on the same path. And as we sat down to dinner together, just the three of us, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. We were going to be okay, we were going to make it through this transition, and we were going to come out stronger on the other side."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.","The upbeat melody filled the room, a stark contrast to the tense atmosphere that had settled over the group.

Graham, oblivious to the irony, began to tap his foot along with the music, his eyes fixed intently on the screen in front of him. The others, however, were too engrossed in their discussion to notice the sudden change in music. They were all too caught up in the debate, their voices rising and falling in a crescendo of argument and counter-argument. As the song reached its climax, Graham's laptop suddenly froze, the music cutting off abruptly and plunging the room into an uncomfortable silence. The group's attention was finally broken, and they all turned to stare at Graham, who was frantically trying to restart his computer. ""Sorry about that,"" he muttered, his face flushing with embarrassment. The others just laughed, the tension in the room dissipating as they teased Graham about his musical taste. But as they joked, they couldn't shake the feeling that the sudden interruption had been more than just a coincidence."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes.

I couldn't shake the feeling that I was living with a stranger, that the man I thought I knew was just a facade, a thin veneer hiding a dark and disturbing reality. As the days went by, my anxiety grew, fueled by the silence that hung between us like a challenge, daring me to broach the subject. But I couldn't bring myself to do it, not yet, not until I had concrete evidence of his online transgressions. So I waited, my nerves stretched taut as a bowstring, ready to snap at the slightest provocation."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option.

I spotted a few of my neighbors huddled under an awning, sipping tea and watching the commotion with a mixture of fascination and trepidation. As I made my way through the water, trying not to slip on the slick pavement, I noticed that the river had already started to rise above the curb. The council's sandbags might not be enough to hold back the tide. I quickened my pace, my heart sinking with every step. The water was cold and murky, swirling around my ankles like a living thing. I could feel the weight of it, the relentless pressure that threatened to engulf us all. And yet, despite the danger, there was a sense of community in the air, a sense of people coming together to face the storm. It was a fragile, fleeting thing, but it was there, a beacon of hope in the midst of chaos."

The clock on my wall seemed to tick louder, each passing second a countdown to the mysterious rendezvous.

I nodded, feeling a yawn rise up in my throat. ""We should get you to bed,"" he said, standing up and offering me his hand. I took it, feeling a spark of electricity as his fingers wrapped around mine. He pulled me to my feet, and I swayed slightly, my legs feeling like jelly. Arthur's arm came around my waist, steadying me, and I felt a flutter in my chest. ""I've got you,"" he whispered, his breath warm against my ear. And in that moment, I felt like I was exactly where I was meant to be."
"Anne Spencer almost made it off those wards. After I read the email, an ancient and exuberant terror blazed through me. It was partly the terror that had grown in me alongside my very bones,","knowing as I did that I only existed because my mother had outrun almost; I don’t know at what point you stop feeling the need to run, generation by generation, when you’re born after that.","the one that had been my constant companion since childhood, a low-grade fever that spiked whenever I thought about the fragility of life.

But it was also something more, a creeping sense of dread that had been building in the shadows of my mind, waiting to pounce. I felt like I was staring into the abyss, with the abyss staring back at me, its dark eyes glinting with a malevolent intensity. My heart was racing, my breath coming in short gasps, as I tried to process the words on the screen. Anne Spencer, the woman who had been a constant presence in my life, the one who had held my hand through the darkest moments, was gone. The thought was like a punch to the gut, leaving me winded and reeling. I felt like I was losing my grip on reality, like the world was spinning out of control. I tried to shake off the feeling, to tell myself it was just a bad dream, but deep down, I knew it was real. The terror that had been simmering inside me had finally boiled over, and I was left to face the consequences."
"He was sitting at the noisome kitchen table, staring at nothing. Rogue Male was lying splayed and face down by the ashtray. The thing in my chest kicked again","as I realized he must have grabbed it as we left our home. When I came in, he didn’t move anything but his gaze, which swung up like a whip.","and I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead.

I tried to take a deep breath, but my lungs felt constricted, as if a tight band had been wrapped around my chest. The air in the room seemed to thicken, making it hard to swallow. I glanced around the kitchen, searching for something, anything, to distract me from the growing sense of unease. The fluorescent light above the sink flickered, casting eerie shadows on the walls. I shivered, despite the sweltering heat. The thing in my chest kicked again, harder this time, and I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. I pushed my chair back, the legs scraping against the linoleum floor, and stood up, my eyes fixed on Rogue Male's motionless form. I took a step forward, my heart racing, and then another, my mind screaming at me to get out of there, to get as far away from that kitchen as possible. But my feet seemed rooted to the spot, unable to move, unable to look away from the scene before me."
