"“I’m Adela,” she said. She had an eye patch and blond",hair the same color and texture as hay. “I’m the Vice Secretary.”,23,"hair that cascaded down her back like a golden waterfall. Her bright blue eye sparkled with a hint of mischief as she extended a hand, her long fingers adorned with an assortment of colorful rings. A small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist, adding to the air of mystery that surrounded her. ""And you are?"" she asked, her voice husky and confident, as if she already knew the answer."
“The Wellness team think their adjustment will be negatively impacted if they’re,"held on the wards any longer,” said Adela, dry as a filing system.",25,"required to work with the new software system that the IT department is implementing, as they have grown accustomed to the current system and are concerned that the change will disrupt their workflow and productivity, ultimately affecting the quality of care they provide to their patients, and they are worried that the new system may not be user-friendly or compatible with their existing tools and equipment, which could lead to errors and inefficiencies that would negatively impact their adjustment and overall performance."
"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.",103,"the remaining five had been left with varying degrees of physical and mental trauma. Graham's own memories of the procedure were hazy, but the pain and disorientation that followed were all too real. As he slowly regained his strength, he found himself struggling to adjust to the unfamiliar surroundings and customs of the 21st century. Simple tasks, like using a smartphone or navigating the internet, became daunting challenges that left him feeling like a relic from another era. Despite the difficulties, Graham was determined to make the most of his new life and find a way to contribute to this strange and bewildering world. He began to explore his new surroundings, marveling at the towering skyscrapers and bustling streets of the city. Everywhere he looked, he saw people staring at small, glowing rectangles in their hands, their faces bathed in the pale light of screens. It was a far cry from the bustling ports and naval vessels of his own time, and yet, Graham felt a thrill of excitement at the prospect of exploring this brave new world. As he walked, he stumbled upon a small café, where he decided to stop and collect his thoughts. The barista, a friendly young woman with a nose ring and a warm smile, greeted him with a cheerful ""Hi, how's it going?"" Graham hesitated, unsure of how to respond. In his day, such informality would have been unthinkable, but he was determined to fit in. ""I'm doing well, thank you,"" he replied, trying to sound casual. ""Just getting used to...all this."" The barista nodded sympathetically. ""Yeah, it can be overwhelming. But don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. What can I get you?"" Graham scanned the menu, bewildered by the array of options. ""Just...coffee, please,"" he said finally. The barista smiled. ""Coming right up."" As he waited for his drink, Graham couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at the strange and unfamiliar world he now inhabited. He had traveled through time, leaving behind everything he knew and loved. But as he looked around at the people and the city, he felt a spark of hope. Maybe, just maybe, he could find a new sense of purpose in this strange and bewildering world."
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties. As it was, he was thirty-seven years old and had not experienced crinolines, A Tale of Two Cities, or the enfranchisement of the working classes.",53,"the early twentieth century. The house had been modified over the years, with a small extension added to the back and a loft conversion that had been done in the 1980s. Despite its age, the house still had a lot of character, with high ceilings, large windows, and a beautiful wooden staircase. The Ministry had furnished it with a mix of old and new pieces, creating a comfortable and functional living space. Gore would have appreciated the simplicity and practicality of the design, and the way the house seemed to blend seamlessly into the surrounding neighborhood. As he walked through the front door, he felt a sense of relief wash over him, grateful to have a place to call his own after so many years of living in hotels and temporary accommodations. He took a deep breath, feeling the weight of his responsibilities slowly lifting, and began to explore his new home."
“Mm. Beside your elbow is a white box with a handle. It’s a refrigerator—a,"fridge, we call it. Could you open the door and take out the milk, please?”",29,"portable one, judging by its size. It's probably used for keeping drinks and snacks cool during long trips or outdoor events. You can't help but wonder what's inside, so you carefully lift the lid, and a faint hum fills the air as the seal is broken. A soft light emanates from within, illuminating the contents. You peer inside, and your eyes widen in surprise at the assortment of items neatly arranged on the shelves."
"Gore was already fully dressed and sitting on the edge of the bath, smoking. The bottom of the bath",had a low-tide mark of cigarette ash and soap scum. Two cigarettes were crushed out in the soap dish.,38,"was still wet from his recent shower, and the mirror above the sink was fogged up, but he didn't seem to notice. He was too engrossed in his thoughts, staring blankly at the wall as he took long, slow drags on his cigarette. The smoke curled up towards the ceiling, filling the small bathroom with a thick haze that made his eyes water. Despite this, he didn't flinch, his gaze remaining fixed on some invisible point in front of him. His eyes looked sunken, his skin pale, and his hair was mussed, giving him a disheveled appearance that was at odds with his usual polished demeanor. The air was heavy with tension, and the silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the occasional crackle of the cigarette as he took another drag."
"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale. A vile smell was seeping up from the floor.",39,"plumber was on his way, but the water was still off, and the toilet was clogged. Gore was in a foul mood, and the smoke from his cigarette curled up towards the ceiling as he paced back and forth in the small kitchen. He muttered to himself, trying to remember the name of the plumber, but it was on the tip of his tongue. The sound of dripping water echoed through the pipes, a constant reminder of the chaos that had already begun. As he waited, he thought about the long list of tasks that lay ahead, and the weight of responsibility settled heavy on his shoulders. The creak of the front door broke the silence, and Gore turned to see the plumber, a gruff-looking man with a thick beard, standing in the doorway with a toolbox in hand."
"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant. Men in their right minds are","not usually overcome with a mania for pulling the plumbing apart. I suggested he might like to wash his hands at the sink downstairs, and I could, perhaps, call a plumber, and we could, potentially, take a constitutional walk on the nearby heath.",85,"notoriously resistant to change, and the Royal Navy was no exception. The introduction of steam power and ironclad warships was a radical departure from the traditional sailing vessels that had dominated the seas for centuries. Gore's generation of officers had grown up with the sound of canvas and the creak of wooden hulls, not the hiss of steam and the clang of metal. It's likely that he viewed these newfangled contraptions with a healthy dose of skepticism, if not outright disdain. The idea of a ship that could move without the aid of wind or oars would have been almost unimaginable to him, a relic of a bygone era. And yet, as the world around him continued to evolve at a breakneck pace, Gore found himself at the forefront of this revolution, forced to adapt to a new reality that was both exhilarating and terrifying. The question was, could he keep up?"
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry. By the end of the first week he was visibly going bonkers with no one but me to talk to.",79,"reading, devouring books on a wide range of subjects, from philosophy to science and history. He had a particular fondness for the works of Shakespeare and could often be found reciting monologues from memory. His love of nature was evident in the way he spoke about the land, the trees, and the creatures that inhabited it. He had a deep respect for the interconnectedness of all living things and lived his life in harmony with the natural world. As I spent more time with him, I began to see the world through his eyes, and it was a truly transformative experience. His passion for life was infectious, and he had a way of making everyone around him feel seen and heard. Despite his many accomplishments, he remained humble and kind, always willing to lend a listening ear or a helping hand. As I reflect on the time I spent with Gore, I am reminded of the profound impact one person can have on another's life, and I feel grateful to have known him."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea. He told me stories as if he were trying to catch himself in amber. Just like my mother, though I didn’t tell him that.",105,"the peculiarities of the people and the landscape, as if he were a naturalist observing a new species. This detachment gave him a unique perspective, allowing him to comment on the world around him with a mix of fascination and disapproval. He would often remark on the rapid changes he saw, from the rise of industrialization to the shifting social norms, with a sense of wonder and dismay. It was as if he had been transported through time and was struggling to make sense of the unfamiliar world he found himself in. His observations were often laced with a sense of nostalgia for a bygone era, and yet, he was also drawn to the possibilities and promise of the modern age. This tension between past and present was a defining characteristic of his worldview, and it informed his thoughts on everything from politics to art. Despite his somewhat antiquated demeanor, he was a man of strong convictions and was not afraid to speak his mind, even if it meant challenging the status quo. His words were often laced with a dry wit and a sharp intelligence, making him a compelling and thought-provoking companion. As I got to know him better, I began to appreciate the complexity of his character and the depth of his insights, and I found myself drawn into his unique perspective on the world."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake. Another person’s unguardedness in that moment can be very useful, interpersonally, as long as you don’t soften. There is language I could use about this if I were the melodramatic type: behind enemy lines, for example, or double agent. My sister might use these terms, or she might call me a fraud.",119,"he inevitably would, given the way these things usually go—I'd have to decide whether to be relieved or annoyed that he'd been so thoroughly duped. For now, though, I just let it ride, enjoying the novelty of being seen as something I wasn't. It was a strange kind of freedom, one that I wasn't sure I was comfortable with, but was determined to explore nonetheless. As we walked through the city, Gore pointing out landmarks and sharing stories about the local history, I found myself playing along, adopting the persona he'd assigned to me with an ease that was almost unsettling. It was as if I'd been waiting for someone to give me permission to be this person, to shed my own skin and try on a new one. And yet, with every step, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was living a lie, that I was just one misstep away from being found out. The tension between these two selves was exhilarating, but also exhausting. I wasn't sure how much longer I could keep up the charade, or what would happen when the truth finally came to light."
Gore lifts his hand. He’s left a smear on the table the color of tamarind flesh.,"There is a sour, steady pain in his palm that he briefly misunderstands as a taste.",32,"His eyes flicker to the stain, and for a moment, he seems to be somewhere else, lost in a memory that makes his face tighten. The air in the room grows heavier, as if the weight of his thoughts is pressing down on everyone. The others exchange uneasy glances, unsure of how to react, but no one breaks the silence. It's as if they're all waiting for Gore to return to the present, to acknowledge the stain and whatever it represents. The tension builds, until finally, he blinks, and his gaze snaps back to the table. He looks at the stain again, and this time, his expression is unreadable. Without a word, he pushes his chair back and stands up, his movements economical and deliberate. The others watch as he walks over to the sink and turns on the faucet, the sound of running water breaking the silence. He wets a cloth and returns to the table, his eyes fixed on the stain as he begins to clean it up, his movements slow and meticulous."
"Gore considers the weight of the sack he’d carried, which had felt so meaningful. “Three partridges,”","he says, “and a boatswain gull too far off to hit. Nothing else. Not even tracks.”",32,"he says, shaking his head in a mixture of amazement and amusement. ""Three partridges, a few scraps of stale bread, and a flask of water. That's all I had to show for my troubles. I remember thinking to myself, 'Is this really all there is to life?' The weight of that sack had felt like the weight of the world on my shoulders, but now it just seems...insignificant. I've been on so many journeys since then, seen so many incredible things, and yet that moment still stands out in my mind. I suppose it's funny how our perceptions can change over time. What once felt like a burden can become a fond memory, a reminder of how far we've come."" Gore's eyes drift off, lost in thought, as he ponders the twists and turns of his life's journey."
"At this, Stanley leans in. He is a fussy, short-tempered, handsome man who does not enjoy his job. “I must impress upon",the meeting that the debility that wracks those in the sick bay will doubtless find ample footholds should we reduce the men’s rations.”,45,"you the gravity of this situation,” he says, his voice low and urgent. “The company is on the brink of collapse, and if we don't secure this deal, we risk losing everything. I expect you to be on your best behavior and make a good impression. No mistakes, no excuses. Do I make myself clear?” He eyes me sternly, his gaze piercing as he waits for my response. I nod, feeling a surge of determination. I know what's at stake, and I'm ready to do whatever it takes to save the company. But as I glance around the room, I notice something that makes my heart skip a beat. A familiar face, one that I never expected to see again, is standing in the corner, watching me with an intensity that makes my skin crawl."
"Gore is looking at his left palm. The sour pain is still there, seeping","through the bandages. So is the blood, but it seems melodramatic to observe this.",28,"into his skin like a slow-moving stain, a constant reminder of the accident that had left him shaken. His eyes narrowed as he tried to recall the events leading up to the incident, but his memories were hazy and unclear. The only thing he remembered was the sound of shattering glass and the feeling of weightlessness before he hit the ground. Now, as he stood in his dimly lit apartment, he couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had settled in the pit of his stomach. He looked around the room, his gaze drifting from the scattered papers on his desk to the half-empty bottle of whiskey on the coffee table. The pain in his palm throbbed in sync with his racing thoughts, a nagging voice that refused to be silenced."
The ice outside shifts—the Arctic stammering its jaws as a cat does when it sees a bird. The ship’s cat died in convulsions during,"their second winter. Gore had liked that cat. He’d become quite attached to it, especially as his dog had died in the first spring.",48,"the last storm, and now the crew is on edge, their superstitions running wild. The captain's eyes are fixed on the horizon, his face a map of worry and fatigue. The men huddle around the galley, their voices low and urgent as they discuss the omens and portents that have been plaguing them since the cat's demise. Some say it's a sign from the gods, a warning of the dangers that lie ahead. Others claim it's just a coincidence, a mere animal succumbing to the harsh conditions of the Arctic wilderness. But as the ice creaks and groans around them, it's hard to shake the feeling that something is off, that the very fabric of their reality is beginning to unravel. The captain's voice cuts through the din, his words a steady beat that tries to calm the rising tide of fear. ""We'll push on,"" he says, his eyes never leaving the horizon. ""We have to."" But as the ship lurches forward, the men can't help but wonder what lies ahead, and whether they'll make it out alive."
"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats. I was expecting he’d","go through a group therapy session, but Gore was in a sunny mood, so he must have been envisaging something closer to a salon.",47,"be whisked away to some high-level meeting, but instead, he was led to a nondescript conference room filled with an assortment of people who looked like they'd been plucked from a United Nations gathering. There were representatives from various countries, all chatting and sipping coffee, seemingly oblivious to the tension that had been building outside. Gore was greeted warmly by a tall, slender woman with a kind smile, who introduced herself as Ambassador Rachel Morse. As he began to mingle, I noticed a peculiar individual lingering at the edge of the room, eyeing Gore with an intensity that made me uneasy. He was a tall, imposing figure with a chiseled jawline and piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into Gore's very soul. I couldn't help but wonder who this person was and what his role was in this gathering of expats."
"“Complex,” said Adela. “Thanks for your input. Given their histories, mental trauma is to be anticipated. I remind you that we are interested in the actual",feasibility of taking a human body through time. Our concern is if the process of time-travel has major implications for the expat or the expat’s surroundings.”,52,"perpetrators, not the victims. We need to understand their motivations and the events that led them to commit such heinous crimes. I want you to dig deeper into their past, interview their acquaintances, and gather any relevant information that can help us build a profile. We can't let our emotions cloud our judgment, no matter how horrific the crimes may be. Our goal is to uncover the truth and bring justice to the victims and their families. Let's get to work and see if we can find any connections between the perpetrators and the victims. Maybe there's a pattern or a common thread that we're missing. I want you to also look into any potential witnesses and see if they noticed anything suspicious on the days leading up to the crimes. Every detail counts, no matter how small it may seem. Let's work together to piece together the puzzle and bring closure to this case."
"“We can’t risk the temporal repercussions,” said Adela. “They are supposed to be dead. As long as they’re here, it’s functionally as if they are dead in","their own time. Again, I must emphasize, you are focused on the long-term prognoses of the expats in our era. Your remits really could not be clearer.”",54,"the timeline. We have to find a way to return them to their own time before it's too late. I've been studying the temporal energies surrounding them, and I think I've found a way to create a localized distortion field that can send them back. But we need to be careful - if we disrupt the timeline any further, the consequences could be catastrophic. We'll need to move quickly and precisely to avoid any paradoxes or disruptions to the space-time continuum. I'll start setting up the equipment, but I'll need your help to calibrate the energy matrix. We can't afford to make any mistakes. The fate of the timeline is at stake."
"We’d arrived in the central lobby. Gore was standing in a shaft of sunlight, staring up",at the steel-and-glass ceiling. He looked dazzled into boyishness by the half sky of the building’s skull.,33,"at the vaulted ceiling, his eyes fixed on a particular spot as if mesmerized. I followed his gaze, but all I saw was a faded mural of a sunset, the colors worn away by time and dust. The air was thick with the scent of old books and stale air, and I could hear the faint whisper of pages turning somewhere in the distance. Gore's eyes snapped back into focus, and he turned to me with an intense look on his face. ""We need to find the archives,"" he said, his voice low and urgent. ""The answers we're looking for are hidden somewhere in there."" He nodded towards a door on the far side of the lobby, a door that looked like it hadn't been opened in years. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I followed him towards it, the silence between us thick with anticipation."
"We went for lunch at a small bistro near the Ministry. Gore came from an era of service à la française, private dining rooms and putting everything into jelly. When I began to","explain, in tones of motherly patience, how twenty-first-century restaurants operated, he said, “I’ve eaten kangaroo on the uninhabited shores of the Albert River. I understand how a knife and fork work. Please sit down.”",67,"work with him, I was struck by the formality of his approach to food, which seemed to belong to a bygone age. He would often speak of the great chefs of the past, of Escoffier and his contemporaries, and the way they would lavish attention on every detail, from the presentation of the dishes to the selection of the finest ingredients. As we sat down at our table, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia for a time when dining was a more leisurely and elegant affair. The bistro, with its crisp white tablecloths and soft lighting, seemed to be a throwback to that era, and I felt grateful to be experiencing it, if only for a brief moment. Gore, ever the traditionalist, opted for the bouillabaisse, a classic Provençal fish stew that he declared was ""the only civilized choice"" for a meal. I, on the other hand, chose the steak tartare, which I had been craving all morning. As we waited for our food to arrive, we chatted about everything from politics to literature, our conversation flowing easily as we sipped our wine and enjoyed the warm atmosphere of the bistro."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house. I am looking forward to seeing what visions of sin this era has concocted for the humble tavern.”,53,"be repaired and that I could cross it whenever I wanted. I was grateful for his kindness and told him that I would be happy to repay him in any way I could. He smiled and said that he would think of something, but for now, he just wanted to get to know me better. Over the next few weeks, we spent many hours talking and I found myself growing more and more fond of him. He was intelligent and witty, with a quick sense of humor and a deep understanding of the world. I was surprised to find that we had so much in common, despite our vastly different backgrounds. As the days turned into weeks, our conversations became more in-depth and meaningful, and I began to feel a sense of connection with him that I had never felt with anyone before. I started to look forward to our meetings, and I found myself wondering what he would say or do next. One day, as we were walking through the forest, he turned to me and asked if I would like to see something special. I nodded eagerly, and he led me to a hidden clearing deep in the woods. In the center of the clearing stood an enormous tree, its trunk twisted and gnarled with age. He told me that this was the oldest tree in the forest, and that it held a secret that only a select few knew. I was intrigued, and I asked him to tell me more. He smiled mischievously and said that he would show me, but only if I promised to keep the secret. I promised, and he began to climb the tree, motioning for me to follow. As we climbed higher and higher, the branches grew thinner and the leaves rustled in the wind. I felt a sense of excitement and trepidation, wondering what we would find at the top. Finally, we reached a small platform, and he pushed aside a curtain of leaves to reveal a hidden door. He opened the door and gestured for me to enter, and I stepped through into a world unlike anything I had ever seen."
"Back at the house I was still struggling to think of as “home,” Gore shyly asked me if I would also “come for a drink.” He had done well, at lunch, to hide his deep embarrassment over my payment",of the bill (with a Ministry expense card); he was adjusting with gold-star alacrity in recognizing that it wouldn’t be a reputation-detonating act for a respectable woman to be seen in a public house in the company of bachelors.,78,"of the bill, but I could sense it still lingering in the air. I agreed to join him, and we walked to a small pub just a short distance from the house. The atmosphere inside was cozy, with dim lighting and the warm smell of ale wafting through the air. We found a quiet corner table and sat down, Gore ordering a round of drinks as we perused the menu. As we sipped our drinks, the conversation flowed easily, and I found myself opening up to Gore in ways I hadn't expected. He was easy to talk to, and I discovered that we shared a love of literature and music. The hours slipped by unnoticed, and before I knew it, the sun had dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the pub. Gore glanced at his watch and suggested we head back to the house, but I was reluctant to end the evening just yet. I proposed we take a walk along the nearby river, enjoying the peacefulness of the night air. Gore agreed, and we strolled along the water's edge, the sound of the river flowing gently beside us. The stars were beginning to twinkle overhead, and I felt a sense of contentment wash over me. It was moments like these that I cherished, and I was grateful to have Gore as a companion to share them with."
"I coughed at my half-pint. Ralph, a snide and etiolated former field agent, was my",least favorite bridge. He had somehow managed to get assigned the only young woman expat.,30,"handler, and he was not pleased with my lack of progress. His eyes, a pale shade of blue that seemed to bore into my skin, narrowed as he spoke in a low, gravelly voice, ""You're not even close, rookie. The intel we received suggests that the target is still at large, and I expect you to bring me something concrete by the end of the day."" I felt a surge of frustration at his tone, but I knew better than to push back. Ralph had a reputation for being ruthless, and I didn't want to become his next casualty. I took a deep breath, trying to calm my nerves, and began to scan the crowded bar, searching for any sign of the elusive target."
“No. Apparently it was very awkward when Ralph came in here for a lunchtime gallon of merlot and spotted him. He’s part of Defence’s tracking,team. You know they don’t much like the fact that the Ministry is a separate institution. They thought the time-door ought to fall under their remit.”,51,"team, and he's been tasked with keeping an eye on the situation. Ralph, being the charming individual that he is, immediately began to make a scene, demanding to know what this 'impostor' was doing in his favorite wine bar. The poor guy was taken aback, but he tried to play it cool, explaining that he was just a big fan of Ralph's work and had decided to, uh, 'method act' by dressing up as him. Ralph, however, was having none of it, and things quickly escalated into a heated argument. The bartender had to intervene, threatening to call security if they didn't calm down. In the end, Ralph stormed out, leaving the fake Ralph to finish his drink in peace. It was definitely a strange encounter, and one that left everyone in the bar talking for weeks to come."
"“He used the word ‘Negro’ until I stopped him, but I don’t think he meant it with","two g’s, if that’s what you’re asking me. How’s your expat managing the news of your miscegenation?”",34,"any malice, and he was very open to learning and growing from the experience. He asked me questions about why the term was no longer acceptable and listened intently as I explained the historical context and the impact it had on the community. It was a valuable teaching moment, and I was impressed by his willingness to listen and adapt. As we continued to talk, I realized that his use of the word was a result of his upbringing and environment, rather than any intentional attempt to offend. It was a powerful reminder that language and cultural norms are constantly evolving, and that education and open communication are key to breaking down barriers and building understanding."
I choked. “Uh. We don’t use that word anymore. We just say,"‘Black.’ As an adjective. You would say, ‘She is a Black woman.’ ”",25,"“person of color” or “minority” now. It’s more respectful and inclusive.” I tried to sound confident, but my voice shook slightly as I corrected him. He looked taken aback, but then a look of realization crossed his face and he nodded slowly. “I see. I didn’t know that. Thank you for telling me.” I smiled weakly, feeling a mix of emotions: relief that the conversation hadn’t escalated, but also frustration that I had to have it in the first place. Why did people still use that word? Didn’t they know how hurtful it was? I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on the present moment, trying to move the conversation forward. “So, how was your week?” I asked, attempting to sound casual. He launched into a story about his job, and I listened intently, trying to put the awkwardness behind us."
"Graham used other words too, not wrong, exactly, but not right, like “your people,” or “your culture.” When I said, in a wincingly tight voice, that we had the same people and culture, he replied, mildly, “But I don’t think that we do.” Then came the image searches about Cambodia, on food and dress","and customs. I had to do those for him, in the early days, because he still didn’t know how, and the English-language internet was not on my side. Exotic, friendly, conservative, resilient. The way he couched his questions, too, was imperfect. I had to correct “ancestor” for “grandparent,” “sacred” for “polite,” “tribal leaders” for “farmers.”",109,"and customs, which he insisted on sharing with me, as if I was unfamiliar with the intricacies of my own heritage. I felt a growing sense of unease as he clicked through the slides, pointing out the differences between our two cultures, as if they were specimens to be studied under a microscope. His words dripped with a patronizing tone, implying that I was somehow disconnected from my own roots. I tried to explain to him that cultural identity is complex, that it can't be reduced to a few images or stereotypes, but he just smiled and nodded, as if he understood, but I could tell he didn't. The conversation left me feeling frustrated and disheartened, wondering why he couldn't see the world from my perspective, why he couldn't understand that our experiences, though different, were not mutually exclusive. As the days went by, I found myself withdrawing from our conversations, hesitant to share my thoughts and feelings, fearing that they would be met with the same kind of condescending curiosity. Our interactions became stilted, with Graham trying to bridge the gap between us, but only succeeding in widening it further. I began to realize that our friendship was built on shaky ground, and I wondered if it was strong enough to withstand the weight of our differences."
"He smiled, dimples curving. “I think, as we are ‘housemates,’","and also, I hope, friends, that you should call me Graham.”",21,"we should at least try to be civil to one another, don't you think?” He said this with a mischievous glint in his eye, as if daring me to disagree. I felt a flutter in my chest, which I quickly suppressed, reminding myself that I was not going to let his charming smile get the better of me. I raised an eyebrow, trying to appear nonchalant, and replied, “I suppose that's a reasonable expectation, considering we'll be living together for the foreseeable future.”"
"“After you returned home yesterday, the Brigadier came back to see Arthur. They had a conversation","about television, which Arthur seems to think is a wonderful invention. The Brigadier mentioned ‘Auntie’s output.’ ”",33,"that seemed to have left Arthur visibly shaken. He didn't say much about it to me, but I could sense a change in his demeanor. His usual calm and collected self was replaced by a look of concern and unease. I tried to ask him what was wrong, but he just brushed it off, saying it was nothing. I knew better than to press the issue, but I couldn't help but wonder what the Brigadier had said to him. The rest of the evening was spent in an uncomfortable silence, with Arthur lost in thought and me trying to make sense of the situation. It wasn't until later that night, when we were getting ready for bed, that Arthur finally opened up to me about what had transpired. He told me that the Brigadier had brought some disturbing news, something that could potentially change everything we thought we knew. I listened intently as Arthur recounted the conversation, my mind racing with possibilities and worst-case scenarios."
"This old wound, formerly healed, he’d received in Australia with Captain Stokes. A gun had exploded in his hands. They were rowing up a river in the captain’s gig, charting its","course. The cockatoos they’d spotted on the opposite bank were so dense as to be cloudlike, billowing from tree to tree. He’d taken up his fowling piece and sighted along the barrel.",63,"course, when the accident occurred. The captain had been killed instantly, and he had been left to make his way back to civilization, the gun's remnants still clutched in his mangled hand. The memory of that fateful day still lingered, a constant reminder of the dangers that lurked in the uncharted territories he had dedicated his life to exploring. As he stood there, the familiar ache in his hand brought it all flooding back - the smell of smoke and sweat, the sound of the captain's voice, the feeling of helplessness that had washed over him as he realized the true extent of his injuries. He had thought that the passage of time would have dulled the pain, but it seemed that some wounds never fully healed. The memories still felt raw, still felt like they belonged to the present, not the past. He took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of unease that had settled over him, and began to make his way back to the present, back to the task at hand."
"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC. I thought it was a form of juvenilia, drawn in","his earliest years as a modern man, something to remind him of on a significant anniversary of his arrival here; and not, as it would turn out to be, a red letter from another era.",70,"the margins of a notebook, a doodle that would be forgotten by the time the notebook was filled. But the image lingered, haunting me like a ghost in the machine. I found myself thinking about it at odd moments, wondering what it would be like to see the world through a lens that warped and distorted reality. I began to see the world in a different light, as if the very fabric of space and time was twisted and curved. The drawing had become a kind of Rorschach test, revealing the deepest recesses of my own mind. I started to feel like I was losing my grip on reality, like I was being pulled into the vortex of Graham's twisted imagination. And then, one night, I received a package in the mail with no return address. Inside, I found a small, intricately carved wooden box with a note that read: ""For the curious, the truth is not what it seems."" I opened the box, and my world was forever changed."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and",went for a run. He would sometimes wake me up with a juicy smoker’s wheeze on his return to the house. He started giving me custody of his cigarettes and enforced a predinner smoking ban.,70,"made his way to the kitchen to prepare a pot of coffee, the aroma of which would eventually rouse me from my slumber. He had developed a fondness for the local diner, where he would often stop for a hearty breakfast before heading out to explore the town. The diner's patrons had grown accustomed to his presence, and he was always greeted with a warm smile and a nod of recognition. As the summer solstice approached, Graham's affinity for the era had become so pronounced that I found myself wondering if he would ever be able to readjust to our own time. His transformation was nothing short of remarkable, and I couldn't help but feel a twinge of concern that he might become stuck in this bygone era, forever trapped in a world that was not his own. Despite my reservations, I couldn't deny the sense of excitement and adventure that Graham's presence brought to our little corner of the past. As we navigated the ups and downs of life in a bygone age, I couldn't help but feel grateful to have him by my side."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.",65,"the way he would often dismiss the modern world, as if it was somehow less authentic than the one he had grown up in. I felt like I was constantly trying to prove to him that the world had moved on, that progress was a good thing, but he just wouldn't budge. It was like he was stuck in a time warp, and I was starting to feel like I was getting sucked in too. I would try to show him the benefits of technology, the way it could make our lives easier, but he would just scoff and tell me that it was all just a bunch of nonsense. He would say that people were losing touch with what was truly important, that we were becoming too reliant on machines and forgetting how to live. I would try to argue with him, to tell him that he was being close-minded, but he just wouldn't listen. It was frustrating, because I knew that he wasn't a stupid man, but it seemed like he was willfully ignorant of the world around him. I started to wonder if he was just trying to hold on to the past, to a time when things were simpler, when life wasn't so complicated. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it was more than that. It was like he was trying to hold on to a part of himself, a part that he felt was slipping away with each passing day. And I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness, because I knew that I couldn't help him, that he was going to have to find his own way through this."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly. I once found him the sole occupant of the fifth-floor smoking area (a pigeon-shit-encrusted balcony), methodically shredding a filter of a finished cigarette. I watched him for a while, interested in the way that only his fingers moved. Most people ripple with surplus motion unless they are concentrating, but Graham only ever moved the parts of him that he wanted to move.",137,"to focus on the tasks at hand. The researchers soon realized that they needed to create a more neutral environment to elicit genuine reactions from the expats. They decided to conduct the tests in a mock living room setting, complete with comfortable furniture and calming colors. The expats were instructed to watch a series of videos designed to evoke strong emotions, ranging from heartwarming moments of kindness to disturbing scenes of violence. The researchers observed their reactions, taking note of their facial expressions, body language, and physiological responses. As the tests progressed, the expats began to open up about their feelings, sharing personal anecdotes and insights that provided valuable context to the data. The researchers were particularly interested in how the expats' cultural backgrounds influenced their emotional responses, and whether there were any universal triggers that transcended cultural boundaries. They spent hours poring over the data, looking for patterns and correlations that could shed light on the complex and multifaceted nature of human emotions. Meanwhile, the expats were left to ponder the true purpose of the tests, and whether they were merely pawns in a larger experiment. As they left the laboratory each day, they couldn't help but wonder what other secrets lay hidden behind the Ministry's imposing walls."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm. They began to resist the exams psychologically, spoiling our hard-won data. It was agreed that we’d delay introducing them to Hiroshima, Auschwitz, and the Twin Towers. Control promised to provide a timeline for the revelations, but it hadn’t materialized.",105,"had always been the most stoic of the group, were visibly shaken by the images. The test was meant to gauge their emotional response to traumatic events, but it seemed to have crossed a line. The researchers were forced to reevaluate their methods and consider the potential long-term effects on the expats' mental health. Meanwhile, the expats were left to process their emotions and try to come to terms with the disturbing images they had seen. Nineteen-sixteen, still recovering from the sedation, was particularly withdrawn, and the others tried to be supportive, but it was clear that the experience had left a lasting impact on all of them. As the days went by, the expats began to open up about their feelings, sharing their thoughts and emotions with each other in a way they never had before. It was a difficult but ultimately cathartic experience, and it brought them closer together as a group. However, it also raised questions about the ethics of the research and the true cost of playing with the human mind."
"Adela was always present at the honesty exams, often intervening in them. I got the impression that she was listening to offstage prompts that only she could","hear, being the only one among us who was aware she was on a stage, and was trying to chivvy us along the right course of action.",54,"hear, and that she was being fed lines to disrupt the proceedings. Her presence was unnerving, to say the least, and I often found myself wondering what her true motives were. Was she genuinely interested in the outcome of the exams, or was she simply there to cause chaos and mayhem? I tried to brush off the feeling of unease that settled in the pit of my stomach every time she appeared, but it was no use. Her eyes seemed to bore into my very soul, as if she could see right through me. I began to feel like I was living in some kind of twisted reality TV show, where the rules were constantly changing and the stakes were higher than I could have ever imagined. And Adela was the puppet master, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was just a pawn in her game, and that my fate was already sealed. As the exams drew to a close, I couldn't help but wonder what the final outcome would be, and what role Adela would play in it. Would she emerge victorious, or would she finally be exposed for the manipulative force that I believed her to be? Only time would tell, but one thing was certain - I would be watching her every move, waiting for her next strike."
"Adela smiled with about a third of her mouth. Her face had changed again. She looked pinched and hungry,",and hauntingly as if her skin was held in place by a bulldog clip at the back of her skull.,39,"her eyes sunken into dark wells that seemed to draw the light out of the room. The faint scent of stale cigarettes clung to her like a shroud, a constant reminder of the long nights and early mornings that had become her norm. As she stood there, her shoulders hunched in a futile attempt to ward off the chill that had seeped into her bones, it was clear that the carefree girl who had once laughed with abandon was now a distant memory, lost in the haze of a life that had taken a drastic turn for the worse."
"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder. Bridges tended not to eat at the Ministry canteen with administrative staff and the operators on the Wellness team—the office-based employees—and the decorous hostility with which the paper pushers met me was adorable. When I got to the","kitchen itself, the first thing I saw was Graham leaning down to light a cigarette on the gas ring, his curls dangerously close to the hob. We’d had to disable smoke detectors in every Ministry room that Graham used. If he couldn’t have a cigarette, he’d throw whatever experiment he was strapped into.",106,"location, I was greeted by a familiar face - Rachel, the team lead, who was busy arranging the food on a long table. The smell of roasted chicken and steaming vegetables filled the air, and my stomach growled in anticipation. As I took a seat, I noticed a few new faces, including a young woman with a bright pink streak in her hair and a guy with a thick beard, both of whom introduced themselves as new recruits. The conversation was lively, with discussions ranging from the latest Ministry gossip to our personal lives outside of work. I felt a sense of belonging, being among people who understood the unique challenges and quirks of our line of work. As we dug into the meal, Rachel stood up to give a brief update on the team's progress, highlighting our recent successes and the upcoming projects. The evening wore on, with laughter and chatter filling the room, and for a brief moment, I forgot about the dangers and uncertainties that came with our job."
"She put a glass down in front of me—ice, water, an oily suggestion of cordial, and,","sure enough, some fussy edible garnishes. I blinked at it and then at Margaret, who smiled.",32,"a slice of lemon that seemed to be staring at me like the eye of a fish. I felt a sudden urge to push the glass away, but my hand seemed rooted to the spot. The woman's eyes, a deep shade of brown that seemed to hold a thousand secrets, watched me with an unnerving intensity as she waited for my reaction. The air in the room was heavy with the scent of old books and stale air, and I could feel the weight of the silence between us like a physical presence. I took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of unease that had settled over me, and reached out to take a sip of the drink. The liquid was cool and sweet, with just a hint of bitterness that lingered on the back of my tongue. As I swallowed, I felt a sudden jolt of clarity, as if the drink had washed away the fog that had been clouding my mind. I looked up at the woman, and for a moment, our eyes locked in a silent understanding."
"Graham said, “Hm!” and pulled hard on his cigarette. He wandered off with the expansive air of a man who might pick up some parsley, not because",he has been told to but because that might be a jolly thing to do en route to his next footloose and fancy-free destination. I watched him go.,55,"he needed it, but because he felt like it. The sun was shining, and the smell of the sea was in the air, and Graham felt a sudden urge to do something carefree and spontaneous. He walked along the beach, feeling the sand between his toes and the wind in his hair, and eventually found himself at a small café overlooking the water. He ordered a coffee and sat down at a table outside, watching as people walked by and children played in the waves. As he sat there, he noticed a woman sitting alone at a nearby table, staring out at the sea with a look of deep contemplation on her face. Graham wondered what she was thinking about, and found himself feeling drawn to her, as if he wanted to know her story. He sat there for a while, lost in his own thoughts, until the woman finally looked up and caught his eye, and Graham felt a spark of connection that he couldn't ignore."
"“No,” said Margaret. She shrugged at my expression. “An’ I forsake this duty,” she said, “we’ll sicken. Forty-seven",thinks tobacco is an herb. But womenfolk were cordoned at the stove for centuries. The men mun take lessons.”,37,"years of tradition and heritage will be undone, and the village will be left to suffer the consequences. The weight of that responsibility is not one I am willing to bear, nor should it be yours to carry. We must see this through, no matter the cost."
The Brigadier drifted closer. He did look hungry. He looked like I did as a student when I ate nothing but buttered,toast and apples. He turned the white of used candlewax when Margaret opened the oven to better squint at her roast potatoes.,44,"toast for a week because I couldn't afford anything else. His eyes had that same desperate gleam, the same willingness to devour anything that crossed his path. I felt a shiver run down my spine as he drew closer, his presence seeming to fill the entire room. The air grew thick with tension, heavy with the weight of unspoken words. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end, my heart pounding in my chest like a drum. The Brigadier's eyes locked onto mine, and I felt like a rabbit caught in the headlights of an oncoming car. I was frozen, unable to move or speak, as he took another step closer, his eyes burning with an otherworldly intensity."
"“ ’Tis all the same to me, sir,” said Margaret, “though I fear",this cod will grow legs and walk afore my ‘colleague’ returns with my parsley.”,27,"that my father will not be of the same opinion, for he has always been most particular about the company I keep, and I fear he will not approve of your acquaintance, sir. But I must confess, I find your conversation most intriguing, and I am not one to shy away from a lively debate. Pray, tell me, what brings you to our humble town, and what is it that you do, sir?"
"Because we lived in a government-owned residence, there were also restrictions on how","long we could have the air-conditioning on. Graham picked at this, irritating and irritated.",27,"we could decorate and modify the property, which sometimes made it difficult to make the space truly feel like our own. My parents, however, were determined to make the most of the situation and would often find creative ways to work within the rules to add personal touches to our home. They would spend hours scouring local markets and thrift stores for unique pieces of furniture and decor that would reflect our family's personality, and then carefully arrange them in a way that would maximize the space and create a sense of warmth and coziness. Despite the limitations, our home was always filled with love, laughter, and a sense of adventure, and it was a place where I felt safe and happy."
"Movement was anathema. I slept, mostly, naked and poaching in my sweat. The water ration forced Graham to switch finally to thirty-second showers. I didn’t see him for the whole of the heat wave.",We left our bedroom doors open with the intention of letting the air circulate—though the air hung like an executed corpse—and said lackluster things about making a salad to each other from our separate cells.,69,"The air was heavy with the smell of stagnation, and the only sound was the constant hum of the air conditioner, which seemed to be working overtime to keep our small apartment from turning into a furnace. I lost track of time, unsure what day it was or how long the heat wave had been going on. Graham's absence was a welcome relief, as I didn't have to worry about making small talk or pretending to be interested in anything other than my own misery. The only thing that broke the monotony was the occasional delivery of groceries, which Graham would leave on the doorstep with a note that simply said ""stay cool."" I'd open the door, grab the bags, and retreat back into my sweat-drenched world, not even bothering to look outside. The heat had become a physical presence, a living entity that wrapped itself around me, squeezing tight and refusing to let go. I felt like I was drowning in it, suffocating under its oppressive weight. And yet, I couldn't muster the energy to care. I just lay there, a limp, sweaty rag, waiting for the heat to break, waiting for the world to return to some semblance of normalcy."
"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest. She always arrived first, and we’d find her sitting at the top of",a long table like a mannequin awaiting the gift of demonic possession. But this time I arrived a quarter of an hour early and she wasn’t there.,53,"the long, polished table, her hands clasped together in front of her, her eyes fixed on some point on the wall as if lost in thought. The rest of us would file in, our footsteps echoing off the cold, grey stone, and take our seats around the table, trying not to make eye contact with her until the meeting officially began. It was a ritual we'd all grown accustomed to, but one that still filled me with a sense of unease. As the newest member of the team, I often found myself wondering what Adela was thinking, what secrets she was hiding behind those piercing green eyes. The soundproof room was a place where the outside world was shut out, where the weight of our responsibilities was palpable, and where the decisions we made would have far-reaching consequences. I took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of trepidation that always settled in the pit of my stomach before these meetings, and waited for Adela to begin."
Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold,"water. She looked unwell, but God alone knows how her plastic surgeon thought she was supposed to look.",36,"water, feeling the refreshing liquid wash away the sweat and grime of the day. She closed her eyes, letting the coolness seep into her skin, and for a moment, she forgot about the strict rules and regulations that governed every aspect of her life. The sound of the water was almost musical, a gentle melody that seemed to wash away her worries and concerns. As she stood there, she felt a sense of freedom that she rarely experienced, a sense of release from the constant scrutiny and control. But as the water continued to flow, she knew she couldn't indulge in this small act of rebellion for much longer, not without risking detection and punishment. She slowly turned off the faucet, the sudden silence a harsh reminder of the reality she lived in. Adela took a deep breath, wiped her hands on the towel, and turned to face the rest of her day, the brief moment of defiance already a distant memory."
"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery. She didn’t enjoy the prestige, as the Secretary did, and she seemed bizarrely overworked for the proxy boss of a project in its pilot stage.",56,"remained a mystery to everyone in the office. Her condescending tone and constant sighs made it clear that she was not thrilled about her new role, and we often wondered if she was only there to collect a paycheck. Despite her demeanor, Adela was efficient and organized, but her people skills left much to be desired. She would often interrupt meetings to point out minor errors in the minutes or correct someone's grammar, making everyone feel like they were in elementary school again. It was as if she had a personal vendetta against the entire office, and we were all just pawns in her game of bureaucratic chess. As time went on, we learned to avoid her as much as possible, but it was hard to escape her presence entirely. She seemed to take pleasure in making our lives more difficult, and we began to suspect that she had a hidden agenda. The question on everyone's mind was: what had we done to deserve Adela as our Vice Secretary?"
"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him. I frowned, and he frowned, and we were frowning into our tea.",64,"found himself in a situation that was both familiar and foreign. His eyes, a deep shade of brown that seemed to hold a world of emotions, met mine, and for a moment, we just stared at each other. The air was thick with unspoken words, and I could feel the weight of his gaze like a gentle touch on my skin. I looked away, breaking the spell, and busied myself with the remnants of our breakfast, trying to shake off the feeling of being seen. But I couldn't shake the sense that Graham was struggling to find his place in this new reality, and I wondered what had brought him to this point. Was it the loss of a loved one, the end of a relationship, or something else entirely? Whatever it was, I knew that I wanted to help him find his way, to be a steady presence in his life as he navigated the ups and downs of this new chapter. As I poured myself another cup of coffee, I caught him watching me, a small smile playing on his lips, and I felt a flutter in my chest. It was a feeling I hadn't experienced in a long time, and I wasn't sure what to make of it. But as I met his gaze once again, I knew that I was willing to take a chance, to see where this newfound connection might lead us."
"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it. He was a severe disciplinarian, it’s true. Held grudges. But he was a very lonely person. Romantic, too, which made his loneliness worse.”",53,"first to say he's a cheerful soul. He's just... intense. Focused. He's got a job to do, and he's going to do it, no matter what it takes. I've seen him go without sleep for days, just to make sure everything is perfect. He's a perfectionist, and that can be intimidating to some people. But he's not grim, exactly. He's just... driven. And when you're around him, you can't help but feel that drive, that energy. It's infectious, in a way. He's the kind of person who makes you want to be better, to do better. And that's not always easy to be around, but it's definitely not grim."" Graham paused, taking another drag on his cigarette as he thought about his friend. ""I think you'll like him, once you get to know him. He's a good guy, deep down."" "
"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running. Given how much of our working day the data collection took, we all assumed that the time-travel project was running to the stated purpose. Every day I had to record his heart rate, his blood pressure, his temperature; every day a written record of what he wore, what he ate, how much","exercise he took; every week checking progress against the imaginary benchmarks set by Control, use of phone, use of transport, use of media and the assessment of how harmful or useful each medium was; all the time the corrective tests for vocabulary and habit; novelistic observations on his character and temperament. It seemed that the job continued. I suppose if you switch on your lights and boil your kettle with energy provided by a nuclear power station, you don’t spend much time reflecting on the fact that the atom had originally been split to kill cities.",192,"he slept, and what he said. The routine was numbing, but it was also reassuring. It was a reminder that, no matter what else was going on, we were still a team, still working towards a common goal. And yet, despite the familiarity of the routine, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It was as if we were all just going through the motions, waiting for something to happen, but not really knowing what that something was.  As the days turned into weeks, the sense of unease grew. It was a low-level hum, always present but never quite audible. I found myself wondering if anyone else felt it, or if it was just me. I glanced around the lab, trying to read the faces of my colleagues, but they all seemed focused on their work. Adela, in particular, seemed oblivious to the tension, her eyes fixed intently on the data streaming in from the experiments.  I tried to push the feeling aside, telling myself it was just paranoia. But it was hard to shake the memory of those files, still sealed and untouched in the bin. What was in them? And why had Adela been so insistent that they be kept secret? The questions swirled in my mind, refusing to be silenced. And then, one day, everything changed. The lab fell silent, the only sound the soft hum of the machinery. Adela's voice cut through the stillness, her words dropping like a bombshell: ""We're ready to move to the next phase."""
"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on","a wet and putrid night, to shoot a fox, and pulled out one of his own rotting teeth (he showed it to me afterward; it was the color of a tombstone, caped with gelatinous red)—was this Victorian, or was this “irregularities”?",81,"the same patch of grass where he'd spent the previous afternoon, staring up at the sky with an intensity that made me wonder if he was trying to will the clouds into a different shape. His eyes were open, but they didn't seem to be focusing on anything in particular, and his chest rose and fell with a slow, steady rhythm that was almost hypnotic. I'd tried to rouse him a few times, but he hadn't responded, and I was starting to get worried. I'd seen him like this before, of course - Graham had always been prone to these strange, catatonic episodes - but they'd never lasted this long before, and I was beginning to wonder if something was seriously wrong. I'd tried calling his name, shaking his shoulder, even sprinkling water on his face, but nothing seemed to be working. As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the garden, I realized that I was going to have to take more drastic action if I wanted to get him back to normal. I gently lifted his head and shoulders, trying not to jostle him too much, and began to make my way back to the house, hoping that a cup of tea or a cold compress would be enough to snap him out of it. But as I looked down at his face, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that this was more than just one of Graham's usual episodes. His eyes seemed...different, somehow, and his skin had a pale, waxy sheen that made my heart skip a beat. I quickened my pace, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios, and stumbled through the back door, calling out for help as I went."
"So I was anxious about Graham’s disdain for the twenty-first century, because never mind that I felt rejected by it, I was worried that the universe would feel the atemporal sting of his contempt and take","him away. My England wasn’t like this, he’d told me—but this was the natural evolution of his England. I was the natural evolution. I was his lens if he would only raise me and look with me.",73,"it out on me. I was worried that the universe would somehow sense my association with Graham and decide that I, too, was worthy of its disdain. I know it sounds irrational, but I couldn't shake the feeling that Graham's negativity was contagious, that it could seep into my pores and infect me with its toxic energy. As I walked alongside him, I found myself glancing nervously at the people we passed on the street, half-expecting them to turn and sneer at me, to sense the darkness that lurked beneath my surface. It was a ridiculous fear, I knew, but it was one that I couldn't shake. And so I quickened my pace, trying to put some distance between myself and Graham's corrosive influence, even as I felt a part of me drawn to his intensity, his unapologetic rejection of the world around him. I was torn, caught between my desire to escape his toxic orbit and my fascination with the raw, unbridled energy that seemed to drive him. As we walked, the city seemed to grow darker, the shadows deepening and twisting around us like living things. I felt like I was trapped in a waking nightmare, with Graham as my guide and the universe itself as our twisted playground."
"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test. The Ministry gave no indication of what format","the test would take, or what manner of questions would be asked, or tasks set. I thought this was unfair, and suggested as much to him.",52,"the test would take, so Graham had to be prepared for anything. He spent hours poring over his notes, trying to commit as much information as possible to memory. I helped him quiz himself, asking him questions and providing feedback on his answers. As the day of the test drew near, Graham's confidence grew, and I could see the tension in his shoulders begin to ease. I was confident that he would do well, and I was eager to see the results. The day of the test arrived, and Graham headed to the Ministry, looking focused and determined. I waited anxiously for his return, wondering how he had done. When he finally walked through the door, a huge smile spread across his face, and I knew that he had passed. We celebrated with a cup of coffee, and Graham told me all about the test, from the tricky questions to the sense of relief he felt when it was all over. His success was a huge weight off both of our shoulders, and we were able to breathe a sigh of relief. With the test behind him, Graham was one step closer to achieving his goal, and I was proud to have been able to help him along the way."
"There was an embarrassed silence, then: “Shame!” yelled Margaret","from the audience. “Fie! Rhubarb, rhubarb! And diverse other curses!”",19,"from the back of the room, her voice echoing off the walls as she stood up, her face red with indignation, and pointed a shaking finger at the person responsible for the commotion, who was now trying to slink away unnoticed, but it was too late, the damage was done, and the room was now in an uproar."
"The person I was referring to was lurking at the far edge of the auditorium, with hair the color of wet earth under moonlight and a pinched, unhappy expression. I don’t think Salese could have looked more disapproving if we’d all started","sucking at one another’s fleshly parts and chanting “Hail, Satan!” The Brigadier was standing beside Salese. They were speaking, heads close together. They looked as if they were in an invisible bell jar of gloom which blocked out the room’s miniature festivities.",84,"chanting an ancient incantation of darkness. Her eyes narrowed as she watched us, her gaze lingering on each of our faces before moving on to the next, as if searching for something - or someone. I felt a shiver run down my spine as her eyes met mine, and for a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of recognition, but it was quickly extinguished, replaced by a scowl that seemed to deepen the lines on her face. She was dressed in dark, flowing robes that seemed to billow behind her like a cloud, and a silver pendant in the shape of a crescent moon hung from her neck, glinting in the dim light of the auditorium. As I watched, she turned and slipped out of the room, disappearing into the shadows like a ghost. I felt a sense of unease settle over me, as if I had just caught a glimpse of something I wasn't meant to see. I turned back to the others, but they seemed oblivious to the strange encounter, too caught up in their own conversations to notice the tension that had just filled the room. I tried to shake off the feeling, telling myself I was just being paranoid, but I couldn't shake the sense that something was off, that we were all being watched by unseen eyes."
"“I’m afraid I’ve only ever met the Secretary,” said the Brigadier.",“But I would very much like to meet Vice Secretary Adela.”,22,"“I see,” said the Doctor, his eyes narrowing slightly as he considered this information. “And what was your impression of him?” The Brigadier hesitated, choosing his words carefully before responding, “To be honest, I found him to be rather... evasive. He seemed reluctant to discuss the details of the project, and I got the feeling that he was hiding something.” The Doctor's eyes lit up with interest at this, and he leaned forward in his chair, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. “I think we're onto something here, Brigadier. I think we're onto something big.”"
"I went home and, on arrival, checked my emails. As with a driving",test—or the lieutenants’ exam—the acclimatization exam results were delivered immediately. Graham had passed.,26,"license, I had to retake the test after a certain period of time had elapsed, and I was eager to see if I had passed or failed. I sat down at my desk, opened my laptop, and began to scroll through my inbox, my eyes scanning the subject lines for the one I was looking for. It didn't take long to find it - the email from the testing center was right at the top, and my heart skipped a beat as I clicked on it and began to read. The words on the screen seemed to blur together at first, but as I focused, I saw that I had passed, and a wave of relief washed over me. I had been so worried that I would have to retake the test, and the thought of having to go through that again had been weighing heavily on my mind. But now, with the news that I had passed, I felt a sense of accomplishment and pride, and I couldn't wait to share the news with my family and friends."
"I cycled up to the nice grocery store to buy a bottle of champagne, pausing on the way home for a soft-serve ice cream. I sat on the bench to lick the ripple into a mound and think about the","Brigadier. A man of bivouac experience, I felt; there was something disturbingly makeshift about both him and Salese, as if they’d been dropped behind enemy lines and were mimicking familiarity while waiting for the right moment to cut a throat.",80,"various ways I could celebrate this momentous occasion. The warm sun on my face and the cool ice cream on my tongue seemed like the perfect accompaniment to my thoughts. I thought about calling my best friend to share the news, but then decided to savor the moment to myself for a little while longer. As I sat there, I felt a sense of contentment wash over me, and I couldn't help but smile at the simple pleasures in life. The sound of children's laughter and the chirping of birds filled the air, adding to the joyful atmosphere. I took a deep breath, feeling the sweetness of the ice cream and the promise of the champagne waiting for me at home, and let out a happy sigh. It was going to be a wonderful evening."
"“Apparently I can pass as an eccentric. I suggested that somewhere like Scotland, Arthur and I might","simply pass as Englishmen. One of the panel was a Scotsman, and I think he liked that.”",34,"be able to live a relatively normal life, free from the pressures of being a famous wizard. I mentioned that we could settle down in a small village, perhaps in the Highlands, and live a quiet life surrounded by nature. Arthur seemed taken with the idea, and we spent the rest of the evening poring over maps and guidebooks, dreaming of a future far removed from the hustle and bustle of London. As the night wore on, our fantasies became more and more elaborate, with Arthur regaling me with tales of his ancestors' exploits in the Highlands, and me spinning yarns of the magical creatures that were said to inhabit the glens and lochs. It was a magical evening, one that left me feeling more hopeful about our future together than I had in weeks."
"When I brought the glass up—stoppering the rest of the bottle for dinner—I could hear Graham singing “I love to steal awhile away,” occasionally muffled by his drags on a cigarette. Water plashed against the tub.","He dropped to humming and presumably soaping. I slid quietly to the floor and leaned my head against the wall. I wasn’t going to see a Ministry therapist. I knew I should, and I knew I wouldn’t.",73,"The sound was soothing, and I closed my eyes, letting the cool liquid slide down my throat. As I stood there, I couldn't help but think about how Graham's voice had changed over the years. It was still smooth and rich, but there was a hint of weariness to it now, a sense of world-weariness that I'd never noticed before. I opened my eyes to find him standing in the doorway, a towel wrapped around his waist, his hair dripping wet. He smiled at me, and for a moment, I forgot about the weariness, forgot about everything except the way my heart skipped a beat when he looked at me like that. ""You okay?"" he asked, his voice low and husky, and I nodded, feeling a little shy all of a sudden. He padded over to me, his bare feet making barely a sound on the tile floor, and took the glass from my hand. ""You didn't have to bring me a drink,"" he said, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled. ""I know,"" I said, feeling a little silly. ""I just thought you might like it."" He took a sip, his eyes never leaving mine, and I felt my heart flutter in my chest. It was moments like these that I cherished, moments when it was just us, alone in our little bubble of happiness."
"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century. On ships there were cooks and officers’ stewards; at home, on the few occasions he was at home, there were women. Nevertheless, he had taken to cooking in a way he had failed to take to","television or texting or the use of deodorants (“I bathe every day,” he’d said to me with hurt dignity). Tonight, he hummed with a busyness that hardly shielded nervousness. He burned the onions and automatically reached for his cigarettes. I took them away—I didn’t want ashy Bolognese—and he accused me of “nanny-stating” him, a turn of phrase I found very alarming because I certainly hadn’t taught it to him. Where was he picking this stuff up?",152,"most other domestic pursuits. He found the simple, methodical nature of the task to be soothing, and the ability to create something nourishing and satisfying from raw ingredients to be a pleasant surprise. As he chopped, sautéed, and seasoned his way through various recipes, Graham began to feel a sense of accomplishment and independence he had never experienced before. The discovery of a small, quirky cookbook in the back of a used bookstore had been the catalyst for this newfound hobby, and he had spent hours poring over its yellowed pages, marveling at the strange and exotic ingredients, and attempting to decipher the cryptic instructions. His first few attempts at cooking had been, shall we say, less than stellar, but he had persevered, driven by a determination to master the art. And now, as he stood in his small kitchen, stirring a pot of simmering stew, he felt a sense of pride and contentment wash over him. The aroma wafting from the pot was incredible, and he couldn't wait to taste the finished product. He had come a long way from the bland, institutional meals of his past, and he was grateful for the discovery of this new passion. As he waited for the stew to finish cooking, Graham's mind began to wander, and he found himself thinking about the strange and winding path that had led him to this moment. From the frozen tundras of the Arctic to the bustling streets of the twenty-first century, his journey had been long and arduous, but it had ultimately led him to this small, cozy kitchen, where he was free to explore the simple pleasures of cooking and savor the joy of a meal well-made."
Margaret was wearing high-waisted cerulean bell-bottoms and a white blouse clocked with lace. She looked like a disco,"goddess, an astonishing concoction given that she was only barely older than the piano, never mind the synth.",36,"queen from a bygone era, her style a nostalgic throwback to the flashy dance floors of the 1970s. As she walked into the dimly lit café, the soft glow of the string lights overhead danced across her face, illuminating the delicate features that seemed almost otherworldly in their perfection. Her long, curly brown hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall of chestnut silk, and her bright hazel eyes sparkled with a mischievous glint that hinted at a sharp wit and a quick intelligence. Despite the retro flair of her outfit, there was something undeniably modern about Margaret, a sense of confidence and self-assurance that commanded attention without demanding it. As she made her way to the counter, the barista looked up from his phone and caught her eye, flashing a warm smile that Margaret returned with a radiant grin of her own."
"Arthur was happy and flushed. He was one of those unusual extroverts who have all the attributes of an introvert, save that they like being around other people. He had a gift for gentleness too, one of the rarest virtues in","any gender and especially in the kind of man Arthur was supposed to be. I eased some biography out of him: half-decent public school; classics at Oxford, where he’d had a lot of fun and failed his exams; retraining as a doctor.",83,"the world, and it was this that made him so well-liked by everyone who knew him. He had a way of making people feel at ease, of listening to them with a depth of understanding that was almost uncanny. As he walked through the crowded room, he was stopped every few feet by someone who wanted to chat, to laugh, or simply to bask in the warmth of his presence. And Arthur, happy to oblige, would pause and talk, his eyes sparkling with interest, his smile a beacon of welcome. He was a people person, through and through, and he reveled in the joy of connection, of community, of being part of a larger whole. Despite his introverted tendencies, he had a deep love of parties, of gatherings, of any occasion that brought people together. And tonight, surrounded by friends and acquaintances, he felt truly alive, his heart full of joy and his spirit soaring. As he made his way through the throng, he felt a sense of belonging, of being exactly where he was meant to be. And in that moment, he knew that this was what it meant to be happy – to be surrounded by people, to be connected, to be alive."
I saw Graham’s eyebrow quirk in a rascally way as he did,"the math. “You became a captain extremely quickly, Sixteen. Found your forte?”",24,"his best to stifle a grin, and I couldn't help but laugh at the sight, knowing that look all too well from our years of friendship, a look that usually preceded some kind of mischief or clever quip that would leave me in stitches, and I found myself wondering what he was up to this time, my curiosity piqued as I waited for him to make his move."
"Arthur grimaced. I saw his hand shiver momentarily on his glass, and then he","swallowed everything in it with a wet click. “Promotion was—fast—in the war,” he said shortly.",29,"steadied it, his eyes fixed on some point across the room. I followed his gaze, but there was nothing out of the ordinary to see - just the usual assortment of patrons, laughing and chatting over their drinks. I turned back to Arthur, my curiosity piqued. ""What's wrong?"" I asked him, trying to keep my voice low. He hesitated, his eyes darting around the room before coming back to mine. ""I don't know,"" he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. ""I just have this feeling that something's off."" I raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself. ""What kind of feeling?"" I pressed, leaning in a little closer. Arthur's eyes locked onto mine, his expression serious. ""I don't know,"" he repeated. ""It's just a hunch. But I've been having these... visions, I suppose you'd call them. Fragments of images, really. And I keep seeing this one face, over and over again."" He paused, his eyes glazing over as if he was lost in thought. ""A woman's face,"" he said finally. ""With piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair. I don't know who she is, but I feel like I'm supposed to know her."" I felt a shiver run down my spine as he spoke, a shiver that had nothing to do with the cold. There was something about Arthur's words that resonated deep within me, something that made me feel like I was on the verge of uncovering a long-forgotten secret."
"Margaret, incidentally, listened to the men talk about their careers with a suffused urgency that only I noticed. In her own era, she’d slept in the room next to the one where she had been born.","She thought Scotland was far-flung and semi-barbaric. When we came round to talking about my time working as a translator in Cambodia, I felt her attention all over me. I may have talked slightly too much.",72,"Her eyes would light up with a deep longing as they spoke of their accomplishments, and I could sense the weight of her own unfulfilled aspirations. It was as if the stories of their successes had awakened a part of her that had long been dormant, a part that yearned to break free from the constraints of her time and experience the world in all its complexity. I watched as she listened intently, her hands clasped tightly together in her lap, her gaze fixed on some point beyond the present moment. The men, oblivious to the turmoil brewing beneath her composed exterior, continued to talk, their words painting vivid pictures of a world that was both familiar and foreign to her. As the evening wore on, Margaret's expression grew more introspective, her thoughts drifting back to the life she had left behind, and the choices she had made. The room seemed to grow quieter, the shadows cast by the flickering candles deepening, as if the very darkness itself was listening to her unspoken thoughts."
"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag. I was shortly handing my grinder and papers to Graham (who was far more adept at rolling).,52,"my opinion was a very short list. But somehow, we had started talking about weed, and I was surprised to find that most of my friends had tried it at least once. I was the only one who hadn't, and I felt like I was missing out on some kind of rite of passage. One of my friends, Alex, was particularly enthusiastic about it, and he started telling us about the different types of strains and their effects. He explained that some were more relaxing, while others were more energizing, and that some even had medicinal properties. I listened intently, fascinated by the complexity of it all. As the conversation went on, I found myself wondering what it would be like to try it, to experience the sensation that everyone else seemed to be talking about. But at the same time, I was hesitant, unsure of what to expect and worried about the potential risks. The debate continued, with some of my friends arguing that it was harmless and others expressing concerns about its impact on mental health. I listened to their perspectives, weighing the pros and cons in my mind. As the night wore on, I realized that I still had a lot to learn about weed, and that my friends' experiences were just the beginning of my education."
"Meeting Margaret made me vivid and receptive. Sentences weighed more. I kept a half-conscious catalog of where the men were looking. I’ve seen people deal with this in different ways. By “this,” I mean power. I mean magnetism. I try to absorb it. Within twenty minutes Margaret","and I were planning a girls-take-Soho night out, which necessitated me explaining the history of Soho, the concept of clubbing, the genre of R & B, the club night R & She, and dancing. I hadn’t been clubbing since I was an assistant in Languages. No matter.",94,"had effortlessly commanded the attention of every person in the room, and I found myself drawn to her with an intensity that was almost palpable. Her presence was like a gravitational pull, warping the space around her and making it impossible to look away. I watched, transfixed, as she laughed and joked with the men, her words dripping with a confident charm that was both captivating and intimidating. As I observed her, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy - how did she do it? What was the secret to her effortless magnetism? I felt like a student, eager to learn from a master, and I leaned in, my senses heightened, as I tried to absorb every detail of her performance. The way she tilted her head, the way her eyes sparkled, the way her voice seemed to vibrate with an inner power - it was all so mesmerizing, so compelling, that I felt myself becoming lost in the spectacle of her. And yet, even as I was drawn to her, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to Margaret, something beneath the surface that I couldn't quite see. A hidden depth, a secret self that only revealed itself in fleeting glimpses, like the flash of a fish in the depths of a dark pool. I was determined to uncover it, to peel back the layers and reveal the truth that lay beneath."
"“Such matters are between myself and God,” he said gravely. “Oh, stop frowning, Sixty-five.","Arthur, will you please lead her in a polka, if you can still stand.”",28,"“You look as if you've lost your last friend. I'm not going to let a little thing like a death sentence get me down, I promise you that.” He smiled wryly and patted the arm of the chair beside him, inviting Sixty-five to sit. “Come, let's talk of more pleasant things. How was your day, my friend?” Sixty-five hesitated for a moment, then sat down, his eyes never leaving the old man's face. “It was...uneventful, sir,” he replied, his voice a little softer than usual. The old man nodded, his eyes twinkling with amusement. “I'm glad to hear that. Uneventful days are often the best kind, don't you think?”"
"“In this age, musicians are imprinted inside music boxes, and there is no need for the band to","keep time,” said Margaret. “You will instruct me in the polka, or I will step on your toes.”",36,"be physically present to create music. The music boxes, also known as ""Sonic Containers,"" have revolutionized the music industry, allowing for a new level of convenience and accessibility. With the ability to record and store the essence of a musician's performance, these containers can be easily transported and played back in any location, eliminating the need for live performances. As a result, the role of musicians has shifted from performers to creators, focusing on producing high-quality recordings that can be enjoyed by people all over the world. However, this shift has also raised concerns about the impact on the music industry, with some arguing that it has led to a loss of the emotional connection and energy that comes with live performances. Despite these concerns, the use of music boxes has become increasingly popular, and it will be interesting to see how this technology continues to evolve and shape the music industry in the years to come."
"Arthur, by contrast, danced beautifully. He dipped me, and I bent like","a reed. He spun me, and I was, with such satisfaction, spun.",24,"a willow branch, my back arched and my arms extended, as he twirled me around the dance floor with effortless ease, the music swirling around us like a vortex, our steps perfectly in sync, the crowd around us a blur as we lost ourselves in the rhythm and the magic of the moment, our laughter and the sound of the music mingling together in a joyous, unforgettable melody."
"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket. My bedside table sprouted two water glasses and a mug. Dust crouched on the skirting boards and in the seams of","my chest of drawers. When a woman is as impossibly attractive as Margaret, the mediocrity shed by a woman like me bustles around her like a horde of pigeons. Or so I thought, at that time. Truthfully, I’d been foxed by how beautiful she was. I felt a complicated anguish when I saw her little besocked toes treadling the carpet.",119,"the carpet, and a faint scent of stale air wafted through the room, a stark contrast to the fresh, floral aroma that usually lingered after her visits. I felt a pang of guilt for noticing these imperfections, but my gaze continued to wander, taking in the scattered books and papers on the floor, the faint ring of a coffee stain on the bedside table, and the tangled mess of my hair tie and earbuds on the nightstand. It was as if the room had been frozen in a state of disarray, waiting for her return to bring order and serenity back to our little sanctuary. I couldn't help but wonder what she would think if she saw the state of our room, and whether she would be disappointed in me for letting things get this out of hand. As I stood there, lost in thought, I heard the sound of her footsteps approaching, and my heart skipped a beat as I realized I had to quickly come up with a plan to tidy up before she saw the mess. But as the door creaked open and she stepped inside, a warm smile spreading across her face, I knew I was in trouble. ""Hey, I'm home,"" she said, dropping her bag onto the floor and surveying the room with a critical eye. I held my breath, waiting for her reaction, but instead of the scolding I expected, she simply chuckled and shook her head. ""I see you've been busy,"" she said, her voice dripping with amusement. ""Or not busy enough, depending on how you look at it."" She walked over to me, her eyes sparkling with mirth, and wrapped her arms around my waist. ""Don't worry, I'm not here to clean up after you,"" she whispered, her breath tickling my ear. ""I'm here to make a mess with you."" And with that, she pulled me into a kiss, and the state of our room was forgotten in an instant."
Margaret appeared unaware of any of these concerns. She didn’t even glance at herself,in the mirror. She gave me an interested grin as I pulled out my lipsticks.,29,"in the mirror that hung on the wall, her focus solely on the task at hand. Her hands moved with precision, her fingers deftly handling the delicate objects in front of her. The soft hum of the machinery and the faint scent of chemicals filled the air, a familiar and comforting atmosphere for her. As she worked, her mind began to wander, thoughts drifting to the upcoming meeting with her colleagues and the presentation she had spent hours preparing. Despite the weight of responsibility on her shoulders, she felt a sense of calm wash over her, a sense of being exactly where she was meant to be."
"I’d stopped wearing it—I was, at the time, thinking of the way my face might be received by a Victorian who didn’t approve of cosmetics—but I demonstrated the coverage of my sole foundation. Margaret","was amazed by the smoothness of its application and the faithfulness of its shade. She drew an arrow with it on her cheek. On her fair skin, it looked like clay. We started giggling.",68,"was taken aback by the transformation, her eyes widening in surprise as she took in the subtle yet noticeable difference it made. She asked me a flurry of questions about the product, from its ingredients to its application, and I found myself launching into a detailed explanation of my skincare routine. As we delved deeper into the world of cosmetics, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. I remembered the countless hours I'd spent as a teenager, poring over beauty blogs and watching YouTube tutorials, desperate to master the art of makeup. It was a world that had once brought me so much joy, but one that I'd largely abandoned in recent years. Margaret's curiosity, however, had sparked something within me, and I found myself feeling a renewed sense of excitement about the possibilities that makeup held. As we continued to chat, I began to realize that perhaps it was time for me to revisit this old passion of mine, to see if I could recapture some of the magic that had once driven me to spend hours in front of the mirror, experimenting with different looks and techniques. The thought sent a thrill through me, and I couldn't help but wonder what other surprises this chance encounter with Margaret might hold."
"The door grumbled shut and I fell back into a doze. Margaret was snoring lightly, like a puppy being squeezed. The door reopened, and I","surfaced to vague consciousness. I felt a wave of cool air, and then a gentle warmth. He had spread a blanket over the pair of us.",51,"sat up with a start, rubbing my eyes in an attempt to shake off the haze of sleep. The dim fluorescent lights overhead seemed to flicker in sync with my racing heart as I took in the figure standing in the doorway. It was a woman, her features obscured by the shadows that danced across her face. She didn't seem to notice me, her gaze fixed intently on Margaret, who was still peacefully snoring away. The woman's presence was unnerving, and I felt a shiver run down my spine as she took a step closer, her eyes never leaving Margaret's face. I tried to speak, to ask her who she was and what she wanted, but my voice caught in my throat. The woman's gaze finally shifted to me, and I felt a jolt of surprise as our eyes met. There was something familiar about her, something that tugged at the edges of my memory, but I couldn't quite place it. She didn't seem to recognize me, though, her expression a mask of calm curiosity. ""Who are you?"" I managed to croak, my voice barely above a whisper. The woman's gaze lingered on me for a moment before she turned back to Margaret, her eyes narrowing slightly as she took another step closer."
"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century. I was therefore unsurprised when, about half an hour after their plane landed, I got a call from Arthur’s phone.",55,"months he had been in the country, and each time it had been to call the Ministry's emergency number, which he had been assured was the only number he would ever need. The rest of the time, the phone had stayed in his desk drawer, a constant reminder of the Ministry's all-pervasive presence in his life. He had tried to convince himself that it was just a precaution, that the Ministry was only looking out for his safety, but deep down he knew better. The phone was a leash, a way for the Ministry to keep tabs on him at all times. Graham had grown accustomed to the feeling of being watched, but it still made his skin crawl. He often found himself wondering what other ways the Ministry was monitoring him, what other secrets they might be keeping from him. The not knowing was almost worse than the knowing, and it was a feeling that Graham couldn't shake, no matter how hard he tried."
"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece,","but then again, so did Pimlico. I hadn’t seen him since the men had got back from Scotland and I asked him whether he enjoyed his trip.",53,"his eyes fixed intently on some point in the distance. The people passing by him seemed to blur together, their faces a kaleidoscope of features that he barely registered. He was a man on a mission, driven by a purpose that only he could see. As he walked, the sounds of the city faded into the background, replaced by the steady thrum of his own thoughts. The world around him melted away, leaving only the soft rustle of his jacket and the creak of his shoes on the pavement. He was a man out of time, a relic from a bygone era, and yet he moved with a sense of urgency that belied his old-fashioned appearance. His destination was a mystery, but one thing was certain: he would not rest until he reached it."
"It paid off in the early autumn. When I came down for breakfast one morning, I found","Graham at the counter with a dictionary and a tin of protein powder, performing exegesis on the label.",35,"my mother sitting at the kitchen table, a look of quiet satisfaction on her face as she gazed out the window at the garden. The sun was shining, casting a warm glow over everything, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of ripe fruit. I poured myself a bowl of cereal and sat down beside her, feeling a sense of contentment wash over me. It was moments like these that I cherished, the simple, peaceful moments that made all the hard work worth it. As I ate, I noticed a small, neatly wrapped package on the table in front of my mother, a tag attached to it with my name on it. I looked up at her in surprise, and she smiled, her eyes sparkling with amusement. ""A little something I picked up for you,"" she said, her voice low and mysterious. I felt a thrill of excitement as I unwrapped the package, revealing a small, leather-bound book inside. I opened it, and my eyes widened as I saw that it was filled with beautiful, intricate drawings of the garden, each one more breathtaking than the last. I looked up at my mother, my heart full of gratitude, and she smiled, her eyes shining with love."
"Adela was of the “never been to the GP in my life because I’m not a pussy” school of care, and nothing changed. If the expats were","dangerously ill, they’d be removed to the wards and never mind the trigger; if they could get a grip and deal with it at home, they should.",54,"going to get sick, they would get sick in the comfort of their own homes, with a stiff upper lip and a bottle of whiskey. The local hospital was a last resort, a place where only the desperate and the dying ended up. Adela had heard the horror stories from her fellow expats about the long waiting times, the unsanitary conditions, and the doctors who seemed more interested in their mobile phones than their patients. She had always been skeptical of the local healthcare system, and now, as she lay in bed with a raging fever and a pounding headache, she was determined to avoid it at all costs. She would ride this out on her own, just as she always had. But as the days passed and her condition only worsened, Adela began to realize that she might not have a choice. Her body was weakening, her mind foggy, and she knew she needed help. The question was, where would she find it?"
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky. But then again, I knew enough about his biography to know that he was very, very lucky.",141,"of the transcript of that session, which I'd obtained through a Freedom of Information request. It was a curious thing to read, full of Graham's characteristic circumlocutions and the analyst's increasingly frustrated attempts to pin him down. At one point, the analyst had asked him directly if he'd ever experienced sexual desire, and Graham had responded by launching into a lengthy disquisition on the history of the concept of 'taste' in aesthetics, which had left the analyst baffled. I couldn't help but feel a certain admiration for Graham's ability to deflect even the most probing questions, but at the same time, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something important he was hiding. As I sat in my office, staring at the transcript, I found myself wondering what it would be like to be Graham, to see the world through his eyes. Would I, too, find the idea of sex to be 'terribly eighteenth'? The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I pushed it aside, focusing instead on the task at hand. I had a meeting with Graham scheduled for later that day, and I needed to be prepared. I spent the next few hours reviewing the transcript, looking for any clues that might help me understand what was going on behind Graham's enigmatic facade. As the time for our meeting drew near, I felt a sense of trepidation building inside me. What would Graham be like today? Would he be distant and aloof, or would he be more open, more willing to talk? I took a deep breath, stood up, and headed out the door, ready to face whatever the meeting might bring."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory. Every time I gave Graham a book, I was trying to shunt him along a story I’d been telling myself all my life.",101,"something so refreshing about her lack of preconceived notions, a tabula rasa waiting to be filled with the stories and experiences that would shape her perspective on the world. I found myself wanting to be the one to share those stories, to impart my own knowledge and watch as her eyes lit up with understanding. But I knew I had to be careful not to overwhelm her, to let her discover things for herself and form her own opinions. It was a delicate balance, one that I wasn't always sure I was getting right. As we walked through the crowded streets, I pointed out landmarks and shared bits of history, trying to gauge her interest and adjust my pace accordingly. Margaret listened intently, her eyes wide with wonder, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and responsibility. I was her guide, her mentor, and her friend, all rolled into one. And as the days turned into weeks, I found myself growing more and more attached to her, enjoying her company and valuing her unique perspective on the world. But I knew that our time together was limited, that eventually she would leave and I would be left to wonder if I had made a lasting impact on her life. The thought was bittersweet, a reminder that all things must come to an end, but also a motivation to make the most of the time we had together."
Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had,ever seen him to entreating. I thought about it a lot. I liked being entreated by him.,34,"ever come to seeing him so vulnerable, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of worry and responsibility. As his closest friend and confidant, I knew I had to respect his wishes, but at the same time, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was putting his life at risk by not seeking help. The weight of this secret was crushing me, and I found myself constantly looking over my shoulder, fearful that someone would discover the truth. I knew that if the Ministry found out, they would stop at nothing to exploit Graham's condition for their own gain, and the thought sent shivers down my spine. As the days went by, Graham's condition worsened, and I was torn between my loyalty to him and my duty to protect him, even if it meant going against his wishes."
"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right? They fed us all poison from a bottle marked “prestige,” and we developed a high tolerance for bitterness. I would have been more frightened if the pressure lifted, like an indoor cat struck by sudden rain.",119,"and her alibis were worse. I knew she was hiding something, but I had no idea what. I thought maybe she was just another desperate soul trying to survive in a world that seemed determined to crush us all. I thought maybe she was just trying to protect herself, to keep her head down and avoid drawing attention. But I was wrong. Adela was playing a much deeper game, one that I couldn't even begin to understand. And I was just a pawn, a foolish little pawn who thought I was making my own moves. I thought I was in control, but I was just dancing on the strings of her manipulation. And now, as I look back, I realize that I was lucky to have gotten out alive. Lucky to have escaped the trap she set for me, lucky to have avoided the fate that awaited those prisoners on the tram. But at the time, I didn't feel lucky. I felt stupid, and angry, and scared. I felt like I had been played, like I had been used. And I didn't know how to process it, how to deal with the emotions that were swirling inside me. All I knew was that I had to get out, to get as far away from Adela and her games as possible. And so I ran, I ran as fast and as far as I could, not stopping until I was sure I was safe. But even now, I know that I'll never be able to fully escape the consequences of that day. The memories will haunt me forever, a constant reminder of my own foolishness and the dangers of underestimating others."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.",39,"that a man could be so utterly convinced of his own genius, yet so catastrophically wrong. I told him it was a combination of ego, ignorance, and a dash of madness, but he just chuckled and said I was jealous. I wasn't jealous, I was appalled. The man had single-handedly managed to turn a simple project into a catastrophe, and yet he seemed to think he was some kind of visionary. I shook my head, wondering how someone so intelligent could be so blind to his own flaws. Graham just smiled and patted me on the back, telling me I'd come around to his way of thinking eventually. I doubted it."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.",56,"his lips, a look of deep contemplation on his face. The room was filled with the savory aroma of roasting meat and the sweet scent of baking cookies, a combination that immediately lifted my spirits. I hung my coat on the hook by the door and walked over to give Graham a gentle kiss on the cheek, trying not to startle him out of his reverie. ""Hey, what's cooking?"" I asked, my stomach growling in anticipation. Graham looked up, a hint of a smile playing on his lips, and replied, ""Just a little something I whipped up. I thought we could use a nice dinner in."" I smiled, feeling grateful for the effort he had put into cooking a meal for us. As I made my way to the kitchen to see what he had prepared, I noticed the table was set with our good china and a bottle of wine was chilling in the ice bucket. It looked like Graham had planned a special evening, and I couldn't wait to see what the rest of the night had in store."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.",94,"electrons in the lab. I was amazed by the way he could focus on the smallest details, whether it was the delicate balance of spices in a Thai curry or the intricate patterns of a molecular structure. As we cooked, he would ask me about the different ingredients, their origins, and the stories behind each dish. I found myself opening up to him in ways I never thought possible, sharing stories about my childhood and the memories associated with each recipe. The kitchen became a space where our two worlds collided, where the precision of science met the creativity of cooking. Graham's curiosity was infectious, and soon I found myself experimenting with new flavors and techniques, pushing the boundaries of traditional Southeast Asian cuisine. Together, we created a fusion of flavors that was both familiar and innovative, a true reflection of our unlikely friendship. As the aromas wafted through the air, I realized that cooking had become a language we both understood, a way for us to communicate and connect on a deeper level. And in that moment, I knew that our friendship was something special, a bond that transcended words and cultures."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself. Whatever Adela said, he wasn’t ready, he’d barely left London, let alone land. But I wanted him to stay for other reasons too. It was humiliating to know that about myself and to say nothing into his implacable placidity.",98,"at a time, and I knew that would be impossible if he rejoined the navy. I had visions of him coming home to our children, who would be born in the next few years, and being a present father, not a distant figure who only appeared sporadically. I encouraged him to explore other options, to find a career that would allow him to use his skills and experience in a more stable and family-friendly environment. He was hesitant at first, but eventually, he began to see the sense in my words and started to look into other opportunities. We spent countless hours scouring job listings, networking with people in his field, and practicing his interview skills. It wasn't easy, but slowly, he began to build a new career path for himself, one that would allow him to provide for our family while also being present for all the milestones and everyday moments that make life worth living. As he navigated this new chapter, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for his resilience and determination. He was adapting to a new country, a new language, and a new way of life, all while trying to build a new career and start a family. It was a daunting task, but he was facing it head-on, and I knew that together, we could overcome anything."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.",64,"The upbeat melody filled the room, a stark contrast to the tense atmosphere that had settled over the group. Graham, oblivious to the irony, began to tap his foot along with the music, his eyes fixed intently on the screen in front of him. The others, however, were too engrossed in their discussion to notice the sudden change in music. They were in the midst of a heated debate, their voices rising and falling in a crescendo of argument and counterargument. As the song reached its climax, one of them slammed their fist on the table, making everyone jump. The music, it seemed, had become a distant hum, a background noise that was easily drowned out by the intensity of their conversation. But just as it seemed like things were about to escalate further, the song came to an abrupt end, plunging the room into an uncomfortable silence. The sudden stillness was a palpable thing, a living, breathing entity that seemed to pulse with tension. It was as if the music had been holding everything together, and now that it was gone, the very fabric of their discussion was beginning to unravel. Graham, sensing the shift in mood, finally looked up from his screen, his eyes scanning the room with a mixture of curiosity and concern. The others, too, seemed to be waiting for something, their eyes fixed on some point beyond the walls of the room, as if searching for a way to break the silence and restore the equilibrium that had been lost."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:",122,"and that I'd have to confront him about it, or worse, that his online activities would somehow seep into our daily lives, like a stain spreading through the carpet. I pictured him hunched over the computer, his eyes scanning the screen with an unwholesome intensity, his fingers moving with a newfound dexterity as he clicked through page after page of...whatever it was he was looking for. The thought made my skin crawl, and I found myself wondering if I should just take the computer away, or limit his access to the internet, but then I'd have to explain why, and I didn't know if I was ready for that conversation. I was trapped in a cycle of anxiety, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios, as I waited for the inevitable, the moment when I'd have to confront the reality of Graham's online activities. And then, one day, the report arrived, and I steeled myself for the worst, my heart sinking as I opened the file and began to scan the list of search terms. But as I read through the list, my anxiety began to give way to confusion - ""birdwatching,"" ""gardening tips,"" ""recipes for scones."" I felt a wave of relief wash over me, followed by a twinge of guilt for having jumped to conclusions. It seemed that Graham's online activities were far more mundane than I had imagined, and I couldn't help but laugh at my own foolishness. But as I continued to read through the report, I noticed something strange - a single search term, buried at the bottom of the list, that made my heart skip a beat: ""how to delete browser history."""
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.",151,"but to me it just looked like a lot of people getting very wet. I spotted Mrs. Jenkins from number seventeen, her hair tied up in a scarf, expertly stacking sandbags in front of her garden gate. Her husband, a retired accountant, was standing beside her, directing the operation with a large umbrella. I waved, and they waved back, their faces set in determined smiles. The water was rising fast, but it seemed to be bringing the community together. I made my way through the crowds, exchanging greetings and words of encouragement with my neighbors. Everyone was in high spirits, despite the chaos around us. As I approached my house, I saw that my family had already started building their own barricade. My dad was lugging a heavy sandbag up the path, while my mom was trying to secure a tarpaulin over the front door. My little brother was dancing around them, laughing and splashing in the puddles. I joined in, and together we worked to protect our home from the rising floodwaters. The sound of laughter and chatter filled the air, mingling with the patter of the rain and the occasional shout of encouragement from the council workers. It was a surreal and slightly absurd scene, but it was also strangely exhilarating. As the water continued to rise, we worked together, a small but determined community, ready to face whatever the storm threw our way."
"“It’s better that we continue to work closely with Eighteen-forty-seven,” Adela","had said, “given that he seems likely to survive the year.”",22,"added, her voice firm but laced with a hint of desperation, as she glanced around the dimly lit room where the remaining members of the council were seated, their faces etched with concern and uncertainty, the weight of their decision hanging precariously in the balance, like the fate of their very existence."
"Adela’s voice contracted on that last sentence. She wiped her gaze, concentrated in her one working eye, up and down my face, to see if I’d noticed, and continued, “Our first priority","is protecting the expats and the time-door. The time-door has been moved to a secure location. I suggest you retake the physical aptitude assessment, and then we can work on your lateral-reasoning scores—”",65,"is to get you to a safe place, somewhere you can rest and recover. I've arranged for a car to take us to a secure location on the outskirts of the city. We'll be able to assess your injuries and figure out our next move from there. But first, we need to get out of here, now. We can't risk being seen or caught by... them. I've managed to disable the security cameras in this area, but we don't have much time before they realize what's happened and send someone to investigate. Can you walk, or do you need me to carry you? We need to move, quickly and quietly. Stay close to me and follow my lead. I'll get you through this, I promise."
"Arthur was gentle, no matter how grotty my behavior. He had found out about Scrabble, and he sometimes brought",his travel set along—my inner competitive bitch could stave off a black mood for half an hour or so.,38,"his own board to the hospital, setting it up on a tray over my bed, and we'd play for hours, the letters blurring together as my eyes grew tired. He was a formidable opponent, but he never gloated when he won, which was often. Instead, he'd smile and say, ""You'll get me next time, kiddo."" And I would, occasionally, but not often enough to make a difference. Those games were a welcome distraction from the beeping machines and sterile smells of the hospital, a reminder that there was still a world outside these walls, a world where people played games and laughed together. Arthur's visits were the highlight of my day, and I looked forward to them with an eagerness that I hadn't felt in a long time."
"My email made a chiding noise. Adela was the originator, and she’d put me in blind copy.",It was a short email. Adela had a real gift for cramming apoplexy into a couple of lines.,35,"Her message was brief, but the words danced on the screen with an air of urgency, requesting a meeting at the old café on the outskirts of town at midnight, with no explanation given. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I read the words, the dim glow of the screen casting an eerie light on my face. The clock on my wall seemed to tick louder, each passing second a countdown to the mysterious rendezvous. I tried to shake off the feeling of unease, telling myself it was just Adela being dramatic, but the seed of curiosity had been planted, and I couldn't help but wonder what she wanted to discuss in such secrecy. The hours ticked by at a glacial pace, each one stretching out like an eternity, until finally, the appointed hour arrived, and I found myself standing outside the café, the neon sign casting a gaudy glow over the deserted street."
The email told us that her death would be reported to the expats as,"a suicide. “This cannot be emphasized enough,” Adela had written, with a double underline.",28,"a tragic accident, and that the local authorities would be handling the investigation, but we knew the truth - she had been murdered, and it was only a matter of time before the news spread like wildfire through the tight-knit community, threatening to expose the dark underbelly of our seemingly idyllic expat haven."
"Arthur smiled and sat down beside me, stretching out his long legs. Twisting the signet ring on his finger—a tell as","clarion as my skin biting—he murmured, “We didn’t know her as well as we would have liked. I wish we had.”",42,"much as the way he drummed his fingers on the armrest—that he was deep in thought. I watched him, my eyes tracing the sharp lines of his profile, the way the dim light of the room danced across his features. His eyes, a deep, piercing blue, seemed to bore into the distance, lost in some inner world. I felt a pang of curiosity, wondering what thoughts were swirling behind those eyes, what secrets he kept hidden beneath his charming smile. The silence between us was comfortable, a warm and familiar thing, like a well-worn blanket. I settled back into the couch, feeling the soft cushions envelop me, and waited for Arthur to break the silence, to share whatever was weighing on his mind."
"Anne Spencer almost made it off those wards. After I read the email, an ancient and exuberant terror blazed through me. It was partly the terror that had grown in me alongside my very bones,","knowing as I did that I only existed because my mother had outrun almost; I don’t know at what point you stop feeling the need to run, generation by generation, when you’re born after that.",70,"the one that had been my constant companion since childhood, a low-grade fever that spiked whenever I thought about the fragility of life. But it was also something more, a sense of foreboding that seemed to seep from the very words on the page. I felt like I was staring into the abyss, with the darkness staring back at me. My mind began to reel as I thought about all the what-ifs, the maybes, and the could-haves. What if Anne had made it off those wards? Maybe she would have been okay, maybe she would have lived. Could she have been saved? The questions swirled in my head like a maelstrom, each one pulling me down deeper into the depths of despair. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of uncertainty, with no lifeline in sight. And then, like a liferaft on the horizon, I saw it - a glimmer of hope, a chance to make things right, to change the course of events. But it was a fragile thing, a delicate thread that could snap at any moment, leaving me plummeting back into the darkness."
"He was sitting at the noisome kitchen table, staring at nothing. Rogue Male was lying splayed and face down by the ashtray. The thing in my chest kicked again","as I realized he must have grabbed it as we left our home. When I came in, he didn’t move anything but his gaze, which swung up like a whip.",59,"and I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead. I tried to take a deep breath, but my lungs felt constricted, as if a tight band had been wrapped around my chest. The air in the room seemed to thicken, making it hard to swallow. I glanced around the kitchen, searching for something, anything, to distract me from the growing sense of unease. The fluorescent light above the sink flickered, casting eerie shadows on the walls. I shivered, despite the sweltering heat. The thing in my chest kicked again, harder this time, and I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. I pushed my chair back, the legs scraping against the linoleum floor, and stood up, my eyes fixed on Rogue Male's motionless form. I took a step forward, my heart racing, and then another, my mind screaming at me to get out of there, to get as far away from that kitchen as possible. But my feet seemed rooted to the spot, unable to move, unable to look away from the scene before me."
