The competition is palpable, and I can sense the air of nervous anticipation as we exchange awkward smiles and firm handshakes. We're all dressed to impress, sporting our best business attire, and armed with an arsenal of rehearsed responses to the most common interview questions. As we wait for the program to begin, I take a moment to scan the room, sizing up my competition. There's the Harvard MBA with the chiseled jawline, the Stanford engineer with the impressive coding credentials, and the Wharton grad with the razor-sharp wit. I wonder what sets me apart from the rest, what unique quality or skill I possess that will make me stand out in this sea of overachievers. The program director, a no-nonsense woman with a warm smile, steps forward to welcome us and outline the agenda for the day. As she speaks, I feel a surge of adrenaline coursing through my veins, and I know that the next few weeks will be a wild ride."
"The truth, though, is quite the opposite. I hated school at first sight—with the direct consequence that school hated the sullen, listless child that I was right back. In the first grade, I refused to learn how to write my name, even though Hannah is only three letters repeated twice. In junior high, I set a school record for the highest number of consecutive detention days—what happens when","you decide to take a stand and not do homework for any of your classes because they are too boring, too difficult, too useless, or all of the above.

I felt like I was stuck in a never-ending cycle of boredom and rebellion, with no escape in sight. But then, something changed. I discovered a passion for writing, and suddenly, the world didn't seem so dull anymore. I started writing short stories and poetry, and for the first time, I felt like I had found something that truly belonged to me. My grades began to improve, and I started to see a glimmer of hope that I might actually make it through high school without completely losing my mind. Of course, this newfound love of writing didn't exactly make me the most popular kid in school. In fact, it only seemed to further solidify my status as an outsider. But I didn't care. For the first time in my life, I felt like I was doing something that truly mattered, something that brought me joy and fulfillment. And that was all that mattered. As I delved deeper into the world of writing, I began to realize that it wasn't just about putting words on paper – it was about self-expression, about tapping into my deepest thoughts and emotions, and about connecting with others on a deeper level. It was about finding my voice, and using it to make a difference. And that's when it hit me – I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to spend my life crafting stories that would touch people's hearts, that would make them laugh and cry and think. I wanted to leave my mark on the world, to make a difference in some small way. And so, I set out on a journey to make that dream a reality, one word at a time."
"“It’s like space is your whole personality,” the girl I casually hooked up with during most of my sophomore year of undergrad told me. It was after I explained that no, thank you, I wasn’t interested in going out for coffee to meet her friends because of a lecture on","Kalpana Chawla I was planning to attend. “Do you have any other interests?” she asked.

She raised an eyebrow, clearly not understanding why I would prioritize a lecture over socializing, and that's when she made the comment about space being my whole personality. I didn't know how to respond, so I just shrugged and changed the subject. Looking back, I realize that her statement was more perceptive than I gave her credit for. My fascination with space and architecture wasn't just a quirk or a hobby – it was a fundamental aspect of who I was. I spent most of my free time reading about the history of urban planning, from the grand boulevards of Haussmann's Paris to the futuristic visions of Le Corbusier's Radiant City. I loved how a well-designed space could bring people together, foster a sense of community, and even shape the way we think and feel. As I delved deeper into my studies, I began to see the world as a complex web of interconnected spaces, each with its own unique character and rhythm. And I knew that I wanted to contribute to this world, to leave my mark on the built environment and make it a more beautiful, more functional, and more just place. But for now, I was content to simply observe and learn, soaking up the knowledge and inspiration that would one day help me create spaces that would inspire and uplift others."
"“Yeah, I’m not sure.” She shrugs and continues to make her way through a Tupperware of broccoli, an apple, and approximately two fucktons of Cheez-Its. “I don’t really know much about him.

I've even tried to bring it up with my siblings, but they just shrug it off and change the subject. It's really frustrating, because I feel like I'm missing out on a big part of my family's history. I've always wondered what really happened, and why it's such a big deal. Maybe I'll try to do some digging and see if I can uncover some more information. I'm curious to know more about my family's past, and I'm not going to let a little thing like awkwardness stop me. I take another bite of my snack, lost in thought as I ponder the mysteries of my family's dynamics. The Cheez-Its are stale, but I don't even notice, too caught up in my own little world of speculation and curiosity. I glance over at my friend, who's watching me with a concerned expression. ""Hey, you okay?"" she asks, and I nod, snapping back to reality. ""Yeah, I'm fine. Just lost in thought, I guess."" She nods sympathetically and we sit in silence for a moment, munching on our snacks and enjoying the quiet companionship. But my mind is still racing, turning over all the what-ifs and maybes, trying to piece together the puzzle of my family's past."

"The section is in C++.

And then, just as I thought I had finally grasped the fundamentals, I would stumble upon a new concept that would send me tumbling back down the rabbit hole. It was a frustrating, yet exhilarating, cycle of learning and relearning. But with each new language, I began to notice a pattern. The more I learned, the more I realized that the skills I had developed in one language were transferable to another. The problem-solving strategies, the logical thinking, the attention to detail – these were the skills that truly mattered, not the specific syntax or semantics of a particular language. And so, as I delved deeper into the world of programming, I began to see the connections between languages, the underlying principles that governed them all. It was a profound realization, one that has stayed with me to this day, and one that has allowed me to approach new languages with a sense of confidence and curiosity, rather than fear and intimidation."
"My heart rate picks up. Warmth twists in my lower stomach. I lean forward with a smile, feeling like I’m finally in my element. This, this, is what I know best.

"As we all know, in early 2010, the rover Spirit became stuck in a sand trap, was unable to reorient its solar panels toward the sun, and froze to death as a consequence of its lack of power.

Although the mission team made numerous attempts to revive Opportunity, it was ultimately declared lost in February 2019. The loss of these two rovers highlights the challenges and risks associated with space exploration, particularly when it comes to the harsh Martian environment. Despite these setbacks, NASA has continued to push the boundaries of space exploration, with the Curiosity rover, launched in 2011, still actively exploring the Martian surface. The Perseverance rover, launched in July 2020, has also joined the ranks of Martian explorers, with a focus on searching for signs of past or present life on the Red Planet. The experiences and lessons learned from Spirit and Opportunity have undoubtedly contributed to the design and operation of these newer rovers, enabling them to navigate the unforgiving Martian terrain with greater success. As we look to the future of space exploration, it is essential to acknowledge the pioneering achievements of Spirit and Opportunity, which paved the way for the continued exploration of our celestial neighbor. Their legacy serves as a testament to human ingenuity and the unwavering pursuit of knowledge, inspiring future generations of scientists, engineers, and explorers to venture forth into the unknown."

Furthermore, the project's focus on interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge sharing aligns with NASA's mission to advance scientific knowledge and inspire future generations of researchers and explorers. With the right support and resources, Dr. Arroyo's project has the potential to make a lasting impact on the scientific community and beyond."
"I met Dr. Merel because he was my direct superior during AMASE, and he is . . . an odd duck, honestly. Very stiff. Very hard-core. NASA is full of ambitious people, but he seems to be almost obsessed with results, publications, the kind of sexy science that makes","big splashy news. Initially I wasn’t a fan, but I must admit that as a supervisor he’s been nothing but supportive. He’s the one who selected me for the expedition to begin with, and he encouraged me to apply for funding once I went to him with my project idea.","headlines and gets your name known.

I remember one time, we were out in the field, collecting samples, and he got so focused on this one particular rock that he completely forgot to eat lunch. I mean, we all get caught up in the moment, but this was different. He just stood there, staring at that rock, taking notes and muttering to himself, while the rest of us were trying to enjoy our sandwiches. It was a bit surreal, to be honest. Despite his intensity, though, he's a brilliant scientist, and I learned a lot from him during my time at NASA. He has this ability to cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter, to identify the key questions that need to be answered. And he's not afraid to take risks, to challenge conventional wisdom and push the boundaries of what's thought to be possible. That's something that I admire about him, even if his people skills can be a bit... lacking at times. Anyway, after AMASE, I didn't really keep in touch with Dr. Merel, but I'd hear about his work from time to time, and I was always impressed by the impact he was making in the field. So, when I saw his name on the list of attendees for the conference, I made a point to seek him out and catch up. I was curious to see how he was doing, and what he was working on now. As it turned out, he was leading a team of researchers on a project to study the effects of climate change on polar ecosystems. It was fascinating stuff, and I ended up spending hours talking to him about it. He was just as intense and focused as ever, but there was something different about him, too. A sense of... I don't know, maybe ""mellowing"" is the wrong word, but he seemed more at peace, more content, than I'd ever seen him before. Maybe it was just the fact that he was doing work that he truly loved, but whatever it was, it was nice to see."

He's a hands-on kind of person, always eager to get his hands dirty and experience things firsthand. I admire that about him, even if it does make me a bit nervous at times. As we make our way to the field site, I can feel the excitement building up inside me. This is it, the moment we've all been waiting for. We're finally going to uncover the secrets that have been hidden beneath the ice for thousands of years. The air is crisp and cold, and I can see my breath as I exhale. Dr. Merel hands me a pair of gloves and a pickaxe, and I take them gratefully. We begin to trudge through the snow, our footsteps the only sound in the stillness. The landscape stretches out before us, a vast expanse of white that seems to go on forever. I feel small and insignificant in the face of such natural beauty, but at the same time, I'm filled with a sense of purpose. We're not just here to sightsee; we're here to make history. As we reach the site, I can see that it's already been partially excavated. There are trenches dug into the ice, and I can see the glint of metal peeking out from beneath the surface. Dr. Merel nods at me, and I begin to carefully brush away the snow and ice, revealing more and more of the ancient artifact. It's slow going, but I'm determined to uncover every last detail. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I'm not going to let it slip away."

His eyes seem to bore into my soul, and I can feel my defenses crumbling. I'm trapped, and I don't know how to escape.

We walk in silence, the only sound being the soft crunch of gravel beneath our feet. I glance up at him, his face set in a determined expression, his jaw clenched.

The trees seem to close in around me, casting deep shadows that make it difficult to see. I fumble in my backpack for my flashlight and turn it on, casting a weak beam of light through the darkness. As I walk, the silence is oppressive, punctuated only by the sound of my own breathing and the rustle of leaves beneath my feet.

Her face lights up, and she pulls out her phone to start searching for the nearest delivery place. I flop down onto the couch beside her, feeling a little relieved. Cooking is so overrated anyway. As we scroll through the menu, I start to feel a pang of guilt. I really should be eating healthier. But then I see the words ""meat lovers"" and all my resolve disappears. We order two large pizzas, complete with extra cheese and pepperoni. And just to balance it out, we throw in an order of chicken wings. Because, you know, protein. The doorbell rings about 20 minutes later, and I jump up to answer it. I take the food from the delivery guy and hand over my credit card, feeling a little like I'm committing a crime. But as I open the box and the smell of melted cheese and tomato sauce wafts out, I know it's worth it. We spend the rest of the evening parked on the couch, stuffing our faces and watching TV. It's not the healthiest night, but it's definitely one of the more enjoyable ones. And as I drift off to sleep that night, my stomach full and my taste buds happy, I know that sometimes it's okay to indulge. After all, life is short. And pizza is delicious."
“Hannah.” His forehead touches mine. He laughs against my mouth. “Dinner is . . . it’s symbolic. A,"metaphor.

It's a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there's always something to be grateful for. His words are laced with a deep emotion, and I can feel the sincerity radiating from him. As we stand there, the tension between us is palpable, but it's no longer just about the physical attraction. It's about the connection we've formed, the trust we've built, and the love that's growing between us. He pulls back, his eyes locking onto mine, and I see the promise of a future together in their depths. ""Come on,"" he says, his voice low and husky, ""let's go make some memories."" He takes my hand, and I follow him, my heart skipping a beat as I realize that this is just the beginning of our journey together."
"He is hot and huge. Closing his eyes, arching his neck before looking at me again with a half-warning, half-pleading expression.

I can see the tension in his body, the way his muscles ripple beneath his skin as he moves closer. His eyes never leave mine, and I can sense the unspoken question hanging in the air. He knows I'm scared, but he also knows I'm curious. I can feel it too, this spark of attraction that seems to grow stronger with every passing moment. He takes another step closer, his movements slow and deliberate, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. I'm not sure what's going to happen next, but I know I'm not going to stop him. I'm frozen in place, my eyes locked on his, as he reaches out a hand and gently brushes a strand of hair behind my ear. The touch sends shivers down my spine, and I feel a rush of excitement mixed with fear. He leans in closer, his face inches from mine, and I can feel his warm breath on my skin. I'm not sure what he's going to do next, but I know I'm ready to find out."
“Or maybe it’s the Vastitas Borealis.” He’s barely intelligible. Doing those little thrusts that are designed more to open me up than to,"fuck me properly, and yet we’re both this close to orgasm. It’s a little scary. “The oceans that used to fill it, Hannah.”","actually bring us closer together.

I try to focus on the sensation, but my mind keeps drifting back to the endless expanse of the Vastitas Borealis, the largest impact basin in the solar system. It's a reminder of the unforgiving environment that lies just beyond our fragile habitat. The thought sends a shiver down my spine, and I try to push it away, focusing on the warmth of his body against mine. But the image lingers, a haunting presence that threatens to disrupt the intimacy of the moment. I force myself to concentrate on his movements, the gentle pressure and the soft sounds he's making, trying to let go of my fears and lose myself in the sensation. As I do, the tension in my body begins to ease, and I feel myself becoming more receptive, more open. It's as if the vast, barren landscape outside has somehow seeped into our lovemaking, imbuing it with a sense of urgency and desperation. We're two fragile, fleeting moments of life in an vast, uncaring universe, and this is our moment of connection, our moment of beauty in the void."
