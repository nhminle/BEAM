I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.",41,"the tension between them was palpable, and I didn't want things to escalate further. As we walked, I could feel the weight of their unspoken words hanging in the air, like a challenge waiting to be accepted. Autumn's eyes kept drifting towards Jack, her expression a mixture of frustration and longing, while Jack's gaze remained fixed on the path ahead, his jaw clenched in a determined line. I knew I had to tread carefully, to find a way to diffuse the situation before it reached a boiling point. But as we continued on in silence, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was merely delaying the inevitable, that the confrontation that was brewing between them would eventually come to a head, and I would be powerless to stop it."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.",49,"Autumn—started talking about how they wanted to go on a camping trip together. At first, I was hesitant, but the more they talked about it, the more excited I became. We started making plans, looking up campsites and checking the weather forecast. Jack even went out and bought a new tent, one that was supposed to be able to withstand even the toughest of weather conditions. Autumn, being the nature lover that she is, started packing all sorts of gear, from hiking boots to a portable stove. I, on the other hand, was more concerned with the food, making sure we had enough snacks and supplies to last us the entire trip. As the days went by, our excitement only grew, and before we knew it, the day of our trip had finally arrived."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.",36,"My mind starts racing as I hear the sound of footsteps approaching the bed. I try to calm myself down, but my heart is beating rapidly. Jack's voice breaks the silence, 'Hey, are you asleep?' I pretend to be, hoping he'll leave me alone. The blankets feel like my only protection, a barrier between me and the outside world. I hold my breath, waiting for him to make his next move. The room is filled with an awkward silence, and I can sense Jack's hesitation. He clears his throat, 'I, uh, I brought you some water.' I slowly open my eyes to find him standing beside the bed, a glass of water in his hand. His eyes meet mine, and for a moment, we just stare at each other."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,41,"to get up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. I can tell he's still half asleep, but he's alert enough to sense that something's off. I take a deep breath and try to explain, but before I can get the words out, he's already moving toward the tent. ""Wait, Jack, don't,"" I say, but he's already pushing aside the flap and ducking inside. I follow close behind, my heart racing with anticipation. As we enter the tent, I see that she's still fast asleep, her chest rising and falling with a slow, peaceful rhythm. Jack looks at me, his eyes questioning, and I can tell he's wondering what's going on. I take another deep breath and try to explain, but the words get stuck in my throat. Suddenly, she stirs, her eyes fluttering open as she takes in her surroundings. She looks at us, confused, and then her gaze falls on Jack. A look of recognition crosses her face, followed by a flash of fear. She tries to sit up, but Jack is too quick, gently pushing her back down onto the sleeping bag. ""It's okay,"" he says softly. ""You're safe now."" But as he looks at me, I can tell he's not so sure."
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.",35,"the words ""my head."" I look at him with concern, but he waves his hand dismissively. ""I'm fine, just a bit of a headache,"" he says, though his eyes tell a different story. His gaze drifts off, lost in thought, and I can sense the weight of his worries bearing down on him. I want to reach out, to offer some comfort, but I'm not sure if he'd welcome it. Instead, I sit down beside him, waiting for him to open up, to share whatever's troubling him. The silence between us is heavy, but I'm willing to wait, to be there for him when he's ready to talk."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”",23,"preoccupied lately, and I'm starting to get worried that something's going on that you're not telling me. Is everything okay? You can talk to me, you know that, right?"
“Why don’t we restart the movie? We can all watch it.” Jack,gives me a look to remind me that our other conversation isn’t over.,25,"suggested, trying to lighten the mood, but his friends just shook their heads in unison. ""No way, dude, we've already seen it three times,"" Tom replied, tossing a handful of popcorn into his mouth. ""Besides, I think we've all had enough of superheroes for one night."" The group fell into a comfortable silence, the only sound the soft hum of the TV as it displayed the menu screen. Suddenly, Sarah spoke up, ""You know what? I think I'm going to call it a night. I have an early class tomorrow."" The others nodded in agreement, and soon they were all saying their goodbyes and heading out into the chilly night air."
"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that","look on his face, I know what he’s going to say. I open my mouth.",29,"smile, I feel a flutter in my chest that I've grown all too accustomed to in his presence. His eyes sparkle with a knowing glint, as if he's aware of the effect he has on me, and for a moment, we just stand there, the tension between us palpable. I try to brush it off, reminding myself that I'm here to do a job, not get caught up in some romantic entanglement, but it's hard to shake the feeling that there's something more at play here. As he opens the car door and slides into the driver's seat, I feel a pang of disappointment that our time together has come to an end, at least for now. ""Thanks for walking me out,"" he says, his voice low and smooth, and I nod, trying to play it cool, but my heart is racing with anticipation of what's to come next."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?",61,"together was a different story. I had always eaten with Autumn, and now I was forced to navigate the cafeteria alone. Jack, however, was easy to talk to, and we quickly discovered a shared love for video games and science fiction novels. As we sat down at a table near the window, I couldn't help but notice the way the sunlight highlighted the freckles on his nose. Autumn, on the other hand, was sitting with a group of girls from her math class, laughing and chatting like they had known each other for years. I felt a pang of jealousy, but Jack's friendly smile drew me back in. We spent the rest of lunch discussing our favorite books and debating the merits of different superhero franchises. By the time the bell rang, signaling the end of lunch, I felt like I had known Jack for years. As we walked out of the cafeteria, Jack turned to me and said, ""Hey, want to sit together on the bus ride home?"" I agreed, and we exchanged numbers, making plans to meet up at the bus stop after school. Little did I know, this chance encounter would be the start of a lifelong friendship."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer. I said yeah, not really interested in conversation, not really listening, wondering what Autumn was doing.",97,"free rein to do as we pleased. I had noticed him watching me a few times, but I didn't think much of it, assuming he was just sizing me up as a potential opponent on the field. Now, as we sat together, he turned to me with an easy smile and asked how I was doing. I replied that I was doing all right, and he nodded thoughtfully, his eyes crinkling at the corners. We chatted for a bit about nothing in particular, exchanging small talk about the class and our shared dislike of the teacher's gruff demeanor. As we talked, I found myself feeling more and more at ease in his presence, which was a welcome change from the awkwardness I'd been experiencing all morning. Before I knew it, we'd been chatting for a good 20 minutes, and the table was starting to fill up with other students. Jack glanced around, seeming to take in the growing crowd, and then turned back to me with a mischievous glint in his eye. ""Hey, want to grab some lunch together?"" he asked, his voice low and casual. I hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to say, but something about his friendly demeanor put me at ease. ""Sure,"" I said finally, smiling back at him. And just like that, we pushed our chairs back and headed out of the cafeteria, leaving the noise and chaos behind us."
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.",92,"he looked at me with a mixture of confusion and curiosity. I could tell he was trying to process the difference between the Autumn I had described and the person standing in front of him. Autumn, however, seemed completely at ease, her smile unwavering as she walked towards us. ""It's great to finally meet you, Jack,"" she said, her voice warm and friendly. Jack's eyes darted back to me, and I could sense his unspoken questions. I knew I had to fill him in on the details, but I wasn't sure where to start. Autumn, sensing the awkwardness, jumped in, ""So, Jack, what do you think of our little town so far?"" Her question broke the tension, and Jack launched into a conversation about his experiences since arriving. As they talked, I couldn't help but notice the way Autumn's eyes sparkled when she laughed, and the way Jack's face lit up when he spoke about his passions. It was clear that they were going to get along just fine."
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure. But he thought I had deluded myself into believing this hot girl was my friend.",79,"his face, a mixture of sadness and concern that made me feel like I was the one who needed help, not him. As I watched him walk up the path to his front door, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had let him down in some way. The drive back to my place was quiet, with only the sound of the engine and the occasional passing car breaking the silence. I was lost in thought, replaying the events of the night over and over in my head, trying to make sense of it all. When I finally pulled into my driveway, I sat in the car for a few minutes, collecting my thoughts before getting out and heading inside. The house was dark and empty, just like my mood. I wandered aimlessly from room to room, trying to find something to distract me from the thoughts that were swirling in my head. But no matter what I did, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that something had shifted in a way that I couldn't quite put my finger on. It wasn't until I finally collapsed onto the couch, exhausted and emotionally drained, that I realized what it was - I had seen a side of Jack that I had never seen before, a side that made me question everything I thought I knew about him. And as I drifted off to sleep, I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets he might be hiding."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.",58,"lined the walls, and the scent of pumpkin spice wafted through the air. I baked pies and made warm apple cider, all in an attempt to show Jack that Autumn was a season to be cherished. I took him on hayrides and to the local pumpkin patch, where we picked out the perfect gourds to carve. I even convinced him to join me for a bonfire on a crisp October night, where we roasted marshmallows and swapped scary stories. And as the leaves changed colors and the air grew cooler, I could see the magic of the season slowly winning Jack over. He began to appreciate the way the sunlight filtered through the trees, casting a warm glow over everything, and the way the stars shone brightly in the night sky. By the time the first snowflakes started to fall, Jack had come to see Autumn in a whole new light, and I had proved to myself that even the most stubborn of people could be won over with a little bit of persistence and a lot of heart."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.",59,"friends. As I stood there, trying to convince him of something I wasn't even sure of myself, I couldn't help but think about the last time Autumn and I had spoken. It had been months, and the conversation had been strained, to say the least. We had been drifting apart for a while, and I had been too caught up in my own life to notice. But now, as I looked back, I realized that our friendship had been slowly unraveling for years. I thought about all the times we had promised to stay in touch, to meet up, to be there for each other, but somehow, life had gotten in the way. And now, as I stood there, trying to convince this stranger that Autumn and I were still friends, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was lying to myself. Were we still friends? I didn't know. All I knew was that I missed her, and I wanted to reconnect, to go back to the way things used to be. But as I looked into the stranger's skeptical eyes, I wondered if it was already too late."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.",41,"to start rambling on about how he had forgotten his math homework or something, but instead he just blurted out that he had seen a ghost in the school hallway. I raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself. ""What do you mean?"" I asked, trying to keep my tone neutral. Jack glanced around the locker room again, as if he was worried someone was listening in. ""I was walking down the hall, and I saw this...this figure,"" he whispered. ""It was tall and gaunt, with eyes that glowed like embers. It was staring right at me."" I felt a shiver run down my spine as Jack's words painted a vivid picture in my mind. I had always been skeptical of ghost stories, but there was something about Jack's demeanor that made me wonder if he was telling the truth. ""Where did you see it?"" I asked, my curiosity getting the better of me. Jack hesitated before answering, ""In front of the old classroom. You know, the one that's been closed off for years?"" I nodded, my mind racing with possibilities. We had all heard rumors about that classroom being haunted, but I had never thought much of it. Now, I wasn't so sure."
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.",59,"yourself of all the things you're good at and the people who care about you. It's okay to feel sad sometimes, but don't let it consume you. You're strong and capable, and you can get through this. Just take things one step at a time and remember that it's okay to ask for help when you need it. And always keep in mind that you're not alone in this, there are people who love and support you no matter what. Now, how about we make a plan for the rest of the day? We could go for a run, or I could help you with your homework, or we could just hang out and watch a movie. What sounds good to you?"
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly. I’d show Autumn that I wasn’t a loser without friends; Jack and I would make more friends somehow.,53,"was a sport that required endurance, agility, and strategy, but it also demanded a certain level of mental toughness. I had to learn to control my emotions, to stay focused under pressure, and to think on my feet. As I continued to play, I began to realize that the skills I was developing on the field were translating to other areas of my life as well. I was becoming more confident, more resilient, and more determined. I started to see that the pursuit of coolness wasn't just about external validation, but about cultivating a sense of inner strength and self-assurance. And with that realization, I felt a sense of freedom, like I could finally be myself without apology. I was no longer trying to fit into someone else's idea of cool, but instead, I was forging my own path, one that was authentic and true to who I was. As I looked back on my journey, I realized that the quest for coolness had been a catalyst for growth, a journey of self-discovery that had led me to a place of greater self-awareness and acceptance."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.",44,"we both felt a mix of relief and excitement as we scanned the names, our eyes widening as we found our own among the selected players. The days leading up to the posting had been filled with anticipation and a bit of anxiety, as we had both worked hard to improve our skills and make a good impression on the coaches. Now, with the uncertainty behind us, we could finally look forward to the season ahead, eager to learn from our mistakes, push ourselves to new heights, and make the most of this opportunity to grow as athletes and as a team. As we walked away from the posted lists, we exchanged a look of mutual congratulations, already planning our strategies for the upcoming games and the hard work that lay ahead."
"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate,",made me seem cool. There had been chuckles of appreciation according to him. I wasn’t sure about that though.,38,"was a defining moment in our working relationship, as it showed him that I wasn't one to be easily rattled or intimidated by condescending remarks. He mentioned that it took a lot of confidence and self-assurance to respond the way I did, and that it earned me a certain level of respect from the rest of the team. From that point on, Jack made a conscious effort to get to know me better and understand my perspective, which ultimately led to a more harmonious and productive collaboration. As we worked together on various projects, I began to appreciate Jack's dry sense of humor and his ability to find the humor in even the most mundane situations. Our working relationship evolved into a strong and supportive partnership, one that was built on mutual respect and trust."
"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots. The junior varsity team practiced on the south field, closer to the circular drive where parents dropped off and picked","up kids. Even though Jack and I were on different teams, our schedules were still the same, and my mom would drive us to and from practice every day for those last weeks of summer.",69,"their children. The varsity team, consisting of the school's most skilled players, was led by Coach Thompson, a no-nonsense veteran with a keen eye for strategy. Meanwhile, the junior varsity team, comprised of younger and less experienced players, was guided by Coach Lee, who emphasized the importance of teamwork and sportsmanship. As the two teams practiced, the sounds of laughter, shouts, and thudding soccer balls filled the air, creating an energetic atmosphere that was quintessentially high school. The sun beat down on the fields, casting a warm glow over the proceedings, and the smell of freshly cut grass wafted through the air, invigorating the senses. Despite the differences in skill level, both teams shared a common goal: to improve their skills, work together, and ultimately, make their school proud."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me. I was excited to tell him that practice hadn’t been as hard as I thought.,61,"that I was going to stick around for a bit to get some extra work in. He nodded and said, ""Good luck with that,"" before heading off to his car. As I watched him drive away, I couldn't help but feel a sense of determination wash over me. I was determined to prove myself, to show my teammates and coaches that I was more than just a rookie trying to make a name for myself. I spent the next hour running drills, practicing my footwork, and working on my passing technique. The sun was starting to set, casting a golden glow over the field, and I was covered in sweat, but I felt invigorated, like I was getting closer to my goal with every rep. As I finally packed up my gear and headed off the field, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment that I hadn't felt in a long time. I knew I still had a long way to go, but for the first time in weeks, I felt like I was on the right track."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again. It was only as I approached and saw them watching me that I figured out they were waiting for me.",61,"the south field, I noticed Jack walking alongside me, his eyes fixed on the ground. He seemed lost in thought, and I wondered what was going through his mind. As we approached the old oak tree, he suddenly spoke up, his voice barely above a whisper. ""Hey, you think we'll ever get out of this place?"" he asked, his eyes darting around cautiously. I hesitated, unsure of how to respond. The question hung in the air, a reminder of the uncertainty that had been lingering in our minds for weeks. We continued walking in silence, the only sound being the rustling of the wind through the crops. The sun beat down on us, relentless in its intensity, a constant reminder of the long days that lay ahead. As we reached the south field, Jack slowed down, his gaze fixed on something in the distance. I followed his line of sight, and my heart skipped a beat as I saw a figure standing by the fence, watching us. Who was it, and what did they want? The questions swirled in my mind as we approached the mysterious figure, our footsteps heavy with anticipation."
"What if, this morning, she woke up in the tent before I thought? What if she woke up as I lifted my arm off her, then lay there wondering why I had been","touching her, why I was still lying close to her and not speaking? If that was the case, she would have—or could have—heard me say many, many, incriminating things to Jack outside the tent.",67,"holding her all night, and why I had stopped. What if she had lain there, feeling the chill of the night air, and the weight of my arm's absence, and had thought to herself, ""He doesn't love me, not really, or he would still be holding me."" What if she had thought that, and then had slowly, quietly gotten out of the tent, and started walking, not knowing where she was going, but knowing she had to get away from me, and from the pain of my rejection. What if she had walked for hours, the sun beating down on her, and the wind whipping her hair into a frenzy, and she had finally come to a small town, and had seen a bus, and had gotten on it, and had ridden it to the city, and had gotten off, and had started walking again, not knowing where she was going, but knowing she had to keep moving. What if she had walked for days, and had finally come to a great, grey sea, and had stood on its shore, and had felt the spray on her face, and had known that she was free, free from me, and from the pain of my rejection, and from the weight of my arm's absence."
"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me. Jack has always said I’m irrational when it comes to Autumn, and maybe I should have taken him more seriously, because he was right earlier today.",60,"likely never even notice me, let alone return my affections. It's a ridiculous notion, and yet, I find myself drawn to it like a moth to flame. Perhaps it's the thrill of the unknown, or the promise of something more, but I feel an inexplicable pull towards this other girl. I imagine the way she might smile at me, the way her eyes might light up when I'm near, and it's enough to make me question everything I thought I knew about love and relationships. I know it's a risk, that I could end up hurt and alone, but a part of me is willing to take that chance, to see if there's something more out there for me. The problem is, I have no idea how to make it happen, or if it's even possible. All I can do is take things one step at a time, and hope that somehow, someway, I'll find my way to this mysterious girl and discover if she's the one I'm meant to be with."
“I already know why you did it.” She doesn’t have to explain that part. I know she’s never wanted me like that. I don’t need to hear her,say it. “I just want to know why you had to be so cruel about it.” It’s time to face what Jack has been telling me all these years.,57,"say the words out loud. What I need to know is why she felt the need to lead me on, to make me believe that there was something between us. I need to know why she couldn't just be honest with me from the start. I look at her, searching for answers in her eyes, but all I see is a mixture of guilt and pity. She takes a deep breath and begins to speak, her voice barely above a whisper. ""I was lonely, and you were there. I didn't mean to hurt you, but I couldn't help how I felt."" Her words cut deep, but I try to remain calm, to process what she's saying. I think back to all the times we spent together, the laughter, the adventures, the quiet moments when it was just us. It was all a lie, a facade she put up to hide her true feelings. I feel a pang of sadness, but also a sense of relief. At least now I know the truth, and I can start to move on."
But Autumn’s getting upset. She sits up and pulls the covers,around her protectively. She frowns at me. The birds are still singing.,23,"back over her head, trying to calm down, but her breathing is still ragged. She can't shake the feeling of unease that's settled in the pit of her stomach. The darkness outside seems to press in around her, making her skin crawl. She tries to distract herself by thinking about the upcoming school dance, but even the thought of seeing her friends and dancing the night away can't dispel the sense of foreboding that's taken hold of her. As she lies there, she becomes aware of the creaks and groans of the old house, the way the wind whispers through the trees outside, and the faint hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen. It's as if the house itself is watching her, waiting for something to happen."
"“It just felt so nice not to be the weird girl anymore,”",Autumn says. “I liked being popular. We did kinda grow apart that year.”,25,"“I could finally blend in with the crowd and not have people staring at me all the time. I started to feel like I was a part of something bigger than myself, like I was connected to the people around me in a way that I never had been before. It was a strange and wonderful feeling, like I had been living in black and white and suddenly someone had turned on the color. I felt alive, like I was finally a part of the world around me, and it was an incredible feeling.”"
“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again. Up ahead, Autumn and her friends were waiting at the crosswalk for the light to change.",45,"ended up with him, but that doesn't change how I feel about her. We've been through thick and thin together, and I'm not about to abandon her just because she's in a relationship with someone I don't particularly care for. I've tried to be civil with him for her sake, but it's not easy. There's just something about him that rubs me the wrong way. Maybe it's the way he always seems to be trying too hard to fit in, or the way he looks at Autumn like she's some kind of prize he's won. Whatever it is, I've learned to keep my opinions to myself and just be happy that Autumn seems happy. But sometimes, like now, my true feelings manage to slip out, and I worry that I've said too much."
My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either. When Jack told me—” and then she stops.",44,"The warmth of her body seeps into mine, and I feel a sense of calm wash over me. As we sit there, I gently stroke her hair, and she nuzzles her head into the crook of my neck. The world outside recedes, and all that's left is the gentle rise and fall of our chests as we breathe in tandem. In this quiet moment, I feel a deep connection to this little being, and my heart swells with love and gratitude. As we sit there, the silence between us is filled with a sense of comfort and understanding, a sense of being exactly where we're meant to be."
"“Sorry,” I say. “I was trying to decide whether I should kill Jack for telling you I was",into you or if I should kill him for telling you that I wasn’t into you. Tough call.”,36,"in love with you, or if I should just let him live and deal with the consequences of his big mouth later. I look at you, and I can see the confusion and curiosity in your eyes. You're waiting for me to finish my sentence, to reveal the truth that Jack has so carelessly spilled out. I take a deep breath, trying to decide how much to reveal, and how much to keep hidden. Do I tell you the truth, and risk losing you forever, or do I lie, and hope that you never find out? The decision is not an easy one, and I can feel my heart racing as I weigh my options. I look at Jack, who is watching us with a mixture of concern and amusement, clearly enjoying the drama that he has created. I shoot him a warning glance, but he just shrugs and looks away, leaving me to deal with the fallout. I turn back to you, and take another deep breath, trying to find the right words to say."
"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn. I’m wondering now though. “What would","you have done if he’d told you the truth, that I was”—I try to remember how Jack put it before—“bonkers in love with you?”",48,"you have done to make him think that?"" I ask, my curiosity getting the better of me. He looks at me with a serious expression, his eyes searching mine as if trying to convey a message without words. ""I told him about the way you've been acting,"" he says finally, his voice low and measured. ""The way you've been pushing everyone away, including me. I told him that you're still hurting, that you're not ready to move on."" I feel a pang of guilt at his words, knowing that he's right. I have been pushing people away, trying to protect myself from getting hurt again. But hearing him say it out loud makes me realize that I've been doing it for too long. It's time to face my feelings and deal with them, rather than trying to suppress them. ""What did he say?"" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper. ""He said that he's willing to wait for you, to give you the time and space you need,"" he replies, his eyes never leaving mine. ""But he also said that he's not going to give up on you, that he's going to be there for you whenever you're ready."" I feel a lump form in my throat as I process his words, a mix of emotions swirling inside me. I'm not sure what to say or do, but I know that I need to think about it, to figure out what I really want."
"“I think my mother has a special bottle of champagne hidden away for just this occasion,” I say. I’m only partially joking. Mom has labeled some of her alcohol, like","for when George W. Bush leaves office and stuff. One expensive one said, “Finny-Autumn Day or NYE 2010.” At the time, I was glad she’d made alternative plans for it.",60,"“the good stuff” and “for special occasions only,” which I’m pretty sure is code for “do not touch this, it’s expensive.” I can almost picture the bottle now, tucked away in the back of the pantry or hidden behind a stack of old cookbooks. I make a mental note to snoop around the kitchen later and see if I can find it. In the meantime, I grab a few beers from the fridge and head back outside to join the party. As I hand out the drinks, I notice that the music has changed and people are starting to dance. The sun is setting, casting a warm orange glow over the whole scene, and for a moment, everything feels perfect. I take a deep breath, feeling grateful for this little slice of happiness, and let the music wash over me."
"“Everything,” she says, which can’t be true. I didn’t even know everything",until last night. And Jack wouldn’t have called her before I arrived.,24,"myself, and I was the one who had been keeping secrets. But there's something in her voice that makes me want to believe her, to believe that she's telling the truth, even when it sounds impossible. Maybe it's the way she looks at me, with an intensity that makes my skin prickle, or maybe it's the way she says it, like she's daring me to contradict her. Whatever it is, I find myself wanting to trust her, to trust that she knows something I don't, something that will make all of this make sense."
"“Syl,” I start, but I don’t know where to begin. I stay","on the highway, passing all the exits that could take us home.",24,"silent for a moment, trying to gather my thoughts. Syl looks at me expectantly, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. I take a deep breath and try to start again, but the words get stuck in my throat. I glance around the room, hoping to find some inspiration, but everything seems mundane and ordinary. Syl notices my gaze wandering and follows it, her eyes scanning the space as if searching for something. Suddenly, she gasps and points to a small, almost imperceptible mark on the wall. ""What's that?"" she asks, her voice barely above a whisper. I follow her finger, and my heart skips a beat as I realize what she's found."
"“Syl,” I say as I drive toward her house, speeding up a bit. “Don’t be ridiculous.",I’ve been enough of a bastard already. I’m not letting you walk home in the rain.”,32,"“You can’t just decide to move to another country without thinking it through. What about your job, your friends, your family? You can’t just leave everything behind like that. And what about us? What about our plans for the future? You can’t just up and leave me like this. I thought we had something real, something worth fighting for. But I guess I was wrong. You’re just going to run away with your tail between your legs, aren’t you? Don’t be ridiculous, Syl. You’re not even thinking about the consequences of your actions. You’re just acting on impulse, like you always do. But this time, it’s not just about you. It’s about us, and our future together. So, please, just calm down and think this through. Let’s talk about this like adults, not like a couple of teenagers who can’t even have a rational conversation.”"
"“Lexy,” I say. It’s too fucking early for her to call. It doesn’t matter if we’re sleeping","together again. “Stop being a drama queen,” I groan into the phone and roll over in bed.",34,"in or not, she knows better than to call before noon. I groggily reach over to my nightstand and grab my phone, rubbing the sleep from my eyes as I try to focus on the screen. Lexy's name is flashing on the display, and I can feel a sense of dread creeping over me. What could she possibly want at this ungodly hour? I hesitate for a moment, wondering if I should just let it go to voicemail, but my curiosity gets the better of me. I swipe to answer, trying to sound more alert than I feel. ""Hey, Lexy. What's up?"" I say, trying to keep my tone neutral. There's a pause on the other end of the line, and for a moment, I wonder if the call dropped. But then Lexy's voice comes through, sounding hesitant and unsure. ""Hey, I'm so sorry to call you so early,"" she says. ""I know you're not a morning person, but I really need to talk to you about something."" My instincts start to kick in, and I can feel a sense of unease growing in the pit of my stomach. What could Lexy possibly need to talk to me about that can't wait until a decent hour?"
I’m still standing in Finn’s yard staring at the grass he’ll never mow again.,"I don’t know how long it’s been when a woman’s voice says, “Jack, right?”",28,"The memories of our childhood laughter and summer barbecues still linger in the air, but the silence is deafening, a harsh reminder that some things are truly gone forever."
"“The arrangements still have to be made, but I’m sure we’ll see","you at the wake, Jack,” she says before going inside. “Thanks again.”",24,"each other again soon. I'm really looking forward to it, and I'm sure we'll have a great time catching up. We can finalize the details later, but for now, let's just say it's going to be a fantastic reunion. I've already started thinking about all the things we can do and the places we can visit. It's going to be a real treat, and I'm honored to be a part of it. The excitement is building up, and I can barely contain my enthusiasm. I just know that this is going to be an experience we'll always treasure."
"There’s an odd aura around us as we approach. I feel so young, like I’m being escorted into kindergarten, and I’m resentful and grateful all over again. My parents shoulder themselves on either side of me, and I can tell all their focus","is on me. They don’t speak, but it’s strange: the closer we get to the horrible box, to the grinning photograph of my friend that sits on top, it’s like I can feel my parents saying to me, See, Jack? This is death.",86,"is on me, their eyes scanning my face for any sign of nervousness or fear. I try to appear calm, to show them that I'm ready for this, but my heart is racing and my palms are sweating. We walk through the entrance, a large metal door with a sign that reads ""New Beginnings"" in bold letters. The hallway is long and narrow, with rows of doors on either side, each one leading to a different room. My parents guide me to the third door on the left, and we stop in front of it. My mother takes a deep breath, then pushes the door open, revealing a room filled with people in white coats, all of whom turn to look at us as we enter. I feel a surge of anxiety, but my father's hand on my shoulder steadies me. We're here, I think. This is it. Whatever is going to happen, it's going to happen now."
"“You don’t have to pretend that we were more than friends of convenience,",Jack. I’m tired of people pretending to care more about me than they do.”,27,"because I already know the truth, and it's okay to acknowledge that our relationship was a mutually beneficial arrangement that served its purpose, allowing us to navigate the challenges of our lives with a sense of security and companionship, even if it wasn't rooted in romance or deep emotional connection."
"“Uh-huh.” I take a gulp of coffee, which hasn’t quite cooled and burns down my throat. “So my guess is that’s what Sylv","said to you, and then you pushed back, because of course you did, and that’s when she said what you said to me, huh?”",47,"an was doing in the woods. I mean, it makes sense, right? If she was trying to get away from the party, she would have headed into the trees. And if she was looking for something, she might have been searching for a specific spot. I glance over at Emily, who's watching me with an intense expression. ""What do you think?"" I ask her, trying to keep my voice neutral. Emily hesitates, then shakes her head. ""I don't know,"" she admits. ""I was hoping you'd have some idea."" I take another sip of my coffee, trying to think. The woods are a big place, and without more information, it's impossible to pinpoint exactly where Sylvan might have been. But I have a feeling that we're on the right track. I just hope we can find out what Sylvan was looking for before it's too late."
"“Hey,” I say as I approach, careful to stand back so that it’s obvious I’m not trying to","cut in line for the keg. Maybe he’s in his own head, but Trevor blanches for a moment.",36,"intrude on her space. She looks up, startled, and for a moment our eyes lock in a way that makes my heart skip a beat. I feel a flutter in my chest as I take in the sight of her, her hair tied back in a messy bun and a smudge of dirt on her cheek. She's so beautiful, even in the midst of chaos. ""Hey,"" she says back, her voice barely above a whisper, and I can tell she's trying to play it cool, but I can see the faintest glimmer of a smile playing on her lips. I take a deep breath and try to calm my racing thoughts, reminding myself that I need to focus on the task at hand. ""What are you doing out here?"" I ask, trying to sound casual, but my voice comes out a little too loud in the stillness of the night."
"That’s the kind of high school memory I want to live in tonight, so even though I have no idea what Chloe","was saying about me to her friend, I head over. A few of the girls rush off, but one of her friends stays.",45,"is doing right now, I'm going to imagine her laughing and smiling, her eyes sparkling with the same carefree joy that I remember from our late-night conversations about life, music, and everything in between. I'll picture us driving down the highway, windows rolled down, singing along to our favorite songs at the top of our lungs, feeling invincible and free. I'll recall the way we used to share our deepest secrets and dreams with each other, the way we supported and encouraged each other through thick and thin. And I'll hold onto the hope that even though life has taken us in different directions, those memories will always be a part of us, a reminder of the unbreakable bond we formed in those unforgettable high school years."
"After the words are out of my mouth, I try to turn them into a joke with a laugh, but that",makes it worse. Chloe’s and her friend’s faces go through a strobe light sequence of reactions before settling back to pity.,42,"only makes the situation more awkward, and I can feel my face growing hotter by the second. I try to brush it off and change the subject, but the damage is already done. The conversation has become stilted, and I can sense the other person's discomfort. I mentally kick myself for not being more careful with my words, wondering why I always seem to say the wrong thing at the worst possible moment. It's as if my brain and mouth are two separate entities, and they often seem to be at odds with each other. I take a deep breath and try to move forward, hoping to salvage what's left of the conversation, but the memory of my thoughtless comment lingers, leaving a sour taste in my mouth."
“You know? How you showed up at soccer practice like that?” Chloe touches my arm in a,"way that I used to think meant a girl was flirting, but now I’m not so sure.",34,"gentle gesture, her eyes sparkling with amusement. I feel a flush rise to my cheeks as I recall the incident, and I'm surprised she's bringing it up now. ""What about it?"" I ask, trying to sound nonchalant despite the memories that come flooding back. Chloe leans in, a conspiratorial look on her face. ""I was just thinking, maybe we could use that to our advantage,"" she says, her voice barely above a whisper. I raise an eyebrow, intrigued, and she continues, ""I mean, if you can show up to soccer practice looking like that, just imagine what you could do at the school dance."" I laugh, feeling a spark of excitement at the prospect. ""You're crazy, Chloe,"" I say, shaking my head, but she just grins and says, ""That's why you love me."" And in that moment, I know she's right – I do love her, and I'd do just about anything to make her happy."
"I think my dad calls it an Irish goodbye when you don’t tell anyone you are leaving, and that’s what I’m","trying to do, but halfway to my car, I hear Kyle call my name. I turn, and he jogs up to me.",43,"about to do. I've been feeling really overwhelmed with everything that's been going on, and I just need some time to clear my head. I know it's not the most considerate thing to do, but I hope my friends will understand. I'll make sure to reach out to them soon and explain everything. For now, I just need to get out of here and find some peace. I've been feeling like I'm drowning in a sea of expectations and responsibilities, and I need to find a lifeline. I'm not sure where I'm going or what I'll do when I get there, but I know I need to get away. I'll figure it out as I go, and I'll be back when I'm ready. Until then, I'm just going to take things one step at a time and see where the road takes me."
"“It’s okay, Kyle.” Because it kind of is. I’m glad that no one hates me, but I’m also glad that the guys on",the team aren’t friends I should be concerned about losing. I clap Kyle on the shoulder. “Thanks for the invite. Good luck in Cali.”,47,"the team aren't intimidated by me. I mean, I'm not exactly the most approachable person, but they seem to have accepted me for who I am. It's a weird feeling, being part of a group like this. I've always been more of a loner, content to keep to myself and observe from a distance. But there's something about these guys that makes me want to open up, to be a part of something bigger than myself. Maybe it's the way they joke around, or the way they support each other on and off the field. Whatever it is, I'm grateful for it. I'm grateful to be a part of this team, and I'm excited to see where it takes us."
"The next morning, I tell my parents about catching up with Kyle and the guys on the","team, how it was nice to see everyone but how I’m starting to get more excited about college.",35,"weekend, and they seem pleased that I'm reconnecting with old friends. My mom asks if I've given any more thought to college, and I tell her I've been looking into a few schools, but I'm still undecided. She nods understandingly and reminds me that I have plenty of time to figure it out. My dad chimes in, suggesting that I consider taking a gap year to travel and gain some life experience before committing to a university. I'm not sure if that's the right path for me, but I appreciate his input. The conversation is pleasant, and we spend the rest of the morning discussing everything from school to our plans for the upcoming summer. As we finish breakfast, I feel a sense of comfort and normalcy wash over me, and I'm grateful for this quiet morning with my family."
"“Well, if we don’t see you again, have a good semester!” Mrs. Carter says.",The tears in her eyes glitter. “Let us know if you ever need anything!”,28,"As I walk out of the office, I feel a mix of emotions: relief that the meeting is over, but also a sense of uncertainty about what the upcoming semester will bring. I take a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of unease that has been building up inside me. The sound of the door closing behind me is a stark reminder that I'm now on my own, left to navigate the challenges that lie ahead. I glance around the empty hallway, the fluorescent lights above seeming to hum in sync with my racing thoughts. Suddenly, the silence is broken by the sound of footsteps echoing down the corridor, growing fainter with each passing moment. I stand there for a moment, frozen in time, before finally turning to make my way back to my dorm room, the weight of the unknown settling heavy on my shoulders."
I give it enough time that Brett’s parents would have to be seriously unreasonable to still,be hanging around. My fingers and toes are wrinkled raisins by the time I get out.,32,"be holding a grudge against me, but I still feel a twinge of nervousness as I pull into their driveway. The house looks just as I remembered it, with its perfectly manicured lawn and cheerful yellow door. I take a deep breath, grab the casserole dish from the passenger seat, and step out of the car. As I approach the front door, it swings open and Brett's mom greets me with a warm smile. ""Hey, kiddo! It's so great to see you,"" she says, enveloping me in a hug. I return the hug, feeling a sense of relief wash over me. Maybe this visit won't be so awkward after all. Brett's dad appears behind her, his expression a bit more serious, but he nods at me in greeting. ""Hey, come on in,"" he says, stepping aside to let me enter. I follow them into the house, taking in the familiar sights and smells of the place where Brett grew up. We spend the next hour catching up and chatting, and I start to feel more at ease. But just as I'm starting to think that everything is going to be okay, Brett's mom drops a bombshell."
"It’s only nine o’clock, but I hope this Brett guy is asleep. When I get to","the room, I decide he may as well be asleep, because he’s reading the new student manual.",33,"the address he gave me, I'll try to sneak in quietly and get this over with. I've been dreading this meeting all day, and the last thing I need is for him to be awake and start asking questions. I've got the package right here in my bag, and I just want to drop it off and get out of there before things get any more complicated. As I approach the apartment building, I can feel my heart beating faster, and I'm trying to calm myself down, reminding myself that this is just a simple delivery. But something about this whole situation feels off, and I'm starting to regret taking on this job in the first place."
Brett keeps a picture of himself in a frame on his desk. It’s one of those,"dopey baseball card pics, and he looks about fourteen or so. Must have been a stellar season.",33,"old-fashioned frames with the gold trim and the velvet backing, the kind that people used to buy at carnivals and fairs. He likes to look at it every now and then, remembering the day it was taken, the summer he turned twenty-one and his whole life was still ahead of him. In the picture, he's wearing a bright yellow shirt with white flowers and a big smile on his face, his hair messy and his eyes squinting from the sun. He looks happy, really happy, and it's a feeling he's been trying to recapture ever since. Sometimes, when things get tough, he'll stare at the picture for a long time, trying to remember what it felt like to be that carefree, that full of life. It's a feeling that's been elusive lately, but he holds onto the hope that it's still out there, waiting for him to find it again."
"So that first Saturday at college, I leave Brett, the middle school baseball star, sleeping on his side of the room",and head to the dining hall. I scarf half a bagel and some juice and head out to scout my new route.,43,"and head to the student union to meet my roommate's friends, a group of guys who all seem to know each other from high school. As I walk in, I'm immediately struck by the sheer number of people, all chatting and laughing, and I feel a pang of nervousness in my stomach. I spot my roommate, Alex, waving at me from across the room, and I make my way over to him, trying to appear more confident than I feel. As I approach, he introduces me to his friends, a group of guys who all seem to be on the college soccer team. They welcome me warmly, and we spend the next few hours talking about everything from sports to music to our plans for the future. As the day goes on, I start to feel more at ease, and by the time we decide to grab some lunch, I'm laughing and joking with the guys like we've known each other for years. Little do I know, this is just the beginning of an incredible journey, one that will take me to places I never could have imagined."
"Which I don’t think I’m going to have to worry about today. All week, people have been handing me flyers for various official and unofficial welcome parties that took",place last night. Brett woke me up when he stumbled home close to dawn. It seems likely he went rather than fell asleep watching TV in the common room.,58,"place all over the city, from the student union to the local bars and clubs. I've been invited to so many events that I've lost count, and I'm starting to feel like I'm going to have to clone myself to attend them all. My friends and I have been trying to decide which ones to go to, but it's hard to choose when they all sound like so much fun. We've been poring over the flyers, comparing the themes, the music, and the freebies on offer. Some of them promise live bands, while others offer free food and drinks. I'm particularly tempted by the one that's offering a free BBQ and a chance to meet the university's sports teams. I've also been invited to a few more low-key gatherings, like a movie night and a game night, which sound like a great way to unwind after a long day of exploring the city. Whatever I choose, I know I'm going to have a blast and make some amazing memories with my new friends."
"Sometimes I see Brett the boring on campus at the Frisbee golf games or outdoor painting workshops, so I guess he’s branched out from dorm activities. He has","remained a mystery I do not want to solve, though it still bothers me that he feels the same about me, since he never gave me a chance.",56,"even started to wear a few different shirts, which is a step up from the usual rotation of three or four that he had going on when we were freshmen. I've seen him chatting with some of the art students, and I'm pretty sure I saw him at the campus coffee shop with a sketchbook, so maybe he's discovered a new passion. It's nice to see him doing his own thing and not just following the crowd like he used to. I've thought about going over to talk to him a few times, but I'm not really sure what to say, and I don't want to interrupt him if he's in the middle of something. Maybe I'll run into him at the student union or something and we can catch up then. It's funny how people can change and grow, even if it's just in small ways."
"“Met a guy from Taiwan last night. He seemed cool.” I’d met him in the elevator. He liked my Zelda shirt, and","we’d talked for about twenty seconds before we got off and walked to opposite ends of the floor, but it still counts.",44,"we started talking about the latest gaming trends. He was a huge fan of the series and had even cosplayed as Link at a comic-con event in Taipei. We exchanged numbers, and he invited me to a gaming session at his place, promising to show me his extensive collection of retro consoles and rare games. I left the elevator feeling like I'd just made a new friend, and I couldn't wait to see his gaming setup. Little did I know, this chance encounter would lead to a series of unforgettable adventures and a lifelong friendship that would transcend borders and cultures."
"As I get off the elevator, it occurs to me that Brett will probably be in our room and not expecting me. My","schedule has been pretty exact these past weeks. If he’s jerking off, he’d at least lock the door. And since the knob turns—",46,"heart starts racing at the thought of seeing him, and I feel a mix of emotions: excitement, nervousness, and a hint of guilt. I take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, and slowly make my way to our room. As I approach the door, I can hear the sound of the TV and Brett's laughter, and my heart skips a beat. I pause for a moment, wondering if I should announce my presence or just walk in. I decide to just walk in, hoping to catch him off guard and gauge his reaction. I slowly turn the handle and push the door open, my eyes scanning the room for Brett. He's sitting on the couch, his eyes fixed on the TV, and a bowl of popcorn in his lap. He looks up, startled, and our eyes meet. For a moment, we just stare at each other, the tension between us palpable."
"Brett tries to play it off like he’s been reading the textbook on his lap,",but the framed picture he’d been holding clatters as he sets it back on the desk.,31,"but his eyes keep drifting back to the window, where the sunlight casts a warm glow over the quad, and he can't help but feel a pang of restlessness, a sense that there's more to life than the dusty pages and stale air of the classroom. His mind begins to wander, imagining the thrill of the open road, the rush of adrenaline as he speeds down the highway, the wind whipping through his hair, and the freedom to go wherever he pleases. The sound of the teacher's voice, droning on about historical dates and events, becomes a distant hum, a reminder that he's stuck in this seat, trapped in a world of monotony, until the bell rings, signaling his escape."
"“You won’t,” Brett says. He looks directly at me from across the table,","his food forgotten. He’s so certain. “You won’t forget. You’ll never forget,” he says.",27,"his eyes locked intensely on mine as if daring me to contradict him. The air in the room seems to thicken, heavy with unspoken words and unresolved tension. I can feel my heart beating faster, my palms growing sweaty as I try to process the weight of his statement. The silence between us stretches out, a palpable thing that presses against my skin, making it hard to breathe. I try to speak, to form some kind of response, but my voice catches in my throat, refusing to emerge. Brett's gaze never wavers, his expression unyielding, as if he's waiting for me to acknowledge some unspoken truth."
"“She tried to kill herself. She survived, but she’s in the hospital.” She sighs. “Taylor",told me. I don’t even know how she found out. She thought I’d be happy.”,30,"was visibly shaken by the news, her eyes welling up with tears as she struggled to process the weight of her friend's desperate actions. The hospital, a place that was supposed to be a sanctuary for healing and recovery, now felt like a cold and unforgiving environment, a stark reminder of the fragility of life. As she sat in stunned silence, the beeping of the machines and the soft murmur of the hospital staff seemed to fade into the background, replaced by the haunting question that echoed in her mind: what could have driven her friend to such a desperate act?"
"“If I didn’t offer, then I should have been guilted,” I say. “I’m telling","you, Sylv, I really should have said something after I saw her last weekend.”",28,"you, I was raised to be polite and considerate of others, and it's only natural that I would offer to help in such a situation. But what really gets my goat is that she didn't even acknowledge my offer, let alone express any gratitude. It's as if she expected me to drop everything and cater to her needs without so much as a thank you. I'm starting to think that I'm just too nice for my own good, and that people are taking advantage of my good nature. I mean, would it really have killed her to say please and thank you? Is that really too much to ask?"
"“Yeah, she slept in a little, so when it was time to take Dave to school, I went to the crib, and she was so still, I really thought that she wasn’t breathing. When I picked her up,","she didn’t stir for a second, so for this horrible moment, I really, really thought she was gone.” She laughs. “But then she woke up and was so grumpy with me! She must have been having a good dream.”",77,"she let out a little whimper, and I swear my heart skipped a beat. I was so relieved that she was okay, but at the same time, I was still trying to process what had just happened. I mean, I've heard of babies sleeping a lot, but this was on a whole different level. I gently placed her in her car seat, and we headed out the door to drop off Dave. The whole time, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. I kept looking back at her, making sure she was still breathing, still alive. When we got to the school, I was a bit distracted, and Dave noticed it. ""Dad, what's wrong?"" he asked, looking up at me with those big brown eyes. I hesitated for a moment before responding, ""Nothing, buddy, just a little tired, that's all."" But the truth was, I was worried. I was worried about my little girl, and I couldn't wait to get her to the doctor to make sure everything was okay."
"Once she is free, the baby stops crying, but seemingly only out of confusion. “Beba?” She waits for me to do something, but I don’t","know what to do, so I continue to hold her from under her armpits out in front of me. “Meh?” she tries again and whimpers.",50,"know what to do. I look around the room, hoping to find some sort of clue or instruction manual, but there's nothing. The baby looks up at me with big, round eyes, and I can sense her uncertainty. I try to speak to her in a soothing voice, but she just blinks at me. I gently pick her up, cradling her in my arms, and begin to rock her back and forth. To my surprise, she starts to calm down, her tiny chest rising and falling with each breath. I continue to rock her, trying to make sense of the situation. Who is this baby, and why is she here? And what does she mean by ""Beba""? Is that her name, or something else entirely? I look around the room again, this time searching for any clues that might explain what's going on. That's when I notice a small piece of paper on the floor, partially hidden under the couch cushion. I carefully set the baby down on the couch and retrieve the paper, hoping it might hold some answers."
"“I guess I thought that Dave or our love and the life we were building together would be enough. I knew it would be hard,","but I thought that while we were working and saving money for the future together, we’d be more together? Maybe doing better than we are now?”",51,"but I had no idea it would be this hard. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of uncertainty, with no lifeline in sight. Every day was a struggle, every conversation with Dave a reminder of the chasm that had grown between us. I tried to hold on to the memories of our laughter, our adventures, our quiet nights in, but they seemed to be slipping away from me like sand between my fingers. I knew I couldn't give up, not yet, but the thought of continuing on this path, of fighting for a love that seemed to be fading, was exhausting. I felt like I was losing myself in the process, like I was disappearing into the void of our relationship. I didn't know how much more of this I could take, how much more of myself I could lose."
"“Hi.” I’m trying not to stare at the ghost before me, but the hostess has pulled out the chair, and everyone is waiting for me to sit. To compensate, I sit too quickly as","she tries to push in the chair for me, and I end up four inches too far from the table. I adjust myself as she assures John that a waitress will be by shortly.",68,"the chair scrapes against the floor, and I feel a flush rise to my cheeks. The ghost, who I assume is my date, smiles kindly at me and takes his seat across the table. I try to compose myself, taking a deep breath as I unfold my napkin and place it in my lap. The hostess hands us menus and tells us that our server will be with us shortly. I glance down at the menu, trying to focus on the words, but my eyes keep drifting back to the ghost. He's not transparent, exactly, but there's a faint shimmer to him, like the air around him is vibrating. I can feel a strange energy emanating from him, like he's humming a gentle tune. I try to shake off the feeling, telling myself it's just my imagination, but I can sense that this is going to be a very unusual dinner date."
"The waitress is suddenly there, and I’m agreeing to lemon in my water and being handed a menu that looks like a wedding invitation. John","already has what looks like a dirty martini, but it appears untouched. Condensation is beginning to form under the chill of what’s probably incredibly expensive vodka.",51,"is already studying his menu intently, his brow furrowed in concentration. I follow his lead, scanning the options and trying to make sense of the overly elaborate descriptions. The specials of the day are written in elegant calligraphy, and I find myself wondering if the chef is also a skilled artist. As I ponder the merits of the pan-seared salmon versus the grilled filet mignon, the waitress returns to take our order. John beats me to it, confidently rattling off his choice of the filet mignon, cooked medium rare. I hesitate for a moment before opting for the salmon, hoping that it will be a lighter option after the rich appetizers we had earlier. The waitress nods and takes our menus, leaving us to sit in silence for a moment as we await the arrival of our meals."
"“So what is it, John?” I say after we’ve ordered strange-sounding appetizer salads and the",waitress has faded into the shadows. “Why did you stay away for most of his life?”,31,"waiter has left us alone again. John leans in, his eyes scanning the restaurant as if searching for potential eavesdroppers. ""I've been getting these strange messages,"" he says in a hushed tone, his voice barely audible over the background hum of the restaurant. ""At first, I thought it was just spam, but then I started noticing a pattern. They're always referencing something from my past, something that only a handful of people would know."" He pauses, studying me intently. ""I think someone's been watching me, following me. And I think it's connected to what happened all those years ago."" His words send a shiver down my spine as I realize that this is more than just a casual lunch meeting. John's expression is dead serious, and I can tell that he's been carrying this burden alone for far too long."
My laugh makes the tears spill but also stops more from forming. I touch my fingertips to my eyes for the sake of my,mascara and look back at John. The gentle concern on his face almost melts my resolve to continue to hold him to the fire.,48,"makeup, but the gesture is also a reflex, a desperate attempt to hold back the tide of emotions that threatens to overwhelm me. As I stand there, frozen in a mixture of sadness and relief, I feel the weight of the past few weeks bearing down on me. The stress, the anxiety, the constant uncertainty – it's all still there, simmering just below the surface. But for a moment, just a moment, I let myself feel the release that comes with finally, finally being able to laugh again. It's a fragile, fleeting thing, but it's enough to give me the strength to take a deep breath and face whatever comes next."
“She was”—he takes another small sip from his glass and sets it back down on the tablecloth—“cold to him is I suppose the way to describe it. She went out of her way to word things so it was understood that she and Stella and I were the real,"family. And I did nothing, Autumn.” His gaze is firm as he admits it. “I should have done or said something, at least to him alone. But the marriage was already half-dead, and I was envisioning losing my second child by trying to reconnect with my first, and I—”",98,"family, and that he was just a tolerated outsider. It was a subtle but clear distinction, one that he had grown accustomed to over the years. He remembered the way she would smile at him, a polite, distant smile that never quite reached her eyes. And the way she would touch him, a light, fleeting touch that was more a gesture of obligation than affection. He had learned to live with it, to accept that he would never be more than a peripheral figure in her life. But it still stung, still hurt to think about it. He pushed the thought away, focusing on the present, on the conversation at hand. ""I'm sorry,"" he said, turning back to the person across from him. ""I'm getting sidetracked. You were saying something about Stella?"""
"The waitress appears with our salads. Mine is seaweed and shavings of cucumber, which looks like a pile of green spaghetti. John’s salad is red somehow. I find myself ordering both steak and lobster and wondering if the waitress will","faint if I ask for a doggy bag at the end of the meal. Before she leaves, she asks John if he would like another martini. He hesitates and says no but to ask again after the entrées have arrived.",80,"raise an eyebrow at the extravagance of my order, but she simply nods and heads back to the kitchen. As we wait for our main course, John and I make small talk, discussing everything from the weather to our jobs. I learn that he's a software engineer, and I find myself zoning out as he delves into the intricacies of coding. The sound of sizzling meat and the aroma of buttery lobster waft through the air, and my stomach growls in anticipation. Before long, the waitress returns with our meals, and I'm taken aback by the sheer size of the portions. My steak is a massive slab of grilled perfection, and the lobster tail is almost as big as my head. John's meal is equally impressive, and we both dig in with gusto, savoring the flavors and textures of our respective dishes. As we eat, the conversation flows more easily, and I find myself laughing at John's witty remarks and insightful observations. The evening wears on, and I realize that I'm having the time of my life, despite my initial reservations about the date. As we finish our meals and prepare to order dessert, I catch John's eye and smile, feeling a spark of connection that I hadn't expected."
"“I’m going to need those stories that you’re collecting,” I tell him. “And Jack’s been working to get",all sorts of pictures from people. Maybe we could put them together as a book for the baby.”,36,"the old computer up and running, so we can access the database and see if there are any connections between the cases. I also need you to dig deeper into the victim's backgrounds, see if there's anything that links them together. And I want you to pay a visit to the local pawn shops, see if anyone's tried to fence any of the stolen goods. We need to move fast on this, before the killer strikes again. I have a feeling that time is running out, and I don't want to be the one who has to tell the next victim's family that we didn't do enough to stop it. Let's get to work, people!"
"When the waitress comes with our entrées, John doesn’t order another martini. There isn’t space at",the table anyway with all the documents spread out. Together we build another inheritance for Phineas’s child.,33,"the small table for another drink, and besides, he seems to be savoring the one he has. He takes a sip, closes his eyes, and lets out a satisfied sigh. I watch him, feeling a pang of curiosity about what's going on behind those eyes. The waitress sets our plates down, and the aroma of roasted vegetables and grilled meat wafts up, making my stomach growl with anticipation. John opens his eyes, smiles at me, and picks up his fork, gesturing for me to start eating. I take a bite, and the flavors explode on my tongue, a perfect balance of sweet and savory. As we eat, the conversation flows easily, like we've known each other for years. We talk about everything and nothing, our words weaving in and out of the sounds of the restaurant. I feel a sense of comfort, of belonging, that I haven't experienced in a long time. And when John reaches across the table and takes my hand, I don't pull away. Instead, I let him hold it, feeling a spark of electricity run through my body."
"For the time being, I called John to let him know that the baby is a girl, and I told him about her heart. He babbled a bit","about being able to afford the best doctors, and I was surprised by my confidence when I told him that everything was probably going to be just fine.",56,"about how much he loved her already and couldn't wait to meet her, but I could sense a hint of worry in his voice. I reassured him that the doctors were taking good care of her and that we would get through this together. We talked for a bit longer, and I could feel the weight of his emotions, even over the phone. After we hung up, I took a deep breath and tried to process everything that was happening. The baby's diagnosis was still sinking in, and I couldn't help but wonder what the future held for our little girl. I looked around the hospital room, taking in the beeping machines and sterile smell, feeling a mix of emotions: fear, uncertainty, but also a deep love for this tiny human who had already stolen my heart. As I sat there, I knew that I would do everything in my power to give her the best possible life, no matter what challenges lay ahead."
"It’s hard to explain why seeing Jack’s face will help, but it will, and I’m looking forward to telling him that the baby is a girl.","I’ll have to explain about the hole in her heart and how it’s probably going to be fine, probably, but I’m getting good at that, I think.",53,"As I walk into the hospital room, Jack's eyes light up, and he flashes a warm smile, immediately putting me at ease. I take a deep breath, savoring the moment, and blurt out the news: ""It's a girl!"" His face lights up even more, and he lets out a whoop of excitement, pumping his fist in the air. We hug, both of us beaming with joy, and I can feel the weight of anticipation lifting off our shoulders. We've been waiting for this moment for what feels like an eternity, and now that it's finally here, it's even more surreal than I imagined. Jack takes my hand, and we gaze lovingly at our little girl, who's sleeping peacefully in her crib, completely unaware of the excitement she's caused. We spend the next hour cooing over her tiny features, marveling at her tiny hands and feet, and making plans for the future. It's a moment I'll treasure forever, and I'm so grateful to have Jack by my side to share it with."
"I spoke to Jack on the phone yesterday, but I want to tell","him those things in person. Besides, the context of the call wasn’t right.",26,"him in person about the project we've been working on, so I'm planning to meet him at the office today to discuss the details and finalize our strategy for the upcoming presentation."
"“Well, I had this umbrella of hers, and when I went to return it, something happened,” Jack said. “I think it’s going","to keep happening too. I know it’s a really weird situation, but I wanted you to know…in case it was a problem?”",44,"to sound a bit strange, but I could swear I saw her standing in the doorway, watching me. I know it sounds crazy, but I felt this chill run down my spine as our eyes met. I tried to shake off the feeling, telling myself it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. But as I approached her, I realized she wasn't alone. There was someone standing just behind her, someone I had never seen before. The person's face was obscured by the shadows, and I couldn't make out any defining features. I felt a sense of unease wash over me as I handed her the umbrella, and she took it from me without a word. The whole encounter left me feeling unsettled, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off."
